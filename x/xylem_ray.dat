30|$|In LH- 1 samples, no dark-colored {{heartwood}} {{was visible}} to the naked eye. However, variations in the autofluorescence of cell walls were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.  5 b). Yellow–green fluorescence of cell walls was observed only in some of the <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells that were located near the pith and perimedullary cells. This observation indicates that these additional substances were synthesized not only in <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells but also in perimedullary cells in Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis. We also observed the disappearance of starch grains from <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells and perimedullary cells around the pith in LH- 2 and 3 samples during cell death (Fig.  4 f-h). It has been suggested that stored starch is used for the synthesis of heartwood substances [5]. Therefore, the disappearance of starch from <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells and perimedullary cells might be involved in the synthesis of heartwood substances.|$|E
40|$|Conference Name:Asia-Pacific Conference on Science and Management of Coastal Environment. Conference Address: HONG KONG, HONG KONG. Time:JUN 25 - 28, 1996. We {{describe}} the wood structure of Aegiceras corniculatum and its differences under various soil salinities. This species had diffuse-porous wood with poorly defined growth rings. Vessels which had single perforations occurred abundantly and in multiples and were storeyed. Intervascular pits between contiguous vessels were alternate bordered ones while half-bordered pit-pairs existed between both vessel-ray and vessel-parenchyma. Homogenous <b>xylem</b> <b>rays</b> were multiseriate and uniseriate. Fiber-tracheids with bordered pits often had thinner walls. Xylem parenchyma cells were scant and distributed diffusely and paratracheally. Differences in the structural and quantitative characters of vessels, <b>xylem</b> <b>rays</b> and fiber-tracheids under diverse soil salinities are described...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{leaf and}} stem {{microstructure}} of commercialised Cyclopia species (Cyclopia intermedia, Cyclopia subternata, Cyclopia maculata, Cyclopia genistoides) is described and illustrated {{for the first}} time. Leaflet characters of diagnostic value include the shape, margin (flat or revolute), bundle sheath extensions, crystals (aggregates, solitary crystals and crystal sand), relative size of {{the upper and lower}} epidermal cells and thickness of the cuticle. The study revealed an abundance of phenolic compounds, not only in the leaf epidermal cells and leaf bundle sheaths, but also in the secondary phloem, <b>xylem</b> <b>rays,</b> <b>xylem</b> parenchyma and pith, showing that the inclusion of older stems may be acceptable and does not necessarily lower the quality of the product...|$|R
40|$|The grain {{pattern in}} wood and {{the pattern of}} {{orientation}} of ray splitting and uniting were studied in roots and root collar of Platanus acerifolia. In roots the interlocked-grain wood was observed as in the stem. An analysis of changes in <b>xylem</b> <b>rays</b> indicates that the cambial domain pattern exists and migrates upward there. In the root collar the grain in wood was straight although cambial domains were noted too. The domain pattern is characterized by relatively wide variations of the domain length and by pulsation: expanding some domains and reducing others {{so that it does}} not become manifest in the grain...|$|R
40|$|Although {{cellular}} {{injury in}} some woody plants has been correlated with freezing of supercooled water, {{there is no}} direct evidence that intracellular ice formation is responsible for the injury. In this study we tested the hypothesis that injury to <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells in supercooling tissues is caused by intracellular ice formation. The ultrastructure of freezing-stress response in <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells of flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.) was determined in tissue prepared by freeze substitution. Wood tissue was collected in the winter, spring, and summer of 1992. Specimens were cooled from 0 to - 60 [deg]C at a rate of 5 [deg]C h- 1. Freezing stress did not affect the structural organization of wood tissue, but <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells suffered severe injury in the form of intracellular ice crystals. The temperatures at which the ice crystals were first observed depended on the season in which the tissue was collected. Intracellular ice formation was observed at - 20, - 10, and - 5 [deg]C in winter, spring, and summer, respectively. Another type of freezing injury was manifested by fragmented protoplasm with indistinguishable plasma membranes and damaged cell ultrastructure but no evidence of intracellular ice. Intracellular cavitation may be a source of freezing injury in <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells of flowering dogwood...|$|E
30|$|In addition, the {{disappearance}} of nuclei and starch grains from perimedullary cells occurred earlier than that from <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells (Figs.  3 f–h, 4 f–h). Moreover, in LH- 1 samples, all perimedullary cells showed yellow–green fluorescence, while no variations in the autofluorescence of cell walls were evident in some <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells that were located near the pith (arrowheads in Fig.  5 b). Therefore, it seems possible that the synthesis of heartwood substances might start in perimedullary cells in the pith region. High-level expression of genes {{that are related to}} the synthesis of heartwood substances was observed in xylem parenchyma cells at the sapwood-heartwood transition zone in Robinia pseudoacacia L [23, 24]. Similar genes might be strongly expressed in perimedullary cells during heartwood formation.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, the {{initiation}} of heartwood formation occurred within 4  years in the pith regions of branches in Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis. It appears that not only <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells but also perimedullary cells in the pith might {{be involved in the}} synthesis of heartwood substances. Further analysis of perimedullary cells should provide useful information about {{the early stages of the}} formation of heartwood.|$|E

30|$|In all samples {{exposed to}} T. versicolor, {{there were many}} mycelia in almost all tracheids and vessels, with serious decay {{symptoms}} (P. densiflora, Fig.  2 A-B; C. japonica, Fig.  3 a, b; C. obtusa, Fig.  4 a, b; and F. crenata, Fig.  5 a, b). However, mycelia of T. eurrhizus were rarely found in the tracheids of softwood (P. densiflora, Fig.  2 c, d; C. japonica, Fig.  3 c, d; and C. obtusa, Fig.  4 c, d). Additionally, there were no decay symptoms around the mycelia at all. In F. crenata, the mycelia of T. eurrhizus were found inside vessels in the hardwood more frequency than tracheids in softwood (Fig.  5 c, d), but no decay symptoms were observed. In addition, there were no mycelia in other woody tissues, such as <b>xylem</b> <b>rays</b> and fibers. There were many T. eurrhizus mycelia covering the sample surfaces and edges (P. densiflora, Fig.  2 e, f; C. japonica, Fig.  3 e, f; C. obtusa, Fig.  4 e, f; and F. crenata, Fig.  5 e, f).|$|R
30|$|Focussing on {{four types}} of {{parenchyma}} cell around pith regions of branches of Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis, we examined the timing and role of cell death during heartwood formation. Large parenchyma cells that were located in the inner part of the pith died within a year. By contrast, other parenchyma cells died within 4  years, with the timing of cell death {{depending on the type}} of cell. Axial parenchyma cells of the xylem close to the pith died first. Then, small parenchyma cells died in the perimedullary zone in the outer part of the pith. Finally, ray parenchyma cells in the xylem close to the pith died. Variations in the autofluorescence of cell walls, which might have been due to deposition of heartwood substances, were observed first in <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells and small parenchyma cells in the perimedullary zone. Our results indicate that the initiation of heartwood formation occurs within 4  years in pith regions of branches in Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis. Moreover, it appears that not only <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells but also small parenchyma cells in the perimedullary zone might be involved in the synthesis of heartwood substances.|$|E
40|$|Freezing {{behavior}} of wood tissue of red osier dogwood (Cornus sericea L.) cannot {{be explained by}} current concepts of freezing resistance. Previous studies indicated that water in wood tissue presumably froze extracellularly. However, {{it was observed that}} <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells within these tissues could survive temperatures as low as - 80 [deg]C and the walls of these cells did not collapse during freezing (S. R. Malone and E. N. Ashworth [1991] Plant Physiol 95 : 871 - 881). This observation was unexpected and is inconsistent with the current hypothesis of cell response during freezing. Hence, the objective of our study was to further examine the mechanism of freezing resistance of wood tissue of red osier dogwood. We studied freezing stress response of <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells of red osier dogwood using freeze substitution and transmission electron microscopy. Wood samples were collected in winter, spring, and summer of 1992. Specimens were cooled from 0 [deg]C to - 60 [deg]C at 5 [deg]C/h. Freezing stress did not affect the structural organization of wood tissue. However, the <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells showed two unique responses to a freezing stress: protoplasm contraction and protoplasm fragmentation. Protoplasm contraction was evident at all freezing temperatures and in tissues collected at different times of the year. Cells with fragmented protoplasm, however, were noticed only in tissues collected in spring and summer. Protoplasm contraction in winter tissue occurred without apparent damage to the protoplasm. In contrast, protoplasm contraction in spring and summer tissues was accompanied by substantial damage. No evidence of intracellular ice formation was observed in parenchyma cells exposed to freezing stress. Differences in protoplasm contraction and appearance of cells with fragmented protoplasm likely indicated seasonal changes in cold hardiness of the wood tissue of red osier dogwood. We speculate that the appearance of fragmented protoplasm may indicate that cells are being injured by an alternative mechanism in spring and summer...|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} some studies about the wood {{permeability}} and its improving measures, some {{progress has been}} made to study the diffusion and transmission of preservative solutions in standing trees. In the present study, copper- (Cu-) based preservative with other reagents is injected into the standing tree Chinese fir using sap-flow method. The chemical compositions of the retreated woods are analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The samples from different height positions are analyzed with scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) to obtain microstructures and preservative retention, respectively. The results indicate that the preservative solutions with lower concentrations are more conducive to diffusion and transmission in the wood. Moreover, the preservative retention at different height position has a greater concentration gradient for composite preservative solutions than those of the single preservative solutions. Solidified preservative particles are observed in <b>xylem</b> <b>rays</b> with SEM.

30|$|The Lower Cretaceous Guantou Formation {{is known}} as an {{important}} horizon for the Cretaceous petrified woods in southern China. Though abundant Cretaceous wood remains {{have been found in}} this formation, only one species has been recognized. A new coniferous wood, Brachyoxylon zhejiangense sp. nov. is described from the Lower Cretaceous Guantou Formation in Xinchang of Zhejiang Province, southeastern China. Anatomically, the new species is characterized by obscure annual rings, mixed type of radial pitting, araucarioid cross-field pits and uniseriate <b>xylem</b> <b>rays.</b> The finding of Brachyoxylon zhejiangense sp. nov. represents the first well-defined record of Brachyoxylon in southeastern China, and enriches the diversity of the Early Cretaceous petrified wood in southern China. Additionally, the new finding sheds new light on further understanding the floral composition, especially the forest vegetation type of the southern phytoprovince in the late Early Cretaceous. Diverse compressed leaf fossils of Cheirolepidiaceae have been described from the Guantou Formation in the fossil locality of the present petrified wood. The co-occurrence of Brachyoxylon zhejiangense sp. nov. and those cheirolepidiaceous leaf fossils provide additional evidences to support that Brachyoxylon may be systematically related to the Cheirolepidiaceae.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Leaflet {{movements}} in the legume Samanea saman are dependent upon massive redistribution of potassium (K), chloride (CI), and other solutes between opposing (extensor and flexor) halves of the motor organ (pulvinus). Solutes are known to diffuse through the apoplast during redistribution. To test the possibility that solute diffusion might be restricted by apoplastic barriers, we analyzed elements in the apoplast in freeze-dried cryosections of pulvini using scanning electron microscopy/x-ray microanatysis. Large discontinuities in apoplastic K and CI at the extensor-flexor interface provide evidence for a barrier to solute diffusion. The barrier extends from the epidermis on upper and lower sides of the pulvinus to cambial cells in the central vascular core. It is completed by hydrophobic regions between phloem and cambium, and between <b>xylem</b> <b>rays</b> and surrounding vascular tissue, as deduced by discontinuities in apoplastic solutes and by staining of fresh sections with lipid-soluble Sudan dyes. Thus, symplastic pathways are necessary for ion redistribution in the Samanea pulvinus during leaflet movement.

30|$|In {{the inner}} {{earlywood}} {{of the current}} year’s xylem (differentiating <b>xylem),</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells had fusiform nuclei (a white arrow in Fig.  5 a) and large central vacuoles (a black arrowhead in Fig.  5 a).

All of the small vacuoles contained proteins. In the middle part of the earlywood in the ninth annual ring from the cambium (the outer part of the intermediate wood), ray parenchyma cells had elliptical nuclei and vacuoles that contained proteins (data not shown).|$|E

By contrast, {{in the sixth}} and ninth annual rings from the cambium, namely, in the middle part of the sapwood and the outer part of the intermediate wood, all the vacuoles in ray parenchyma cells were PSVs (Figs.  5 b, 6 b). These observations suggest that the main function of vacuoles in ray parenchyma cells might be storage of proteins from the outer part of the sapwood to the outer part of the intermediate wood. It was reported that PSVs contain hydrolytic enzymes and function in autophagy, even when proteins are accumulated [29, 31]. Therefore, PSVs in ray parenchyma cells from the outer part of the sapwood to the outer part of the intermediate wood might also function in autophagy for maintenance of cellular homeostasis.|$|E
40|$|Feasibility {{of nuclear}} {{magnetic}} resonance (nMR) was tested for research of anatomy and moisture content of wood. A three m high living beech tree (Fagus sylvatica L.) was imaged by magnetic resonance using the 3 D spin-echo microscopic imaging technique at isotropic spatial resolution of 100 mm to follow structural changes in the topped branch caused by healing response mechanisms of the tree. Conventional light microscopy was also employed to verify tree structures detected on MR images. Conventional light microscopy revealed anatomical structures and three year age of the tree branch. MR images clearly showed pith, radially oriented <b>xylem</b> <b>rays,</b> early wood vessels with a delineated border between early and late wood, {{as well as the}} cambial zone with current xylem and phloem growth increment. We studied water concentration in the branch and the depth of dehydration formed in 22 hours after the mechanical injury. The dehydrated region extended to the mm depth from the wound location. First passive response of the injured branch tissue reflects in the initial decrease of the moisture content that was detected by MR imaging. Finally, we processed 3 D MR microscopy data by the ImageJ image processing program to depict the spatial water concentration in the tree branch and to determine tissues with high water content...|$|R
40|$|The ABA {{concentrations}} of leaves, roots, soils and transport fluids of chickpea and lupin plants growing in acid (pH= 4. 8) and alkaline (pH= 8. 0) soils and an acid soil with an alkaline subsoil and an alkaline soil with an acid subsoil were measured {{with the aim}} of explaining the poor growth of narrow-leafed lupins in alkaline soil. The ABA concentration in the leaves was higher in lupin than chickpea, but did not differ when the plants were grown in alkaline compared to acid soil. The ABA concentration of the roots and xylem sap of lupin did not differ significantly when grown in acid or alkaline soil. Chickpea roots and xylem sap had, however, lower ABA concentrations in acid soil. The ABA concentration in the soil solution was higher in the acid than in the alkaline soil. Roots of lupin and chickpea showed no suberization of the hypodermis or exodermis whether grown aeroponically or hydroponically and the pH of the cytoplasm did not change significantly when root cells of lupin and chickpea were exposed to external pHs of 4. 8 or 8. 0. The chickpea roots had greater suberization of the endodermal cells adjacent to radial <b>xylem</b> <b>rays</b> and maintained a slightly higher vacuolar pH than lupin in both acid and alkaline external media, but these small differences are insufficient to explain the reductions in lupin growth in alkaline soil...|$|R
40|$|Stems of Ipomoea obscura Ker Gawl., {{increase}} in thickness by forming multiple rings of cambia. Stems 5 - 6 mm thick produce parenchymatous derivatives which divide repeatedly to form small arcs of cambium. Several such small arcs initiate simultaneously {{and form a}} ring of small cambial arcs. After {{the formation of a}} few xylem and phloem elements, all these arcs are interconnected by transdifferentiation of parenchyma cells present between the cambial arcs and constitute a complete cambial cylinder. This newly formed cambium is functionally bidirectional: earlier- formed arcs produce xylem centripetally and phloem centrifugally, while later-formed segments exclusively produce thin-walled parenchyma cells on either side. Young stems are circular in cross section but as stem thickness increases they become oval to elliptic or lobed and dumbbell-shaped. <b>Xylem</b> <b>rays</b> are mostly uni- or biseriate and thin-walled, but multiseriate rays characteristic for a climbing habit are observed occasionally. In thick stems, the marginal ray parenchyma in most of the samples becomes meristematic and develops ray cambia which exclusively produce sieve elements. Similarly, parenchyma cells produced from later-formed cambial segments give rise to several irregularly oriented vascular bundles. The secondary xylem is diffuse porous, with indistinct growth rings and is composed of fibriform and wider vessels, fibres, and axial and ray parenchyma cells, while phloem consists of sieve elements, companion cells, and axial and ray parenchyma cells...|$|R
30|$|Changes in the {{morphology}} {{and functions}} of vacuoles provide useful information about the mechanism of cell death. In the present study, we monitored the morphology and contents of vacuoles during the death of ray parenchyma cells in the conifer Cryptomeria japonica. In differentiating <b>xylem,</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells had large central vacuoles. In sapwood, vacuoles in ray parenchyma cells contained proteins, an indication {{that one of the}} main functions of these vacuoles might be protein storage. A dramatic decrease in the protein content of some vacuoles was detected in the intermediate wood before the initiation of vacuole rupture. Although vacuole rupture was detected from the intermediate wood to the outermost heartwood, some vacuoles were obviously enlarged in the inner intermediate wood. Condensed nuclei were first observed after the rupture of these large vacuoles in ray parenchyma cells. It seems plausible that the autolysis of the contents of ray parenchyma cells might be caused by the rupture of the enlarged vacuoles in the inner intermediate wood.|$|E
40|$|We {{have been}} {{interested}} in studying the molecular mechanisms of freeze-tolerance in woody plants. To address this question, seasonal protein extractions were taken from red-osier dogwood (Corpus sericea L.) xylem in an attempt to identify proteins associated with cold acclimation in extremely freeze-tolerant organism. A 24 kDa protein was found to have maximum accumulation during periods of cold acclimation. A polyclonal antibody was raised against this protein and used for subsequent screening of a cDNA expression library generated from cold acclimated xylem. Four unique cDNA s were subsequently sequenced and found to encode putative novel dehydrin-like proteins. Immunogold in situ localization, using the anti- 24 kDa antibody, revealed abundant labeling throughout the cytosol and nuclei of cold acclimated <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma, pith parenchyma, and cortical tissues. In addition, a novel association with plasmodesmata was observed within the simple pits of <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma and adjacent differentiating xylem cell types. Although the dehydrin function remains unknown, they may non-specifically stabilize nuclear and cytosolic macromolecules and membrane surfaces during periods of desiccation. Previous studies have related the occurrence of dehydrins during cold acclimation due to the desiccative stress induced by the formation of extracellular ice during freezing. As a result, it was of interest to determine the environmental regulatory mechanism for 24 kDa protein accumulation. Through extensive controlled photoperiod and field studies, we determined that the 24 kDa dehydrin-like protein accumulates in response to prolonged short day exposure and is phytochrome mediated. Through usage of climatic ecotypes, we have confirmed that this photoperiod regulation is under genetic control. Decreasing photoperiod in late summer triggered a series of physiological events that ultimately reduced stem water content, enhanced freeze-tolerance and increased 24 kDa protein accumulation. As a result, freeze-tolerance was acquired prior to the onset of the first frost episodes. Interspecific analyses between 24 Cornus species determined that 24 kDa protein occurrence is widespread and occurs in both supercooling and non-supercooling tissues. Due to the commonality of the 24 kDa protein in less hardy species, we are unsure of the 24 kDa protein s role in the extreme freeze tolerance that is characteristic of C. sericea. ...|$|E
40|$|Differential thermal analysis, {{differential}} scanning calorimetry, pulsed nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy, and low temperature microscopy are utilized to investigate low temperature freezing points or exotherms which occur near − 40 C in the xylem of cold-acclimated shagbark hickory (Carya ovata L.). Experiments using these methods demonstrate that the low temperature exotherm results from the freezing of cellular water in a manner predicted for supercooled dilute aqueous solutions. Heat release on freezing, {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} relaxation times, and freezing and thawing curves for hickory twigs all point to a supercooled fraction in the xylem at subfreezing temperatures.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the formation of successive rings of cambia in Rivea hypocriteriformis Choisy (Convolvulaceae). The mature stem is composed of four to five rings of xylem alternating with phloem. Successive cambia originate as smaller and larger segments; union and anastomosing of small cambial segments often leads {{to the formation of}} discontinuous rings. In the initial stage of growth, several vascular bundles interconnect to form the first ring of vascular cambium. The cambium remains functional for one complete season and becomes dormant during summer; a new ring of cambium is completed prior to the subsequent monsoon season and sprouting of new leaves. Successive cambia are initiated from the pericyclic parenchyma situated three to four cell layers outside of the protophloem. Functionally, all the successive cambia are bidirectional and produce secondary xylem centripetally and phloem centrifugally. The secondary xylem is diffuse-porous, with indistinct growth rings and consisting of wide fibriform vessels, fibre tracheids, and axial and ray parenchyma cells. The <b>xylem</b> <b>rays</b> are uni- to multiseriate and heterocellular. The multiseriate rays contain lignified marginal ray cells and thin-walled, unlignified central cells. The central ray cells also show accumulations of starch and druses. Discrete strands of intraxylary phloem occur at the periphery of the pith, and additional intraxylary phloem develops from adjacent cells as secondary growth progresses.

40|$|The {{factors that}} {{determine}} sapwood width and volume {{in a tree}} are not known. This study asked whether sapwood width is related to a need for stem storage sites. Experiments were conducted on 12 34 -year-old Douglas-fir [(Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] trees with a 6 - 7 fold range of leaf areas and leaf area/sapwood volumes. Because of declining ray frequency but constant average ray area, ray volume declined for the first 6 - 10 growth rings, then remained constant, and did not vary with height (breast height vs. 10 nodes from the top). Fewer of the ray parenchyma cells had nuclei in inner than outer sapwood. Inner sapwood had ray parenchyma with smaller rounder nuclei than did outer sapwood, {{and there was no}} effect of height. There was a positive relationship between leaf area and the relative volume of ray in outer sapwood at breast height (r= 0. 646, p= 0. 02), supporting the hypothesis that Douglas-fir trees with larger leaf areas have higher ray volume than do trees with smaller leaf areas. However, correlations of leaf area/sapwood volume with leaf area at either height were not significant, nor were correlations of either leaf area or leaf area/sapwood volume with measures of ray vitality (nuclear frequency in outer sapwood, or the ratio of nuclear frequency in the middle/outer sapwood or in inner/outer sapwood. These latter correlations give no evidence that Douglas-fir trees determine their sapwood volume based on a need for quantity of vital <b>xylem</b> <b>rays...</b>|$|R

This data would be helpful for further study in tree breeding program and clarification of the mechanism of utilization of such reserve materials and their distribution pattern within the cells...|$|E
30|$|Wood {{consists}} of {{several kinds of}} secondary xylem cell that {{have a variety of}} functions. Cell death plays a critical role in the determination of the function of secondary xylem cells. Long-lived <b>xylem</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells (ray parenchyma cells) retain their organelles for several years or decades, and they play important roles in the storage and radial transport of materials [1, 2]. In addition, ray parenchyma cells are involved in the heartwood formation and they synthesize heartwood substances, such as polyphenols, that contribute to resistance to decay and the color and odor of wood, prior to their death [3 – 6]. In previous studies, we investigated the death of ray parenchyma cells as a model of the death of long-lived xylem cells in situ. The death of ray parenchyma cells does not occur successively even within the same radial cell lines of a ray, suggesting that the death of ray parenchyma cells might not be controlled in a time-dependent manner [7 – 9]. Thus, the mechanism of the death of ray parenchyma cells might differ from that of the time-dependent programmed cell death of short-lived tracheary elements [10, 11].|$|E
40|$|Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) catalyses {{the first}} {{specific}} {{step in the}} biosynthesis of monolignols, the monomeric units of lignins. We examined the developmental regulation of the Eucalyptus gunnii EgCCR promoter by analysing the expression of EgCCR-GUS fusions in tobacco. EgCCR promoter activity was strongest in lignified organs (stems and roots) consistent with the EgCCR mRNA level in these organs. Histochemical analysis showed expression in vascular tissues (cambium, young differentiating <b>xylem,</b> <b>ray</b> cells, internal and external phloem) of stems and roots in agreement with in situ hybridization data. Promoter deletion analysis and gain-of-function experiments identified the sequences between positions - 119 and - 77 as necessary and sufficient for expression in vascular tissues of stems. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays showed that this region is specifically recognized by nuclear proteins present in tobacco stems, giving rise to two retarded complexes, LMC 1 and LMC 2. Using overlapping EgCCR fragments and mutated oligonucleotides as competitors in gel-shift assays, two DNA-protein interaction sites were mapped. Finally, the role of protein-protein interactions {{in the formation of}} the LMC 1 and LMC 2 complexes was investigated using the detergent sodium deoxycholate, and protein fractionation onto a heparin Sepharose column...|$|E
40|$|Thermo-hygro-mechanical (THM) -densified wood is more {{resistant}} to colonisation and degradation by brown-rot fungi than untreated wood. Colonisation and degradation by soft-rot fungi was investigated in treated Norway spruce (Picea abies) and treated beech (Fagus sylvatica) to assess their suitability for utility class 4. Three different treatments were applied: thermal-hygro (TH) treatment, mechanical densification and THM-treatment including densification and post-treatment under saturated steam conditions at different temperatures. For comparison, additional wood specimens were treated with two concentrations of a chromium-copper (CC) wood preservative. After 32 weeks incubation, weight losses induced by soft-rot fungi were lowest in wood treated with CC. Highest weight losses were recorded from TH-treated wood, in which soft-rot erosion attack (type 2) was exclusively observed in spruce. In comparison to controls, significantly lower weight losses by soft-rot fungi were recorded in THM-treated spruce wood, but no such {{differences were found in}} beech wood. Microscopical examination showed that in THM-treated wood of spruce, soft-rot type 1 commenced from the outer wood surfaces and cavity formation was not found in deeper regions of the wood samples. THM-treated beech wood was more susceptible to degradation than that of spruce which can be partly explained by the higher syringyl lignin content in beech wood, which is more susceptible to all kinds of degradation. Hyphal colonisation and soft-rot was facilitated within deeper regions of beech wood mainly in the non-occluded lumina of parenchyma cells in multiseriate <b>xylem</b> <b>rays.</b> It can be concluded that TH-treated spruce wood and THM-treated beech wood is susceptible to soft-rot and therefore inappropriate for utility class...|$|R
50|$|While {{the pattern}} of {{branching}} and fertile structures such as sporangia are unknown, Franhueberia is most similar anatomically to other basal euphyllophytes like Armoricaphyton chateaupannense and Psilophyton dawsonii. However, certain features of the primary and secondary vascular tissues such as {{the diameter of the}} primary <b>xylem</b> cylinder and <b>ray</b> anatomy sets Franhueberia apart from these other species. Given these and other differences combined with a current lack of a complete understanding of the whole plant, Franhueberia is currently classified as Euphyllophytina incertae sedis.|$|R
40|$|Non-destructive {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) revealed pathological anatomical features of coast live oak trees (Quercus agrifolia) that were naturally infected with Phytophthora ramorum. Fresh excised whole slices showing typical macroscopic cankers and bleeding were examined. Infected areas (i. e. cankers) were compared to presumed healthy sections. Various infected tissues were revealed {{and the depth of}} infection into the xylem could be estimated. Discontinuous distribution of water in the outer layer of sapwood was observed and high water concentrations appeared in the cankers. MRI also revealed channels in the periderm (bark) with high water concentration. Microscopic examination revealed the channels to be rays continuous with the rays extending into the <b>xylem.</b> The <b>rays</b> function in the radial conduction of water, and it is suggested that they may serve as an avenue of infection for P. ramorum.
