40|$|Proposed space applications, such as {{the cooling}} of {{infrared}} and <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> <b>telescopes,</b> have generated substantial interest {{in the behavior of}} He II flowing in porous materials. For design purposes, classical porous media correlations and room temperature data are often used to obtain order of magnitude estimates of expected pressure drops, while the attendant temperature differences are either ignored or estimated using smooth tube correlations. A more accurate alternative to this procedure is suggested by an empirical extension of the two fluid model. It is shown that four empirical parameters are necessary to describe the pressure and temperature differences induced by He II flow through a porous sample. The three parameters required to determine pressure differences are measured in counterflow and found to compare favorably with those for isothermal flow. The fourth parameter, the Gorter-Mellink constant, differs substantially from smooth tube values. It is concluded that parameter values determined from counterflow can be used to predict pressure and temperature differences in a variety of flows to an accuracy of about + or - 20 pct...|$|R

In one embodiment the mirrors are inclined at different angles and has its respective second focus at a different location, separate detectors being located at the respective second focus.

40|$|The Solar-A {{satellite}} {{being prepared}} by the Institute for Sapce and Astronautical Sciences (ISAS) in Japan is dedicated to high energy observations of solar flares. The Soft <b>X</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>Telescope</b> (SXT) is being prepared to provide filtered images in the 2 to 60 A interval. The flight model is now undergoing tests in the 1000 foot tunnel at MSFC. Launch will be in September 1991. Earlier resolution and efficiency tests on the grazing incidence mirror have established its performance in soft x rays. The one-piece, two mirror grazing incidence telescope is supported in a strain free mount separated from the focal plane assembly by a carbon-epoxy metering tube whose windings and filler are chosen to minimize thermal and hygroscopic effects. The CCD detector images both the x ray and the concentric visible light aspect telescope. Optical filters provide images at 4308 and 4700 A.

40|$|We {{obtained}} multiwavelength {{coverage of}} the soft X-ray transient. GRO J 1655 - 40 during its 1996 outburst, using HST (Hubble Space Telescope), RXTE (Rossi X Ray Timing Explorer), CGRO (Compton Gamma Ray Observatory), and ground-based facilities. This outburst was qualitatively different from other SXT (Soft <b>X</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>Telescope)</b> outbursts and from previous outbursts of this source. The onset of hard X-ray activity occurred very slowly, over several months, and was delayed relative to the soft X-ray rise. During this period, the optical fluxes declined steadily. This apparent anticorrelation is not consistent with with the standard disk instability model of SXT outbursts, nor is it expected if the optical output is dominated by reprocessed X-rays, as in persistent low-mass X-ray binaries. Based {{on the strength of}} the 2175 -A interstellar absorption feature, we constrain the reddening to be E(B - V) = 1. 2 plus or minus 0. 1, a result which is consistent with the known properties of the source and with the strength of other interstellar absorption lines. After this dereddening we find that the spectra are dominated by a component peaking in the optical, with the expected v (sup l/ 3) disk spectrum seen only in the ultraviolet. Bowen fluorescence lines of NIII and OIII are also seen, as well as possible P Cyg profiles in the ultraviolet resonance lines. These features suggest an accretion-disk wind. The X-ray spectra broadly resemble the high/soft state commonly seen in black hole candidates, but evolve through two substates...|$|E
40|$|Photographs {{obtained}} {{during three}} flights of an 11 inch diameter normal incident soft X-ray (wavelength 63. 5 A) telescope are analyzed {{and the data}} are compared to the results expected from tests of the mirror surfaces. Multilayer coated <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> <b>telescopes</b> {{have the potential for}} 0. 01 arcsec resolution, and there is optimism that such high quality mirrors can be built. Some of the factors which enter into the performance actually achieved in practice are as follows: quality of the mirror substrate, quality of the multilayer coating, and number of photons collected. Measurements of multilayer mirrors show that the actual performance achieved in the solar X-ray images demonstrates a reduction in the scattering compared to that calculated from the topography of the top surface of the multilayer. In the brief duration of a rocket flight, the resolution is also limited by counting statistics from the number of photons collected. At X-ray Ultraviolet (XUV) wavelengths from 171 to 335 A the photon flux should be greater than 10 (exp 10) ph/sec, so that a resolution better than 0. 1 arcsec might be achieved, if mirror quality does not provide a limit first. In a satellite, a large collecting area will be needed for the highest resolution...|$|R

40|$|Recently Miyaji et al. (1993) {{detected}} excess soft X-ray absorption in the Broad Band <b>X</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>Telescope</b> (BBXRT) {{spectrum of}} the cluster A 2256. The absorption {{was due to the}} K-edge of oxygen; from the observed edge energy and the redshift of the cluster, Miyaji et al. argued that the primary absorber was oxygen in an ionization state between O(+ 2) and O(+ 4) at a temperature in the range 0. 5 - 5 x 10 (exp 5) K. Such gas should produce strong UV and optical line emission. We predict the strongest UV and optical line fluxes for this X-ray absorbing gas. The strongest UV lines include Lyman-alpha, C III lambda- 1909, C IV lambda- 1549, O IV lambda- 1401, O V lambda- 1218, O VI lambda- 1034, Si III lambda- 1207, and Si IV lambda- 1397 lines. These lines should be detectable with the International Ultraviolet Explorer, the Hubble Space Telescope, or the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope. In the optical the lines are weaker, but the (O II) lambda lambda- 3726, 3729, (O III) lambda lambda- 4959, 5007, (N II) lambda lambda- 6567, 6584, (Ne III) lambda lambda- 3918, 3969, (S II) lambda- 6720, and (S III) lambda- 9320 lines should be detected with moderate exposures if the warm absorber is near the lower limit of the allowed temperature range, T less than or approximately equal to 1. 5 x 10 (exp 5) K.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to apply the coronal magnetographic {{technique}} to SOHO (Solar Heliospheric Observatory) /CDS (Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer) EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet Radiation) and coordinated VLA microwave observations of solar active regions to derive the strength {{and structure of the}} coronal magnetic field. A CDS observing plan was developed for obtaining spectra needed to derive active region differential emission measures (DEMs) required for coronal magnetography. VLA observations were proposed and obtained. SOHO JOP 100 was developed, tested, approved, and implemented to obtain coordinated CDS (Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer) /EIT (Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope) / VLA (Very Large Array) / TRACE (Transition Region and Coronal Explorer) / SXT (Solar <b>X</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>Telescope)</b> observations of active regions on April 12, May 9, May 13, and May 23. Analysis of all four data sets began, with heaviest concentration on COS data. It is found that 200 -pixel (14 A in NIS 1) wavelength windows are appropriate for extracting broadened Gaussian line profile fit parameters for lines including Fe XIV at 334. 2, Fe XVI at 335. 4, Fe XVI at 360. 8, and Mg IX at 368. 1 over the 4 arcmin by 4 arcmin CDS field of view. Extensive efforts were focused on learning and applying were focused on learning and applying CDS software, and including it in new IDL procedures to carry out calculations relating to coronal magnetography. An important step is to extract Gaussian profile fits to all the lines needed to derive the DEM in each spatial pixel of any given active region. The standard CDS absolute intensity calibration software was applied to derived intensity images, revealing that ratios between density-insensitive lines like Fe XVI 360. 8 / 335. 4 yield good agreement with theory. However, the resulting absolute intensities of those lines are very high, indicating that revisions to the CDS absolute intensity calibrations remain {{to be included in the}} CDS software, an essential step to deriving reliable coronal magnetograms.

40|$|The energy range above 60 keV is {{important}} for the study of many open problems in high energy astrophysics such as the role of Inverse Compton with respect to synchrotron or thermal processes in GRBs, non thermal mechanisms in SNR, the study of the high energy cut-offs in AGN spectra, and the detection of nuclear and annihilation lines. Recently the development of high energy Laue lenses with broad energy bandpasses from 60 to 600 keV have been proposed for a Hard <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> focusing <b>Telescope</b> (HAXTEL) in order to study the X-ray continuum of celestial sources. The required focal plane detector should have high detection efficiency over the entire operative range, a spatial resolution of about 1 mm, an energy resolution of a few keV at 500 keV and a sensitivity to linear polarization. We describe a possible configuration of the focal plane detector based on several CdTe/CZT pixelated layers stacked together to achieve the required detection efficiency at high energy. Each layer can operate both as a separate position sensitive detector and polarimeter or work with other layers to increase the overall photopeak efficiency. Each layer has a hexagonal shape in order to minimize the detector surface required to cover the lens field of view. The pixels would have the same geometry so as to provide the best coupling with the lens point spread function and to increase the symmetry for polarimetric studies.

40|$|Facilities {{available}} for <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> and gamma ray astronomical observations {{in the late}} 1980 s are described, {{with an emphasis on}} NASA programs. Current European programs for launching Rosat and Exosat will provide coverage in the 0. 4 - 60 keV energy range. The proposed NASA advanced <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> astrophysics facility is intended to cover the 0. 1 - 8 keV range with higher than 0. 5 arcsec resolution. The Japanese Astro-B, scheduled for launch in 1983, observes in the 1 - 60 keV range. <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> and gamma ray observations are also scheduled for Spacelab flights. The French-Soviet Gamma- 1 spark chamber high energy gamma <b>ray</b> <b>telescope</b> is intended for LEO orbit and observations in the energy range above 50 MeV with a 2 deg, 1 - 5 arcmin resolution. The NASA gamma ray observatory is set for 1988 launch and will feature four instruments to monitor the 60 keV- 300 GeV range. Balloon-borne instrumentation will also be launched, with attention given to the medium gamma ray energy range from 1 - 30 MeV...|$|R
