40|$|ABSTRACT. Similarly to {{but quite}} {{different}} from the <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning</b> <b>effects</b> resulting from fission-produced iodine during restart-up process of a fission reactor, we introduce a complete new concept of the tritium well depth and tritium well time in fusion energy research area. To show what the least required amount of tritium storage is used to start up a fusion reactor and how long a time the fusion reactor needs to be operated for achieving the tritium break-even during the initial start-up phase due to the finite tritium breeding time that is dependent on the tritium breeder, specific structure of breeding zone, layout of coolant flow pipes, tritium recovery scheme and extraction process, the tritium retention of reactor components, unrecoverable tritium fraction in breeder, leakage to the inertial gas container, and the natural decay etc, we describe this new phenomenon and answer this problem by setting up and by solving a set of equations, which express a dynamic subsystem model of the tritium inventory evolution in a fusion experimental breeder (FEB). Two different simulation models give almost the same results, It is found the tritium well depth is about 317 - 319 g and tritium well time is approximately 240 full power days for reference case of the FEB designed detail configuration and it is also found that after one-year operation the tritium storage reaches 1. 18 kg that is more than the least required amount of tritium storage to start up three of FEB-like fusion reactors...|$|R

The crew's resulting efforts to restore power, including the manual withdrawal of control rods not under the SKALA computer's automated control, placed the reactor in a highly unsafe configuration.

40|$|The <b>poisoning</b> <b>effect</b> {{of excess}} Si solute on the grain-refining potency of Al-Ti-B grain {{refiners}} in Al-Si casting alloys {{has been studied}} in a crystallographic investigation. The edge-to-edge matching model was used for investigating and comparing the possible <b>poisoning</b> <b>effects</b> of several binary and ternary intermetallic compounds containing Si and Ti. The {{results show that the}} <b>poisoning</b> <b>effect</b> is probably due to the formation of a Ti 5 Si 3 coating on the surface of TiAl 3, because the Ti 5 Si 3 phase has a much better crystallographic matching with TiAl 3 than it does with the Al matrix. However, TiB 2 particles appear to survive because an excessively large misfit prevents the Ti 5 Si 3 phase from forming on the surface of TiB 2. The implications of this proposed mechanism are discussed in the light of current practical casting solutions and the continuing debate on the grain refinement mechanism.

50|$|Because 135Xe is {{a potent}} nuclear poison with a large cross section for neutron absorption, the buildup of 135Xe in the fuel inside a power reactor can lower the {{reactivity}} greatly. If a power reactor is shut down or left running at a low power level, then large amounts of 135Xe can build up through decay of 135I. When the reactor is restarted or the low power level is increased significantly, 135Xe will be quickly consumed through neutron capture reactions and the reactivity of the core will increase. Under some circumstances, control systems {{may not be able}} to respond quickly enough to manage an abrupt reactivity increase as the built-up 135Xe burns off. It is thought that <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning</b> was one of the factors which led to the power surge which damaged the Chernobyl reactor core.|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{share of}} renewable energy, such as {{wind and solar}} power, will increase the demand for load-following power sources, and nuclear reactors could be one option. However, during rapid load-following events, traditional UOX cores could be restricted by the volatile oscillation of the power distribution. Therefore, a conceptual study on stability properties of Th-MOX PWR concerning axial offset power excursion during load-following events are investigated and discussed. The study is performed in SIMULATE- 3 for a realistic PWR core (Ringhals- 3) {{at the end of}} cycle, where the largest amplitude of the axial offset oscillations is expected. It is shown that the Th-MOX core possesses much better stability characteristics and shorter reactor dead time compared with a traditional UOX core, and the main reasons are the lower sensitivity to perturbations in the neutron spectrum, lower <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning</b> and lower thermal neutron flux...|$|R
50|$|If {{sufficient}} reactivity {{control authority}} is available, the reactor can be restarted, but a xenon burn-out transient {{must be carefully}} managed. As the control rods are extracted and criticality is reached, neutron flux increases many orders of magnitude and the 135Xe begins to absorb neutrons and be transmuted to 136Xe. The reactor burns off the nuclear poison. As this happens, the reactivity and neutron flux increases, and the control rods must be gradually reinserted to counter the loss of neutron absorption by the 135Xe. Otherwise, the reactor neutron flux will continue to increase, burning off even more <b>xenon</b> <b>poison,</b> on a path to runaway criticality. The time constant for this burn-off transient depends on the reactor design, power level history of the reactor {{for the past several}} days, and the new power setting. For a typical step up from 50% power to 100% power, 135Xe concentration falls for about 3 hours.|$|R
50|$|Xenon-135 in {{particular}} tremendously affects {{the operation of}} a nuclear reactor because it's the most powerful known neutron poison. The inability of a reactor to be restarted due to the buildup of xenon-135 (reaches a maximum after about 10 hours) is {{sometimes referred to as}} xenon precluded start-up. The period of time in which the reactor is unable to override the effects of xenon-135 is called the xenon dead time or poison outage. During periods of steady state operation, at a constant neutron flux level, the xenon-135 concentration builds up to its equilibrium value for that reactor power in about 40 to 50 hours. When the reactor power is increased, xenon-135 concentration initially decreases because the burn up is increased at the new, higher power level. Thus, the dynamics of <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning</b> are important for the stability of the flux pattern and geometrical power distribution, especially in physically large reactors.|$|R

The key safety features built into the reactor design are the strictly limited amount of excess reactivity and the negative reactivity feedback characteristics, which provide a demonstrably safe self-limiting power excursion response to large reactivity insertions. However, the limited amount of excess reactivity also limits continuous prolonged reactor operation at full power. With a 4 mk excess reactivity, the reactor can operate for about one day at full power, 20 kW, before criticality is lost due to temperature <b>effects</b> and <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning.</b> A new safety concept is proposed in this paper that enables the continuous operation to a few months by increasing the excess reactivity from 4 mk to 8 mk.

The poisoning of the anode is assessed at 160 Ã¢ÂÂ¦C and 180 Ã¢ÂÂ¦C based on the transient behavior of the fuel cell potential and current density distribution.

Furthermore, the currentÃ¢ÂÂcell potential (IÃ¢ÂÂV) and power density curves and impedance spectra are obtained.

2500|$|Most {{types of}} {{reactors}} {{are sensitive to}} a process variously known as <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning,</b> or the iodine pit. The common fission product Xenon-135 produced in the fission process acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to destroy it by neutron absorption {{as fast as it}} is produced. Fission also produces iodine-135, which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult for a day or two, as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the [...] "iodine pit." [...] If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a [...] "xenon burnoff (power) transient". Control rods must be further inserted to replace the neutron absorption of the lost xenon-135. Failure to properly follow such a procedure was a key step in the Chernobyl disaster.|$|R
