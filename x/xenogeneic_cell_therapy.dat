40|$|Recent studies {{revealed}} a significant promoter activity of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) long terminal repeats (LTRs) in different human and mammalian cell lines, which is mediated by a 39 -bp repeat located in the U 3 region in different numbers, representing an enhancer (G. Scheef, N. Fischer, U. Krach, and R. R. Tönjes, J. Virol. 75 : 6933 - 6940, 2001). A statistical transcription factor analysis revealed putative binding sites for the CCAAT-binding transcription factor NF-Y inside the 39 -bp repeat. Specific binding of NF-Y to the repeat sequence was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift assays with specific antibodies directed against the three subunits of NF-Y. To identify further transcription-regulating elements, genetically modified LTRs lacking the repeat box, U 3, R, or U 5 were investigated. The results indicated a strong inhibitory element in the R region, as the deletion of R caused a significantly increased promoter activity. Since PERV might play a potential role {{in the application of}} <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>therapy</b> and xenotransplantation techniques, we have investigated whether immunosuppressive drugs that are routinely used in transplantation medicine {{have an impact on the}} promoter activity. Neither cyclosporine nor prednisolone had any influence on the promoter strength of the PERV LTRs. By performing a real-time PCR we were able to compare the proviral loads of porcine and infected human cells as well as the amount of released virions, which {{revealed a}} direct link between LTR activity and the number of released retroviruses...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs porcine {{endogenous}} retroviruses (PERV) productively infect {{human cells}} in vitro, they pose a serious risk in xenotransplantation and <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>therapies.</b> We have analyzed {{the prevalence of}} six well-characterized full-length PERV, five of them being replication-competent and four of them being chromosomally assigned (J. Virol. 75 (2001) 5465; J. Virol. 76 (2002) 2714). These analyses revealed a heterogeneous distribution of PERV among individuals and, as no PERV is present in every pig, it seems feasible to generate pigs free of functional PERV by conventional breeding. Conversely, as PERV are polymorphic, single proviruses may have escaped detection {{and this kind of}} assay must be performed for every herd used in xenotransplantation or <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>therapies.</b> In addition, specific proviruses show internal point mutations which significantly affect their replicational capacities. As there are two different types of PERV LTR structures showing varying levels of transcriptional capacity (J. Virol. 75 (2001) 6933), an analysis of 21 distinct chromosomal locations revealed that PERV which harbor highly active LTRs with repeat elements in U 3 are dominant...|$|R
50|$|The {{cell type}} chosen for this {{technique}} {{depends on the}} desired application of the cell microcapsules. The cells put into the capsules can be from the patient (autologous cells), from another donor (allogeneic cells) or from other species (<b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells).</b> The use of autologous <b>cells</b> in microencapsulation <b>therapy</b> {{is limited by the}} availability of these cells and even though <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> are easily accessible, danger of possible transmission of viruses, especially porcine endogenous retrovirus to the patient restricts their clinical application, and after much debate several groups have concluded that studies should involve the use of allogeneic instead of <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells.</b> Depending on the application, the cells can be genetically altered to express any required protein. However, enough research has to be carried out to validate the safety and stability of the expressed gene before these types of cells can be used.|$|R
40|$|Nonsensitized human leukocytes cocultured {{with various}} {{xenogeneic}} epithelioid and fibroblastic cells produced human leukocyte interferon and shortly thereafter transferred antiviral activity to the <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells.</b> Antiviral {{activity in the}} cocultured <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> was not due to cell-mediated cytotoxicity as measured by specific 51 Cr release and staining with vital dyes. The transfer of antiviral activity from leukocytes to <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> was blocked by rabbit antiserum to human leukocyte interferon. Transferred viral resistance failed to develop in actinomycin D-treated <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells,</b> even though these cells induced human leukocyte interferon. Based on these findings, it appears that interferon made in the cocultures acts on the leukocytes to effect the transfer of interferon-induced viral resistance to the xenogenic cells, possibly by transmission of an inducer for the antiviral state. These studies strongly suggest a new and efficient host defense against virus infection which does not require killing of noninfected or recently infected cells...|$|R

However, in the case of melanoma, it remains to be determined what specific molecular interactions are involved and whether NK cells control metastatic progression and/or the route of dissemination. Here we show that human melanoma cell lines derived from LN metastases express ligands for natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) and DNAX accessory molecule- 1 (DNAM- 1), two emerging NK cell receptors key for cancer cell recognition, but not NK group 2 member D (NKG 2 D). Compared with cell lines derived from metastases taken from other anatomical sites, LN metastases were more susceptible to NK cell lysis and preferentially targeted by adoptively transferred NK <b>cells</b> in a <b>xenogeneic</b> model of <b>cell</b> <b>therapy.</b> In mice, DNAM- 1 and NCR ligands were also found on spontaneous melanomas and melanoma cell lines. Interference with DNAM- 1 and NCRs by antibody blockade or genetic disruption reduced killing of melanoma cells. Taken together, these results show that DNAM- 1 and NCRs are critical for NK cell–mediated innate immunity to melanoma cells and provide a background to design NK cell–based immunotherapeutic strategies against melanoma and possibly other tumors...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chromaffin {{cells from}} the adrenal gland secrete a mixture of {{compounds}} that have a strong analgesic effect, especially when administered intrathecally. Many studies in animal models have shown that discordant <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> isolates, including chromaffin cells, can survive and have biologic effects when transplanted within a semipermeable membrane capsule. METHODS: To evaluate the clinical potential of encapsulated <b>cell</b> <b>therapy,</b> a human-scale implant containing bovine chromaffin cells was developed, characterized, and implanted in the subarachnoid space of seven patients with severe chronic pain not satisfactorily managed with conventional therapies. Patients received no pharmacologic immunosuppression. Cell devices were implanted during minimally invasive surgery, and device design allowed retrieval. All devices were recovered after implant periods of 41 to 176 days. RESULTS: Postexplant histologic analysis, immunostaining, and secretory function all confirmed survival and biochemical function of the encapsulated cells. Reductions in morphine intake and improvement in pain ratings were observed in several patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first successful trial of encapsulated <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> in humans. The preliminary findings of pain reduction warrant the initiation of a randomized, double-blind phase II study to evaluate the potential efficacy of the procedure...|$|R

40|$|Nonvascularized {{xenograft}} rejection is T cell mediated, but {{is dependent}} on initial macrophage (M) infiltration. We developed an i. p. transplant model to define the roles of M and T cells in xenograft rejection. Nonobese diabetic or BALB/c mice were injected i. p. with xenogeneic, allogeneic, or syngeneic cells, and the responding cells in subsequent lavages were assessed by flow cytometry and adoptive transfer. Neutrophils and monocytes/elicited M were rapidly recruited in response to xenogeneic pig (PK 15 or spleen) cells and, to a significantly lesser extent, allogeneic cells. These innate responses preceded T cell infiltration and occurred in their absence in SCID mice. Syngeneic cells induced negligible neutrophil or M responses. Neutrophils and M induced by <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> in SCID mice stimulated T cell recruitment after transfer to immunocompetent mice. T cells in turn were required for M activation and <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> rejection. Thus, M harvested from immunocompetent but not SCID mice injected with <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> expressed activation markers and rejected <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> when transferred into SCID mice. These findings demonstrate the interdependent roles of M and T cells in xenograft rejection. The requirement for M reflects their ability to mount a rapid, local innate response that stimulates T cell recruitment and, having received T cell help, to act as direct effectors of rejection...|$|R

40|$|Exposure {{to human}} serum induces the lysis of <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> through natural {{antibodies}} and complement activation. The carbohydrate Galactose-alpha 1, 3 -Galactose (Gal-alpha 1, 3 -Gal) epitope, {{has been shown}} to be the principal antigenic determinant on target cells. This reaction is, therefore, particularly important for xenogeneic cell-based therapy. As a first step toward the evaluation of the impact of this phenomenon for encapsulated <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells,</b> we have evaluated the presence of the Gal-alpha 1, 3 Gal epitope on two cell lines currently being used for the systemic delivery of protein in the periphery or the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In the second part of the study, we have tested and compared human serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the presence of xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNAs) and their potential impact on the survival of <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells.</b> Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis indicated that baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressed low levels of the alpha-Gal epitope, whereas mouse myoblast C 2 C 12 cells were extensively stained with the specific IB 4 -lectin. There was a direct correlation between serum killing and the level of Gal-alpha 1, 3 -Gal epitope expression on these cells. Importantly, we showed that CSF did not lyse BHK and C 2 C 12 cells as determined by cytotoxic crossmatch assays. The reaction was specific as the addition of soluble Gal-alpha 1, 3 -Gal sugar to human serum effectively reduced cell killing, and the overproduction of alpha- 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase in BHK cells significantly increased inactivation by human serum. To interfere with this antibody-antigen reaction and develop cell lines particularly suitable for cell-based therapy, we either selected C 2 C 12 clones expressing low levels of Gal-alpha 1, 3 -Gal or high levels of alpha- 1, 2 -fucosyltransferase. These cells were found to be resistant to complement-mediated cytolysis. These strategies may, therefore, protect encapsulated <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> transplanted in the periphery or the central nervous system even in an unlikely event of a blood-brain barrier breakage and the post-transplantation development of an antibody response...|$|R

40|$|We have {{previously}} proven that the interspecies incompatibility of CD 47 {{is responsible for}} in vitro phagocytosis of <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> by host macrophages. Utilizing an in vivo model in the present study, we investigated whether genetically engineered expression of mouse CD 47 in rat insulinoma cells (INS- 1 E) could inhibit macrophage-mediated xenograft rejection. INS- 1 E cells transfected with the pRc/CMV-mouse CD 47 vector (mCD 47 -INS- 1 E) induced SIRPα-tyrosine phosphorylation in mouse macrophages in vitro, whereas cells transfected with the control vector (cont-INS- 1 E) did not. When these cells were injected into the peritoneal cavity of streptozotocin-induced diabetic Rag 2 (-/-) γ chain (-/-) mice, which lack T, B, and NK cells, the expression of mouse CD 47 on the INS- 1 E cells markedly reduced the susceptibility of these cells to phagocytosis by macrophages. Moreover, these mice became normoglycemic after receiving mCD 47 -INS- 1 E, whereas the mice that received cont-INS- 1 E failed to achieve normoglycemia. Furthermore, injection of an anti-mouse SIRPα blocking monoclonal antibody into the mouse recipients of mCD 47 -INS- 1 E cells prevented achievement of normoglycemia. These results demonstrate that interspecies incompatibility of CD 47 significantly contributes to in vivo rejection of <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> by macrophages. Thus, genetic induction of the expression of recipient CD 47 on <b>xenogeneic</b> donor <b>cells</b> could provide inhibitory signals to recipient macrophages via SIPRα; this constitutes a novel approach for preventing macrophage-mediated xenograft rejection...|$|R

40|$|We have {{previously}} proven that human macrophages can phagocytose porcine cells {{even in the}} absence of Ab or complement opsonization, indicating that macrophages present a pivotal immunological obstacle to xenotransplantation. A recent report indicates that the signal regulatory protein (SIRP) α is a critical immune inhibitory receptor on macrophages, and its interaction with CD 47, a ligand for SIRPα, prevents autologous phagocytosis. Considering the limited compatibility (73 %) in amino acid sequences between pig and human CD 47, we hypothesized that the interspecies incompatibility of CD 47 may contribute to the rejection of <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> by macrophages. In the present study, we have demonstrated that porcine CD 47 does not induce SIRPα tyrosine phosphorylation in human macrophage-like cell line, and soluble human CD 47 -Fc fusion protein inhibits the phagocytic activity of human macrophages toward porcine cells. In addition, we have verified that manipulation of porcine cells for expression of human CD 47 radically reduces the susceptibility of the cells to phagocytosis by human macrophages. These results indicate that the interspecies incompatibility of CD 47 significantly contributes to the rejection of <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> by macrophages.

Here, we show that pig CD 47 does not interact with mouse SIPRα. Similar to CD 47 −/− mouse cells, porcine red blood cells (RBCs) failed to induce SIRPα tyrosine phosphorylation in mouse macrophages. Blocking SIRPα with antimouse SIRPα mAb (P 84) significantly enhanced the phagocytosis of CD 47 +/+ mouse cells, but did not affect the engulfment of porcine or CD 47 −/− mouse cells by mouse macrophages. CD 47 -deficient mice, whose macrophages do not phagocytose CD 47 −/− mouse cells, showed markedly delayed clearance of porcine RBCs compared with wild-type mouse recipients. Furthermore, mouse CD 47 expression on porcine cells markedly reduced their phagocytosis by mouse macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that interspecies incompatibility of CD 47 contributes significantly to phagocytosis of <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> by macrophages and suggest that genetic manipulation of donor CD 47 to improve its interaction with the recipient SIRPα may provide a novel approach to prevent phagocyte-mediated xenograft rejection...|$|R

The immunoresponse to allogeneic human synovial-derived mesenchymal stromal cells alone or transduced with adenoviral green fluorescent protein (hSD-MSC or hSD-MSC/GFP) or the immunoresponse to xenogeneic equine mesenchymal stromal cells (eqMSC) or equine dermal fibroblasts (eqDFb), characterized by the proportion of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + human splenocytes (hSpl), was measured on Day 0 and Day 6 of co-culture by flow cytometry. In culture with hSD-MSC, hSD-MSC/GFP, eqDFb, or eqMSC, the proportion of CD 3 + and CD 8 + hSpl increased with time in culture but not with exposure to cell allo- or xeno-antigens. Both hSD-MSC and hSD-MSC/GFP increased in number during culture and were not affected in viability or proliferation by co-culture with allogeneic hSpl.
