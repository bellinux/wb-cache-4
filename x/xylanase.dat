In addition, we examined the specific activity of all the <b>xylanases</b> against xylan and found that XylC has much higher specific activity than the other <b>xylanases</b> (Table  3). XylC exhibited between 4.5 to 90 -fold higher activity at pH  5.5 than the other <b>xylanases,</b> and twofold higher activity at its optimum pH (pH  4.0) than at pH  5.5. These results clearly show that XylC plays the important role as a glycoside hydrolase 11 (GH 11) of all the <b>xylanases</b> in A. cellulolyticus.

40|$|The {{structure}} of xylan, {{which has a}} 1, 4 -linked beta-xylose backbone with various substituents, is much more heterogeneous and complex than that of cellulose. Because of this, complete degradation of xylan needs {{a large number of}} enzymes that includes GH 10, GH 11, and GH 3 family <b>xylanases</b> together with auxiliary enzymes. Fluorescence-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) is able to accurately differentiate unsubstituted and substituted xylooligosaccharides (XOS) in the heterogeneous products generated by different <b>xylanases</b> and allows changes in concentrations of specific XOS to be analyzed quantitatively. Based on a quantitative analysis of XOS profiles over time using FACE, we have demonstrated that GH 10 and GH 11 family <b>xylanases</b> immediately degrade xylan into sizeable XOS, which are converted into smaller XOS in a much lower speed. The shortest substituted XOS produced by hydrolysis of the substituted xylan backbone by GH 10 and GH 11 family <b>xylanases</b> were MeGlcA(2) Xyl(3) and MeGlcA(2) Xyl(4), respectively. The unsubstituted xylan backbone was degraded into xylose, xylobiose, and xylotriose by both GH 10 and GH 11 family xylanases; the product profiles are not family-specific but, instead, depend on different subsite binding affinities in the active sites of individual enzymes. Synergystic action between <b>xylanases</b> and beta-xylosidase degraded MeGlcA(2) Xyl(4) into xylose and MeGlcA(2) Xyl(3) but further degradation of MeGlcA(2) Xyl(3) required additional enzymes.

50|$|B. ovatus {{has been}} used in animal studies as a mode of {{microbial}} drug delivery due to its <b>xylanase</b> operon. Operons exist in bacteria to control gene expression and are composed of a DNA sequence containing an operator followed by the genes of interest. The operator in the <b>xylanase</b> operon prevents transcription of genes when bound to a repressor protein. The B. ovatus <b>xylanase</b> operon only functions {{in the presence of the}} starch, xylan, which removes the repressor and enables production of whichever proteins correlate with the genes located after the operator. For microbial drug delivery, the genes after the operator include those inserted as part of the genetic modification. Xylan is non-digestible to human gastric acid or digestive enzymes, so a predictable quantity of dietary xylan will reach the recombinant B. ovatus in the gut, hypothetically allowing for a precise quantity of drug to be produced by the recombinant B. ovatus. In mice, recombinant B. ovatus strains containing genes for growth factors TGF-β and KGF-2 within the <b>xylanase</b> operon have successfully treated ulcerative colitis (UC). The secreted drugs from B. ovatus are applied topically to the epithelial lining, affecting local tissues rather than acting systemically. Systemic administration of these growth factors could otherwise cause tumors and increased vascularization of tissues. When administered microbially, TGF-β and KGF-2 facilitate tissue repair only in the colon where they are released.|$|E

40|$|Why study cellulases and <b>xylanases?</b> Although {{this review}} focusses {{primarily}} on bacterial cellulases and <b>xylanases,</b> {{there is considerable}} overlap in the molecular biology and biochemistry of prokaryotic and fungal forms of these enzymes. Therefore, fungal plant cell wall hydrolases are discussed where comparisons with the corresponding bacterial enzymes are important. Cellulases and <b>xylanases</b> encompass a collection of enzymes whose primary function is to hydrolyse p- 1, 4 -glycosidic linkages in the major plant structural polysaccharides, cellulose and xylan. In converting cellulose and xylan to their constituent sugars, these enzymes play {{an essential role in}} the digestive processes of herbivores and in the recycling of photosynthetically fixed carbon. The past decade has seen a burgeoning interest in all aspects of the biochemistry and molecular biology of cellulases and <b>xylanases,</b> which at first glance is rather perplexing. As a paradigm for p- 1, 4 glycanases, lysozyme is the enzyme of choice; it has been studied in greater detail than cellulases or <b>xylanases</b> and has a clearly understood catalytic mechanism. The recent discoveries from analysis of gene sequences and the three-dimensional structure of cellulase proteins show, however, that there is much to be understood about the enzymic hydrolysis of plant carbohydrate polymers beyond what can be adduced from analogy with lysozyme. To really appreciate the rationale behind current studies of microbial cellulases and <b>xylanases,</b> it is necessary to take a broad view that takes into account not just their intrinsic interest, but also their undoubted commercial potential.

30|$|<b>Xylanases</b> {{have been}} used in many {{industrial}} processes as the additives {{to improve the quality of}} baked goods and animal feeds as well as to bleach kraft pulp. In biomass conversion, <b>xylanases</b> also play a crucial role to synergistically deconstruct lignocellulose with cellulases and release soluble sugars from polysaccharide of xylan (Inoue et al. 2015). Besides the pre-treatment of biomass and the design of efficient enzyme cocktails, the whole industrial process also need high thermostable enzymes, which have many benefits of increased specific activity, stability, prevention of growth of contaminants, and increased mass transfer rate due to lower fluid viscosity at high substrate concentrations at high temperature, to save the cost (Kubicek and Kubicek 2016). To this end, the searching of high thermostable <b>xylanases</b> is valuable.|$|R
30|$|Lignocellulosic biomass can be {{converted}} into biofuel or bio-based materials (Deutschmann and Dekker [2012]; Kumar et al. [2008]) but must {{be converted}} into fermentable sugars by saccharification. Xylan {{is one of the}} major structural components of plant cell walls and is the second most abundant renewable biomass resource (York and O’Neill [2008]). Xylan consists of a backbone of β- 1, 4 -D-xylan with short side chains of O-acetyl, β-L-arabinofuranosyl, D-α-glucuronic acid and phenolic acid (Coughlan and Hazlewood [1993]). <b>Xylanases</b> (endo- 1, 4 -β-xylanases; EC 3.2. 1.8) catalyze the hydrolysis of the β- 1, 4 bonds of xylan and thus are important enzymes for the degradation of hemicellulosic polysaccharides (Collins et al. [2005]; Prade [1996]). Based on their amino acid sequence similarities, <b>xylanases</b> are mainly classified into families 10 and 11 of the glycoside hydrolases (GH; [URL] (Coutinho and Henrissat [1999]). GH 10 <b>xylanases</b> generally have a molecular weight ≥ 30  kDa and a low pI, while GH 11 <b>xylanases</b> are generally smaller (approximately 20  kDa) and have a high pI (Beaugrand et al. [2004]). The crystal structures of <b>xylanases</b> show that GH 10 enzymes fold into a (β/α) 8 -barrel (Dimarogona et al. [2012]; Harris et al. [1994]; Lo Leggio et al. [1999]), whereas family 11 enzymes have a β-jellyroll structure (Paës et al. [2012]; Sidhu et al. [1999]). Cellulose and xylan are closely linked together in plant cell walls (Carpita and Gibeaut [1993]). Thus, cellulases and hemicellulases work coordinately in the enzymatic degradation of these polysaccharides.|$|R
