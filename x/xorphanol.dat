50|$|<b>Xorphanol</b> (INN) (developmental {{code name}} TR-5379 or TR-5379M), {{also known as}} <b>xorphanol</b> mesylate (USAN), is an opioid {{analgesic}} of the morphinan family that was never marketed. It is a mixed agonist-antagonist of opioid receptors, acting preferentially as a high-efficacy partial agonist/near-full agonist of the κ-opioid receptor (Ki = 0.4 nM; EC50 = 3.3 nM; Emax = 84%) {{and to a lesser}} extent as a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor with lower relative intrinsic activity and marked antagonistic potential (including the ability to antagonize morphine-induced effects and induce opioid withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals). The drug has also been found to act as a weak partial agonist of the δ-opioid receptor (IC50 = 8 nM; Imax = 76%).|$|E
5000|$|Ketorfanol (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} SBW-22), or ketorphanol, is an opioid {{analgesic}} of the morphinan family {{that was found}} to possess [...] "potent antiwrithing activity" [...] in animal assays but was never marketed. It is a 17-cycloalkylmethyl derivative of morphinan and as such, is closely related structurally to butorphanol, cyclorphan, oxilorphan, proxorphan, and <b>xorphanol,</b> which act preferentially as κ-opioid receptor agonists {{and to a lesser}} extent as μ-opioid receptor partial agonists/antagonists.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xorphanol</b> {{produces}} potent analgesia, and {{was originally}} claimed {{to possess a}} minimal potential for dependence or abuse. Moreover, side effects in animal studies were relatively mild, with only sedation and nausea being prominent, although it also produced convulsions at the highest dose tested. However, human trials revealed additional side effects such as headaches and euphoria, {{and this was the}} subject of a lawsuit between the drug's inventors and the company to which they had licensed the marketing rights, which claimed that these side effects had not been revealed to them during the license negotiations. As a result of this dispute, the drug was never marketed commercially.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{describe}} the activity of a set of opioid drugs, including partial agonists, in a cell system expressing only mu opioid receptors. Receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (cAMP) production. Efficacies and potencies of these ligands were determined relative to the endogenous ligand β-endorphin and the common mu agonist, morphine. Results Among the ligands studied naltrexone, WIN 44, 441 and SKF 10047, were classified as antagonists, while the remaining ligands were agonists. Agonist efficacy was assessed by determining the extent of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. The rank order of efficacy of the agonists was fentanyl = hydromorphone = β-endorphin > etorphine = lofentanil = butorphanol = morphine = nalbuphine = nalorphine > cyclazocine = dezocine = metazocine ≥ <b>xorphanol.</b> The rank order of potency of these ligands was different from that of their efficacies; etorphine > hydromorphone > dezocine > <b>xorphanol</b> = nalorphine = butorphanol = lofentanil > metazocine > nalbuphine > cyclazocine > fentanyl > morphine >>>> β-endorphin. Conclusion These results elucidate the relative activities of a set of opioid ligands at mu opioid receptor and can serve as the initial step in a systematic study leading to understanding of the mode of action of opioid ligands at this receptor. Furthermore, these results can assist in understanding the physiological effect of many opioid ligands acting through mu opioid receptors. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the activation profiles of 15 opioid ligands in transfected human embryonic kidney cells expressing only δ opioid receptors. Activation profiles of most of these ligands at δ opioid receptors had not been previously characterized in vitro. Receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. Results Naltrexone and nalorphine were classified as antagonists at δ opioid receptor. The other ligands studied were agonists at δ opioid receptors and demonstrated IC 50 values of 0. 1 nM to 2 μM, maximal inhibition of 39 – 77 % and receptor binding affinities of 0. 5 to 243 nM. The rank order of efficacy of the ligands tested was metazocine = <b>xorphanol</b> ≥ fentanyl = SKF 10047 = etorphine = hydromorphone = butorphanol = lofentanil > WIN 44, 441 = Nalbuphine = cyclazocine ≥ met-enkephalin >> morphine = dezocine. For the first time these data describe and compare the function and relative efficacy of several ligands at δ opioid receptors. Conclusions The data produced from this study can lead to elucidation of the complete activation profiles of several opioid ligands, leading to clarification of the mechanisms involved in physiological effects of these ligands at δ opioid receptors. Furthermore, these data can be used as a basis for novel use of existing opioid ligands based on their pharmacology at δ opioid receptors. </p...|$|E
