40|$|M. Tech. There is varied X-ray {{equipment}} in the hospitals where radiology services are being provided {{by the government of}} Malawi. Well maintained and optimally functioning X-ray equipment is essential in providing diagnostic assistance to referring clinicians. Equipment needs to be carefully looked after by the users to avoid unnecessary breakdowns because installation and maintenance is very expensive. Imaging departments need to be well run and efficiently utilised in order to minimise radiation hazards and to be cost effective. One important element of taking care of equipment is to conduct Quality Assurance (QA) Programmes and Quality Control (QC) measures. QA and QC activities are essential if X-ray equipment is to operate optimally at all times. X-ray {{equipment in}} Malawi is not subjected to any QA or QC measures as stipulated by the World Health Organization (WHO) standards and this leads to frequent breakdown of equipment. This prompted the researcher to conduct a study to investigate the status of X-ray equipment QA and QC measures in Malawi. The aim {{of the study was to}} establish the status of QA and QC measures in diagnostic <b>X-ray</b> <b>departments</b> in government hospitals of Malawi and establish a baseline from which recommendations could be made to facilitate the development of QA and QC programmes in Malawi. A quantitative design that included an exploratory and descriptive approach was used to collect data. All four central hospitals were selected using a census sampling method and ten district hospitals were selected using cluster sampling method across the country. Questionnaires were used to collect information on QA programmes for hospitals and <b>X-ray</b> <b>departments.</b> Records were checked retrospectively in the hospitals and <b>X-ray</b> <b>departments</b> for the availability of formal QA programmes if any. QC tests were also conducted on the X-ray equipment and imaging accessories...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: Protocols {{provide a}} {{baseline}} for audit opportunity {{as well as}} evidence for clinical governance, since the use of protocols ensure compliance with documented scope of professional practice. Objectives: We determined the existence and variations of radiographic protocols for radiographic examinations of axial and appendicular skeleton in <b>X-ray</b> <b>departments</b> within the Accra Metropolis and also to establish whether there were variations in the projections taken among the departments for these examinations. Methods: A questionnaire containing mostly open ended question, {{was given to the}} radiographers who were in-charge of the departments and those in charge of the various clinical rooms of the selected hospitals and polyclinics to complete. Codes were assigned each of the departments, the examinations and the sets of projections indicated for the examinations. The data gathered was analyzed using SPSS version 16 software and presented in tabular and graphical forms. Results: In all eight <b>X-ray</b> <b>departments</b> were studied. Majority (80 %) of the respondents indicated having protocols. All respondents agreed to the technical fact that examination protocols must be written and documented and copies made available in all clinical rooms.

40|$|Abstract: The dose of {{radiation}} emitted by an X-ray source and delivered on a target depends on the source tube peak potential (kVp), the current time (mAs) and the source to film distance (FFD). There could be an harmful health effect on the patient if these exposure technique factors are not appropriately selected by the operators of these sources. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study is to survey the choice of these technique factors in <b>X-ray</b> <b>departments</b> in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, while undertaking some common diagnostic X-ray examinations. The common and mostly requested examinations considered were, Chest (PA), Skull (AP), Pelvis (AP) and Abdomen (AP). A total of 48 personnel, 952 adult volunteers in <b>X-ray</b> <b>departments</b> in nine Hospitals took part in the survey. The adults were age between 20 - 75 yrs and body weight 70 ± 13 kg. Variations in the technique factors selected for the different examination were observed when compared with the values in CEC guidelines on quality criteria. The mean tube potential of 125 kVp selected for chest examination in this study is low compared to 180 kVp in the CEC. The mean mAs varies while some departments employed constant mAs for all examination and all patients not taking into account the body thickness of the patient. In skull and pelvis examination, some departments used lower kVps while some selected tube potentials within the CEC range of 70 - 85 kVp and 75 - 90 kVp respectively the mean FFD (162. 0 cm) for chest i...|$|R

The advantage with this technique is a lower radiation dose compared to conventional CT. Common examples when DVT is used are; for diagnosing the position of impacted canines and suspected root resorption of the adjacent lateral incisor, preoperative planning of implant treatment and examination of periapical areas when intraoral radiography has given uncertain information. Conventional CT is used for examination of larger areas in diagnosing e. g. facial anomalies, extensive traumata and tumours...|$|R
