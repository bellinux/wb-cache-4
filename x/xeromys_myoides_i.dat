50|$|The {{false water-rat}} (<b>Xeromys</b> <b>myoides)</b> is {{a species of}} rodent native to {{waterways}} of Australia and Papua New Guinea.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{species in}} the reserve include the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), tiger quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), greater long-eared bat (Nyctophilus timoriensis), false water rat (<b>Xeromys</b> <b>myoides),</b> {{humpback}} whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and the dugong (Dugong dugon). Both the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) are flagship species in Australia, receiving {{a great deal of}} conservation attention from the public. In comparison, species like the greater long-eared bat (Nyctophilus timoriensis) and the false water-rat (<b>Xeromys</b> <b>myoides)</b> are unknown to most of the public, but are nationally vulnerable species, with current studies indicating both require the same level of conservation attention to prevent further decline in abundance and distribution. Even megafauna species dugong (Dugong dugon) numbers are also in steady decline, with extinction forecast for this vulnerable species within this century.|$|R
50|$|Myora Springs is {{a unique}} wetland site on the North West side of North Stradbroke Island, of {{particular}} cultural significance to the Quandamooka people as a sacred gathering site, and is also a declared fish habitat area. Myora Springs {{is known to be}} essential habitat for the vulnerable water mouse (<b>Xeromys</b> <b>myoides)</b> and the endangered Swamp Orchid (Phaius australis).|$|R
40|$|Aim Global {{sea-level rise}} (SLR) {{could be as}} much as 1. 8 metres by 2100, which will impact coastal wetland {{communities}} and threatened species. We evaluated the likely outcomes of SLR for wetland communities using a process-based simulation model and coupled this with a metapopulation model for a threatened native rodent (<b>Xeromys</b> <b>myoides).</b> Furthermore, we tested the amplified impacts of SLR, urban growth and introduced predators on X. myoides persistence...|$|R
50|$|Wetlands of {{national}} {{importance in the}} Noosa region, such as Lake Weyba and Noosa River Wetlands, are threatened by sea level rise, further flooding, and climate change. This directly affects and threatens the habitat of the false water-rat (<b>Xeromys</b> <b>myoides).</b> Fish species, such as the oxleyan pygmy perch (Nannoperca oxleyana) have had their abundance reduced in Noosa due to man-made stream contaminants, lack of stream flow, and introduced species.|$|R
5000|$|A {{conservation}} area {{is located on}} the southern bank of the river at its junction with Moreton Bay, bordering the Southern Moreton Bay Island National Park and the RAMSAR wetland site. [...] The Pimpama River wetlands has mangroves, saltmarshs and marine flats providing protected breeding grounds for marine species including four frog species and the vulnerable False Water Rat (<b>Xeromys</b> <b>myoides).</b> The wetlands are an important {{conservation area}} for a recorded 184 species of native plants, 134 vertebrate fauna species including 13 species of mammals, 108 species of birds and nine species of reptiles.|$|R
40|$|Identification {{of habitat}} {{variables}} {{that are associated}} with patch occupancy can provide a solid foundation for conservation, especially when habitats and landscapes are affected by human activities. As a case study to investigate the importance of landscape complementation and habitat quality for conservation, we examined the habitat preferences of a vulnerable native rodent, the false water rat (<b>Xeromys</b> <b>myoides</b> Thomas). In this study, results from surveys for animal presence and recording of habitat attributes in localities in south-east Queensland showed that X. myoides prefers a habitat with a wide mangrove zone of short mangroves and a high percentage of relatively tall vegetation cover in the sedge/saltmarsh zone. The absence of X. myoides from areas of likely habitat at a large scale can be attributed, at least in part, to the local habitat variables that overrode predictions based at a large scale. The findings suggest that availability of suitable habitat is a factor limiting the distribution and abundance of X. myoides. It is clear that landscape complementation influences patch occupancy and should be an essential consideration for conservation programs...|$|R
5000|$|The false {{water rat}} (<b>Xeromys</b> <b>myoides)</b> lives in Australia and Papua New Guinea. [...] Though {{originally}} believed to be restricted to Southeast Queensland and the Northern Territory, the {{false water rat}} has subsequently {{been found in the}} central and southern parts of Queensland, North Stradbroke Island off the coast of Southeast Queensland, Melville Island, and southwest Western Province, Papua New Guinea. [...] False water rats primarily live in mangrove communities and shallow areas surrounding lagoons, swamps, and lakes. [...] Their nests are made at the base of mangrove trees. Their nests are very similar to termite mounds. They are made of leaves, mud, and may be as high as 60 centimetres. There is usually one opening and on the inside it is a complex system of tunnels which connects to multiple chambers. Since the tunnels are very complex sometimes the homes can overlap. [...] This behaviour shows that they are social and very friendly.Because of their lack of webbed feet and their inability to swim, their nests are generally built near shallow water. [...] This allows them to wade in water instead of swimming and diving in search of their food.|$|R
50|$|German's one-toothed moss mouse (Pseudohydromys germani) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Muridae which occurs in the {{mountains}} of southeastern New Guinea. It has only one molar and only one incisor in each jaw quadrant for a total of eight teeth, less than any other rodents except for its close relative, the one-toothed moss-mouse (P. ellermani) and the recently described Paucidentomys, which lacks molars entirely. It is known from only one specimen, an adult male which was caught at an altitude of 1300 m in the village of Munimun, Milne Bay Province, southeastern Papua New Guinea in August 1992. P. germani was first described in 2005 by biologist Kristofer Helgen and named after Pavel German, who caught the specimen. It was first described in the genus Mayermys, but this genus, which only included the two one-molared species, has since been synonymised under Pseudohydromys because of the close morphological resemblances among Mayermys and the other species now placed in Pseudohydromys. As a member of the Xeromys division within the subfamily Murinae, P. germani is related to the false water rat (<b>Xeromys</b> <b>myoides)</b> of Australia and southern New Guinea and to the three species of Leptomys, another New Guinean genus, and more distantly to other New Guinean and Australian rodents, including the water rat.|$|R
40|$|The water mouse, <b>Xeromys</b> <b>myoides,</b> is {{currently}} recognised as a vulnerable species in Australia, inhabiting {{a small number}} of distinct and isolated coastal regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory. An examination of the evolutionary history and contemporary influences shaping the genetic structure of this species is required to make informed conservation management decisions. Here, we report the first analysis undertaken on the phylogeography and population genetics of the water mouse across its mainland Australian distribution. Genetic diversity was assessed at two mitochondrial DNA (Cytochrome b, 1000 bp; D-loop, 400 bp) and eight microsatellite DNA loci. Very low genetic diversity was found, indicating that water mice underwent a recent expansion throughout their Australian range and constitute a single evolutionarily significant unit. Microsatellite analyses revealed that the highest genetic diversity was found in the Mackay region of central Queensland; population substructure was also identified, suggesting that local populations may be isolated in this region. Conversely, genetic diversity in the Coomera region of south-east Queensland was very low and the population in this region has experienced a significant genetic bottleneck. These results have significant implications for future management, particularly in terms of augmenting populations through translocations or reintroducing water mice in areas where they have gone extinct...|$|R
