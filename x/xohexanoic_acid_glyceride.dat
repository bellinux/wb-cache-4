In this paper, the {{relative}} change rates of content of conjugated fatty <b>acid</b> <b>glycerides,</b> content of tans-fatty <b>acid</b> <b>glycerides,</b> unsaturation and linear long-chain fatty <b>acid</b> <b>glycerides</b> were explored after being at high temperature {{for several hours}} by using FTIR-ATR. The results hints: 1. Starting from 160 ℃, the contents of conjugated fatty <b>acids</b> <b>glycerides</b> and trans-fatty <b>acid</b> glycerids in the vegetable oils increase but unsaturation and content of linear long-chain fatty <b>acid</b> <b>glycerides</b> decreases with heating temperature and heating time increasing; 2.

The content of linoleic acid in the vegetable oil has some contributions to the change amplitude of contents of conjugated fatty <b>acid</b> <b>glycerides,</b> {{and the content of}} oleic acid in the vegetable oil has some contributions to the change amplitude of content of trans-fatty <b>acid</b> <b>glycerides.</b> Because refined “waste oil ” experiences a longer history at temperature higher than 200 ℃ compared to the vegetable oil, four index value and its variation can be used as specific indicators for it...|$|R

A significant increase in the polymer fluorescence and blue shift in its emission are observed on association with the surfactant. This is suggested to be due to breakup of polymer aggregates. In addition, the spectroscopic and photophysical data suggest this is followed by the vesicle to ribbon transition characteristic of this surfactant, leading to incorporation of single chains of the polymer within mixed polymer−surfactant aggregates.

It is a medicinal plant, native of southern Europe and western Mediterranean region and is cultivated worldwide [1]. India is the largest producer of coriander in the world. Major production centers are Rajasthan, Maharastra, Gujarat, and Karnataka [2]. The whole plant and especially the unripe fruits are characterized by a strong disagreeable odor, hence the name coriander, giving characteristic aroma when rubbed [3]. The most important constituents of coriander seeds are the essential oil and the fatty oil.

From the amount of glucose taken up, the production of lactate and pyruvate, and the incorporation of 14 C from differently labelled [14 C]glucose into CO 2, fatty <b>acids</b> and <b>glyceride</b> glycerol, the rates of glucose metabolism via different pathways {{and the extent of}} lipogenesis under various experimental conditions were determined. The contribution of the pentose phosphate-cycle to glucose metabolism under normal conditions was calculated to be 8 %. Starvation and re-feeding, and the presence of insulin, caused an enhancement of glucose uptake, pentose phosphate-cycle activity and fatty acid synthesis. Plots of both pentose phosphate-cycle activity and fatty acid synthesis versus glucose uptake revealed that the extent of glucose uptake, over a wide range, determines the rates of fatty acid synthesis and glucose metabolism via the pentose phosphate cycle. A balance of formation and production of nicotinamide nucleotides in the cytoplasm was established. The total amount of cytoplasmic NADH and NADPH formed was only in slight excess over the hydrogen equivalents required for the synthesis of fatty <b>acids,</b> <b>glyceride</b> glycerol and lactate. Except in cells from starved animals, the pentose phosphate cycle was found to provide only about 60 % of the NADPH required for fatty acid synthesis.

30|$|The {{saponification}} {{value of the}} essential oil was 188  mg KOH/g. Saponification value is {{an indicator of the}} average molecular weight and hence chain length. It is inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the oil (Onwuka 2005). High {{saponification value}}s of oils are due to the predominantly high proportion of shorter carbon chain lengths of fatty acids (Gohari et al. 2011). Low molecular weight (short to medium chain) fatty <b>acids</b> have more <b>glyceride</b> molecules per gram of fat than high molecular weight <b>acids.</b> Each <b>glyceride</b> molecule requires three KOH molecules for saponification; hence, the more the glyceride molecules, the greater the saponification value (Kirk and Sawyer 1991). Nagre et al. (2011) established that saponification value in combination with the acid value gives information on the quantity, type of glycerides, and mean weights of the acids in a given sample. Saponification value is of interest if the oil is for industrial purposes, as it has no nutritional significance (Dari 2009). The larger the saponification number, the better the soap making ability of the oil (Asiedu 1989).|$|R
40|$|High {{rates of}} light-dependent fatty acid {{synthesis}} from acetate were measured in isolated chloroplasts that were permeabilized to varying extents by resuspension in hypotonic reaction medium. The reactions in hypotonic medium unsupplemented with cofactors were linear {{with time and}} were directly proportional to chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the enzymes and cofactors of fatty acid synthesis remained tightly integrated and thylakoid associated within disrupted chloroplasts. Permeabilized chloroplasts expanded to at least twice the volume of intact chloroplasts, lost about 50 % of their stromal proteins in the medium, and metabolized exogenous nucleotides. However, neither acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) nor malonyl-CoA inhibited fatty acid synthesis from acetate; nor were [1 - 14 C]acetyl-CoA and [14 C]malonyl-CoA significantly incorporated into fatty acids. Fatty acid synthesis from acetate was independent of added cofactors but was totally light dependent. Changes in the products of fatty acid synthesis {{were consistent with the}} loss of endogenous glycerol- 3 -phosphate from permeabilized chloroplasts. However, in appropriately supplemented medium, the products of acetate incorporation by spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts were similar when reactions were carried out in either isotonic or hypotonic medium.

Polar head groups such as glycerol, inositol, and serine only slightly activated ATPase activity or not at all, while ethanolamine and choline had no effect. Activation was dependent {{on the degree of}} saturation or unsaturation of the fatty acyl chain and its length. The activity decreased with increase in the length of fatty acyl chain from dimyristoryl(14 : 0) -PC to distearoyl(18 : 0) -PC and the degree of unsaturation from dioleoyl(18 : 1) -PC to dilinolenoyl(18 : 3) -PC.

Derivatized fatty acids signals show improved resolution. The developed method was employed to study the degree of hydrolysis and oxidation of oil paint reconstructions.

In the case of R. arrhizus and R. japonicus there was a decrease in the extra-cellular activity when glucose was replaced by the different triglycerides, but the enzyme activity increased in the mycelia. In the case of R. oryzae both the extracelluar and the mycelial lipase activities increased to some extent. When grown in the presence of triglycerides instead of glucose. Tributyrin was not utilized well for the growth of these species yet the enzyme produced in the presence of glucose and other triglycerides hydrolysed it at the highest rate and the order of activity was followed by those against the glycerides of coconut oil, oleic acid and erucic acid in decreasing order. Oleic and erucic <b>acid</b> <b>glycerides</b> affected greater induction of lipase in all the Rhizopus species as compared to coconut oil. Oleic acid and erucic <b>acid</b> <b>glycerides</b> in general caused greater inhibition of the enzyme as well, as compared to the glycerides of coconut oil. The lipase produced in the presence of particular triglycerides neither show preferential activity against the same triglycerides nor the enzyme was inhibited preferentially by these. In case of the various Mucor species it was observed that when glucose was replaced by olive, coconut mustard oil in the growth medium there was increase in lipase activities both in the mycelia and the broth in all oases. Olive oil was found to cause greater lipase induction as compared to coconut and mustard oils. The enzyme produced by these species was not specifically active against the triglycerides in the presence of which it was produced. Irrespective of the triglycerides used as a carbon source the lipase produced hydrolysed coconut oil at a greater rate and this activity was followed by those against olive and mustard oils. Optimum pH at which maximum hydrolysis took place was determined to be 7. 0 when all these species were produced in the medium containing glucose as the corbon*****. When M. hiemalis was grown in the medium containing olive oil instead of glucose the optimum pH for lipase activity remained the same. M. hiemalis being the best producer of lipase among the various Mucor species was studied in detail. Initial pH Of the fermentation medium at which M. hiemalis produced maximum lipase was 4. o. Addition of Ca++ to the medium did not increase lipase production. Optimum pH for hydrolysis for both the mycelial and the extracellular lipases was found to be 7. 0. The fungus produced significant amount of lipase in the presence of glucose. However, the lipase activity increased markedly when olive oil was added to the medium at the beginning of fermentation. Addition of alive oil at a later stage did not induce the enzyme as much. Studies with washed mycelia showed that greater amount of lipase was released in the presence of olive oil. Olive oil and mustard oil products inhibited the lipase more than those of coconut oil the lipase induced by a particular type of triglycerides did not specifically hydrolyse the same triglyceride nor was it inhibited specifically. The mycelial growth, extracellu 1 ar and cell-bound lipase production and lipid formation within the cells of M. hiemalis were observed to be associated with glucose utilization. Most of the glucose was used {{towards the end of the}} growth phase when the mycelia showed maximal lipase activity (17 U/g dry mycelia) as well as maximal lipid content (13. 4 mg/g dry mycelia). Maximal broth lipase activity (76 U/ 100 ml) was observed after the cell lysis had started. The fractions identified in the mycelial lipid extracts were sterol esters, triglycerides, fatty acids, diglycerides, sterols, monoglycerides, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl serine and an unknown polar lipid. The proportion between the neutral and the polar lipids was only 0. 06 at 44 hours, increasing gradually to 1. 51 at 164 hours of fermentation. Effect of adding triglycerides on the growth of Mucor hiemalis and production of lipase and the mycelial lipids was studied as well. A concentration of 1...|$|R
40|$|Indonesia is {{the second}} big CPO {{producer}} after Malaysia. The CPO production of Indonesia gradually increases and reaches 8. 2 million tones. About two third of {{it is used to}} meet the domestic demand and the other is exported in crude.   The value of it is low. If it is exported in crude, Indonesia will receive little income. Therefore, it must be converted into the other product, which has the high value. The main component of it is glyceride composed of glycerol and fatty <b>acid.</b> The <b>glyceride</b> can be converted into polyol (polyalcohol) which is the material in manufacturing polyurethane, cosmetic, lubricant etc. The process of converting of CPO into polyol is called the hydroxylation. This research aims to study the hydroxylation process of CPO into polyol and to optimize the variable which really affects the hydroxyl number of product. Based on the experiment, the optimum condition of hydroxylation of  CPO with the hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and the formic acid (HCOOH) into polyol is got as follows: temperature 50 o C, composition of reactant 40 %, and time 2 hours. The Polyol produced has the hydroxyl number 148.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Cheeses {{manufactured}} in certi"ed dairies in the Portuguese region of Serra da Estrela, using refrigerated and non-refrigerated raw sheep milk, were quantitatively evaluated {{in terms of}} indigenous micro#ora and volatile compounds during a ripening period of up to 6 mo. Viable counts were obtained for lactococci, lactobacilli, leuconostoc, enterococci, yeasts, Enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci; analyses of volatiles were performed by chromatography after solid-phase micro-extraction. Treatment of all analytical data produced by principal component analysis revealed correlations between the major microbial groups present in cheese and patterns of volatiles generated. End products resulting from the degradation of sugars, free amino <b>acids</b> and <b>glycerides</b> constituted the predominant volatiles of Serra da Estrela cheeses. Among volatile, short-chain carboxylic acids detected were acetic, propionic, iso-butyric and iso-valeric acids; these compounds {{are known to be}} breakdown products of Gly, Ala and Ser, of Thr, of Val, and of Ile, respectively, following oxidative deamination. Semi-volatile fatty acids and their corresponding ethyl esters appeared in the cheese, probably {{as a result of the}} activity of lipases produced by yeasts and Enterobacteriaceae. These ethyl esters, which are responsible for fruity #avours, were especially pronounced in cheeses manufactured from refrigerated milk...|$|R
