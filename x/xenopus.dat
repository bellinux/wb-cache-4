5|$|Because <b>Xenopus</b> {{are sold}} in pet shops and used in {{laboratories}} around the world, {{it is possible that}} the chytrid fungus may have been exported from Africa.|$|E
5|$|Troponin I, slow {{skeletal}} muscle is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNNI1 gene. An isoform switch from ssTnI to cTnI occurs during perinatal heart development. ssTnI is not {{expressed in the}} embryonic hearts of <b>Xenopus</b> and zebrafish, while it is expressed in the somites and {{skeletal muscle}}s.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (<b>Xenopus</b> laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous. The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{have served}} as {{experimental}} animals {{throughout the history of}} science. Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog's heart in a procedure called a Stannius ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates. The African clawed frog or platanna (<b>Xenopus</b> laevis) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.|$|E
25|$|Within a <b>Xenopus</b> nucleus-free system, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that Cdc45 {{is required for the}} unwinding of plasmid DNA. The <b>Xenopus</b> nucleus-free system also demonstrates that DNA unwinding and tight RPA binding to chromatin occurs only in the presence of Cdc45.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} the {{transition}} from a calcium-dependent action potential to a sodium-dependent action potential to proceed new channels must be added to the membrane. If <b>Xenopus</b> neurons are grown in an environment with RNA synthesis or protein synthesis inhibitors that transition is prevented. Even the electrical activity of the cell itself {{may play a role in}} channel expression. If action potentials in <b>Xenopus</b> myocytes are blocked the typical increase in sodium and potassium current density is prevented or delayed.|$|E

25|$|KCNE3 also {{interacts with}} hERG, and when co-expressed in <b>Xenopus</b> laevis oocytes KCNE3 {{inhibits}} hERG activity {{by an unknown}} mechanism. It is not known whether hERG-KCNE3 complexes occur in vivo.|$|E
25|$|Grafting {{experiments}} done in <b>Xenopus</b> {{and chicken}} embryos show the neural plate's capability to induce {{other regions of}} cells, including the pre-placodal region, a group of ectodermal cells essential to the function of sensory organs.|$|E
25|$|This {{maturation}} {{of electrical}} properties is seen across species. <b>Xenopus</b> sodium and potassium currents increase drastically after a neuron goes through its {{final phase of}} mitosis. The sodium current density of rat cortical neurons increases by 600% within the first two postnatal weeks.|$|E
25|$|Beta-catenin {{has also}} been implicated in {{regulation}} of cell fates through asymmetric cell division in the model organism C. elegans. Similarly to the <b>Xenopus</b> oocytes, this is essentially the result of non-equal distribution of Dsh, Frizzled, axin and APC in the cytoplasm of the mother cell.|$|E
25|$|During embryo {{development}} in mice, Cyr61 is highly {{expressed in the}} cardiovascular, skeletal, and neuronal systems. Cyr61 knockout mice are embryonic lethal due to defects in cardiac septal morphogenesis, deficient blood vessel formation in placenta, and compromised vascular integrity. In <b>Xenopus</b> laevis, Cyr61 is required for normal gastrulation and modulation of Wnt signaling.|$|E
25|$|Amphibian frog <b>Xenopus</b> laevis {{serves as}} an ideal model system {{for the study of}} the {{mechanisms}} of apoptosis. In fact, iodine and thyroxine also stimulate the spectacular apoptosis of the cells of the larval gills, tail and fins in amphibians metamorphosis, and stimulate the evolution of their nervous system transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial, carnivorous frog.|$|E
25|$|The Ndc80 {{complex is}} highly conserved {{and it has}} been {{identified}} in S. pombe, C. elegans, <b>Xenopus,</b> chicken and humans. Studies on Hec1 (highly expressed in cancer cells 1), the human homolog of Ndc80p, show that it is important for correct chromosome congression and mitotic progression, and that it interacts with components of the cohesin and condensin complexes.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear actin exists {{mainly as}} a monomer, {{but can also}} form dynamic {{oligomers}} and short polymers. Nuclear actin organization varies in different cell types. For example, in <b>Xenopus</b> oocytes (with higher nuclear actin level in comparison to somatic cells) actin forms filaments, which stabilize nucleus architecture. These filaments can be observed under the microscope thanks to fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin staining.|$|E
25|$|Atomoxetine also {{reversibly}} inhibits GIRK {{currents in}} <b>Xenopus</b> oocytes in a concentration-dependent, voltage-independent, and time-independent manner. Kir3.1/3.2 ion channels are opened downstream of M2, α2, D2, and A1 stimulation, {{as well as}} other Gi-coupled receptors. Therapeutic concentrations of atomoxetine are within range of interacting with GIRKs, especially in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. It is not known whether this contributes to the therapeutic effects of atomoxetine in ADHD.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{synthesis}} in evo-devo {{has been in}} the field of animal evolution, one reason being the presence of elegant model systems like Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, zebrafish and <b>Xenopus</b> laevis. However, {{in the past couple of}} decades, a wealth of information on plant morphology, coupled with modern molecular techniques has helped shed light on the conserved and unique developmental patterns in the plant kingdom also.|$|E
25|$|Both chordin and noggin are antagonists of BMPs. They bind BMPs {{preventing}} the binding of the ligand to the receptor. It {{has been demonstrated}} that Chordin and Noggin dorsalize mesoderm. They are both found in the dorsal lip of <b>Xenopus</b> and convert otherwise epidermis specified tissue into neural tissue (see neurulation). Noggin {{plays a key role}} in cartilage and bone patterning. Mice Noggin-/- have excess cartilage and lacked joint formation.|$|E
25|$|Kv12.2 {{channels}} {{were found}} to be inhibited by endogenous KCNE3 (and KCNE1) subunits in <b>Xenopus</b> laevis oocytes. Thus, silencing of endogenous KCNE3 or KCNE1 using siRNA increases the macroscopic current of exogenously expressed Kv12.2. Kv12.2 forms a tripartite complex with KCNE1 and KCNE3 in oocytes, and may do so in mouse brain. Previously, endogenous oocyte KCNE3 and KCNE1 were also found to inhibit exogenous hERG activity and slow the gating of exogenous Kv2.1.|$|E
25|$|Since anurans {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} to motion, females use conspicuous movements to communicate interest. A female frog may also send vocal signals {{of her own}} to males, motivating copulation and competitive behaviors. Female Iberian midwife toads (Alytes cisternasii) use courtship calls to distinguish themselves from other male competitors. The African common platanna (<b>Xenopus</b> laevis) uses duet calling when males are not visible, allowing females to distinguish territorial males from satellite males. The Emei music frog (Babina daunchina) female calling stimulates male movement towards sound or phonotaxis.|$|E
25|$|Most aquatic and {{semi-aquatic}} amphibians have a membranous skin {{which allows}} them to absorb water directly through it. Some semi-aquatic animals also have similarly permeable bladder membrane. As as result, {{they tend to have}} high rates of urine production to offset this high water intake, and have urine which is low in dissolved salts. The urinary bladder assists such animals to retain salts. Some aquatic amphibian such as <b>Xenopus</b> do not reabsorb water, to prevent excessive water influx. For land-dwelling amphibians, dehydration results in reduced urine output.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear actin {{was first}} noticed and {{described}} in 1977 by Clark and Merriam. Authors describe a protein {{present in the}} nuclear fraction, obtained from <b>Xenopus</b> laevis oocytes, which shows the same features such skeletal muscle actin. Since that time {{there have been many}} scientific reports about the structure and functions of actin in the nucleus (for review see: Hofmann 2009.) The controlled level of actin in the nucleus, its interaction with actin-binding proteins (ABP) and the presence of different isoforms allows actin {{to play an important role}} in many important nuclear processes.|$|E
25|$|Anurans {{can only}} {{regenerate}} their limbs during embryonic development. Once the limb skeleton has developed regeneration {{does not occur}} (<b>Xenopus</b> can grow a cartilaginous spike after amputation). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) appear to be required for a regeneration response in the anuran larvae. ROS production is essential to activate the Wnt signaling pathway, which {{has been associated with}} regeneration in other systems. Limb regeneration in salamanders occurs in two major steps. First, adult cells de-differentiate into progenitor cells which will replace the tissues they are derived from. Second, these progenitor cells then proliferate and differentiate until they have completely replaced the missing structure.|$|E
25|$|At {{the onset}} of S phase, the pre-replicative complex must be {{activated}} by two S phase-specific kinases in order to form an initiation complex at an origin of replication. One kinase is the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase called Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) {{and the other is}} cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). Chromatin-binding assays of Cdc45 in yeast and <b>Xenopus</b> have shown that a downstream event of CDK action is loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin. Cdc6 has been speculated to be a target of CDK action, because of the association between Cdc6 and CDK, and the CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6. The CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6 has been considered to be required for entry into the S phase.|$|E
25|$|In fission yeast and <b>Xenopus,</b> {{chromatin}} {{licensing and}} DNA replication factor 1 (Cdt1) protein {{is required for}} the licensing of chromatin for DNA replication. Cdt1 is essential for DNA replication and performs its role during the formation of the pre-replicative complex by loading the minichromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm) onto the chromosome. Cdt1 has been shown to associate with the C terminus of Cdc6 to cooperatively promote the association of Mcm proteins to the chromatin. Cdt1 activity during the cell cycle is tightly regulated by its association with the protein geminin, which both inhibits Cdt1 activity during S phase in order to prevent re-replication of DNA and prevents it from ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} {{development}} of many organisms, the action potential is actually initially carried by calcium current rather than sodium current. The {{opening and closing}} kinetics of calcium channels during development are slower {{than those of the}} voltage-gated sodium channels that will carry the action potential in the mature neurons. The longer opening times for the calcium channels can lead to action potentials that are considerably slower than those of mature neurons. <b>Xenopus</b> neurons initially have action potentials that take 60–90 ms. During development, this time decreases to 1 ms. There are two reasons for this drastic decrease. First, the inward current becomes primarily carried by sodium channels. Second, the delayed rectifier, a potassium channel current, increases to 3.5 times its initial strength.|$|E
25|$|After {{fusion of}} the neural fold {{to create the}} neural tube, cells {{originally}} located in the neural plate border become neural crest cells. For migration to begin, neural crest cells must undergo a process called delamination that involves a full or partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Delamination {{is defined as the}} separation of tissue into different populations, in this case neural crest cells separating from the surrounding tissue. Conversely, EMT is a series of events coordinating a change from an epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype. For example, delamination in chick embryos is triggered by a BMP/Wnt cascade that induces the expression of EMT promoting transcription factors such as SNAI2 and FoxD3. Although all neural crest cells undergo EMT, the timing of delamination occurs at different stages in different organisms: in <b>Xenopus</b> laevis embryos there is a massive delamination that occurs when the neural plate is not entirely fused, whereas delamination in the chick embryo occurs during fusion of the neural fold.|$|E
25|$|Because pairing between {{homoeologous}} chromosomes {{is rare in}} established allopolyploids, {{they may}} benefit from fixed heterozygosity of homoeologous alleles. In certain cases, such heterozygosity can have beneficial heterotic effects, either in terms of fitness in natural contexts or desirable traits in agricultural contexts. This could partially explain the prevalence of allopolyploidy among crop species. Both bread wheat and Triticale are examples of an allopolyploids with six chromosome sets. Cotton is an allotetraploid with multiple origins. In Brassicaceous crops, the Triangle of U describes {{the relationships between the}} three common diploid Brassicas (B. oleracea, B. rapa, and B. nigra) and three allotetraploids (B. napus, B. juncea, and B. carinata) derived from hybridization among the diploid species. A similar relationship exists between three diploid species of Tragopogon (T. dubius, T. pratensis, and T. porrifolius) and two allotetraploid species (T. mirus and T. miscellus). Complex patterns of allopolyploid evolution have also been observed in animals, as in the frog genus <b>Xenopus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Not all proneural {{genes are}} equally {{sensitive}} to lateral inhibition. For example, in <b>Xenopus,</b> Chitnis and Kintner demonstrated that ‘’XASH-3’’ and NeuroD (achaete-scute complex) respond differently to lateral inhibition, which reflect different ability to activate target genes and differential susceptibility of these target genes to repression by notch. Posterior studies revealed {{that even when}} Notch/Delta signaling pathway is blocked, Wnt2b is capable of inhibiting neuronal differentiation, through the downregulation of mRNA expression of multiple proneural genes and also of Notch1. With this mechanism Wnt2b maintains progenitor cells undifferentiated by attenuating the expression of proneural and neurogenic genes, preventing cells from getting into the differentiation cascade regulated by proneural genes and Notch. Although notch signaling {{is involved in the}} control of proneural gene expression, positive-feedback loops are required to increase or maintain the levels of proneural genes. The transcription factors responsible for this maintenance can act through the inhibition of the notch signaling pathway in particular cells or at a post-transcriptional level, affecting proneural genes transcription and function.|$|E
25|$|Polyploidy was induced in fish by Har Swarup (1956) using a cold-shock {{treatment}} of the eggs close {{to the time of}} fertilization, which produced triploid embryos that successfully matured. Cold or heat shock has also been shown to result in unreduced amphibian gametes, though this occurs more commonly in eggs than in sperm. John Gurdon (1958) transplanted intact nuclei from somatic cells to produce diploid eggs in the frog, <b>Xenopus</b> (an extension of the work of Briggs and King in 1952) that were able to develop to the tadpole stage. The British Scientist, J. B. S. Haldane hailed the work for its potential medical applications and, in describing the results, {{became one of the first}} to use the word “clone” in reference to animals. Later work by Shinya Yamanaka showed how mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent, extending the possibilities to non-stem cells. Gurdon and Yamanaka were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in 2012 for this work.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Xenopus</b> oocytes, β-catenin is {{initially}} equally localized to all {{regions of the}} egg, but it is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the β-catenin destruction complex. Fertilization of the egg causes a rotation of the outer cortical layers, moving clusters of the Frizzled and Dsh proteins closer to the equatorial region. β-catenin will be enriched locally {{under the influence of}} Wnt signaling pathway in the cells that inherit this portion of the cytoplasm. It will eventually translocate to the nucleus to bind TCF3 in order to activate several genes that induce dorsal cell characteristics. This signaling results in a region of cells known as the grey crescent, which is a classical organizer of embryonic development. If this region is surgically removed from the embryo, gastrulation does not occur at all. β-Catenin also plays {{a crucial role in the}} induction of the blastopore lip, which in turn initiates gastrulation. Inhibition of GSK-3 translation by injection of antisense mRNA may cause a second blastopore and a superfluous body axis to form. A similar effect can result from the overexpression of β-catenin.|$|E
500|$|Frogs {{are used}} in cloning {{research}} and other branches of embryology. [...] Although alternative pregnancy tests have been developed, biologists continue to use <b>Xenopus</b> as a model organism in developmental biology because their embryos are large and easy to manipulate, they are readily obtainable, and can easily be kept in the laboratory. <b>Xenopus</b> laevis is increasingly being displaced by its smaller relative, <b>Xenopus</b> tropicalis, which reaches its reproductive age in five months rather than the {{one to two years}} for X. laevis, thus facilitating faster studies across generations. The genome of X. tropicalis is being sequenced.|$|E

500|$|Subsequent {{research}} has {{established that the}} fungus has been present in Australia since at least 1978, and present in North America {{since at least the}} 1970s. [...] The first known record of chytrid infection in frogs is in the African Clawed Frog, <b>Xenopus</b> laevis.|$|E
500|$|Studies in the {{zebrafish}} Danio rerio {{show that}} TBR1 is highly conserved across species. TBR1 cDNA clones from zebrafish were acquired by screening a zebrafish embryo using a phosphorus labeled probe. [...] The TBR1 found in zebrafish (zf-TBR1) has 83-97% amino acid identity to orthologs in humans (hu-TBR1), <b>xenopus</b> (x-EOMES), and mice (mu-TBR1). [...] The zebrafish TBR1 is only {{expressed in the}} forebrain, not in {{other regions of the}} zebrafish embryo.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its collection, the herpetologists who later {{described}} Ecnomiohyla rabborum were already aware of the encroaching threat of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (colloquially referred to by biologists as [...] "Bd") in Panama. The fungus causes an infectious amphibian disease called chytridiomycosis, which has been linked to the massive decline and extinction of amphibian species in certain parts of the world; including the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Infected amphibians can display a wide variety of symptoms, usually including lethargic and abnormal behavior, convulsions, peeling skin, ulcers, and hemorrhaging; eventually resulting in death. The origin of the disease is unknown, but there is speculation that it may have been introduced throughout the world via importation of the African clawed frog (<b>Xenopus</b> laevis).|$|E
