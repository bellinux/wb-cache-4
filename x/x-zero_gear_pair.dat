Predicting <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> defects by analyzing changes in vibration signal of <b>gears</b> <b>pairs</b> in operation is a very reliable method. Therefore, a suitable vibration signal processing technique is necessary to extract defect information usually covered under noise of other <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> dynamic factors. This paper {{presents the results of}} an evaluation of vibration analysis techniques as a method for the <b>gear</b> and <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> condition assessment. The origin of vibration in <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> and useful definition of damage identification techniques are presented. The detection and assessment capability {{of some of the most}} effective vibration techniques are discussed and experimentally compared, concerning a multistage industrial gearbox. In particular, the results of estimated vibration signal processing techniques are compared. Advantages and disadvantages of estimated techniques having in mind specific limitation have been shown.

40|$|Abstract. Planetary {{gear drive}} with minor teeth {{difference}} (zd≤ 8) {{is one of}} the advanced transmitting styles and could meet the requirement of larger ratio in a smaller size of dimension. Generally the gears with addenda modifications play a principal role in planetary gear drive of minor teeth difference to avoid teeth interference during the mesh, and this transmission implies cumbersome parameters calculations and brings up higher angle of engagement to affect the load capacity because of life weakening on carrier bearings involved. In fact, provided some certain promise, zero addenda modification (viz. X-zero) drive with minor teeth difference could also qualify for gearing conditions so as to reduce the complicacy of calculations and angle of engagement mentioned above. From investigating the relationships amongst the total teeth number of internal gear, difference of tooth number between internal and external gear, addendum coefficient and teeth profile interference criterion, the unique design characteristic about <b>X–zero</b> <b>gear</b> drive with minor teeth difference are outlined...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{irregularity}} of the I.

The paper presents a theoretical {{study on the}} dynamic behaviour of automotive transmissions focusing {{on the presence of}} oil between the impacting tooth of the meshing gears. This rattle phenomenon is particularly audible at low regimes and regards all the <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> different from the gear inserted to transmit the power. Another operating condition that manifests the gear rattle phenomenon is typically the “idle condition”, when all the <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> are meshing but without loading. The presence of oil between the impacting tooth of the <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> can play a positive role to decrease the vibrations and than the rattle noise level.

40|$|A clear {{understanding}} of the dynamics of <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> is important for many reasons. First of all, gear vibration is a main source of noise in gearboxes and vehicle trasmissions, secondly the torsional elasticity of the gear trasmission can produce relevant amplification of the contact force, and thus of the gear stress.

40|$|The {{lubrication}} regime in <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> is usually elasto-hydrodynamic, i. e. solid deformations {{due to the}} fluid pressure are not negligible. It {{is well known that}} lubrication in <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> depends upon a number of kinematical parameters, so that it is a non stationary EHD problem. Moreover, it depends upon the dynamic response (i. e. the dynamic load) of the <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> [1 - 5]. The problem of finding the dynamic response in gear systems, especially spur gears, has been studied by many research works. Most of them consider as the main source of vibration the time variation of the number of teeth pairs that are in contact at the same time. This fluctuation makes the transmission more stiff, when two pair of teeth are in contact, more deformable when only one pair is in contact. This behaviour can cause oscillations of the gears, and eventually detachment of the teeth in contact, with impacts and noise. The purpose of the present work is to investigate the effect of the varying rotational velocity of the <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> on the film thickness and the contact pressure distribution.
