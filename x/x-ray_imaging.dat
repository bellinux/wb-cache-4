5|$|Phase-contrast <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging</b> (Fig.26) {{refers to}} a variety of {{techniques}} that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. (For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast <b>x-ray</b> <b>imaging</b> (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging.)</b> It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures {{in a wide range of}} biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot interferometry, moiré-based far-field interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast <b>x-ray</b> <b>imaging,</b> making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, x-ray optics, or high resolution x-ray detectors.|$|E

50|$|Although not {{technically}} radiographic techniques due to not using <b>X-rays,</b> <b>imaging</b> modalities such as PET and MRI are sometimes grouped in radiography because the radiology department of hospitals handle {{all forms of}} imaging.

5|$|Phillip Manning {{and colleagues}} (2009) {{attempted}} {{to test the}} function of the sickle claw and similarly shaped claws on the forelimbs. They analyzed the bio-mechanics of how stresses and strains would be distributed along the claws and into the limbs, using <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging</b> to create a three-dimensional contour map of a forelimb claw from Velociraptor. For comparison, they analyzed the construction of a claw from a modern predatory bird, the eagle owl. They found that, based on the way that stress was conducted along the claw, they were ideal for climbing. The scientists found that the sharpened tip of the claw was a puncturing and gripping instrument, while the curved and expanded claw base helped transfer stress loads evenly.|$|E
25|$|Phase-contrast <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging</b> (PCI) or phase-sensitive <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging</b> is {{a general}} term for {{different}} technical methods that use information concerning changes in the phase of an X-ray beam that passes through an object {{in order to create}} its images. Standard <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging</b> techniques like radiography or computed tomography (CT) rely on a decrease of the X-ray beam's intensity (attenuation) when traversing the sample, which can be measured directly with the assistance of an X-ray detector. In PCI however, the beam's phase shift caused by the sample is not measured directly, but is transformed into variations in intensity, which then can be recorded by the detector.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{owing to}} {{technological}} convergence, the word fluoroscopy is widely {{understood to be}} a hypernym of all the earlier names for moving pictures taken with X-rays, both live and recorded. Also owing to technological convergence, radiography, CT, and fluoroscopy are now all digital imaging modes using X-rays with image analysis software and easy data storage and retrieval. Just as movies, TV, and web videos are to a substantive extent no longer separate technologies but only variations on common underlying digital themes, so too are the <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging</b> modes. And indeed, the term <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging</b> is the ultimate hypernym that unites all of them, even subsuming both fluoroscopy and 4DCT. However, it may be many decades before the earlier hyponyms fall into disuse, not least because the day when 4D CT displaces all earlier forms of moving <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging</b> may yet be distant.|$|E

25|$|Nowadays, in {{all forms}} of digital <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging</b> (radiography, fluoroscopy, and CT) the {{conversion}} of X-ray energy into visible light {{can be achieved by}} the same types of electronic sensors, such as flat panel detectors, which convert the X-ray energy into electrical signals, small bursts of current that convey information that a computer can analyze, store, and output as images. As fluorescence is a special case of luminescence, digital <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging</b> is conceptually similar to digital gamma ray imaging (scintigraphy, SPECT, and PET) in that in both of these imaging mode families, the information conveyed by the variable attenuation of invisible electromagnetic radiation as it passes through tissues with various radiodensities is converted by an electronic sensor into an electric signal that is processed by a computer and made output as a visible-light image.|$|E
25|$|The classic DMF (decay/missing/filled) {{index is}} one of the most common methods for {{assessing}} caries prevalence as well as dental treatment needs among populations. This index is based on in-field clinical examination of individuals by using a probe, mirror and cotton rolls. Because the DMF index is done without <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging,</b> it underestimates real caries prevalence and treatment needs.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of in-line hard <b>x-ray</b> phase-contrast <b>imaging</b> had been performed, using the polychromatic output of an x-ray tube.

40|$|Purpose: Grating-based <b>X-ray</b> phase-contrast <b>imaging</b> is a {{promising}} modality increasing {{the soft tissue}} contrast in medical imaging. In this work, the signature of lung tissue in <b>X-ray</b> grating-based physe-contrast <b>imaging</b> is investigated. Methods: We used a Talbot-Lau interferometer for our investigations of two C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Both underwent projection imaging and computed tomography. Results: The {{results show that the}} three images obtained by <b>X-ray</b> phase-contrast <b>imaging</b> show complementary anatomical structures. Especially the dark field image allows a more-exact determination of the position of the lung in the chest cavity. Conclusion: Due to its sensitivity to granular structures, the dark field image may be used for the diagnosis of lung diseases in earlier stages or without a CT scan. Furthermore, <b>X-ray</b> phase-contrast <b>imaging</b> may also have great potential in the application of animal laboratory sciences {{to reduce the number of}} required animals used in long-term translational, toxicity, and regenerative medicine studies...|$|R
25|$|Short {{nanosecond}} {{bursts of}} X-rays peaking at 15-keV in energy may be reliably produced by peeling pressure-sensitive adhesive tape from its backing {{in a moderate}} vacuum. This {{is likely to be}} the result of recombination of electrical charges produced by triboelectric charging. The intensity of X-ray triboluminescence is sufficient for it to be used as a source for <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to producing projection images, PCI, like conventional transmission, {{can be combined}} with tomographic techniques to obtain the 3D distribution of the real part of the refractive index of the sample. When applied to samples that consist of atoms with low atomic number Z, PCI is more sensitive to density variations in the sample than conventional transmission-based <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging.</b> This leads to images with improved soft tissue contrast.|$|E

It is {{hypothesized that the}} reconnection and unravelling of braids can act as primary sources of heating of the active solar corona to temperatures of up to 4 million kelvins. The main heat source in the quiescent corona (about 1.5 million kelvins) is assumed to originate from MHD waves.|$|E

25|$|<b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging</b> {{of the hip}} is {{most often}} unremarkable. Subtle {{radiographic}} signs include an accentuated pericapsular shadow, widening of the medial joint space, lateral displacement of the femoral epiphyses with surface flattening (Waldenström sign), prominent obturator shadow, diminution of soft tissue planes around the hip joint or slight demineralisation of the proximal femur. The main reason for radiographic examination is to exclude bony lesions such as occult fractures, slipped upper femoral epiphysis or bone tumours (such as osteoid osteoma). An anteroposterior and frog lateral (Lauenstein) view of the pelvis and both hips is advisable.|$|E
25|$|Radium {{is still}} used {{today as a}} {{radiation}} source in some industrial radiography devices to check for flawed metallic parts, similarly to <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging.</b> When mixed with beryllium, radium acts as a neutron source. Radium-beryllium neutron sources are still sometimes used even today, but other materials such as polonium are now more common: about 1500 polonium-beryllium neutron sources, with an individual activity of , have been used annually in Russia. These RaBeF4-based (α, n) neutron sources have been deprecated despite {{the high number of}} neutrons they emit (1.84×106 neutrons per second) in favour of 241Am–Be sources.

Above the photodiodes, {{an array of}} scintillating CsI:Tl crystals are placed. So, the x-ray energy is first converted to visible light by the scintillating crystals, which is then detected by the photodiodes. The photocurrent produced by each photodiode is amplified, converted to a voltage and stored in a capacitor. Finally, the voltage of each capacitor is read by the readout circuit...|$|R

25|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, {{the price of}} copper rose {{to the point where}} the cent {{contained}} almost one cent's worth of copper. This led the Mint to test alternative metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. Aluminum was chosen, and over 1.5 million of these pennies were struck and ready for public release before ultimately being rejected. The proposed aluminum pennies were rejected for two reasons: vending machine owners complained the coins would cause mechanical problems; and pediatricians and pediatric radiologists pointed out that the radiodensity of the metal inside the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was close to that of soft tissue, and the coins would therefore be difficult to detect in <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging.</b> One aluminum cent was donated to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to gain {{acceptance}} for the new composition, the Mint distributed approximately three dozen examples to {{various members of the}} House Banking and Currency Committee and the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Nine congressmen and four senators received examples, along with some Treasury officials. Additional specimens were given out by then Mint Director Mary Brooks. Ultimately, the proposal was rejected in Congress, due mainly to the efforts of the copper-mining and vending machine industries, which felt the coins would cause mechanical problems. Opposition also came from pediatricians and pediatric radiologists who pointed out the radiodensity of the metal inside the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was close to that of soft tissue, and therefore would be difficult to detect in <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging.</b> In addition, the price of copper declined enough that making copper cents would again be economically viable, and conversely made hoarding pointless. The idea of changing the composition of the cent would not be explored again until the 1980s. In 1982, the composition of the coin was changed to the current 99.2% zinc and 0.8% copper core alloy with a plating of pure copper, resulting in a 20% weight reduction.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy and {{angiography}} {{are special}} applications of <b>X-ray</b> <b>imaging,</b> {{in which a}} fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting {{into the body of}} the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the genitourinary system, or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract. Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air {{can be used as a}} contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.|$|E
