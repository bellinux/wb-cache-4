40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{relationship}} of <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> temperature to duty cycle was studied for a superficial therapy x-ray installation, a dental radiographic installation, and a rotating-anode medical diagnostic installation. Thermistors {{were used to}} measure the tube housing temperature at points selected to be representative of thermal conditions {{on the surface of the}} <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>housing.</b> Measurements were made for continuous operation and intermittent operation, for the beam directed horizontally, and for the beam directed vertically down. Maximum temperatures were observed on the uppermost surfaces of the tube housings and minimum temperatures were observed on the lower surfaces of the tube housings. The orientation of the tube housing was found in some cases to alter the maximum tube housing temperature. Theoretically, tube housing temperatures for continuous and intermittent operation should be the same, but some differences were observed. These differences between tube housing temperatures observed for continuous operation and those observed for intermittent operation were due to differences in the duty cycle ratings specified by the x-ray tube manufacturer for continuous and intermittent operation...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the distribution of leakage radiation from two unshielded diagnostic-type X-ray tube housings. This information was used to determine the shielding required in the housings to bring them into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing, as set forth by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements in Report No. 33. Two special diagnostic X-ray tube units were used, one containing a rotating anode tube and the other a stationary anode tube. The only shielding supplied was that provided by the steel, oil-containing tube casing which surrounds the X-ray tube. A measurement of the distribution of leakage radiation on a sphere of one meter radius about the focal spot of the X-ray tube was made on each tube when the tube was operated at its maximum rated continuous current for its maximum rated operating voltage. From the leakage radiation measured, the thickness of lead shielding required to bring the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing was calculated. Lead shielding was placed on each of the X-ray tube housings, and measurements were made to determine if each housing was then in compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing. As a result of this study, it was found that the distribution of leakage radiation from an unshielded diagnostic-type tube housing is non-uniform. The amount and location of shielding required in the housing is dependent upon the distribution of the leakage radiation, and is, therefore, a function of the design and rating of the X-ray tube used in the housing...|$|E
50|$|For medical purposes, X-ray {{filters are}} used to {{selectively}} attenuate, or block out, low-energy rays during x-ray imaging (radiography). Low energy x-rays (less than 30 keV) contribute little to the resultant image as they are heavily absorbed by the patient's soft tissues (particularly the skin). Additionally, this absorption adds {{to the risk of}} stochastic (e.g. cancer) or non stochastic radiation effects (e.g. tissue reactions) in the patient. Thus, it is favorable to remove these low energy X-rays from the incident light beam. X-ray filtration may be inherent due to the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> and <b>housing</b> material itself or added from additional sheets of filter material. The minimum filtration used is usually 2.5 mm aluminium (Al) equivalent, although there is an increasing trend to use greater filtration. Manufacturers of modern fluoroscopy equipment utilize a system of adding a variable thickness of copper (Cu) filtration according to patient thickness. This typically ranges from 0.1 to 0.9 mm Cu.|$|R
40|$|Grid (or sieve) therapy ("Gitter-" oder "Siebtherapie"), {{spatially}} fractionated kilo- and megavolt X-ray therapy, {{was invented}} in 1909 by Alban Köhler, a radiologist in Wiesbaden, Germany. He tested it on several patients before 1913 using approximately 60 - 70 kV Hittorf-Crookes tubes. Köhler pushed the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube's</b> lead-shielded <b>housing</b> against a stiff grid of 1 mm-square iron wires woven 3. 0 - 3. 5 mm on center, taped tightly to the skin over a thin chamois. Numerous islets unshielded by iron in the pressure-blanched skin were irradiated with up to about 6 erythema doses (ED). The skin was then thoroughly cleansed, disinfected, and bandaged; delayed punctate necrosis healed in several weeks. Although grid therapy was disparaged or ignored until the 1930 s, {{it has been used}} successfully since then to shrink bulky malignancies. Also, advanced cancers in rats and mice have been mitigated or ablated using Köhler's concept since the early 1990 s by unidirectional or stereotactic exposure to an array of nearly parallel microplanar (25 - 75 μm-wide) beams of very intense, moderately hard (median energy approximately 100 keV) synchrotron-generated X rays spaced 0. 1 - 0. 4 mm on center. Such beams maintain sharp edges at high doses well beneath the skin yet confer little toxicity. They could palliate some otherwise intractable malignancies, perhaps in young children too, with tolerable sequelae. There are plans for such studies in larger animals...|$|R
40|$|A {{versatile}} EGSnrc Monte Carlo (MC) framework, initially {{designed to}} explicitly simulate <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> {{and record the}} output data into phase space data files, was modified towards dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) dosimetric applications by introducing equivalent sources. Half value layer (HVL) measurements were conducted to specify protocol-specific energy spectra. Air kerma measurements were carried out with an ionisation chamber positioned against the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> to obtain the total filtration attenuation characteristics. The framework is applicable to bowtie and non-bowtie inherent filtrations, and it accounts for the anode heel effect and the total filtration of the <b>tube</b> <b>housing.</b> The code was adjusted to the Promax 3 D Max (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) dental CBCT scanner. For each clinical protocol, calibration factors were produced to allow absolute MC dose calculations. The framework was validated by comparing MC calculated doses and measured doses in a cylindrical water phantom. Validation results demonstrate {{the reliability of the}} framework for dental CBCT dosimetry purposes. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|In summary, we have {{demonstrated}} a vacuum-sealed miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> based on CNT field-emission electron source. The <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> can be operated up to 70 kV, and high-dose X-rays are generated with a comparatively good spatial dose distribution. Due {{to the small}} electron beam size in the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> the prototype <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> can be further miniaturized. We believe that such a vacuum-sealed miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> {{can be used for}} various industrial and medical diagnostic/therapy purposes.|$|R

40|$|A {{miniature}} <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> {{based on}} a carbon-nanotube electron emitter has been employed for the application to a dental radiography. The miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> has an outer diameter of 7  mm and a length of 47  mm. The miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> is operated in a negative high-voltage mode in which the X-ray target is electrically grounded. In addition, X-rays are generated only to the teeth directions using a collimator while X-rays generated to other directions are shielded. Hence, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> can be safely inserted into a human mouth. Using the intra-oral <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> a dental radiography is demonstrated where the positions of an X-ray source and a sensor are reversed compared with a conventional dental radiography system.

40|$|An {{introduction}} to the fundamental concepts of X-ray physics and <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> design is given. This discussion also includes {{a brief description of}} various <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> types available commercially for a number of different industrial applications. The design of a high-energy MgO cold cathode <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> which is to be used in an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer, is described in detail with emphasis placed on the electron beam focusing mechanism and the theory of operation as well as the construction of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> MgO cold cathode, which functioned as the electron emitter of the device. A detailed account is also given of the output characteristics of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> power supply, which has a direct effect on the design requirements and consequently the performance ofthe <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube.</b> An investigation into the manufacture of the vacuum envelope with particular attention focused on the production of reliable metal-to-ceramic seals was performed. A number of tests were conducted especially with regard to the maximum temperature that such seals may withstand without becoming permanently damaged. These tests were essential, since high temperature gradients tend to develop in an <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> during operation, which the metal-to-cerarnic seals of the tube must be capable of withstanding if damage to the device is to be avoided. The set-up of the XRF spectrometer in which the completed <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> was tested is discussed, in which the X-ray current and voltage measuring techniques are described. Furthermore a detailed account of the operation of the X-ray detector system and the multichannel analyser is given, which was used to detect and record spectra of the sample elements excited by the primary radiation of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube.</b> Finally the measured <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> performance characteristics are discussed and compared to the predicted results...|$|R
40|$|We {{correlate}} {{the failure}} in miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> {{with the field}} emission gate leakage current of gated carbon nanotube emitters. The miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> even with a small gate leakage current, exhibits an induced voltage on the gate electrode by the anode bias voltage, resulting in a very unstable operation and finally a failure. The induced gate voltage is apparently caused by charging at the insulating spacer of the miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> through the gate leakage current of the field emission. The gate leakage current could be a criterion for the successful fabrication of miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes...</b>|$|R
5000|$|An <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> is {{a vacuum}} tube that {{converts}} electrical input power into <b>X-rays.</b> [...] <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> evolved from experimental Crookes <b>tubes</b> with which <b>X-rays</b> were first discovered on November 8, 1895, by the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen. The availability of this controllable source of X-rays created {{the field of}} radiography, the imaging of partly opaque objects with penetrating radiation. In contrast to other sources of ionizing radiation, X-rays are only produced {{as long as the}} <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> is energized. <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> are also used in CT scanners, airport luggage scanners, X-ray crystallography, material and structure analysis, and for industrial inspection.|$|R
25|$|The Coolidge <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> {{was invented}} during the {{following}} year by William D. Coolidge. It made possible the continuous emissions of <b>X-rays.</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> similar to this are still in use in 2012.|$|R
30|$|Figure 2 b {{shows the}} dose rate of X-ray that is {{produced}} from the miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> and {{the stability of}} the dose rate with time. The dose rate was measured with an ionization chamber and an electrometer (PTW 34013 and Unidos-E both from PTW, Freiburg, Germany) at 1 cm apart from the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> in air. The air kerma strength of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> operating at 50 kV with the tube current of 252 μA was as high as 108.1 Gy·cm 2 min− 1, which is approximately 15 times higher than that of a 10 -Ci HDR 192 Ir radioisotope source [20] that is widely used for brachytherapy. The fluctuation of the X-ray dose rate was as low as ± 2.7 %. In addition, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> has worked for over 2 months with no significant change in the electron beam current (0.25 mA at 50 kV) and the X-ray dose rate. The <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> has been continuously operated for approximately 1 h/day. Consequently, the developed miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> produces high enough X-ray output and exhibits very good short-term and long-term stabilities.|$|R
30|$|Meanwhile, <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> {{based on}} carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) field-emission electron sources have been extensively developed because CNT emitters have several advantages compared with thermionic electron sources. The advantages of CNT emitters include (1) cold electron sources, and hence, little heat is generated inside the tube [6] {{which is important}} for the minimization of an X-ray tube; (2) simplicity and easy controllability in a pulse operation [7, 8]; (3) high current density for electron and X-ray microscopy devices [9, 10]. Several types of <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> have also been developed using CNT field emitters [11 – 15]. However, the miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> are mostly not vacuum-sealed and thus should be operated in a vacuum chamber or with a vacuum pump. In addition, the maximum operating voltages of the miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> were less than 30 kV. As a consequence, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> have limited practical applications.|$|R
50|$|Some X-ray {{examinations}} (such as, e.g., {{non-destructive testing}} and 3-D microtomography) need very high-resolution images and therefore require <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> that can generate very small focal spot sizes, typically below 50 µm in diameter. These tubes are called microfocus <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
50|$|An X-ray {{imaging system}} {{consists}} of a generator control console where the operator selects desired techniques to obtain a quality readable image(kVp, mA and exposure time), an x-ray generator which controls the <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> current, <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> kilovoltage and <b>x-ray</b> emitting exposure time, an <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> that converts the kilovoltage and mA into actual x-rays and an image detection system which can be either a film (analog technology) or a digital capture system and a PACS.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the safety and {{efficacy}} of percutaneous aortic valve replacement procedures, a closed bore hybrid x-ray∕MRI (CBXMR) system is proposed in which an x-ray C-arm will be positioned with its isocenter ≈ 1 m from the entrance of a clinical MRI scanner. This system will harness the complementary strengths of both modalities to improve clinical outcome. A key component of the CBXMR system will be a rotating anode <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> to produce high-quality x-ray images. There are challenges in positioning an <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> in the magnetic fringe field of the MRI magnet. Here, the effects of an external magnetic field on <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> induction motors of radiography <b>x-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> and the corresponding reduction of <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> heat loadability are investigated. Anode rotation frequency fanode was unaffected when the external magnetic field Bb was parallel to the axis of rotation of the anode but decreased when Bb was perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The experimental fanode values agreed with predicted values to within ± 3 % over a Bb range of 0 – 30 mT. The MRI fringe field at the proposed location of the <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> mounted on the C-arm (≈ 4 mT) reduced fanode by only 1 %, so <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> heat loadability will not be compromised when using CBXMR systems for percutaneous aortic valve replacement procedures. Eddy current heating power in the rotor due to an MRI fringe field {{was found to be}} two orders of magnitude weaker than the heating power produced on the anode due to a fluoroscopic exposure, so eddy current heating had no effect on <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> heat loadability...|$|R

50|$|Monochromatic X-rays may be channeled from {{synchrotron}} radiation, {{obtained from}} filtered Coolidge <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> {{or from the}} preferred transmission <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes.</b> To induce inner-shell ionization with resonant scattering from a moderately-heavy atom with dozens of electrons, the X-ray photon energy must be 30 keV or higher to penetrate tissue in therapeutic applications.

All of the connection parts of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> are tightly vacuum-sealed. The both ends of the alumina ceramic tube were vacuum-brazed with a focusing electrode assembly and a connecting anode, respectively. Both electrodes were made of Kovar (Carpenter Technology Corporation, Reading, PA, USA) that has a similar thermal expansion coefficient to alumina. The connecting anode was used to interconnect a ceramic tube and a Be X-ray window that have different thermal expansion coefficients. The connecting anode and the Be window were also vacuum-brazed. All the components of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> were baked at 550 °C for 10 h, and subsequently, these were brazed through a single-step brazing process at 680 °C for 30 min in a vacuum furnace. Before the brazing process, electron emission and transport tests of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> have been carried out inside a vacuum chamber. The position of the cathode inside the focusing electrode could be finely controlled through this process. A non-evaporable getter film was installed around the focusing electrode to evacuate the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube.</b> The getter was activated during the brazing process. The outer part of the sealed <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> except the target, was covered with a layer of silicone resin to improve high-voltage insulation between the cathode and the X-ray target.
