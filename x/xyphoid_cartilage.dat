40|$|BCL 2 α {{is known}} to protect cells from apoptosis. To {{determine}} the functional domains of BCL 2 α critical for its role in apoptosis, I generated different deletion and point mutants of BCL 2 α. These mutants under the regulation of CMV or RSV-LTR promoter were transfected into human preB cell line 697. The stable transfectants were tested {{for their ability to}} protect the cells from apoptosis induced by dexamethasone treatment. Although the transmembrane domain is required for membrane localization, BCL 2 α did not require it to protect the cells from apoptosis. Point mutations like T 7 D, G 27 A, and W 30 A did not affect function of BCL 2 α. Point mutations like T 7 A, S 24 A, and S 24 D reduced the ability of BCL 2 α in protecting cells against apoptosis. Point mutations like G 194 A and D 196 A inactivated BCL 2 α. While incorporation of point mutations like T 7 A, T 7 D, S 24 A, S 24 D, G 27 A, and E 29 K did not affect the ability of BCL 2 α to bind BAX, mutation like G 194 A prevented BCL 2 α to bind BAX. The mutation D 196 A reduced the ability of BCL 2 α to bind BAX. These studies imply that G 194 and D 196 of BCL 2 α are critical for its binding to BAX and for its ability to protect cells from apoptosis. While generating BCL 2 α transgenic mice, I found that in transgenic line TG 114 the Bmp 7 gene, a member of the TGFβ superfamily, was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis due to transgene integration. The Bmp 7 homozygous null condition in mice was a postnatal lethal mutation and was associated with various developmental defects: holes in basisphenoid bone and <b>xyphoid</b> <b>cartilage,</b> retarded ossification or bones, fused ribs and vertebrae, underdeveloped neural arches of lumbar and sacral vertebrae, polydactyly of hind limbs, kinked tail, reduced number of nephrons, polycystic kidney, lack of retinal pigmentation, and retarded lens development. These findings indicate that BMP 7 is an important signaling molecule for normal development of mammalian skeleton, kidney, and eye. ...|$|E
