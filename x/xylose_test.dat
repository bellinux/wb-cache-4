In 15 we showed intestinal xylose malabsorption by the one-hour blood xylose level within 1 - 28 days of starting ingestion of gluten. One child, with a persistently normal one-hour blood <b>xylose</b> <b>test</b> after gluten challenge for 3 months, had normal absorption and normal jejunal histology after 18 months on a gluten-containing diet; she is considered not to have CD.

40|$|Introduction: Growth faltering is {{a common}} health issue in the {{developing}} countries. At times {{we are unable to}} attribute this growth faltering to lack of adequate nutrients in food or ongoing disease conditions alone. With this study we aim to assess the possibility of the existence of subclinical malabsorption in children with undernutrition. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted on a sample of 161 children from a birth cohort of 377 children who were under follow up from birth for health and disease in three of the urban slums of Vellore. The prevalence of small intestinal enteropathy, as assessed by a 5 hour urinary d-xylose excretion test, was compared between undernourished and well-nourished children. Correlation between undernutrition, d-xylose malabsorption and previous documented illnesses including viral, bacterial or parasitic infections/ infestations was also studied.

40|$|In {{disease states}} of the small {{intestine}} [...] for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy [...] there is an increased permeability to large molecules. This increased permeability extends to polar molecules of intermediate size such as disaccharides, whereas small polar molecules are malabsorbed. A recently-developed oral test, based on the simultaneous administration of two test substances, cellobiose (a disaccharide) and mannitol (a small polar molecule) {{has been used to}} investigate permeability in a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, the result of the test being expressed as the ratio (cellobiose/mannitol) of the five hour urinary recoveries of the two probe molecules. Results for patients with pancreatic insufficiency, intestinal bacterial overgrowth, primary hypolactasia, ileocolic or colonic Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis were comparable with those in normal controls, whereas in 23 out of 24 untreated coeliacs, and five out of eight patients with Crohn's disease involving the more proximal small bowel, the cellobiose/mannitol ratio was clearly abnormal.

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of the xylose tolerance test as a screening procedure for coeliac disease has been reassessed in 54 children with suspected coeliac disease. 5 - and 24 -hour urinary excretion rates of xylose were of no value in discriminating between patients with and without coeliac disease; similarly, the 3 -hour blood xylose concentration was nondiscriminatory. Three (15 - 8 %) patients with subtotal villous atrophy and 8 (61 - 5 %) with partial villous atrophy due to coeliac disease had one-hour blood xylose values which fell within the normal range. The effect of withdrawal or reintroduction of dietary gluten on sequential one-hour blood xylose levels was variable and generally unhelpful in predicting those patients who developed gluten-induced mucosal changes. The {{results of the present}} study emphasize the serious limitations of the xylose tolerance test as a screening procedure in childhood coeliac disease. It is recommended that the use of the urinary <b>xylose</b> <b>test</b> should be abandoned in the paediatric population. A normal one-hour blood xylose value does not exclude a diagnosis of coeliac disease even in young children who have never received a gluten-free diet.

Jejunal biopsies and the 1 -hour xylose {{absorption test}} were performed immediately before and 20 - 24 hours after cows' milk provocation. After milk provocation, 30 infants had clinical, enzymological, and histological relapse, and in 28 of them there was a significant depression of post-provocation blood xylose levels. Six infants had histological and enzymological relapse but clinically they tolerated cows' milk. The post-provocation blood xylose level was depressed in all infants. Ten infants had enzymological relapse without histological or clinical relapse. The post-challenge blood xylose was depressed significantly (greater than 20 %) in 3, mildly depressed in 3 (16 - 18 %), and not depressed in four.

In 12 of these 16 cases, pentagastrin tests showed normal gastric acid secretion and in 12 cases the small bowel was radiologically normal. Nutritional assessment, anthropometric measurements, culture of small-bowel aspirates, HC-triolein breath tests and blood xylose tests were performed before and after 4 to 6 months of cyclical antibiotic therapy. Initially all patients except two showed evidence of malabsorption. After antibiotic treatment alone, 13 patients gained in weight and body fat.

Newborn foals were either fed COL (n = 5) or an equal amount of milk replacer (MR, n = 7) during the first 24 hours of life. To ensure passive immunity, all foals received 1 L plasma. Postnatal development, meconium release, intestinal motility, white blood cell count, insulin-like growth factor 1, and intestinal absorptive function (<b>xylose</b> absorption <b>test)</b> were evaluated. Clinical findings and meconium release were not affected by feeding of COL or MR. Ultrasonography revealed a slightly larger jejunum and stomach in group COL versus MR (P < 0. 05). The percentage of polymorphonuclear leucocytes was higher in foals of group MR versus group COL (P < 0. 05) and the percentage of lymphocytes was lower in MR compared with COL foals (P < 0. 05). Plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 concentration increased during the first 14 days after birth in both groups. A <b>xylose</b> absorption <b>test</b> on Day 5 revealed similar increases in plasma xylose concentrations after oral intake. In conclusion, feeding of COL versus MR was without effect on meconium release and intestinal absorptive function. Differences between foals fed COL and MR with regard to intestinal function are apparently without clinical relevance. In foals that have not received maternal COL, there is no major risk of intestinal problems if they are fed MR and provided with immunoglobulins by transfusion of plasma...|$|R

Abundance and un-competitiveness with food sources are desired features of potential feedstocks. These features are fulfilled by lignocellulosic biomass. This contribution is about the characterization of the ABE fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792 using sugars representative for hydrolysis products of lignocellulosic biomass: glucose, mannose, arabinose, and <b>xylose.</b> Preliminary <b>tests</b> (according to Napoli et al., 2009) were carried out adopting each single sugar as carbon source to investigate the ability of the microorganism to convert them. Batch fermentation tests with mixtures of two sugars were carried out in order to assess the possible combined effects of the investigated sugars on the fermentation performances. The tests had also the aim of assessing the ability of C. acetobutylicum to simultaneously metabolize different sugars. Investigated sugar mixtures were: glucose/mannose (GM), glucose/arabinose (GA), glucose/xylose (GX), mannose/arabinose (MA), and arabinose /xylose (AX). The total initial sugar concentration was set at 60 g/L and the mass ratio between the two sugars was set at 1 : 1. The conversion process was characterized as a function of time in terms of biomass, acids and solvents concentrations as well as pH and total organic content. Data were evaluated to assess sugars conversion and the kinetics of cell growth and of the ABE production. The yields for cells, acids and solvents on the carbon source were also assessed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Radiation-induced {{gastrointestinal}} syndrome (RIGS) {{is due to}} the clonogenic loss of crypt {{cells and}} villi depopulation, resulting in disruption of mucosal barrier, bacterial invasion, inflammation and sepsis. Intestinal macrophages could recognize invading bacterial DNA via TLR 9 receptors and transmit regenerative signals to the neighboring crypt. We therefore investigated whether systemic administration of designer TLR 9 agonist could ameliorate RIGS by activating TLR 9. Methods and Materials: Male C 57 Bl 6 mice were distributed in four experimental cohorts, whole body irradiation (WBI) (8. 4 – 10. 4 Gy), TLR 9 agonist (1 mg/kg s. c.), 1 h pre- or post-WBI and TLR 9 agonist+WBI+iMyd 88 (pretreatment with inhibitory peptide against Myd 88). Animals were observed for survival and intestine was harvested for histological analysis. BALB/c mice with CT 26 colon tumors in abdominal wall were irradiated with 14 Gy single dose of whole abdominal irradiation (AIR) for tumor growth study. Results: Mice receiving pre-WBI TLR 9 agonist demonstrated improvement of survival after 10. 4 Gy (p, 0. 03), 9. 4 Gy (p, 0. 008) and 8. 4 Gy (p, 0. 002) of WBI, compared to untreated or iMyd 88 -treated controls. Post-WBI TLR 9 agonist mitigates up to 8. 4 Gy WBI (p, 0. 01). Histological analysis and <b>xylose</b> absorption <b>test</b> demonstrated significant structural and functional restitution of the intestine in WBI+TLR 9 agonist cohorts. Although, AIR reduced tumor growth, all animals died within 12 days from RIGS. TLR 9 agonist improved the survival of mice beyond 28 days post-AIR (p, 0. 008) with significan...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the determination of}} D-xylOSe in urine {{which is based on}} the specific absorptivity of the pentose o-toluidine complex. Quantitation of xylose can be made in the presenceof a hexose. HE DETERMINATION OF XYLOSE in both blood amid urine has been em-ployed in the absorption test for the clinical evaluation of patients with celiac disease, steatorrhea, and nontropical sprue (1 - 5). The first meth-od for the <b>xylose</b> absorption <b>test</b> was introduced by Helmer and Foutes in 1937 (6) and employed the Folin procedure for glucose. Subsequently, other methods utilizing reactions with bromo-anihine (7, 8) and orcinol (9, 10), and the Somogyi-Nelson procedure (1), as well as comparisons of all these methods (1, 2, 7, 8), have been reported. The relation be-tween the xylose dose given tile patient, and the method of analysis and its correlation with clinical findings also have been discussed (3). All of the foregoing methods share {{one or more of the}} common dis-advantages usually encountered in xylose determination-e. g., the non-specificity of reaction for xylose, interference by glucose or other hexoses, elaborate procedural steps, special organic or caustic solvents, or a combination of any or all of these. In the procedure described here, an o-toluidine reagent is used to determine n-xylose in urine. This reagent is in wide general use for the determination of blood and urine glucose, as introduced by Hultmaii (ii). It is not specific for glucose and has a greater sensitivity for xylose.

40|$|Xylanase (1, 4 -beta-D-xylan xylanohydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 8) {{production}} {{was investigated in}} the ruminal anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix frontalis. The enzyme was released principally into the culture fluid and had pH and temperature optima of 5. 5 and 55 degrees C, respectively. In the presence of low concentrations of substrate, the enzyme was stabilized at 50 degrees C. Xylobiose was the principal product of xylanase action, with lesser amounts of longer-chained xylooligosaccharides. No xylose was detected, indicating that xylobiase activity was absent. Activities of xylanase up to 27 U ml- 1 (1 U represents 1 micromol of xylose equivalents released min- 1) were obtained for cultures grown on xylan (from oat spelt) at 2. 5 mg ml- 1 in shaken cultures. No growth occurred in unshaken cultures. Xylanase production declined with elevated concentrations of xylan (less than 2. 5 mg ml- 1), and this was accompanied by an accumulation of xylose and, to a lesser extent, arabinose. Addition of either pentose to cultures grown on low levels of xylan in which neither sugar accumulated suppressed xylanase production, and in growth studies with the paired substrates xylan-xylose, active production of the enzyme occurred during growth on xylan only after xylose had been preferentially utilized. When cellobiose, glucose, and <b>xylose</b> were <b>tested</b> as growth substrates {{for the production of}} xylanase (each initially at 2. 5 mg ml- 1), they were found to be less effective than xylan, and use of xylan from different origins (birch wood or larch wood) as the growth substrate or in the assay system resulted in only marginal differences in enzyme activity. However, elevated production of xylanase occurred during growth on crude hemicellulose (barley straw leaf). The results are discussed in relation {{to the role of the}} anaerobic fungi in the ruminal ecosystem, and the possible application of the enzyme in bioconversion processes is also considered...|$|R

In four the anaemia was megaloblastic (due to folate deficiency) and in six hypochromic. Perfusion solutions contained (1) glucose 200 mmol/ 1, (2) glycine 100 mmol/ 1, and (3) folic acid 250 mug/ 1. D-xylose absorption after a 25 g oral load was determined in them, and also in 18 additional patients (11 had megaloblastic and seven either hypochromic or haemolytic anaemia). <b>Xylose</b> absorption <b>tests</b> were significantly impaired in the patients with megaloblastic compared with hypochromic or haemolytic anaemia (P less than 0 - 001); those with untreated megaloblastic anaemia had a greater abnormality {{than those who had}} started treatment. Mean glucose, glycine, and folic acid absorption rates were similar to those in controls, and the rates in patients with megaloblastic and hypochromic anaemia were not significantly different. Correlation between glucose absorption rate and xylose excretion was, however, significantly (P less than 0 - 02). If more patients had been studied it seems likely therefore that a significant impairment of glucose absorption rate in the presence of megaloblastic anaemia would also have been demonstrated. In this investigation anaemia per se did not affect glucose, glycine, or folic acid absorption rates or xylose absorption, but xylose absorption was reduced in patients with megaloblastic anaemia. That abnormality was probably related to folate deficiency, and the underlying mechanism seems to be different from that causing impairment of monosaccharide absorption in patients with systemic bacterial infections. Mean glycine and folic acid absorption rates were not altered by megaloblastic anaemia, indicating that folate deficiency does not cause a general depression of absorption...|$|R
