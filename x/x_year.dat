40|$|The {{atmospheric}} deposition of nitrogen (N) {{in the environment}} is of great concern due to its impact on natural ecosystems including affecting vegetation, reducing biodiversity, increasing tree growth in forests, and the eutrophication of aquatic systems. Taking into account the average annual N emission into the atmosphere in Germany of about 2 million t N (ammonia/ammonium, NOx), and assuming homogeneous distribution throughout Germany, an average N deposition of 45 kg/ha <b>x</b> <b>year</b> can be calculated. Such high atmospheric N deposition could be confirmed by N balances from long-term field experiments in Central Germany (e. g., the Static Fertilization Experiment in Bad Lauchstädt). By contrast, estimates by standard methods indicate a deposition of only about 30 kg N/ha <b>x</b> <b>year.</b> This is because the standard methods are using wet-only or bulk collectors, which fail {{to take into account}} gaseous deposition and the direct uptake of atmospheric N by aerial plant parts. Therefore, a new system was developed using 15 N isotope dilution methodology to measure the actual total atmospheric N input into a soil/plant system (Integrated Total Nitrogen Input, ITNI). A soil/plant system is labeled with [15 N]ammonium-[15 N]nitrate and the total input of airborne N is calculated from the dilution of this tracer by N from the atmosphere. An average annual deposition of 64 ± 11 kg/ha <b>x</b> <b>year</b> from 1994 – 2000 was measured with the ITNI system at the Bad Lauchst?dt research farm in the dry belt of Central Germany. Measurements in 1999 / 2000 at three other sites in Central Germany produced deposition rates of about 60 kg/ha <b>x</b> <b>year.</b> These data clearly show that the total atmospheric N deposition into the soil/plant system determined by the newly developed ITNI system significantly exceeds that obtained from standard wet-only and bulk collectors.

A total of 722 ejaculates from 13 homozygous (CC), 7 heterozygous (CT) stress negative Piétrain and 10 Duroc CC boars was collected between 2008 and 2012. The sperm quality was assessed on each ejaculate using ejaculate volume (VOL), spermatozoa motility (MO), sperm concentration (CO) and total number of spermatozoids (NT). Genetic type of boars, season, year and (season <b>x</b> <b>year)</b> as well as (genetic type <b>x</b> <b>year)</b> interactions were included in the model as fixed factors. The results show that the semen quality was influenced by all studied effects (p< 0. 05) except VOL for season (p= 0. 45) and season <b>x</b> <b>year</b> (p= 0. 55), and CO for genetic type (p= 0. 93). VOL and NT (291. 74 ml and 103. 37 × 109 spz) of Piétrain CC were higher than those (241. 40 ml and 84. 58 × 109 spz) of Piétrain CT and (228. 05 ml and 77. 15 × 109 spz) of Duroc (p< 0. 001) although the values of the 3 genetic groups are in the range of normal semen.

Testing newly developed genotypes under several environments is important for evaluating stability of performance and range of adaptation. Twenty five F 1 and their 10 parents of sorghum were evaluated at two locations (Assiut and Qena governorates) under early and late sowing dates in both 2007 and 2008 summer seasons. Year effects were significant for the studied traits. Location and date effects had the largest impact on the studied traits. The interaction effects of genotype with each of locations and dates were highly significant for all studied traits whereas genotype <b>x</b> <b>year</b> interaction effect was highly significant for days to blooming, plant height and grain yield. Genotype <b>x</b> <b>year</b> x date interaction effect was highly significant for plant height, 1000 -grain weight and grain yield. However, genotype <b>x</b> <b>year</b> x location x date interaction effect was highly significant only for plant height and grain yield. Most of hybrids were significantly earlier, taller, heavier grain weight and higher grain yield compared to their parents and checks. Stability analysis for grain yield demonstrated that most of F 1 hybrids had higher yields than their parents, but the parents were relatively more stable. Four genotypes (three crosses; (A- 73 x R- 272), (A- 604 x R- 92010) and (A- 613 x R- 210) and one parent (R- 273)) were the best stable genotypes.

In this paper, restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of GxE components of variation were derived using trial means in both standard and extended models where concomitant genotype and location factors such as maturity, disease resistance, and experimental management regimes were investigated. Prior to estimating the variance components the heterogeneity of trial error variances was modelled. Several alternative trialing systems were compared using acceptance probabilities derived from the variance components. The interaction of genotype maturity with location considerably reduced the line x location <b>x</b> <b>year</b> variance component and further examination of the maturity x environment interaction suggested an advantage in stratifying the breeding program on maturity.

A randomized complete block design was used with four replicates, two locations, {{seven years and}} three periods per year. Stability analysis was based on clone <b>x</b> <b>year</b> and clone <b>x</b> <b>year</b> x location interactions. Five stability parameters viz environmental variance, shukla's stability variance, regression of clonal latex yield on environmental index, variance due to regression and variance due to deviation from regression were applied. There was significant clone x environment effect at the two levels of interaction. Among the eleven clones, C 162 was outstanding for clonal stability and it can serve as donor parent for stability alleles. Three clones (C 76, C 150 and C 154) were also stable. The four stable clones (C 76, C 150, C 154 and C 162) are suitable for broad-spectrum recommendation for latex yield.

Correlation amongst these characters showed positive association of number of grains per spike with grain yield, whereas grain protein percentage indicated negative associated with number grains per spike and grain yield under certain environments, however effect was inconsistent.

This index characterizes the cumulative lifetime exposure by integrating the estimated concentration of PCDD/F at every point in time (area under the curve). Production department-specific dose rates were derived from blood levels and working histories of 275 workers by applying a first-order kinetic model. These dose rates were used to estimate exposure levels for all cohort members. Total mortality was elevated in the cohort; 413 deaths yielded an SMR of 1. 15 (95 % confidence interval [Cl] 1. 05, 1. 27) compared to the mortality {{of the population of}} Germany. Overall cancer mortality (n = 124) was significantly increased (SMR = 1. 41, 95 % Cl 1. 17, 1. 68). Various cancer sites showed significantly increased SMRs.
