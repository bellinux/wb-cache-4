40|$|Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma ranks as the 15 th most common cancer worldwide. The present study was undertaken to standardise a protocol {{for the analysis of}} oral exfoliated cells using Raman microspectroscopy. For this purpose, samples were obtained from two different sites, based on prevalence of disease (ventral side of the tongue and buccal mucosa). Different oral rinsing agents were employed and it was concluded that non-alcoholic mouthwash adequately removes food debris. Samples were collected using various collection tools and compared. It was observed that endo-cervical brushes yielded cells from deeper layers of the epithelium. Furthermore, monolayer formation of cells was carried out adopting cytospin and ThinPrep techniques and only the ThinPrep method provided flat and separated cells on the glass slide. Raman spectra were acquired from the nuclear and cytoplasmic regions of the cell using an <b>XploRA</b> confocal Raman instrument (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with a 532 nm laser as the source. Glass spectral contamination was removed using non negatively constrained least squares (NNLS) algorithms. Corrected spectra were subjected to principal components analysis (PCA) which was able to differentiate the nucleus and cytoplasm regions of the cell; based on nucleic acid and protein features, respectively. However, no classification of the two anatomically different sites was observed according to PCA or PCA–LDA (linear discriminant analysis) using either the nuclear or cytoplasmic spectra. Nevertheless, the study has developed a standardised protocol for sample collection, sample preparation, spectral acquisition and data processing for future studies of oral exfoliated cells based on Raman microspectroscopy...|$|E

The chemical composition of the samples was characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS). EDXS analysis was typically performed at an accelerating voltage of 200  kV, using an Oxford Link-ISIS X-ray EDXS microanalysis system attached to SEM. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were measured by using a Nanoscope model MultiMode 8 Scanning Probe Microscope (Veeco Instrument, USA) with silicon cantilever probes.

40|$|There {{are several}} ways to characterise the {{hydrothermally}} degraded layer in metastable tetragonal zirconia ceramics: X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The aim {{of this study is to}} compare different surface characterization methods to get a more profound understanding of the degradation process taking place in dental zirconia ceramics after exposure to a humid environment. Fully-sintered IPS e. max ZirCAD (Ivoclar-Vivadent) blocks were sliced into rectangular bars with an approximate volume of 15 x 5 x 3 mm 3. Both the top and bottom surface of the specimen were mirror polished and analyzed by a θ- 2 θ XRD (Seifert 3003 TT, Seifert) in order to confirm that no monoclinic phase (m-phase) was present in the as-sintered ceramic. The low-temperature degradation test was performed at 134 °C for 4 hours under 2 bar within a custom-made autoclave. θ- 2 θ XRD was applied to both the top and bottom surface of the degraded sample. The diffraction patterns were compared with those recorded using a grazing incident XRD. Fracture surfaces of the degraded samples were analysed by micro-Raman spectroscopy (<b>XploRA,</b> Horiba). Finally, a micro-structural analysis was performed using SEM. Before hydrothermal treatment, no m-phase could be detected. After degradation, θ- 2 θ XRD revealed the presence of approximately 22 % m-phase within 8 μm of the sample. Grazing incident XRD showed that over 60 % m-phase was present down to a depth of 2 μm below the sample surface, while the proportion m-phase significantly decreased from 3 μm below the surface. Micro-Raman analysis indicated that the m-phase content decreased quite rapidly below the degraded sample surface, and even 2 µm below the surface was nearly absent. SEM disclosed that the thickness of the degraded layer varied significantly over the sample surfaces. It can be concluded that the three methodologies tested allow to quantify and characterise the hydrothermally degraded zones in dental zirconia ceramics. status: publishe...|$|E

Before SEM investigations, the prepared samples were coated with copper foil fixed by a conductive adhesive tape and covered with gold nanoparticles {{to make them more}} conductive. X-ray diffraction study was carried out by using an X-ray diffractometer (SmartLab, Rigaku, Japan) equipped with a conventional Cu Kα X-ray radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) source and a Bragg diffraction setup. Transmission Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a Nicolet iS 10 FT-IR spectrophotometer from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA) with an average of 16 scans and at a resolution of 4 cm− 1 by the conventional KBr disk tablet method. Thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) analyses of the samples were conducted in air condition by using a Netzsch STA 409 PC Luxx simultaneous thermal analyzer (Netzsch Instruments Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Germany).

30|$|Raman {{spectra of}} CM show {{significant}} peaks at 1355 – 1380 and 1575 – 1620  cm− 1, which {{are known as}} disordered (D) and graphite (G) bands, respectively (Tuinstra and Koenig 1970). Several spectral parameters {{have been used to}} evaluate the maturity of CM in metamorphic rocks (e.g., Beyssac et al. 2002; Aoya et al. 2010; Kouketsu et al. 2014; Nakamura et al. 2015) and fault rocks (e.g., Hirono et al. 2015; Kaneki et al. 2016; Kouketsu et al. 2017; Kuo et al. 2017). We followed the methods of Kaneki et al. (2016) to acquire our Raman spectra and spectral parameters. We used a Raman microspectrometer (<b>XploRA,</b> Horiba Jobin–Yvon Inc.) equipped with a laser (532  nm) to obtain Raman spectra of CM powder derived from the shale and from the samples heated at 1 and 100  °C s− 1. Before the measurements, samples were dried in an oven at 50  °C for several hours. Although the graphitic structure of CM has a crystallographic orientation (c-axis orientation), we did not control sample orientation during our spectral measurements because the orientation is unlikely to affect the Raman spectral features (Aoya et al. 2010). We used an exposure time of 10  s and a laser power of 0.09 – 0.11 mW to obtain spectra from the targeted surfaces to avoid thermal damage to the powder samples. Because Raman spectra obtained from the grain boundaries of CM particles might differ from those obtained from the body of CM particles (Tuinstra and Koenig 1970), we adopted a laser spot size of 5  µm as sufficiently smaller than the average CM particle size (approximately 100  µm). We then used PeakFit 3.0 software (Systat Software Inc.) to fit the D and G bands to the acquired spectra after a linear baseline correction of 1000 – 1800  cm− 1 (Additional file 2). We determined the intensities of both bands. To compare the spectral features among the acquired Raman spectra, we normalized the spectra so that the height of the strongest peak of each spectrum was the same among the spectra being compared. Ten spectra were obtained from each sample (one spectrum per CM particle), and the mean values and standard deviations of the intensity ratios of the D and G bands (ID/IG) were calculated. All of the calculated ID/IG ratios with their standard deviations are summarized in Additional file 3.|$|E
30|$|The {{polished}} {{sections were}} first observed by optical microscopy and then analyzed by field emission gun {{scanning electron microscopes}} (FEG-SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectrometers (EDS) and EBSD detectors (Hitachi S- 4500 at Department of Earth and Planetary Science, The University of Tokyo and Zeiss Supra 55 VP Schottki at NASA Johnson Space Center, TX, USA). We obtained forescatter electron (FSE) images and EBSD maps using the Zeiss SEM. The FSE images are dominated by orientation contrast and give grain and subgrain structures. Then, these particles were analyzed by electron microprobe (JEOL JXA 8900 L at Department of Earth and Planetary Science, The University of Tokyo) using well-characterized natural and synthetic standards. For all phases, the accelerating voltage was 15  kV. For olivine, the beam current was 12  nA with a focused beam. For plagioclase, a defocused beam (5 to 10  μm in diameter) was used with a beam current of 6 to 8  nA to minimize volatile loss. We employed a ZAF correction for the data reduction of the electron microprobe analysis. The detection limits by electron microprobe analyses are 0.02 SiO 2, 0.02 Al 2 O 3, 0.05 TiO 2, 0.04 FeO, 0.02 MnO, 0.02 MgO, 0.02 CaO, 0.02 Na 2 O, 0.02 K 2 O, 0.02 Cr 2 O 3, 0.04 NiO, and 0.04 P 2 O 5 (wt%) for olivine and 0.03 SiO 2, 0.03 Al 2 O 3, 0.12 TiO 2, 0.05 FeO, 0.03 MnO, 0.03 MgO, 0.03 CaO, 0.03 Na 2 O, 0.03 K 2 O, 0.03 Cr 2 O 3, 0.07 NiO, and 0.05 P 2 O 5 (wt%) for plagioclase. For a few polished sections, a micro-Raman spectrometer was employed to confirm the constituent phases and document their crystallinity (Horiba <b>Xplora</b> at Mineral State Collection, Munich, Germany). The range of wave number for Raman is 50 to 2, 500  cm− 1. The polished sections and RA-QD 02 - 0049 - 2 were also analyzed by SR-XRD using an energy scanning method at BL 37 XU, SPring- 8. The beam size is approximately 1  μm. Details of the SR-XRD measurement are described in Hagiya et al. (2010). For plagioclase in RA-QD 02 - 0100 and RA-QD 02 - 0133 - 1, we performed SR iron X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements to determine the presence of Fe 3 + at BL- 4 A, Photon Factory (PF), High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK, Ibaraki, Japan) using the method described in Monkawa et al.
