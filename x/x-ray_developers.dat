40|$|The Spanish {{market of}} Children and Young people’s Literature {{has been on}} the rise in recent decades and has {{undergone}} an exponential increase since introduction of ICT and the acquisition of digital contents which are dedicated to the children and young audience. For this reason, this research aims to show brief <b>X-ray</b> <b>developers</b> of a particular kind of ebooks, enhanced ebooks in Anglo-Saxon terminology, to set aside children and young people in Spain. Due to the lack of studies on these kinds of ebooks in the Children and Young people’s literature in Spain, an exploratory methodology has been applied. On the one hand, it’s based on the collection of primary and secondary sources of information, and on the other hand, an orderly and systematic survey of controlled variables has been created to obtain the answers from developers of enhanced ebooks. The purpose is to know the intrinsic characteristics that define its; to analyze the changes in the business model through the production, marketing and promotion of enhanced ebooks; and finally, to outline the future prospects these companies both application books in Spanish Children and Young people’s literature subsector; showing that they are young companies, composed by interdisciplinary teams and advocating the renewal of the business model through the integration of digital media, online sales platforms and 2. 0 Social Media tools...|$|E

50|$|In 1970, {{the company}} name was changed to Dürr Dental GmbH & Co. KG. Subsequently the {{laboratory}} business was established in 1972 due to the development and production of the Multivac vacuum embedding unit for Degussa. From 1973, compressors were produced for North America on Long Island (New York) under the name Engineering Dental Industry. The year 1974 welcomed {{the introduction of the}} dry air unit for compressors for the protection of dental instruments from oxidation and from the growth of microorganisms in the pressure tank. In 1975, the Dürr 1330 <b>X-ray</b> film <b>developer</b> reached the market. This enabled the complete automation of the X-ray film development of all dental formats.

40|$|Abstract Background Exposures to {{high doses}} of irradiation, to chemotherapy, benzene, {{petroleum}} products, paints, embalming fluids, ethylene oxide, herbicides, pesticides, and smoking {{have been associated with}} an increased risk of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Although there in no epidemiological evidence of relation between <b>X-ray</b> <b>developer,</b> fixer and replenisher liquids and AML, these included glutaraldehyde which has weakly associated with lymphocytic leukemia in rats and hydroquinone has been increasingly implicated in producing leukemia, causing DNA and chromosomal damage, inhibits topo-isomerase II, alter hematopoiesis and inhibit apoptosis of neoplastic cells. Case presentation Two white females (A and B) hired in 1985 as medical radiation technologists in a primary care center, in Greece. In July 2001, woman A, 38 -years-old, was diagnosed as having acute monocytic leukaemia (FAB M 5). The patient did not respond to therapy and died threeweeks later. In August 2001, woman B, 35 -year-old, was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (FAB M 3). Since discharge, she is in continuous complete remission. Both women were non smokers without any medical history. Shortly after these incidents official inspectors and experts inspected workplace, examined equipment, archives of repairs, notes, interviewed and monitored employees. They concluded that shielding was inadequate for balcony's door but personal monitoring did not show any exceeding of TLV of 20 mSv yearly and cytogenetics analysis did not reveal findings considered to be characteristics of ionizing exposure. Equipment for developing photos had a long list of repairs, mainly leakages of liquids and increases of temperature. On several occasions the floor has been flooded especially during 1987 – 1993 and 1997 – 2001. Inspection confirmed a complete lack of ventilation and many spoiled medical x-ray films. Employees reported that an "osmic" level was continuously evident and frequently developed symptoms of respiratory irritation and dizziness. Conclusion The findings support the hypothesis that the specific AML cases might have originated from exposure to chemicals, especially hydroquinone and/or glutaraldehyde. The report also emphasises the crucial role of inspection of facilities and enforcement of compliance with regulations in order to prevent similar incidents. </p...|$|R
40|$|Diseases {{affecting}} the respiratory and cardiovascular systems {{are on the}} increase {{in many developing countries}} and often lead to death. Life style and work environment tend to contribute to the ugly development which is worsened by lack of the right drugs for treatment. Empirical observations showed that the disease was seen more in people exposed to chemical fumes. Unfortunately, majority of the radiology practices in developing countries including Nigeria is darkroom-based, thus exposing radiographers and darkroom staff to x-ray film processing chemical fumes. This experimental research was aimed at investigating the cardiopulmonary reactions in wistar rats exposed to <b>x-ray</b> film <b>developer</b> solutions of varying concentrations. Eighteen apparently healthy wistar rats of 20 - 24 week weighing between 208 g and 210 g were put in three groups A-C of 6 rats each. Group A was the control group while groups Band C were the experimental groups. The rats in the experimental groups were exposed to varying concentrations of the <b>x-ray</b> film <b>developer</b> solution fumes for periods ranging from 15 - 30 days (1 st - 30 th June, 2014) while the rats in the control group were not. At the end of each desired period, two rats from each group were randomly selected, painlessly sacrificed and the lungs and hearts harvested and sent to the medical laboratory sciences department of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital for examination and analysis. Micrographs of the lungs tissues in the experimental groups showed histological changes of tissue injury evidenced by macrophage infiltration, distortion of interstitial tissue architecture, thickening of basement membrane, tissue fibrosis and formation of pleomorphic nuclei which are inflammatory responses indicating cellular injuries. The observed histological changes increased with the concentration of the developer solution and the duration of exposure to the developer solution. Micrographs of the hearts in the experimental and control groups showed normal histological appearances. When the changes in the lungs are extrapolated to a 70 kg human subject, these histological changes would manifest within twenty-five year of exposure to the developer solution...|$|R

This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the prevalence of calcified carotid artery in 50 year-old and older postmenopausal dental outpatients for early diagnosis of individuals at risk of stroke. &# 13; Materials and methods. This is a descriptive study of 200 panoramic radiographs. These radiographs included postmenopausal women referring to the Department of Oral Medicine at Shahid Beheshti Faculty of Dentistry during 2006 - 2007. The <b>x-ray</b> machine, <b>developer</b> and film type were the same for all the radiographs. Statistical analysis included chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test. &# 13; Results. We found 22 calcified carotid arteries. The left and right carotid arteries were involved in 7 and 9 cases, respectively. In 6 cases both carotid arteries were calcified. Four individuals had no vascular risk factor excluding age and others had at least one risk factor. We found significant statistical correlation between hypertension, past history of myocardial infarction, and hypercholesterolemia with calcified carotid artery on panoramic radiographs. &# 13; Conclusion. Under the limitations of the present study, prevalence of calcified carotid arteries is 11. 0 % in 50 year-old and older postmenopausal dental outpatients...|$|R
