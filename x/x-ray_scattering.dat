In general, single-crystal X-ray diffraction offers more structural information than these other techniques; however, it requires a sufficiently large and regular crystal, which is not always available.|$|E
5|$|For {{all above}} {{mentioned}} X-ray diffraction methods, the scattering is elastic; the scattered X-rays {{have the same}} wavelength as the incoming X-ray. By contrast, inelastic <b>X-ray</b> <b>scattering</b> methods are useful in studying excitations of the sample, rather than the distribution of its atoms.|$|E
5|$|Other particles, such as {{electrons}} and neutrons, {{may be used}} to produce a diffraction pattern.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose: Detector {{characterization}} with modulation {{transfer function}} (MTF), noise power spectrum (NPS) and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) inadequately predicts image quality when the imaging system includes patient scatter. This contribution investigates {{the effect of}} <b>x-ray</b> <b>scatter</b> on the MTF and NPS in mammography to characterize the system in clinical situations. Material and Methods: A full-field digital mammography unit was characterized at 28 kV Mo/Mo at two beam qualities with and without <b>x-ray</b> <b>scatter.</b> Pre-sampling MTF and NPS without scatter were measured according to the IEC 62220 - 2 standard. The same imaging parameters were measured again with a mammography test object that simulates <b>x-ray</b> <b>scatter</b> due to the breast. Results: <b>X-ray</b> <b>scatter</b> causes a falloff of MTF (6 % at very low spatial frequency (0. 1 mm- 1) and 9. 5 % {{for the rest of}} the spectra) and adds a constant amount of noise (3 % from 0. 5 to 2 pl/mm, 6 % from 2. 5 to 4 pl/mm and 8 % from 4. 5 pl/mm to the Nyquist frequency). This increase in image noise is related to the amount of scatter integrated by the detector. The reduction of MTF and the increment of noise implies the drop of the DQE at all frequencies. Conclusion: The properties of an image receptor are properly characterized with a scatter free beam. In clinical situations, detectors are used with <b>x-ray</b> <b>scatter</b> from the patient. The use of a test object including scatter to measure MTF and NPS describes the resolution and noise properties of the imaging system with regard to scatter from the patient...|$|R

5|$|As {{described}} in the mathematical derivation below, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>scattering</b> {{is determined by the}} density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of an X-ray is much greater than that of a valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of the scattered radiation.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{is related}} to several other methods for determining atomic structures. Similar diffraction patterns can be produced by scattering electrons or neutrons, which are likewise interpreted by Fourier transformation. If single crystals of sufficient size cannot be obtained, various other X-ray methods {{can be applied to}} obtain less detailed information; such methods include fiber diffraction, powder diffraction and (if the sample is not crystallized) small-angle <b>X-ray</b> <b>scattering</b> (SAXS).|$|E
5|$|Anomalous <b>X-ray</b> <b>scattering</b> (MAD or SAD phasing)â€“ the X-ray {{wavelength}} may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above {{and in the middle}} of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E

5|$|In principle, {{an atomic}} {{structure}} could be determined from applying <b>X-ray</b> <b>scattering</b> to non-crystalline samples, {{even to a}} single molecule. However, crystals offer a much stronger signal due to their periodicity. A crystalline sample is by definition periodic; a crystal is composed of many unit cells repeated indefinitely in three independent directions. Such periodic systems have a Fourier transform that is concentrated at periodically repeating points in reciprocal space known as Bragg peaks; the Bragg peaks correspond to the reflection spots observed in the diffraction image. Since the amplitude at these reflections grows linearly with the number N of scatterers, the observed intensity of these spots should grow quadratically, like N2. In other words, using a crystal concentrates the weak scattering of the individual unit cells into a much more powerful, coherent reflection that can be observed above the noise. This {{is an example of}} constructive interference.|$|E
5|$|Only {{microscopic}} {{quantities of}} plutonium were available until the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works came online on 4 November 1943, {{but there were}} already some worrying signs. When plutonium fluoride was produced at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it was sometimes light colored, and sometimes dark, although the chemical process was the same. When they managed to reduce it to plutonium metal in November 1943, the density was measured at 15g/cm3, and a measurement using <b>X-ray</b> <b>scattering</b> techniques pointed to a density of 13g/cm3. This was bad; it had been assumed that its density {{was the same as}} uranium, about 19g/cm3. If these figures were correct, far more plutonium would be needed for a bomb. Kennedy disliked Seaborg's ambitious and attention-seeking manner, and with Arthur Wahl had devised a procedure for plutonium purification independent of Seaborg's group. When they got hold of a sample in February, this procedure was tested. That month the Metallurgical Laboratory announced that it had determined that there were two different fluorides: the light colored plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4) and the dark plutonium trifluoride (PuF3). The chemists soon discovered how to make them selectively, and the former turned out to be easier to reduce to metal. Measurements in March 1944 indicated a density of between 19 and 20g/cm3.|$|E

The analyzer grating reduced incoherent scatter by ~ 18 % for 2 cm thick adipose breast and by ~ 35 % for 8 cm thick fibroglandular breast.

25|$|<b>X-ray</b> <b>scattering</b> {{techniques}} {{are some of}} the most useful techniques for determining the structural identification and shape of lipids.

The disadvantage is that it can be difficult to determine patterns in lipids that are not well oriented such as non-lamellar phases. Although this can be a limitation in producing electron density reconstructions in lipids, X-ray diffraction is still a reliable method for obtaining structural information and distinguishing between lamellar and non-lamellar phases.|$|E

Techniques such as wide angle <b>X-ray</b> <b>scattering,</b> small angle <b>X-ray</b> <b>scattering,</b> and small angle neutron scattering are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow us to know a bit of the phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an analytical method in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average molar mass and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, polyelectrolyte synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including emulsion polymerization, adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E
