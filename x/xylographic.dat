In it there is a Planetarium, a Museum of Natural History, a <b>Xylographic</b> Exposition of the works of Romeo Musa, an Art Gallery and a gigantic National Library. A third church, the Oratorio dei Disciplinati, added its beautiful bell tower to the skyline of the town up until 1950. Due to issues related to the structures alleged instability, the tower was demolished and the church was desecrated. The Sanctuary of the Madonna di S. Marco (Madonna of S. Mark), built in 1939, houses one wooden statue created in 1531 representing the Madonna with Child on throne.The ancient Arc of Entrance to the old town is now being included in the breathtaking system of the [...] "Peschiera Park".

50|$|He {{started his}} artistic {{activity}} in the 1920s by training as textile designer and by practising photography. He was introduced by Raffaelle Giolli {{in a group of}} Italian intellectuals associated with the review Poligono. At the age of 20, he was interested for painting and took lessons with the Neapolitan painter Carmelo Violante, then professor at the Accademia Carrara of Bergamo (Italy). In 1932 he travelled to Paris and met Fernand Léger. His first works were presented in the Gallery Il Milione in Milan. They were still figurative. Later, Veronesi started to research in the direction of abstract art. In 1934, he exhibits <b>xylographic</b> works with the German artist Josef Albers in the Gallery Il Milione. In the same year he joined the photographic group Abstraction-Création in Paris, he experimented constructivism, and adhered to the Bauhaus method. On 4 March 1935, he participated to the first collective exhibition of abstract art of Italy in the atelier of the painters Felice Casorati and Enrico Paolucci in Turin together with the artists Oreste Bogliardi, Cristoforo De Amicis, Ezio D'Errico, Lucio Fontana, Virginio Ghiringhelli, Osvaldo Licini, Fausto Melotti, Mauro Reggiani and Atanasio Soldati, who signed the Manifest of the first collective exhibition of Italian abstract art. In 1936, Veronesi was the illustrator of a geometry book of Leonardo Sinisgalli and he participated to the triennal of Milan. In that year he also participated to an exhibition of abstract art in the city of Como (Italy) with the artists Lucio Fontana, Virginio Ghiringhelli, Osvaldo Licini, Alberto Magnelli, Fausto Melotti, Enrico Prampolini, Mario Radice, Mauro Reggiani, Manlio Rho and Atanasio Soldati. In 1939 he made a personal exhibition in the Gallerie L'Equipe in Paris.|$|E
40|$|As a {{preliminary}} consideration for research into <b>xylographic</b> editions in Tibetan non-canonical literature, {{in this paper}} I have attempted to research the <b>xylographic</b> printing projects on Tibetan non-canonical literature and the members that composed those projects, chiefly focusing on block prints related to the Sa-skya-pa tradition. This research first takes a general view of early period wood-block printing such as the Old Sa-skya edition, of the Derge edition of the 1730 s, and of early modern age wood-block printing, etc. Based on the descriptions in the Sa skya bka’ ‘bum, I then took the persons in charge of each wood-block printing work into consideration. Finally, I introduced some of the methods of analyzing woodcut information from the various traces left in the print blocks...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a direct co-relationship between the {{printing}} industry and volume of publication in the country. Printing {{is not a new}} art. Traditional <b>xylographic</b> printing has been in existence for hundred of years in dzong and lhakhang. There, indigenous printing presses were established. Some of them still exist today. The National Library has a mini <b>xylographic</b> printing press and has about 10, 000 wooden blocks covering about 20 religious texts. The construction of dzong in the 17 th century and introduction of monastic syllabus across the country promoted the writings and publications of religious texts. The publishing industry in Bhutan has been gradually expanding and increasing their output over the last few years. The number of printers has shot up from just one in 1983 to about 65 as of June 2000 although 64 % of them are concentrated in Thimphu. The approximate total output {{in the last ten years}} has been just over 600 publications (excluding school text books). However, the rate of output has increased every year. Many printing and publishing housesare being established. But there has been no agency in Bhutan to co-ordinate and standardize use of identifying numbers for various publications. The need to streamline system of identification for publications along international standard has been long felt...|$|E

40|$|In {{conjunction}} with raising some questions regarding “genre” in Edo literature, {{the purpose of}} this thesis is to introduce a complete annotated translation of Kyōkun hyakumonogatari 教訓百物語 (One Hundred Scary Tales for Moral Instruction) by the Shingaku teacher Murai Yoshikiyo 村井由清 (1752 - 1813). Published in 1804 and reprinted several times, this text was intended as a guide to self-cultivation and ethical living based on Shingaku 心学, a philosophico-religious movement of great importance {{in the latter half of}} the Edo era. The translation is complemented with a transcription into modern script based on publicly available (online) digital images of an 1815 <b>xylographic</b> edition. Considering the work as one example of transgenred literature, in the introduction I explore the intellectual and historical contexts of the work, paying special attention to the contemporary category of textbook called ōraimono 往来物. I also consider for reference a kibyōshi 黄表紙 called Shingaku hayasomegusa 心学早染草, published in 1790 by Santō Kyōden 山東京伝, as another example both of transgenred literature itself and of literary responses to the same socio-intellectual moment, specifically the Edo world in the aftermath of the Kansei reforms (1787 - 93) ...|$|E
40|$|Czech Illustrated Magazines of the Second Half of the 19 th Century Markéta Dlábková Abstract of {{the thesis}} Illustrated {{magazines}} are specific {{phenomenon in the}} 19 th century culture. Between the 1860 s and 1890 s they published {{an enormous number of}} pictorial materials of diverse content and quality. Apart from general social importance they {{played a significant role in}} the world of art as well. Today they can serve as a beneficial source of knowledge about situation on Czech as well as European art scene in the period. The so-called penny-magazines of the 1830 s can be seen as predecessors of illustrated magazines. They presented a cheap and popular source of knowledge and amusement, together with considerable amount of <b>xylographic</b> illustrations. However, it was the second half of the 19 th century that witnessed a real boom of illustrated magazines. At the beginning of the 1840 s, the Illustrated London News, the Leipziger Illustrirte Zeitung and L'Illustration established the character of this type of periodicals. In following years there were many other magazines rising throughout entire Europe. In the Czech lands, first examples of the type can be found at the end of the 1850 s. Květy (1865 - 1872), Světozor (1867 - 1899) and Zlatá Praha (1884 - 1929) belong among the most successful periodicals. The thesis deals [...] ...|$|E
