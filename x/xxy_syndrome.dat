50|$|Klinefelter {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} 47, XXY and <b>XXY</b> <b>syndrome)</b> - A condition that describes a male born {{with at least}} one extra female chromosome. Though the most common variation is 47, XXY, a man may also be 48, XXXY or 49, XXXXY. It is a common occurrence, affecting 1 in 500 to 1,000 men. While some men may have no issues related to the syndrome, some may experience gynecomastia, micropenis, cognitive difficulties, hypogonadism, reduced fertility/infertility, and/or little or no facial hair. Testosterone therapy may be pursued by men who desire a more masculine appearance and those with gynecomastia may opt to undergo a reduction mammoplasty.

Despite this milestone not the <b>XXY</b> <b>syndrome</b> but the XYY syndrome is instead sometimes called Jacobs syndrome: After it had been incidentally discovered by Avery Sandberg in 1961, the syndrome was also found in a chromosome survey of 315 men at a hospital for developmentally disabled, made by Jacobs and hence considered the first little research on it. However, that selection had been too little for a meaningful result, so that individuals of this syndrome were mischaracterized as aggressive and violent criminals, which led the path for many biased studies on height-selected, institutionalized XYY individuals.|$|E

40|$|Klinefelter syndrome, {{also known}} as <b>XXY</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is a fairly common genetic {{condition}} found in males only. It occurs when a boy is born with an extra sex chromosome in {{most or all of}} his cells. Many boys with Klinefelter syndrome have no signs or symptoms, and some don't even know they have it until later in life. Klinefelter syndrome typically causes a boy's testicles to grow at a slower rate than those of other boys. It also prevents the testicles from producing normal amounts of sperm and the hormone testosterone. Testosterone affects the way a boy develops both physically and sexually. Low hormone levels and problems with sperm production make it difficult or sometimes impossible for a boy with Klinefelter syndrome to father a child later in life...|$|E

40|$|Klinefelter's {{syndrome}} {{is the most}} common genetic disorder in which {{there is at least one}} extra X chromosome. Males normally have an X chromosome and a Y chromosome (XY). But males who have Klinefelter syndrome have an extra X chromosome (XXY), giving them a total of 47 instead of the normal 46 chromosomes. Sex chromosome abnormalities are more frequently associated with male infertility. The prevalence of XXYs has risen from 1. 09 to 1. 72 per 1 000 male births. A patient attended to fertility and genetic clinic, during the clinical diagnosis we found the following complaints of loss of secondary sexual characteristics and infertility. Physical examination revealed breast development, thin built, small size testes, and absence of beard and pubic hairs. Karyotype and biochemical analysis were performed to detect chromosomal abnormality as well as hormonal level to confirm the diagnosis of Klinefelter's syndrome. Chromosomal analysis of the peripheral blood lymphocytes demonstrated the constitutional karyotype of 47, XXY. Using karyotype the presence of extra X chromosome was confirmed, supporting the cytogenetic finding. The 47, <b>XXY</b> <b>syndrome</b> is relatively uncommon and can be missed clinically because of its variable clinical presentations.

40|$|Symposium Description: Genetic {{disorders}} can initially manifest with {{a specific}} pattern of psychological dysfunctions and/or behavioural disorders. This holds for genetic disorders resulting from large chromosomal abnormalities {{but also for the}} many novel microdeletion syndromes that have been described recently. A well-known example of the first category is Klinefelter or <b>XXY</b> <b>syndrome,</b> while 17 q 21. 31 microdeletion syndrome (17 qMDS) and Kleefstra syndrome (KS) are examples of the last. KS was originally described as the 9 q subtelomeric deletion syndrome associated with marked mental retardation, specific dysmorphisms, particular sleep disturbances, and progressive deterioration and apathy, suggestive for a ‘neurodegenerative phenotype’. Haploinsufficiency of the EHMT 1 gene has proven to be the causative factor. 17 qMDS, thought to be caused by MAPT haploinsufficiency, comprises moderate mental retardation, dysmorphisms and various congenital anomalies. Hypersociability has been suggested to be part of its behavioural phenotype. There is great variability in the degree to which genetic disorders are investigated on behavioural and neurocognitive variables. For instance, Noonan syndrome (NS), a relatively common autosomal dominant congenital disorder often caused by a mutation of genes in the Ras/MAP kinase pathway (e. g., PTPN 11, KRAS, and SOS 1), has been described from a neuropsychological perspective only very recently. In this symposium, an overview will be given of modern genetic analysis techniques followed by recent findings on neuropsychological and psychopathological phenotypes of 17 qMDS, XXY, NS, and KS. It is concluded that in all of the above syndromes, neuropsychological examination was able to demonstrate specific patterns of neurocognitive development and social interaction. Findings will be discussed as to their potential to further clarify the genotype-phenotype relation and to establish individualized behavioural and clinical management programs...|$|E

40|$|How and why female somatic X-chromosome {{inactivation}} (XCI) {{evolved in}} mammals remains poorly understood. Ohno proposed a two-step process where XCI is a dosage-compensation mechaQ: 7 nism that evolved to equalize expression levels of X-linked genes in females (2 X) and males (1 X), with a prior twofold increase in expression of X-linked genes in both sexes [Ohno S (1967) (Springer, Berlin) ]. Whereas the parity of X chromosome expression {{between the sexes}} has been clearly demonstrated, tests for the doubling of expression levels globally along the X chromosome have returned contradictory results. However, changes in gene dosage during sex-chromosome evolution {{are not expected to}} impact on all genes equally, and should have greater consequences for dosage-sensitive genes. We show that, for genes encoding components of large protein complexes (! 7 members) ?a class of genes that is expected to be dosage-sensitive?expression of X-linked genes {{is similar to that of}} autosomal genes within the complex. These data support Ohno?s hypothesis that XCI acts as a dosage-compensation mechanism, and allow us to re!ne Ohno?s model of XCI evolution. We also explore the contribution of dosage- sensitive genes to X aneuploidy phenotypes in humans, such as Turner (X 0) and Klinefelter (<b>XXY)</b> <b>syndromes.</b> X aneuploidy in humans is common and is known to have mild effects because most of the supernumerary X genes are inactivated and not affected by aneuploidy.

50|$|Queer theorists {{focus on}} {{problems}} in classifying individuals as either male or female, {{even on a}} strictly biological basis.

40|$|The {{presence}} of a translocation between two chromosomes in the I 3 -I 5 (D) group does not usually give rise to any phenotypical abnormality and may be relatively common in the population (Hamerton, Giannelli, and Carter, I 963).

25|$|The {{existence}} of genes along the inactive X {{which are not}} silenced explains the defects in humans with abnormal numbers of the X chromosome, such as Turner syndrome (X0) or Klinefelter <b>syndrome</b> (<b>XXY).</b> Theoretically, X-inactivation should eliminate the differences in gene dosage between affected individuals and individuals with a normal chromosome complement.

The samples studied represented cases of oligozoospermia, cryptorchidism, Swyer syndrome, Turner <b>syndrome,</b> male pseudoher-maphroditism, <b>XXY</b> female <b>syndrome,</b> Klinefelter’s syndrome, repeated abortion and instances of male infertility. Chromoso-mal constitutions {{and the level of}} hormones (FSH, LH, PRL, E 2 and TSH) were found to be abnormal in several cases. A phenotypic female (P 20) positive for all the Y-linked loci screened, showed mutations upstream of the HMG box in the SRY gene. In addition, {{one or more of the}} Y-linked loci were detected in several phenotypic females. Fluorescence in-situ hybridiz-ation of metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei of an aborted fetus with DYZ 1 probe detected signals from normal to low levels to its complete absence confirming a complex Y chromosome mosaicism. Upon DNA analysis, the fetus was found to be positive for all the above-mentioned Y-linked loci. Organizational variation within the DYZ 1 arrays and its correlation with recurrent spontaneous abortion may be followed-up in subsequent studies to substantiate this observation. This would augment genetic counselling to the affected couples. Prospects of this approach in the overall management of clinical cases with sex chromosome-related anomalies are discussed.

We assess the frequency of sex chromosome aneuploidies in individuals with language impairment or dyslexia. Method Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was performed in three sample sets: a clinical cohort of individuals with speech and language deficits (87 probands: 61 males, 26 females; age range 4 to 23 years), a replication cohort of individuals with SLI, from both clinical and epidemiological samples (209 probands: 139 males, 70 females; age range 4 to 17 years), and a set of individuals with dyslexia (314 probands: 224 males, 90 females; age range 7 to 18 years). Results In the clinical language-impaired cohort, three abnormal karyotypic results were identified in probands (proband yield 3. 4 %). In the SLI replication cohort, six abnormalities were identified providing a consistent proband yield (2. 9 %).

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is designed to}} show the diagnostic implications of chromosomal abnormalities, and how in some cases chromosome analysis may be helpful in prognosis and counselling. Most males with Klinefelter's syndrome have chromatinpositive nuclei and an abnormal sex chromosome complex (usually <b>XXY).</b> In Turner's <b>syndrome</b> many such females have chromatin-negative nuclei and a deficient sex chromosome complex (usually XO). Multiple-X females have unusual chromatin patterns (two or three masses of sex chromatin) and abnormal sex chromosome complexes (XXX, XXXX, XO/XXX, etc.). One of {{the parents of a}} translocation mongol may carry a translocation chromosome and pass it to future children. Cytogenetic data are therefore essential for genetic counselling. Mosaic and deletion mongols may show incomplete manifestations of mongolism, which make diagnosis difficult; chromosome analysis is helpful in diagnosis, and in prognosis concerning mental development. Abnormal chromosome numbers result from non-disjunction, usually during gametogenesis. The error may occur, however, during cleavage, producing cells with different chromosome complements (mosaicism). Visible structural abnormalities of chromosomes result from deletions or translocations of chromosome fragments...|$|R

Rates of SCA diagnoses in infants and children are increasing, and {{there is a need for}} specialized interdisciplinary care to address associated risks. The eXtraordinarY Kids Clinic was established to provide comprehensive and experienced care for children and adolescents with SCA, with an interdisciplinary team composed of developmental–behavioral pediatrics, endocrinology, genetic counseling, child psychology, pediatric neuropsychology, speech–language pathology, occupational therapy, nursing, and social work. The clinic model includes an interdisciplinary approach to care, where assessment results by each discipline are integrated to develop unified diagnostic impressions and treatment plans individualized for each patient. Additional objectives of the eXtraordinarY Kids Clinic program include prenatal genetic counseling, research, education, family support, and advocacy. Methods: Satisfaction surveys were distributed to 496 patients, and responses were received from 168 unique patients. Results: Satisfaction with the overall clinic visit was ranked as “very satisfied” in 85 %, and as “satisfied” in another 9. 8 %.

KS is associated with hypogonadism and is suspected to cause variable physical, physiological and cognitive abnormalities. As a supernumerary X chromosome is also associated with infertility, sound animal models for KS are difficult to obtain. In this study, male mice with two X chromosomes (XXYlow asterisk) were derived from fathers carrying a structurally rearranged Y chromosome (Ylow asterisk) that resulted in physical attachment of a part of the Y chromosome to one X. These animals display certain physiological features that resemble closely those of human KS and can also be utilized to study X chromosomal imbalance and cognition. Therefore 15 XXYlow asterisk males and 15 XYlow asterisk controls were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests, including a general health check, analysis of spontaneous exploration and locomotor activity, measures for anxiety-related behavior and the “novel object task” to test memory performance. Physiologically, XYlow asterisk males did not differ from C 57 Bl/ 6 wild type mice carrying a normal Y chromosome, which provided a valid control group. All mice appeared healthy. XXYlow asterisk mice did not differ from their wild type littermates with respect to locomotion, exploration and anxiety-related behavior. XXYlow asterisk male mice, however, exhibited no significant recognition memory performance in contrast with wild type XYlow asterisk males that readily fulfilled a given task. These findings support the hypothesis that the presence of a supernumerary X in male mice influences cognitive abilities. We suggest that the altered endocrine state and/or changes in the dosage of X-linked genes in the XXYlow asterisk mouse model affect brain function, in particular those regions responsible for cognition and learning behavior...|$|R

Median (2. 5 - 97. 5 percentiles) INSL 3 serum levels were as follows: normal men (n = 135), 0. 99 (0. 55 - 1. 73) ng/ml; infertile men (n = 23), 1. 11 (0. 60 - 2. 07) ng/ml; anorchid men (n = 21), nondetectable (ND); patients with 47, <b>XXY,</b> Klinefelter <b>syndrome</b> (n = 21), 0. 12 (ND- 0. 78) ng/ml; men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and T substitution (n = 11), ND; and men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment (n = 5), 0. 36 (0. 13 - 0. 73) ng/ml. Before testicular biopsy, two infertile men had blood samples drawn directly from vena spermatica. Here, the serum INSL 3 levels were 15 -fold higher than in serum from peripheral blood samples (13. 84 and 14. 00 ng/ml, respectively). In two unilaterally orchiectomized former testis cancer patients, who underwent hCG stimulation test, INSL 3 serum levels were unchanged 72 and 96 h after hCG stimulation. In conclusion, we provide a normal range for INSL 3 serum levels in adult men and show that the majority, if not all, circulating INSL 3 derives from the testes. Furthermore, our data strongly indicate that INSL 3 secretion {{is dependent on the}} differentiating effect of LH on Leydig cells but independent of the steroidogenic LH-mediated action. Thus, even though T and INSL 3 are both dependent on LH, these two Leydig cell hormones are regulated differently. K. Bay, S. Hartung, R. Ivell, M. Schumacher, D. Jürgensen, N. Jorgensen, M. Holm, N.
