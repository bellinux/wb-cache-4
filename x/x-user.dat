40|$|A {{number of}} models exist for {{connection}} establishment, ranging from traditional control plane solutions based on signalling procedures to connection management architectures based on distributed computing technologies. This paper concentrates on those approaches {{relevant to the}} establishment of semi-permanent connections through the activity of the management plane; concentrating, in particular, on the issues related to inter-domain connections requiring federation between connection management systems. Three approaches are analysed and compared in this paper: the TMN approach, based on the <b>X-user</b> and Xcoop interfaces, using OSI systems management as the underlying technology; the TINA approach, using the ConS and LNFed reference points, with CORBA as the base technology for the computing architecture; and an approach based on intelligent agents and mobile code using OMG's MAF as the enabling technology. The three approaches are compared from the points of view of architecture and tec [...] ...|$|E
