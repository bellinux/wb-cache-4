50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Digitalis-derived digoxin, used to treat heart failure, induced <b>xanthopsia</b> responsible for the yellow tinting exhibited by many of Van Gogh's works.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xanthopsia</b> {{is also a}} rare side-effect of jaundice, {{in which}} {{bilirubin}} may be deposited into the eye in sufficient quantity to produce a yellow tint to the vision.|$|E
5000|$|While absinthe is {{certainly}} more infamous for its content of thujone, the liquor does also contain {{small amounts of}} santonin [...] It has been speculated by some parties that Impressionist art—in particular, Van Gogh's artwork—may have been inspired not by thujone and its presumed psychotropic effects, but on the [...] "yellow vision" [...] or <b>xanthopsia</b> which is a known side effect of santonin. This has been disputed, however, most notably by Arnold and Loftus (1991) who have noted the santonin content would have been insufficient to cause <b>xanthopsia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Edmund Rose {{is remembered}} for his {{research}} of color blindness, <b>xanthopsia</b> {{and the drug}} Santonin, and how Santonin affected color vision. In surgical medicine he performed important pathophysiological studies of cardiac tamponade (herztamponade), a term he coined in an 1884 treatise.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xanthopsia</b> is a {{color vision}} {{deficiency}} {{in which there}} is a predominance of yellow in vision due to a yellowing of the optical media of the eye. The most common cause is digoxin's inhibitory action on the sodium pump, and the development of cataracts which can cause a yellow filtering effect.|$|E
50|$|Digitalis {{toxicity}} (Digitalis intoxication) {{results from}} {{an overdose of}} digitalis and causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, as well as sometimes resulting in <b>xanthopsia</b> (jaundiced or yellow vision) {{and the appearance of}} blurred outlines (halos), drooling, abnormal heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias, weakness, collapse, dilated pupils, tremors, seizures, and even death. Bradycardia also occurs. Because a frequent side effect of digitalis is reduction of appetite, some individuals have used the drug as a weight-loss aid.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that van Gogh may have exhibited {{a form of}} digoxin toxicity from the foxglove plants used to treat his epilepsy. His yellow period ('yellow vision'), missing ear ('oto-toxicity') and penchant for painting halos around landscape objects ('halo vision') are often used by medical students as a mnemonic to remember the sequelae of digoxin toxicity. Speculation has been further fueled by Van Gogh's portrait of his physician, Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet (1890), in which Gachet holds Digitalis purpurea. But van Gogh was not treated with digitalis, and Dr. Arnold dismisses the plant {{as a cause of}} <b>xanthopsia</b> (yellow halos).|$|E
5000|$|Symptoms of {{oleandrin}} poisoning {{can cause}} both gastrointestinal and cardiac effects. The gastrointestinal effects can consist of nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, {{as well as}} higher salivation and diarrhea (which may contain blood). After these first symptoms, the heart may be affected by tachyarrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, premature ventricular contractions, or atrioventricular blockage. Also, <b>xanthopsia</b> (yellow vision), a burning sensation of the mucous membranes of the eyes, and gastrointestinal tract and respiratory paralysis can occur. [...] Reactions to poisonings from this plant can also affect the central nervous system. These symptoms can include drowsiness, tremors, or shaking of the muscles, seizures, collapse, and even coma {{that can lead to}} death. Oleander sap can cause skin irritations, severe eye inflammation and irritation, and allergy reactions characterized by dermatitis when administered topically.|$|E
5000|$|The {{entire plant}} is toxic (including {{the roots and}} seeds). Mortality is rare, but case reports do exist. Most plant {{exposures}} occur in children younger than six years and are usually unintentional and without associated significant toxicity. More serious toxicity occurs with intentional ingestions by adolescents and adults. Early symptoms of ingestion include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, wild hallucinations, delirium, and severe headache. Depending on {{the severity of the}} toxicosis, the victim may later suffer irregular and slow pulse, tremors, various cerebral disturbances, especially of a visual nature (unusual colour visions (see <b>xanthopsia)</b> with objects appearing yellowish to green, and blue halos around lights), convulsions, and deadly disturbances of the heart. For a case description, see the paper by Lacassie. Vincent van Gogh's [...] "Yellow Period" [...] may have been influenced by digitalis therapy which, at the time, was thought to control seizures. As noted above, other oculotoxic effects of digitalis include generalized blurry vision, as well as seeing a [...] "halo" [...] around each point of light.|$|E
5000|$|Santonin was {{an agent}} which (compared to more modern anthelminthic drugs) was very {{complicated}} {{to use and}} entailed rather serious risk to the patient. Nearly every formulary and herbal which lists santonin or santonin-containing plants lists the real risk of yellow vision and of fatal reactions; even small doses of santonin cause disturbances of vision, usually yellow vision or perhaps green (<b>xanthopsia</b> or chromatopsia). Even the Encyclopædia Britannica noted:...These effects usually pass off in a few days. Large doses, however, produce toxic effects, aphasia, muscular tremors and epileptiform convulsions, and the disturbances of vision may go on to total blindness.More typical is the warning given regarding side effects of santonin in King's American Dispensatory:Santonin is an active agent, and, in improper doses, is capable of producing serious symptoms, and even death. As small a dose as 2 grains {{is said to have}} killed a weakly child of 5 years, and 5 grains produced death in about 1/2 hour in a child of the same age. Among the toxic effects may be mentioned gastric pain, pallor and coldness of the surface, followed by heat and injection of the head, tremors, dizziness, pupillary dilatation, twitching of the eyes, stertor, copious sweating, hematuria, convulsive movements, tetanic cramps stupor, and insensibility. Occasionally symptoms resembling cholera morbus have been produced, and in all cases the urine presents a characteristic yellowish or greenish-yellow hue. We have observed convulsions caused by the administration of [...] "worm lozenges." [...] Death from santonin is due to respiratory paralysis, and post-mortem examination revealed in one instance a contracted and empty right ventricle, and about an ounce of liquid, black blood in the left heart, an inflamed duodenum, and inflamed patches in the stomach (Kilner).[...] [...]Santonin often produces a singular effect upon the vision, causing surrounding objects to appear discolored, as if they were yellow or green, and occasionally blue or red; it also imparts a yellow or green color to the urine, and a reddish-purple color if that fluid be alkaline. Prof. Giovanni was led to believe that the apparent yellow color of objects observed by the eye, when under the influence of santonin, did not depend upon an elective action on the optic nerves, but rather to the yellow color which the drug itself takes when exposed to the air. Santonin colored by the air does not produce this effect, which only follows the white article. The air gives the yellow color to santonin, to passed urine containing it, and to the serum of the blood when drawn from a vein, and, according to Giovanni, it is owing to its direct action upon the aqueous humor, where it is carried by absorption, that objects present this color. The view now held, however, is that of Rose, that the alkaline serum dissolves the santonin, which then acts upon the perspective centers of the brain, producing the chromatopsia or xanthopsia.At least one modern herbal has also noted these same severe side effects of santonin.|$|E
40|$|The yellow vision {{produced}} by the administration of santonin {{has not yet been}} satisfactorily explained. The possible places of action are (a) the ocular media; (b) the receptive mechanism of the retina; (c) the visual centers. An action on the visual centers has not been seriously entertained although Filehne (1) regarded it as, a priori, the most probable explanation. R#{ 228 }. hl-mann (2), however, has suggested {{that as a result of}} an action on the central nervous system a change in the receptivity of the peripheral nerve mechanism in the retina may occur resulting in its sensitiveness to light stimuli of different wave lengths be-coming altered. The <b>xanthopsia</b> has also been attributed by Konig (3) to absorption of the shorter light waves in the ocular media, but, although the effect is similar to vision through a weakly tinted yellow medium, no unequivocal evidence of staining of the ocular media has been obtained either from experiments on animals or from ophthalmoscopic examinations of men. ’ The most generally accepted view is that advocated by Filehne and supported by Siv#{ 233 }nand von Wendt (4) of an action associated with the visual purple. This view will be considered later. The first extensive physiological investigation of Santonica was made by Rose (5) who described the following three changes as characteristic of santonin <b>xanthopsia</b> (6) -a fading of the violet, a certain blending of colors, and a shortening of the red 1 Dr. Usher kindly examined the eye ophthalmoscopically in some of my ex-periments and also found no coloration of the media. Konig’s observations are criticized by Filehne (p. 99 et seq.) ...|$|E
40|$|Vincent Van Gogh {{is one of}} {{the most}} celebrated {{creative}} artists of all time. All his life, he was afflicted by some kind of neurological or psychiatric disorder, which remains a mystery even today. Many historians and his personal physicians believe that he suffered from epilepsy while others felt that he was affected by Ménière′s disease. Features such as hypergraphia, atypical sexuality, and viscosity of thinking suggest the possibility of Gastaut-Geschwind phenomenon, a known complication of complex partial seizure. On the contrary, some historians feel that he was forced to sever his right ear in order to get relief from troublesome tinnitus, a complication of Ménière′s disease. He was addicted to the liquor absinthe, which is known to lead to <b>xanthopsia,</b> and many authorities argue that this was the reason for his penchant for the deep and bright yellow color in many of his paintings. Others have suggested the possibility of bipolar disorder, sunstroke, acute intermittent porphyria, and digitalis toxicity as well...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Rapidly {{progressing}} bilateral {{night blindness}} in an elderly patient suggests primarily {{a diagnosis of}} paraneoplastic retinopathy. Occasionally diffuse rod dysfunction can result from vitamin A deficiency. HISTORY AND SIGNS: A 70 -year-old man complained of progressive night blindness and <b>xanthopsia</b> for the past 6 months. Visual acuity was 0. 8 in both eyes with severe dyschromatopsia. Slit-lamp and fundus examination were normal. Visual field disclosed bilateral depression. Scotopic full-field ERG was severely reduced. The patient's medical history revealed an acute pancreatitis one year ago, followed by chronic jaundice and an increased blood bilirubin. Serum vitamin A level was decreased to 0. 1 micromol/L (normal range 1. 5 to 4. 0). THERAPY AND OUTCOME: Intramuscular injections of vitamin A were provided. Subjective visual improvement was reported already one day after initiation of therapy. Scotopic full-field ERG was markedly improved 3 days after the injection and was only slightly subnormal 3 months later. CONCLUSIONS: In developed countries, vitamin A deficiency usually results from malabsorption syndromes and manifests initially by rod more than cone dysfunction. This diagnosis should be entertained early as vitamin A supplementation induces a rapid restoration of vision...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Approaching {{art from}} the {{standpoint}} of optics and the artist’s eye pathology can sometimes explain the shift of the spectral colors in the work of some artists with cataract and aphakia. This may not be obvious in the paintings of other artists with the same eye pathology. The aim {{of this study was to}} create a timeline from the recently obtained details of the cataract surgery, his best corrected aphakic visual acuity, and the last paintings of the artist Jovan Bijelić. Methods. The research included primary and secondary source material: Bijelić’s paintings from all stages of his career, interviews with Bijelić and his eye surgeon, art criticism, sources with the description of Bijelić’s symptoms, hospital archives, discussion with art historians, comparison of his palette from different periods. Results. Jovan Bijelić was nearly blind from cataract in 1957. He underwent an unsuccessful cataract surgery in 1956, followed by enucleation of the operated eye. In 1958, 20 / 25 – 20 / 20 vision was regained, after the extracapsular cataract extraction and sector iridectomy in his right eye, with the posterior lens capsule discision afterwards. <b>Xanthopsia</b> and cyanopsia are not present in his art, which is not a representation of visualized objects. Conclusion. The response of Jovan Bijelić to cataract and aphakia was predominantly a change of his style...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: We {{report a}} case of digoxin {{intoxication}} with severe visual symptoms. Patients (or Materials) and Methods: Digoxin 0. 25 mg QD for atrial fibrillation was prescribed to a 91 -year-old woman with an estimated creatinine clearance of 18 mL/min. Within 2 to 3 weeks, she developed nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia, and began complaining of snowy and blurry vision, photopsia, dyschromatopsia, aggravated bedtime visual and proprioceptive illusions (she felt as being on a boat), and colored hallucinations. She consulted her family doctor twice and visited the eye clinic once until, 1 month after starting digoxin, impaired autonomy led her {{to be admitted to}} the emergency department. Results: Digoxin intoxication was confirmed by a high plasma level measured on admission (5. 7 μg/L; reference range, 0. 8 - 2 μg/L). After stopping digoxin, general symptoms resolved in a few days, but visual symptoms persisted. Ophtalmologic care and follow-up diagnosed digoxin intoxication superimposed on pre-existing left eye (LE) cataract, dry age-related macular degeneration (DMLA), and Charles Bonnet syndrome. Visual acuity was 0. 4 (right eye, RE) and 0. 5 (LE). Ocular fundus was physiologic except for bilateral dry DMLA. Dyschromatopsia was confirmed by poor results on Ishihara test (1 / 13 OU). Computerized visual field results revealed nonspecific diffuse alterations. Full-field electroretinogram (ERG) showed moderate diffuse rod and cone dysfunction. Visual symptoms progressively improved over the next 2 months, but ERG did not. Complete resolution was not expected due to the pre-existing eye disease. The patient was finally discharged home after a 5 -week hospital stay. Conclusion: Digoxin intoxication can go unrecognized by clinicians, even in a typical presentation. The range of potential visual symptoms is far greater than isolated <b>xanthopsia</b> (yellow vision) classically described in textbooks. Newly introduced drugs and all symptoms must be actively sought after, because they significantly affect quality of life and global functioning, especially in the elderly population, most liable not to mention them...|$|E
