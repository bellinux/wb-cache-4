A {{production}} {{gas turbine}} combustor swirl cup and a 3 <b>x-scale</b> model, both featuring co-axial, counter-swirling air streams are characterized at atmospheric pressure {{and in the}} absence of reaction. Spatially-resolved measurements of continuous phase (gas in the presence of spray) and droplet size and velocity are acquired downstream of the production and 3 <b>x-scale</b> swirl cups by using two-component phase Doppler interferometry. The effect of scale on the behavior of the continuous phase and droplets is investigated by comparing the continuous phase velocity and droplet size and velocity at geometrically analogous positions. The continuous phase flow field scales well at the exit of the swirl cup. Farther downstream, differences occur which are due to disparity in entrainment. The droplet velocities scale reasonably well, but the sizes show some differences. However, the difference in size is less significant than it is between the two atomizers in the absence of the swirl cup assemblies...|$|E

40|$|We analyze 2 + 1 {{dimensional}} Yang-Mills theory regularized on a lattice with twisted {{boundary conditions}} in the spatial directions. In previous work it was shown that the observables in the non-zero electric flux sectors obey the so-called <b>x-scaling,</b> i. e. depend only on the dimensionless variable x ∝ NL/b and the angle θ ̃ given by {{the parameters of the}} twist (L being the length of the spatial torus and b the inverse ’t Hooft coupling). It is conjectured that this scaling is obeyed by all physical quantities. In this work we extend the previous analyses to the zero electric flux (glueball) sector. We study the mass of the lightest scalar glueball in two theories with different N but matching x and θ ̃ {{in a wide range of}} couplings from the perturbative small-volume regime to the non-perturbative one.

Dominant gravity wave spectrum in the middle atmosphere: <b>x-scale,</b> less than 100 km; z-scale, greater than 10 km; t-scale, less than 2 hr. Theorists are beginning to understand middle atmosphere motions. There are two classes: Planetary waves and equatorial motions, gravity waves and tidal motions. The former give rise to variability at large scales, which may alter apparent mean structure. Effects include density and velocity fluctuations, induced mean motions, and stratospheric warmings which lead to the breakup of the polar vortex and cooling of the mesosphere. On this scale are also equatorial quasi-biennial and semi-annual oscillations. Gravity wave and tidal motions produce large rms fluctuations in density and velocity. The magnitude of the density fluctuations compared to the mean density is of the order of the vertical wavelength, which grows with height. Relative density fluctuations are less than, or of the order of 30 % below the mesopause. Such motions may cause significant and variable convection, and wind shear. There is a strong seasonal variation in gravity wave amplitude. Additional observations are needed to address and quantify mean and fluctuation statistics of both density and mean velocity, variability of the mean and fluctuations, and to identify dominant gravity wave scales and sources as well as causes of variability, both temporal and geographic...|$|E
40|$|This masters {{thesis is}} a part of the nordic {{collaboration}} project NorSEN, whose goal is to improve the environmental surveillance in the regions north of the Arctic circle. This implies the build-up of a data-acquisition network that can be used for tracing environmental changes over the years. The data from these sites can also be used as a reference for satellite image validation and to improve the atmospheric correction procedures of satellite imagery. Atmospheric correction is the process where an image taken at satellite level is recreated as it would have looked like on the ground. The signal is distorted along its way through the atmosphere by the means of absorption and scattering. Swedens contribution to this project is a raft with on board spectrometers placed on the lake Torneträsk near Abisko in the summer of 2005. The lake is surrounded by mountains which are often covered with clouds that changes the light conditions. This poses a problem for the atmospheric correction since these types of situations are more difficult to model. The lake is also often exposed to rough weather with strong winds, leading to high waves. When this occurs, it is much harder to calculate the reflectance from the data. Severe rainfalls can also lead to sediments in the lake which changes the lakes reflectance. One part of the project is therefore to evaluate if Torneträsk is a good reference surface. This part will however not be covered by the report. The masters thesis has been devoted to the evaluation and changing of the satellite signal simulation program 6 S, which is also able to apply atmospheric correction to known satellite signals. Pictures from the instrument MERIS on board ESAs Earth observation satellite ENVISAT has been available within the project. Some assumptions in 6 S that has proved to be a problem is that of horizontal homogeneity and the plane-parallel assumption. Since the clouds and mountains need to be modeled, an inhomogeneous model must be implemented. This can be done by introducing a horizontal <b>x-scale</b> which adds a parameter to all the equations governing the radiative transfer in the atmosphere. Since the <b>x-scale</b> cant go on forever, there must however be a combination of the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous model where the homogeneous assumption is used at the boundary layer of the inhomogeneous model. Tests have been made with a horizontal scale of 300 kilometers. The grid has to be about this wide since the atmosphere is modeled with an altitude of 150 kilometers and it is desired that as many beams as possible, they are traveling with different inclinations, reaches the top of the atmosphere. This however slows down the program significantly. The computation is therefore made with less accuracy the further you get from the lake, while an area of 10 kilometers where the raft is situated is modeled with high accuracy. Up to date it is hard to draw any substantial conclusions about whether the changes made to 6 S will lead to any significant improvement. This is because the evaluation of the program has taken so long time, leaving very little time to test the new program. However, it looks like we have made some progress.

40|$|Various {{universal}} {{features of}} relativistic rotating strings {{depend on the}} organization of allowed local operators on the worldsheet. In this paper, we study the set of Neumann boundary operators in effective string theory, which are relevant for the controlled study of open relativistic strings with freely moving endpoints. Relativistic open strings are thought to encode the dynamics of confined quark-antiquark pairs in gauge theories in the planar approximation. Neumann boundary operators can be organized by their behavior under scaling of the target space coordinates X, and the set of allowed <b>X-scaling</b> exponents is bounded above by + 1 / 2 and unbounded below. Negative contributions to X-scalings come from powers of a single invariant, or "dressing" operator, which is bilinear in the embedding coordinates. In particular, we show that all Neumann boundary operators are dressed by quarter-integer powers of this invariant, and we demonstrate how this rule arises from various ways of regulating the short-distance singularities of the effective theory.

Our {{goal is to}} study the interplay between the rank of the group N, {{the length of the}} torus L and the Z_N magnetic flux. After presenting the classical and quantum formalism, we analyze the spectrum of the theory using perturbation theory to one-loop and using Monte Carlo techniques on the lattice. In perturbation theory, results to all orders depend on the combination x=λ NL and an angle defined in terms of the magnetic flux (λ is 't Hooft coupling). Thus, fixing the angle, the system exhibits a form of volume independence (NL dependence). The numerical results interpolate between our perturbative calculations and the confinement regime. They are consistent with <b>x-scaling</b> and provide interesting information about the k-string spectrum and effective string theories. The occurrence of tachyonic instabilities is also analysed.
