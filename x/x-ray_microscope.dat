25|$|Baez {{was born}} in Staten Island, New York, on January 9, 1941. Joan's grandfather, the Reverend Alberto Baez, left Catholicism to become a Methodist {{minister}} {{and moved to the}} U.S. when her father was two years old. Her father, Albert Baez (1912–2007), {{was born in}} Puebla, Mexico and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, where his father preached to—and advocated for—a Spanish-speaking congregation. Albert first considered becoming a minister but instead turned to the study of mathematics and physics and received his Ph.D. degree at Stanford University in 1950. Albert was later credited as a co-inventor of the <b>x-ray</b> <b>microscope.</b> Joan's cousin, John C. Baez, is a mathematical physicist.|$|E

40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} microscopy (XDM) is a lensless imaging tech-nique {{well suited}} to studying thick biological samples at high res-olution. Because x-rays have relatively short wavelengths, <b>x-ray</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{have the potential to}} achieve higher resolution than visible light <b>microscopes.</b> <b>X-rays</b> have high penetration ability, which enables <b>x-ray</b> <b>microscopes</b> to image samples that are too thick for electron <b>microscopes.</b> <b>X-ray</b> photons can be considered to interact with objects only once in most cases, which simpli-fies the data analysis process. Furthermore, by dispensing with the resolution and efficiency limitations imposed by x-ray optics, XDM can provide images with a resolution only confined by the maximum diffraction angle that can be collected and the sample’s radiation tolerance. iii We demonstrated through numerical simulations that XDM ha...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} results of SEM and TEM {{measurements}} with the BPRML test samples fabricated from a BPRML (WSi 2 /Si with fundamental layer thickness of 3 nm) with a Dual Beam FIB (focused ion beam) /SEM technique. In particular, we demonstrate that significant information about the metrological reliability of the TEM measurements can be extracted even when the fundamental frequency of the BPRML sample is smaller than the Nyquist frequency of the measurements. The measurements demonstrate {{a number of problems}} related to the interpretation of the SEM and TEM data. Note that similar BPRML test samples can be used to characterize <b>x-ray</b> <b>microscopes.</b> Corresponding work with <b>x-ray</b> <b>microscopes</b> is in progress...|$|R
50|$|Scanning {{transmission}} X-ray microscopy (STXM) {{is a type}} of X-ray microscopy {{in which}} a zone plate focuses an X-ray beam onto a small spot, a sample is scanned in the focal plane of the zone plate and the transmitted X-ray intensity is recorded {{as a function of the}} sample position. A stroboscopic scheme is used where the excitation is the pump and the synchrotron X-ray flashes are the probe. <b>X-ray</b> <b>microscopes</b> work by exposing a film or charged coupled device detector to detect X-rays that pass through the specimen. The image formed is of a thin section of specimen. Newer <b>X-ray</b> <b>microscopes</b> use <b>X-ray</b> absorption spectroscopy to heterogeneous materials at high spatial resolution. The essence of the technique is a combination of spectromicroscopy, imaging with spectral sensitivity, and microscpectroscopy, recording spectra from very small spots.|$|R
40|$|Hard x-ray contact {{microscopy}} provides {{images of}} dense samples at resolutions {{of tens of}} nanometers. However, the required beam intensity can only be delivered by synchrotron sources. We report {{on the use of}} a gold photoelectric conversion layer to lower the exposure dose by a factor of 40 to 50, allowing hard x-ray contact microscopy to be performed with a compact x-ray tube. We demonstrate the method in imaging the transmission pattern of a type of hard x-ray grating that cannot be fitted into conventional <b>x-ray</b> <b>microscopes</b> due to its size and shape. Generally the method is easy to implement and can record images of samples in the hard x-ray region over a large area in a single exposure, without some of the geometric constraints associated with <b>x-ray</b> <b>microscopes</b> based on zone-plate or other magnifying optics...|$|R
50|$|An <b>X-ray</b> <b>microscope</b> uses {{electromagnetic}} radiation {{in the soft}} X-ray band to produce magnified images of objects. Since X-rays penetrate most objects, {{there is no need}} to specially prepare them for X-ray microscopy observations.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s Newberry {{produced}} a shadow <b>X-ray</b> <b>microscope</b> which placed the specimen between {{the source and}} a target plate, this {{became the basis for}} the first commercial X-ray microscopes from the General Electric Company.|$|E

40|$|Rapidly-frozen {{hydrated}} (cryopreserved) specimens {{combined with}} cryo-scanning x-ray fluorescence microscopy provide an ideal approach for investigating elemental distributions in biological cells and tissues. However, because cryopreservation does not deactivate potentially infectious agents associated with Risk Group 2 biological materials, {{one must be}} concerned with contamination of expensive and complicated cryogenic <b>x-ray</b> <b>microscopes</b> when working with such materials. We employed ultraviolet germicidal irradiation to decontaminate previously cryopreserved cells under liquid nitrogen, and then investigated its effects on elemental distributions under both frozen hydrated and freeze dried states with x-ray fluorescence microscopy. We show that the contents and distributions of most biologically important elements remain nearly unchanged when compared with non-ultraviolet-irradiated counterparts, even after multiple cycles of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and cryogenic x-ray imaging. This provides a potential pathway for rendering Risk Group 2 biological materials safe for handling in multiuser cryogenic <b>x-ray</b> <b>microscopes</b> without affecting the fidelity of the results...|$|R

He conducted biophysical research in connection with the Argonne National Laboratory.|$|E
40|$|Although {{magnetic}} imaging with polarized x-rays is {{a rather}} young scientific discipline, {{the various types of}} established <b>x-ray</b> <b>microscopes</b> have already taken an important role in state-of-the-art characterization of the properties and behavior of spin textures in advanced materials. The opportunities ahead will be to obtain in a unique way indispensable multidimensional information of the structure, dynamics and composition of scientifically interesting and technologically relevant magnetic materials...|$|R
30|$|When {{new drugs}} are {{synthesized}} [1], dust particles are {{brought back from}} space [2], or new superconductors are discovered [3], a variety of sophisticated <b>X-ray</b> <b>microscopes,</b> spectrometers, and scattering instruments are often summoned to characterize their structure and properties. High-resolution and hyperspectral X-ray imaging, scattering and tomography instruments at modern synchrotrons are among the workhorses of modern discovery to study nano-materials and characterize chemical interactions or electronic properties at their interfaces.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>X-ray</b> <b>microscopes</b> by Paul Kirkpatrick and Albert Baez used grazing {{incidence}} reflective optics {{to focus the}} X-rays, which grazed X-rays off parabolic curved mirrors {{at a very high}} angle of incidence. An alternative method of focusing X-rays is to use a tiny fresnel zone plate of concentric gold or nickel rings on a silicon dioxide substrate. Sir Lawrence Bragg produced some of the first usable X-ray images with his apparatus in the late 1940s.|$|R
50|$|The water {{window is}} {{a region of}} the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum in which water is transparent to soft x-rays. The window extends from the K-absorption edge of carbon at 282 eV (68 PHz, 4.40 nm wavelength) to the K-edge of oxygen at 533 eV (129 PHz, 2.33 nm wavelength). Water is transparent to these X-rays, but carbon (and thus, organic molecules) is absorbing. These wavelengths could be used in an <b>x-ray</b> <b>microscope</b> for viewing living specimens.|$|E
50|$|Unlike visible light, X-rays do {{not reflect}} or refract easily, and they are {{invisible}} to the human eye. Therefore, an <b>X-ray</b> <b>microscope</b> exposes film or uses a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector to detect X-rays that pass through the specimen. It is a contrast imaging technology using the difference in absorption of soft X-rays in the water window region (wavelengths: 2.34-4.4 nm, energies: 280-530 eV) by the carbon atom (main element composing the living cell) and the oxygen atom (main element for water).|$|E
50|$|Zone plates {{consist of}} a {{substrate}} with concentric zones of a phase-shifting or absorbing material with zones getting narrower the larger their radius. The zone widths are designed so that a transmitted wave gets constructive interference in a single point giving a focus. Zone plates {{can be used as}} condensers to collect light, but also for direct full field imaging in e.g. an <b>X-ray</b> <b>microscope.</b> Zone plates are very chromatic, making it necessary to have monochromatic X-rays for efficient collection and high resolution imaging.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{image contrast}} for electron microscopy of thick hydrated biological specimens, {{allowing for the}} use of phase contrast and energy ltering. This allows us to gain perspective on the relative roles of electron and soft <b>X-ray</b> <b>microscopes.</b> Radiation dose is found to depend strongly on ice thickness, with electrons oering lower dose if the ice thickness is less than about 500 nm, and x rays oering lower dose for thicker ice layers. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>X-ray</b> <b>microscopes</b> are {{instruments}} that use electromagnetic radiation {{usually in the}} soft X-ray band to image objects. Technological advances in x-ray lens optics in the early 1970s made the instrument a viable imaging choice. They are often used in tomography (see micro-computed tomography) to produce three dimensional images of objects, including biological materials {{that have not been}} chemically fixed. Currently research is being done to improve optics for hard x-rays which have greater penetrating power.|$|R
