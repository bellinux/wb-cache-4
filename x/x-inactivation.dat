25|$|The <b>X-inactivation</b> center (or simply XIC) on the X {{chromosome}} {{is necessary}} and sufficient to cause <b>X-inactivation.</b> Chromosomal translocations which place the XIC on an autosome lead to inactivation of the autosome, and X chromosomes lacking the XIC are not inactivated.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of genes along the inactive X {{which are not}} silenced explains the defects in humans with abnormal numbers of the X chromosome, such as Turner syndrome (X0) or Klinefelter syndrome (XXY). Theoretically, <b>X-inactivation</b> should eliminate the differences in gene dosage between affected individuals and individuals with a normal chromosome complement. In affected individuals, however, <b>X-inactivation</b> is incomplete and the dosage of these non-silenced genes will differ as they escape <b>X-inactivation,</b> similar to an autosomal aneuploidy.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} that control escape from <b>X-inactivation</b> are not known, but silenced and escape regions {{have been shown}} to have distinct chromatin marks. It has been suggested that escape from <b>X-inactivation</b> might be mediated by expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) within the escaping chromosomal domains.|$|E
25|$|<b>X-inactivation</b> is {{reversed}} {{in the female}} germline, so that all oocytes contain an active X chromosome.|$|E
25|$|It’s {{thought that}} <b>X-inactivation</b> skewing could {{be caused by}} issues in the {{mechanism}} that causes inactivation, or by issues in the chromosome itself. However, the link between phenotype and skewing is still being questioned, and should be examined on a case-by-case basis. A study looking at both symptomatic and asymptomatic females who were heterozygous for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD) found no apparent link between transcript expression and skewed <b>X-Inactivation.</b> The study suggests that both mechanisms are independently regulated, {{and there are other}} unknown factors at play.|$|E
25|$|The XIC {{contains}} four non-translated RNA genes, Xist, Tsix, Jpx and Ftx, {{which are}} involved in <b>X-inactivation.</b> The XIC also contains binding sites for both known and unknown regulatory proteins.|$|E
25|$|Like Xist, {{prior to}} inactivation, both X {{chromosomes}} weakly express Tsix RNA from the Tsix gene. Upon {{the onset of}} <b>X-inactivation,</b> the future Xi ceases to express Tsix RNA (and increases Xist expression), whereas Xa continues to express Tsix for several days.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{suggests}} the female high tendency to get autoimmunity {{is due to}} an imbalanced X chromosome inactivation. The <b>X-inactivation</b> skew theory, proposed by Princeton University's Jeff Stewart, has recently been confirmed experimentally in scleroderma and autoimmune thyroiditis. Other complex X-linked genetic susceptibility mechanisms are proposed and under investigation.|$|E
25|$|Compounding on Lyon’s discoveries, in 1962 Ernest Beutler used female {{fibroblast}} cell lineages {{grown in}} culture {{to demonstrate the}} heritability of lyonization or random <b>X-inactivation.</b> By analyzing the differential expression of two existing, viable alleles for the X-linked enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene, Beutler observed that the inactivation of the gene was heritable across passaged generations of the cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{differentiation}} of phenotype in heterozygous females is furthered {{by the presence}} of <b>X-inactivation</b> skewing. Typically, each X-chromosome is silenced in half of the cells, but this process is skewed when preferential inactivation of a chromosome occurs. It is thought that skewing happens either by chance or by a physical characteristic of a chromosome that may cause it to be silenced more or less often, such as an unfavorable mutation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} blastocyst, this initial, {{imprinted}} <b>X-inactivation</b> is reversed in {{the cells of}} the inner cell mass (which give rise to the embryo), and in these cells both X chromosomes become active again. Each of these cells then independently and randomly inactivates one copy of the X chromosome. This inactivation event is irreversible during the lifetime of the cell, so all the descendants of a cell which inactivated a particular X chromosome will also inactivate that same chromosome. This phenomenon, which can be observed in the coloration of tortoiseshell cats when females are heterozygous for the X-linked gene, {{should not be confused with}} mosaicism, which is a term that specifically refers to differences in the genotype of various cell populations in the same individual; <b>X-inactivation,</b> which is an epigenetic change that results in a different phenotype, is not a change at the genotypic level. For an individual cell or lineage the inactivation is therefore skewed or 'non-random', and this can give rise to mild symptoms in female 'carriers' of X-linked genetic disorders.|$|E
25|$|This {{pattern of}} dosage compensation, caused by random <b>X-inactivation,</b> is {{regulated}} across development in female mammals, following concerted patterns throughout development; for example, {{at the beginning}} of most female mammal development, both X chromosomes are initially expressed, but gradually undergo epigenetic processes to eventually achieve random inactivation of one X. In germ cells, inactivated X chromosomes are then once again activated to ensure their expression in gametes produced by female mammals.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no common}} {{mutations}} that cause disease, however 10 - 15% of disease causing mutations are deletions. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, meaning males are more commonly affected than females. Females who carry a defective {{copy of the}} gene can be severely affected or asymptomatic, largely depending on the random nature of <b>X-inactivation.</b> There is some degree of genotype - phenotype correlation with OTC deficiency, but this depends {{on a number of}} situations. Individuals with milder mutations, often associated with late onset disease can still present with severe illness when exposed to sufficient metabolic stress. Correlations are more difficult to ascertain in females, since the residual activity of OTC in the liver is impacted not only {{by the nature of the}} mutation, but also by the random pattern of <b>X-inactivation.</b> OTC deficiency is estimated to be the most common urea cycle disorder. An exact incidence is difficult to calculate, due to the varying clinical presentations of later onset forms of the disease. Early estimates of the incidence were as high as 1:14,000 live births, however later studies have decreased these estimates to approximately 1:60,000 - 1:72,000.|$|E
25|$|<b>X-{{inactivation}}.</b> The inactivation of one X chromosome {{takes place}} during the early development of mammals (see Barr body and dosage compensation). In placental mammals, the inactivation is random as between the two Xs; thus the mammalian female is a mosaic in respect of her X chromosomes. In marsupials it is always the paternal X which is inactivated. In human females some 15% of somatic cells escape inactivation, {{and the number of}} genes affected on the inactivated X chromosome varies between cells: in fibroblast cells up about 25% of genes on the Barr body escape inactivation.|$|E
25|$|As {{with several}} other {{metabolic}} conditions, OTC deficiency can have variable presentations, regarding age of onset and the severity of symptoms. This compounded when considering heterozygous females {{and the possibility of}} non-random <b>X-inactivation.</b> In the classic and most well-known presentation, a male infant appears well initially, but by the second day of life they are irritable, lethargic and stop feeding. A metabolic encephalopathy develops, and this can progress to coma and death without treatment. Ammonia is only toxic to the brain, other tissues can handle elevated ammonia concentrations without problems.|$|E
25|$|By {{preferentially}} modifying hemimethylated DNA, DNMT1 transfers {{patterns of}} methylation to a newly synthesized strand after DNA replication, and therefore {{is often referred}} to as the ‘maintenance' methyltransferase. DNMT1 is essential for proper embryonic development, imprinting and <b>X-inactivation.</b> To emphasize the difference of this molecular mechanism of inheritance from the canonical Watson-Crick base-pairing mechanism of transmission of genetic information, the term 'Epigenetic templating' was introduced. Furthermore, in addition to the maintenance and transmission of methylated DNA states, the same principle could work in the maintenance and transmission of histone modifications and even cytoplasmic (structural) heritable states.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{defective}} enzyme in PNH is phosphatidylinositol glycan A (PIGA), {{one of several}} enzymes needed to make GPI. The gene that codes for PIGA {{is located on the}} X chromosome, which means that only one active copy of the gene for PIGA is present in each cell (initially, females have two copies, but one is silenced through <b>X-inactivation).</b> A mutation in the PIGA gene can lead to the absence of GPI anchors expressed on the cell membrane. When this mutation occurs in a hematopoietic stem cell in the bone marrow, all of the cells it produces will also have the defect.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the genes}} which escape {{inactivation}} are present along regions of the X chromosome which, unlike {{the majority of the}} X chromosome, contain genes also present on the Y chromosome. These regions are termed pseudoautosomal regions, as individuals of either sex will receive two copies of every gene in these regions (like an autosome), unlike the majority of genes along the sex chromosomes. Since individuals of either sex will receive two copies of every gene in a pseudoautosomal region, no dosage compensation is needed for females, so it is postulated that these regions of DNA have evolved mechanisms to escape <b>X-inactivation.</b> The genes of pseudoautosomal regions of the Xi do not have the typical modifications of the Xi and have little Xist RNA bound.|$|E
25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} the absence of one complete or partial copy of the X chromosome in some or all the cells. The abnormal cells may have only one X (monosomy) (45,X) or they may be affected by one of several types of partial monosomy like a deletion of the short p arm of one X chromosome (46,X,del(Xp)) or the presence of an isochromosome with two q arms (46,X,i(Xq)) Turner syndrome has distinct features {{due to the lack of}} pseudoautosomal regions, which are typically spared from <b>X-inactivation.</b> In mosaic individuals, cells with X monosomy (45,X) may occur along with cells that are normal (46,XX), cells that have partial monosomies, or cells that have a Y chromosome (46,XY). The presence of mosaicism is estimated to be relatively common in affected individuals (67–90%).|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, Mary F. Lyon began {{investigating}} {{manipulations of}} X-linked traits that had phenotypically visible consequences, particularly in mice, whose fur color is a trait intimately {{linked to the}} X chromosome. Building on work done by Ohno and his colleagues, Lyon eventually proved that either the maternal or paternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in every cell of the female body in the species she was studying, which explained the heterogeneous fur patterns she observed in her mosaic mice. This process is known as <b>X-inactivation,</b> and is {{sometimes referred to as}} “lyonization”. This discovery can be easily extrapolated to explain the mixed color patterns observed in the coats of tortoiseshell cats. The fur patterns characteristic of tortoiseshell cats are found almost exclusively in females, because only they randomly inactivate one X chromosome in every somatic hair cell. Thus, presuming that hair color determining genes are X-linked, it makes sense that whether the maternal or paternal X chromosome is inactivated in a particular hair cell can result in differential fur color expression.|$|E
25|$|OA1 is {{recognized}} by many different symptoms. Reduced visual acuity {{is accompanied by}} involuntary movements of the eye termed as nystagmus. Astigmatism is a condition wherein there occurs significant refractive error. Moreover, ocular albino eyes become crossed, a condition called as ‘lazy eyes’ or strabismus. Since very little pigment is present the iris becomes translucent and reflects light back. It appears green to blueish red. However, {{the most important part}} of the eye, the fovea which is responsible for acute vision, does not develop properly, probably indicating the role of melanin in the development stages of the eye. Some affected individuals may also develop photophobia/photodysphoria. All these symptoms are due to lack of pigmentation of the retina. Moreover, in an ocular albino eye, nerves from back of the eye to the brain may not follow the usual pattern of routing. In an ocular albino eye, more nerves cross from back of the eye to the opposite side of the brain instead of going to the both sides of the brain as in a normal eye. An ocular albino eye appears blueish pink in color with no pigmentation at all unlike a normal eye. Carrier women have regions of hypo- and hyper-pigmentation due to <b>X-inactivation</b> and partial iris transillumination and do not show any other symptoms exhibited by those affected by OA1.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{of their}} {{ambiguous}} evolutionary history, platypuses have been empirically determined to follow an XY sex-determination system, with females possessing five pairs of X chromosomes as the homogametic sex, and males possessing five X and five Y chromosomes as the heterogametic sex. Because the entire genome of the platypus {{has yet to}} be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes), there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles. This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random <b>X-inactivation</b> observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes.|$|E
25|$|The sex {{chromosomes}} {{of birds}} evolved separately {{from those of}} mammals and share very little sequence homology with the XY chromosomes. As such, scientists refer to bird sex chromosomes as a ZW sex-determining system, with males possessing two Z chromosomes, and females possessing one Z chromosome and one W. Thus, dosage compensation in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random <b>X-inactivation</b> observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male heterogametic sex, similar to the system observed in the two male X chromosomes of Drosophila. However, bird mechanisms of dosage compensation differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome. This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as “less effective” at dosage compensation than mammals. However, more {{recent studies have shown}} that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may {{play an important role in}} recruiting dosage compensation machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms. In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex regulator gene in C. elegans. Thus, the function of the selective silencing may be to spare dosage compensation of genes crucial for sex determination of homologous pairing.|$|E
500|$|For one example, {{cytosine}} methylation produces 5-methylcytosine, {{which is}} important for <b>X-inactivation</b> of chromosomes. The average level of methylation varies between organisms– the worm Caenorhabditis elegans lacks cytosine methylation, while vertebrates have higher levels, with up to 1% of their DNA containing 5-methylcytosine. Despite the importance of 5-methylcytosine, it can deaminate to leave a thymine base, so methylated cytosines are particularly prone to mutations. Other base modifications include adenine methylation in bacteria, the presence of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the brain, and the glycosylation of uracil to produce the [...] "J-base" [...] in kinetoplastids.|$|E
2500|$|<b>X-inactivation</b> (also called lyonization) is {{a process}} by {{which one of the}} copies of the X {{chromosome}} present in female mammals is inactivated. The inactive X chromosome is silenced by its being packaged {{in such a way that}} it has a transcriptionally inactive structure called heterochromatin. As nearly all female mammals have two X chromosomes, <b>X-inactivation</b> prevents them from having twice as many X chromosome gene products as males, who only possess a single copy of the X chromosome (see dosage compensation). The choice of which X chromosome will be inactivated is random in placental mammals such as [...] humans, but once an X chromosome is inactivated it will remain inactive throughout the lifetime of the cell and its descendants in the organism. Unlike the random <b>X-inactivation</b> in placental mammals, inactivation in marsupials applies exclusively to the paternally derived X chromosome.|$|E
2500|$|The X {{chromosome}} carries {{hundreds of}} genes but few, if any, {{of these have}} anything to do directly with sex determination. Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly and permanently inactivated in nearly all somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). This phenomenon is called <b>X-inactivation</b> or Lyonization, and creates a Barr body. [...] If <b>X-inactivation</b> in the somatic cell meant a complete de-functionalizing of one of the X-chromosomes, it would ensure that females, like males, had only one functional copy of the X chromosome in each somatic cell. This was previously assumed to be the case. However, recent research suggests that the Barr body may be more biologically active than was previously supposed.|$|E
2500|$|On average, each X {{chromosome}} is inactivated in {{half of the}} cells, however 5-20% of [...] "apparently normal" [...] women display <b>X-inactivation</b> skewing. In {{cases where}} skewing is present, {{a broad range of}} symptom expression can occur, resulting in expression varying from minor to severe depending on the skewing proportion. An extreme case of this was seen where monozygotic female twins had extreme variance in expression of Menkes disease (an X-linked disorder) resulting in the death of one twin while the other remained asymptomatic.|$|E
2500|$|Genetic females (46,XX karyotype) {{have two}} X chromosomes, thus have two AR genes. [...] A {{mutation}} in one (but not both) {{results in a}} minimally affected, fertile, female carrier. [...] Some carriers have been noted to have slightly reduced body hair, delayed puberty, and/or tall stature, presumably due to skewed <b>X-inactivation.</b> [...] A female carrier will pass the affected AR gene to her children 50% of the time. [...] If the affected child is a genetic female, she, too, will be a carrier. [...] An affected 46,XY child will have AIS.|$|E
2500|$|Ernest Beutler (September 30, 1928 – October 5, 2008) was a German-born American {{hematologist}} and biomedical scientist. [...] He made important discoveries {{about the}} causes of a number of diseases, including anemias, Gaucher disease, disorders of iron metabolism and Tay-Sachs disease. He was also among the first scientists to identify <b>X-inactivation</b> as the genetic basis of tissue mosaicism in female mammals, and pioneered a number of medical treatments, including bone marrow transplantation techniques. Beutler served as a Professor, then Chairman, of the Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California from 1979 until 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, dosage {{compensation}} in mammals is largely achieved through the silencing {{of one of}} two female X chromosomes via <b>X-inactivation.</b> This process involves histone tail modifications, DNA methylation patterns, and reorganization of large-scale chromatin structure encoded by the X-ist gene. In spite of these extensive modifications, not all genes along the X chromosome are subject to X-inactivation; active expression at some loci is required for homologous recombination with the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR) of the Y chromosome during meiosis. Additionally, 10-25% of human X chromosome genes, and 3-7% of mouse X chromosome genes [...] outside of the PARs show weak expression from the inactive X chromosome.|$|E
2500|$|X-linked {{recessive}} {{conditions are}} also caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Males are more frequently affected than females, {{and the chance}} of passing on the disorder differs between men and women. The sons {{of a man with}} an X-linked recessive disorder will not be affected, and his daughters will carry one copy of the mutated gene. [...] A woman who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder (XRXr) has a 50% chance of having sons who are affected and a 50% chance of having daughters who carry one copy of the mutated gene and are therefore carriers. [...] X-linked recessive conditions include the serious diseases hemophilia A, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, as well as common and less serious conditions such as male pattern baldness and red-green color blindness. [...] X-linked recessive conditions can sometimes manifest in females due to skewed <b>X-inactivation</b> or monosomy X (Turner syndrome).|$|E

50|$|Fragile X {{syndrome}} {{has traditionally}} been considered an X-linked dominant condition with variable expressivity and possibly reduced penetrance. However, due to genetic anticipation and <b>X-inactivation</b> in females, the inheritance of Fragile X syndrome does not follow the usual pattern of X-linked dominant inheritance and some scholars have suggested discontinuing labeling X-linked disorders as dominant or recessive. Females with full FMR1 mutations may have a milder phenotype than males due to variability in <b>X-inactivation.</b>|$|E
