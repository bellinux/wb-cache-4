5|$|Four non-engineering {{scientific}} experiments were planned, two requiring the active {{involvement of the}} astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, and for a <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken {{through a set of}} colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the Goddard Space Flight Center and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> is a {{specialized}} {{type of gas}} discharge lamp, an electric light that produces light by passing electricity through ionized xenon gas at high pressure.

The lifetime of a <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> varies according to its design and power consumption, with one major manufacturer quoting average lifetimes ranging from 500 hours (7kW) to 1,500 (1kW).|$|E
2500|$|Xenon short-arc lamps {{were invented}} in the 1940s in Germany and {{introduced}} in 1951 by Osram. First {{produced in the}} 2 kW size (XBO2001), these lamps saw wide use in movie projection, where they replaced the older, more labor intensive (to operate) carbon arc lamps. The white continuous light generated by the xenon arc is spectrally similar to daylight, but the lamp has a rather low efficacy in terms of lumens of visible light output per watt of input power. Today, almost all movie projectors in theaters employ these lamps, with power ratings ranging from 900 watts up to 12kW. Omnimax (Imax Dome) projection systems use single xenon lamps with ratings as high as 15kW. [...] As of 2016, laser illumination for digital theater projectors is starting to establish a market presence and has been predicted will supersede the <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> for this application.|$|E

50|$|Incoherent {{broad band}} cavity {{enhanced}} absorption spectroscopy (IBBCEAS), sometimes called broadband cavity enhanced extinction spectroscopy (IBBCEES), measures {{the transmission of}} light intensity through a stable optical cavity consisting of high reflectance mirrors(typically R>99.9%). The technique is realized using incoherent sources of radiation e.g. <b>Xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps,</b> LEDs or supercontinuum (SC) lasers, hence the name.|$|R

50|$|Several {{variants}} were built. The concept demonstration {{was done}} with conventional optics that projected a white line from a <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp.</b> The projector was driven by an analog computer and the lamp (line) was moved by servo motors.|$|E

50|$|Carbon arc {{lights were}} the first {{electric}} lights. They were used for street lights in the 19th century and for specialized applications such as searchlights until World War 2.

50|$|Some {{organizations}} publish {{standards for}} rating the lightfastness of pigments and materials. Testing is typically done by controlled exposure to sunlight, or to artificial light {{generated by a}} <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp.</b> Watercolors, inks, pastels, and colored pencils are particularly susceptible to fading over time, so choosing lightfast pigments is especially important in these media.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> was {{introduced}} in Germany in 1957 and in the US in 1963. After film platters became commonplace in the 1970s, Xenon lamps became the most common light source, as they could stay lit for extended periods of time, whereas a carbon rod used for a carbon arc could last for an hour at the most.|$|E

It {{was first}} introduced on the 70-year-anniversary of the federal state North Rhine-Westfalia in August 2016. It has 56 <b>Xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps.</b> It was first intended only for the anniversary. Due to high public popularity, they try to set it up permanently and to use it on special occasions.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Arc</b> <b>lamps</b> were {{superseded}} by filament lamps in most roles, remaining in only certain niche {{applications such as}} cinema projection, followspots, and searchlights. Even in these applications conventional carbon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> are being pushed into obsolescence by <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps,</b> but were still being manufactured as spotlights at least as late as 1982 and are still manufactured {{for at least one}} purpose [...] - [...] simulating sunlight in [...] "accelerated aging" [...] machines intended to estimate how fast a material is likely to be degraded by environmental exposure.|$|R
25|$|These {{lighting}} instruments come in {{a variety}} of sizes with light sources ranging from low power incandescent light bulbs to very powerful <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps.</b> Carbon <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> spots were common until the 1990s, using the arc between carbon rods as their light source. These follow spots required special installations that include high volume ventilation due to the hazardous fumes produced by the carbon arc. The current generation, xenon, has extremely high internal pressure in the lamp and thus has its own safety concerns.|$|R
50|$|Using a {{powerful}} <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp,</b> 1 lumen of light is focused through a optical fiber onto a 300-400 μm spot of the object’s surface. The reflected light is collected {{by a second}} fiber optic. The period of exposure is monitored with a probe that transforms the reflectance spectrum into color coordinates in real-time. A typical microfading test is achieved in less than 10 minutes and replicates exposures equivalent to 5-12 years of display at normal museum light levels. The output of the <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> is kept at a constant by an exposure controller while it is filtered to 400-710 nm using a water filter. The spectrum is then used to quantify {{the amount of time}} it would take for the color change to result in a noticeable difference. This information is used to retrofit display conditions and improve the protection of vulnerable objects.Calibration of the instrument is achieved by using internal standards such as the Blue Wool Scale.|$|E
50|$|DLP {{technology}} is light-source agnostic {{and as such}} can be used effectively {{with a variety of}} light sources. Historically, the main light source used on DLP display systems has been a replaceable high-pressure <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> unit (containing a quartz arc tube, reflector, electrical connections, and sometimes a quartz/glass shield), whereas most pico category (ultra-small) DLP projectors use high-power LEDs or lasers as a source of illumination.|$|E
50|$|Several Polilight {{models have}} been released, {{including}} the Polilight 6/150W, Polilight 10/300W and the Polilight500, sometimes abbreviated to PL6, PL10 and PL500. The PL500 ('500' refers to the power in watts of the <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp)</b> has eleven monochromatic bands, a ‘blank’ position that provides high intensity white light {{in the range from}} 380 to 650 nm and an optional infra-red output suitable for document examination.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} of the incandescent lamp did not use a hot wire filament, but instead used an arc struck on a spherical bead electrode to produce heat. The electrode then became incandescent, with the arc contributing little to the light produced. Such lamps were used for projection or illumination for scientific instruments such as microscopes. These <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> ran on relatively low voltages and incorporated tungsten filaments to start ionization within the envelope. They provided the intense concentrated light of an <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> but were easier to operate. Developed around 1915, these lamps were displaced by mercury and <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> {{developed}} during the Apollo program by Streamlight, Inc. are the basis for commercial flashlights and emergency handlights. These {{are some of the}} brightest portable lights made. They throw a light some 50 times brighter than automobile high beams and are primarily used by police and military. The light penetrates fog and smoke and returns less back-scatter light. They are operated on portable power packs as boat and auto batteries. An infrared model produces totally invisible light for covert surveillance...|$|R
5000|$|The {{front fascia}} takes its cues from the 100EX {{but with the}} crucial {{difference}} of the middle bodywork/raised bonnet/grille assemblage terminating midway down the face rather than continuing downwards and bisecting the front bumper. The headlamps are also taken {{straight out of the}} 100EX/101EX concept and are similar to the Phantom's. The deep set rectangular high beams are light-emitting diode (LED) units while the round [...] "faux-foglamp" [...] driving lights are projector-style <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps.</b> The exterior is available in more than 44,000 colour combinations.|$|R
5000|$|The term is {{now used}} for gas {{discharge}} lamps, which produce light by an arc between metal electrodes through an inert gas {{in a glass}} bulb. The common fluorescent lamp is a low-pressure mercury arc lamp. [...] The <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp,</b> which produces a high intensity white light, is now used {{in many of the}} applications which formerly used the carbon arc, such as movie projectors and searchlights.|$|E
50|$|Light from a <b>Xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> was {{modulated}} by a {{light valve}} {{consisting of a}} rotating glass disc that was continuously re-coated with a viscous oil. An electron beam {{similar to the one}} in a cathode ray tube traced a raster {{on the surface of the}} coated glass, deforming the surface of the oil. Where the oil was undisturbed, the light would be reflected into a light trap. The raster traced into the oil formed a diffraction grating.|$|E

50|$|The weather {{testing process}} can be greatly {{accelerated}} {{through the use of}} specially designed weathering chambers. While this speeds up the time needed to get results, the conditions are not always representative of real world conditions. Most of the commercialized devices are using Gas-discharge <b>lamp</b> (e.g. <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps),</b> electric <b>arc</b> (carbon) or fluorescent lamps to simulate/accelerate the effect of sunlight. Xenon, mercury, metal halide or carbon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> have to be used with a careful elimination of shorter wavelenghs usually by adding a borosilicate filter. In Fluorescent lamps the short UV is converted into visible light or long wavelength UV with fluorescent coatings.|$|R
5000|$|Continuous, short-arc, high {{pressure}} <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> have a color temperature closely approximating noon sunlight {{and are used}} in solar simulators. That is, the chromaticity of these lamps closely approximates a heated black body radiator at {{the temperature of the}} Sun. First introduced in the 1940s, these lamps replaced the shorter-lived carbon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> in movie projectors. They are also employed in typical 35mm, IMAX, and digital film projection systems. They are an excellent source of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and have intense emissions in the near infrared used in some night vision systems. Xenon is used as a starter gas in HID automotive headlights, and high-end [...] "tactical" [...] flashlights.|$|R
50|$|The {{very small}} size of the arc makes it {{possible}} to focus the light from the lamp with moderate precision. For this reason, <b>xenon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> of smaller sizes, down to 10 watts, are used in optics and in precision illumination for microscopes and other instruments, although in modern times they are being displaced by single mode laser diodes and white light supercontinuum lasers which can produce a truly diffraction limited spot. Larger lamps are employed in searchlights where narrow beams of light are generated, or in film production lighting where daylight simulation is required.|$|R
