5000|$|A likely {{candidate}} for {{an extreme example}} of compound articulated rod design could be the complex German 24-cylinder Junkers Jumo 222 aviation engine, meant to have — unlike an <b>X-engine</b> layout with 24 cylinders, possessing six cylinders per bank — only four cylinders per bank, and six banks of cylinders, all liquid-cooled with five [...] "slave" [...] rods pinned to one master rod, for each [...] "layer" [...] of cylinders in its design. After building nearly 300 test examples in several different displacements, the Junkers firm's complex Jumo 222 engine {{turned out to be}} a production failure for the more advanced combat aircraft of the Third Reich's Luftwaffe which required aviation powerplants of over 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) output apiece.|$|E
5000|$|In Germany, the {{original}} Bomber A design {{program in the}} summer of 1936 had led to the Heinkel He 177A, powered by two Daimler-Benz DB 606 [...] "power system" [...] engines. The 606 was a late-1930s attempt to use two separate Daimler-Benz DB 601 powerplants mated to a common gear reduction case to arrive to a 24-cylinder powerplant as with the Vulture, but using twin crankcases, for the power needs for the demanding German Heinkel He 119 high-speed reconnaissance design, and the Messerschmitt Me 261 long range design's need for such a powerplant. The DB 606's twinned-up pair of DB 601 component engines, however, were arranged in an inverted W-block layout, keeping each component engine as a discrete, [...] "all up" [...] functional powerplant as much as possible (except for the [...] "final drive" [...] to the propeller shaft) instead of the X-crankcase/cylinder layout. The Daimler-Benz firm was also working on a single-crankcase 24-cylinder design solution in parallel with the DB 606 design, creating the an <b>X-engine</b> design of their own from 1939 through September 1942. Like the Vulture, DB engineers found the DB 606, weighing in at a massive 1.5 tonnes, simply did not work well, particularly when the airframe mounting them possessed a deficient design that prevented adequate maintenance access and ventilation.|$|E

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves [117]- 121). This thesis {{attempts to}} accelerate compute intensive sections of a frequency domain radio astronomy correlator using dedicated co-processors. Two co-processor implementations were made independently with one using reconfigurable hardware (Xilinx Virtex 4 LXlOO) {{and the other}} uses a graphics processor (Nvidia 9800 GT). The objective of a radio astronomy correlator is to compute the complex valued correlation products for each baseline {{which can be used}} to reconstruct the sky's radio brightness distribution. Radio astronomy correlators have huge computation demands and this dissertation focuses on the computational aspects of correlation, concentrating on the <b>X-engine</b> stage of the correlator...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{implementation}} of a custom GPU-based compute cluster that provides the correlation <b>X-engine</b> of the CHIME Pathfinder radio telescope. It is among the largest such systems in operation, correlating 32, 896 baselines (256 inputs) over 400 MHz of radio bandwidth. Making heavy use of consumer-grade parts and a custom software stack, the system was developed at {{a small fraction of}} the cost of comparable installations. Unlike existing GPU backends, this system is built around OpenCL kernels running on consumer-level AMD GPUs, taking advantage of low-cost hardware and leveraging packed integer operations to double algorithmic efficiency. The system achieves the required 105 TOPS in a 10 kW power envelope, making it among the most power-efficient X-engines in use today. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures. Accepted by IEEE ASAP 201...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} highly {{parallel}} {{implementation of the}} cross-correlation of time-series data using graphics processing units (GPUs), which is scalable to hundreds of independent inputs and suitable for the processing of signals from "Large-N" arrays of many radio antennas. The computational part of the algorithm, the <b>X-engine,</b> is implementated efficiently on Nvidia's Fermi architecture, sustaining up to 79 % of the peak single precision floating-point throughput. We compare performance obtained for hardware- and software-managed caches, observing significantly better performance for the latter. The high performance reported involves use of a multi-level data tiling strategy in memory and use of a pipelined algorithm with simultaneous computation and transfer of data from host to device memory. The speed of code development, flexibility, and low cost of the GPU implementations compared to ASIC and FPGA implementations {{have the potential to}} greatly shorten the cycle of correlator development and deployment, for cases where some power consumption penalty can be tolerated.

40|$|Interferometric {{radio telescopes}} often rely on {{computationally}} expensive O(N^ 2) correlation calculations; fortunately these computations map well to massively parallel accelerators such as low-cost GPUs. This paper describes the OpenCL kernels {{developed for the}} GPU based <b>X-engine</b> of a new hybrid FX correlator. Channelized data from the F-engine is supplied to the GPUs as 4 -bit, offset-encoded real and imaginary integers. Because of the low bit width of the data, two values may be packed into a 32 -bit register, allowing multiplication and addition {{of more than one}} value with a single fused multiply-add instruction. With this data and calculation packing scheme, as many as 5. 6 effective tera-operations per second (TOPS) can be executed on a 4. 3 TOPS GPU. The kernel design allows correlations to scale to large numbers of input elements, limited only by maximum buffer sizes on the GPU. This code is currently working on-sky with the CHIME Pathfinder Correlator in BC, Canada. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE ASAP 2015 Conferenc...|$|E
40|$|The CHIME Pathfinder {{is a new}} {{interferometric}} {{radio telescope}} that uses a hybrid FPGA/GPU FX correlator. The GPU-based <b>X-engine</b> of this correlator processes over 819 Gb/s of 4 + 4 -bit complex astronomical data from N= 256 inputs across a 400 MHz radio band. A software framework is presented to manage this real-time data flow, which allows each of 16 processing servers to handle 51. 2 Gb/s of astronomical data, plus 8 Gb/s of ancillary data. Each server receives data {{in the form of}} UDP packets from an FPGA F-engine over the eight 10 GbE links, combines data from these packets into large (32 MB- 256 MB) buffered frames, and transfers them to multiple GPU co-processors for correlation. The results from the GPUs are combined and normalized, then transmitted to a collection server, where they are merged into a single file. Aggressive optimizations enable each server to handle this high rate of data; allowing the efficient correlation of 25 MHz of radio bandwidth per server. The solution scales well to larger values of N by adding additional servers. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, In Press, IEEE ASAP 201...|$|E
