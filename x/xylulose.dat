When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells they are often converted to more space-efficient forms, often polysaccharides. In many animals, including humans, this storage form is glycogen, especially in liver and muscle cells. In plants, starch is used for the same purpose. The most abundant carbohydrate, cellulose, is a structural component of the cell wall of plants and many forms of algae. Ribose is a component of RNA. Deoxyribose is a component of DNA.

Galactose, a component of milk sugar lactose, is found in galactolipids in plant cell membranes and in glycoproteins in many tissues.

Without the regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, the cycle will be unable to continue.

In response, S. cerevisiae has been engineered to ferment xylose through the addition of the S. stiptis genes, XYL1 and XYL2, coding for xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase, respectively. The concerted action of these enzymes converts xylose to <b>xylulose,</b> which is naturally fermented by S. cerevisae.

[...] Therefore, the reaction that occurs in the pentose phosphate pathway is exactly the reverse of the reaction which occurs in the Calvin cycle. The mechanism remains the same and involves the formation of an enediolate intermediate. Due to its involvement in this pathway, phosphopentose epimerase is an important enzyme for the cellular response to oxidative stress. [...] The generation of NADPH by the pentose phosphate pathway helps protect cells against reactive oxygen species. NADPH is able to reduce glutathione, which detoxifies the body by producing H2O from H2O2. [...] Therefore, not only does phosphopentose epimerase alter flux through the PPP, but it also prevents buildup of peroxides.|$|E

In glucose-fermenting cells, the carbon balance could be closed, whereas in xylulose-fermenting cells, about 25 % of the consumed sugar carbon could not be accounted for. The rate of sugar consumption was 3. 94 mmol g of initial biomass− 1 h− 1 for glucose and 0. 39 mmol g of initial biomass− 1 h− 1 for <b>xylulose.</b> Concentrations of the intermediary metabolites fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate (FDP), pyruvate (PYR), sedoheptulose 7 -phosphate (S 7 P), erytrose 4 -phosphate, citrate (CIT), fumarate, and malate were compared for both types of cells. Levels of FDP, PYR, and CIT were lower, and levels of S 7 P were higher in xylulose-fermenting cells. After normalization to the carbon consumption rate, the levels of FDP were approximately the same, whereas {{there was a significant}} accumulation of S 7 P, PYR, CIT, and malate, especially of S 7 P, in xylulose-fermenting cells compared with in glucose-fermenting cells. In the presence of 15 μM iodoacetate, an inhibitor of the enzyme glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 2. 1. 12), FDP levels increased and S 7 P levels decreased in xylulose-assimilating cells compared with {{in the absence of the}} inhibitor, whereas fermentation was slightly slowed down.

Intriguingly, the S. cerevisiae GRE 3 gene can complement the Cagre 3 mutant, while the ScSOR 1 gene can complement the Caxyl 2 mutant, showing that S. cerevisiae contains the enzymatic capacity for converting xylose to <b>xylulose.</b> In addition, the gre 3 xyl 2 double mutant of C. albicans is effectively rescued by the xylose isomerase (XI) gene of either Piromyces or Orpinomyces, suggesting that the XI provides an alternative to the missing oxido-reductase functions in the mutant required for the xylose-xylulose conversion. Overall this work suggests that C. albicans strains engineered to lack essential steps for xylose metabolism can provide a platform for the analysis of xylose metabolism enzymes from a variety of species, an...|$|E
30|$|Ethanol {{has been}} used as an {{antimicrobial}} agent in foods and is known to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes (Oh and Marshall 1993). Yeasts generate ethanol from glucose by alcoholic fermentation under anaerobic conditions. SJP-SNU possess genes involved in alcoholic fermentation using glucose and additional genes (xylose reductase and <b>xylulose</b> kinase genes) for ethanol production with xylose. Therefore, SJP-SNU may produce ethanol in the anaerobic intestines, which may affect microbiota of intestines.|$|E
40|$|Thiamine {{diphosphate}} (ThDP) -dependent enzymes are ubiquitously {{present in}} all organisms and catalyze essential reactions in various metabolic pathways. ThDP-dependent phosphoketolase plays key roles in the central metabolism of heterofermentative bacteria and in the pentose catabolism of various microbes. In particular, bifidobacteria, representatives of beneficial commensal bacteria, have an effective glycolytic pathway called bifid shunt in which 2. 5 mol of ATP are produced per glucose. Phosphoketolase catalyzes two steps in the bifid shunt because of its dual-substrate specificity; they are phosphorolytic cleavage of fructose 6 -phosphate or <b>xylulose</b> 5 -phosphate to produce aldose phosphate, acetyl phosphate, and H 2 O. The phosphoketolase reaction is different from other well studied ThDP-dependent enzymes because it involves a dehydration step. Although phosphoketolase was discovered more than 50 years ago, its three-dimensional structure remains unclear. In this study we report the crystal structures of <b>xylulose</b> 5 -phosphate/fructose 6 -phosphate phosphoketolase from Bifidobacterium breve. The structures of the two intermediates before and after dehydration (α,β-dihydroxyethyl ThDP and 2 -acetyl-ThDP) and complex with inorganic phosphate give an insight into the mechanism of {{each step of the}} enzymatic reaction...|$|E
