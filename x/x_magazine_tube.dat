50|$|The {{variants}} {{with the}} extended <b>magazine</b> <b>tubes</b> use different barrels, as the barrel {{is held in}} place by attaching {{at the end of the}} <b>magazine</b> <b>tube.</b> The shortest barrel length available for the eight- and nine-shot models is 20 in, which fits flush with the long <b>magazine</b> <b>tube.</b> A ribbed 28 in modified choke field barrel was also manufactured for the 8-shot model 500. The shortest barrel for Title I six-shot models is 18.0 in, while military and law enforcement personnel (as well private persons in NFA states) can also get a 14 in barrel (the 590 Compact), which uses a special 5-shot magazine.|$|R

50|$|While IPSC Open {{limits the}} {{magazine}} length to 170 mm (approximately 6.69 inches), USPSA Open changed the maximum magazine length from 170 mm to 171.25 mm (6.742 inches) somewhere between 2004 and 2009. Confusingly, some 171.25 mm magazine setups are marketed {{and referred to}} as 170 mm while they in reality measure 171.25 mm, making their configuration illegal for IPSC competitions. Since the <b>magazine</b> <b>tubes</b> themselves always are shorter than 170 mm, the overall magazine length will be dependent on the particular basepad used. I.e. using a 167 mm long <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> with a 3 mm basepad would yield an overall length of 170 mm making its configuration approved for international competition, while a 167 mm <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> with a 4 mm basepad would yield an overall length of 171 mm making it restricted to USPSA matches only. Adding to the confusion, some manufacturers lists their <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> length as {{the length of the}} tube itself, while others lists the length with a basepad assembled.|$|R

50|$|The primary {{difference}} between the Model 500 and Model 590 is in <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> design. The Model 500 magazines are closed at the muzzle end, and the barrel is {{held in place by}} bolting into a threaded hole {{at the end of the}} <b>magazine</b> <b>tube.</b> Model 590 <b>magazines</b> are designed to be opened at the muzzle end, and the barrels fit around the <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> and are held on by a capnut at the end. The Model 500 magazine facilitates easy barrel changes, as the barrel bolt serves no function other than holding the barrel in place. The Model 590 magazine facilitates easy cleaning and parts replacement, as removing the nut allows removal of the magazine spring and follower.|$|R

50|$|Model 535 barrels are not {{interchangeable}} with Model 500 or Model 835 barrels, but 535 barrels {{are available}} in smoothbore and rifled {{in a variety of}} vent ribbed, barrel lengths and different sights. The 535 is also available in a tactical model with ghost ring sights and a collapsible pistol grip buttstock. Although Model 500 barrels can be used with Model 535 receivers, <b>magazine</b> <b>tubes</b> from the Model 500 must also be used because of the <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> length difference.|$|R
50|$|The DP-12 is a bullpup 12-gauge pump action double-barreled shotgun {{designed}} by Standard Mfg Co.. It has two <b>tube</b> <b>magazines</b> which each feed their own barrel. Each <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> can {{hold up to}} seven 2.75 in 12-gauge shotshells or six 3 in shotgun shells.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{standard}} {{capacity of the}} Model 10 is 4 shells, there was a <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> extension available which would increase the capacity to 6 shells.|$|R
50|$|The Sportsman '48 is a {{variation}} introduced {{to comply with}} various US hunting laws that limited shotguns used for hunting to three shells. It came with a crimped <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> that allowed it to be loaded with only two shells in the magazine. One additional round placed in the chamber brought its total capacity to three shells. It came in 12, 16, and 20 gauge variations. The dimples pressed into the <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> can be removed with a round file from the inside, allowing the magazine to accept 4 shells instead of just 2.|$|R

50|$|A sawed-off shotgun (US, CAN) {{also called}} a sawn-off shotgun (UK, IRL, AU, NZ) and a short-barreled shotgun (SBS) (U.S. {{legislative}} terminology), {{is a type}} of shotgun with a shorter gun barrel—typically under 18 inches—and often a shortened or absent stock. Despite the colloquial term, barrels do not, strictly speaking, have to be shortened with a saw. Barrels can be manufactured at shorter lengths as an alternative to traditional, longer barrels. This makes them easier to transport due to their smaller profile and lighter weight. The design also makes the weapon easy to maneuver in cramped spaces, a feature sought by military close quarters combat units, law enforcement SWAT team users, and home defense purposes. With modern pump action/magazine tube shotguns, the shorter barrel limits the magazine capacity of the weapon due to the <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> protruding beyond the barrel. Therefore, the <b>magazine</b> <b>tubes</b> are matched in length to the barrel, which causes a {{reduction in the number of}} shells that can be held in the <b>magazine</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Model 500 {{comes in}} a variety of {{different}} receiver configurations, whose main difference is the magazine configuration. The basic Model 500 comes with a <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> capable of holding five 2.75 in shells, which is called a six-shot model (a full magazine plus a round in the chamber). The 500 is also available with an extended <b>magazine</b> <b>tube</b> that holds seven rounds, making an eight-shot model. The 590A1 is available with five- and eight-shot magazines, sold as six- and nine-shot models respectively. The Model 590A1 also allows the use of magazine extensions in place of the magazine cap to further increase the capacity of ammunition.|$|R

50|$|The {{first model}} of the rifle, {{commonly}} called the old model, was in production from 1873 to 1876.

In addition, the ejection port has no dust cover. Approximately 500 old models were produced.
