40|$|We {{study the}} motion of a random walker in one {{longitudinal}} and d transverse dimensions with a quenched power law correlated velocity field in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>x</b> <b>direction.</b> The model is a modification of the Matheron-de Marsily model, with long-range velocity correlation. For a velocity correlation function, dependent on transverse coordinates y as 1 /(a+parallel to y(1) -y(2) parallel to) (alpha), we analytically calculate the two-time correlation function of the x coordinate. We find that {{the motion of}} the x coordinate is a fractional Brownian motion (FBM), with a Hurst exponent H=max[1 / 2,(1 -alpha/ 4),(1 -d/ 4) ]. From this and known properties of FBM, we calculate the disorder averaged persistence probability of x(t) up to time t. We also find the lines in the parameter space of d and alpha along which there is marginal behavior. We present results of simulations which support our analytical calculation...|$|R

In the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction,</b> the same trend was observed for the two levels of ground motions as previously demonstrated; as the skew angle increases, the displacement increases. The deck of the bridges without shear keys experienced slightly larger displacements than those with shear keys. However for straight bridges, displacements in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction</b> {{do not seem to}} be affected by the absence of shear keys. It is anticipated that deformations in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction</b> will not be affected significantly by the absence of shear keys, while it is expected that transverse deformations will be affected significantly.|$|R

Along the transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>directions</b> of the ladder, there exist plenty Peierls phases corresponding to various dimerization patterns. Resulted from a special modulation, namely, staggered modulation along the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction,</b> the ladder {{system in the}} insulator phase behaves as a "topological insulator", which possesses charged solitons as the gapless edge states existing in the gap. Such solitary states promise the dispersionless propagation along the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction</b> of the ladder system.

30|$|When {{comparing}} ED in standing trees, {{there were}} differences in the longitudinal (EDL) and transversal (EDT) dynamic elastic modulus. EDT was higher than EDL (Table  1). The difference in the variability of data {{is due to the}} location of the anatomical elements of the tree. Ultrasound waves travel slower in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction</b> than in transversal direction because waves disperse along the fiber length. The contrary occurs in transversal direction, where the ultrasound spreads easily across fiber cell wall [27]. Bucur [25] mentions that speed in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction</b> is one-fifth or one-third of the speed in perpendicular-to-grain direction, which is why the dynamic elastic modulus is smaller in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction</b> as was determined in the teak trees.|$|R

30|$|The {{localized}} KARs {{were matched}} with the localized MOE {{at the same}} position on the lamina; then, the tensile strength of 1  mm-long lamina element was calculated using these localized KAR and MOE values. The 345 points of localized MOE were recorded by MSR machine and the measured length was 3000  mm. Thus, the length of localized MOE was approximately 8.7  mm and the same MOE was applied within the corresponding section. Meanwhile, the detected image for measuring a KAR was continuous along the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction</b> of lamina. Knot lengths at perpendicular to the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction</b> on four surfaces of lamina were used for calculating KAR. The knot lengths can be detected at 1  mm intervals along the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction.</b> Thus, the localized tensile strength can be predicted for every 1  mm-long element.|$|R

The armored vehicle model is developed using three main inputs of a vehicle system which are Pitman arm steering system, Powertrain system and also hydraulic assisted brake system. Several testings in lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction</b> are performed such as double lane change, slalom, step steer and sudden acceleration and sudden braking to verify the vehicle model. The armored vehicle model is verified using validated software, CarSim, using HMMWV vehicle model as a benchmark.

40|$|The {{transverse}} viscoelastic {{extension of}} isolated Nitella cell walls is stimulated by acid pH and by Mg 2 + and K+ ions. In {{the presence of}} 1 millimolar citrate-phosphate buffer the threshold pH in the transverse direction is 3. 5, compared to 4. 5 in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction.</b> The relative amounts of extension stimulated by acid are comparable in the two directions at their respective thresholds. Longitudinal and transverse Mg 2 + ion-induced extensibility begins at 10 millimolar and reaches a plateau between 10 and 100 millimolar. The threshold for K+ ion enhancement is near 10 millimolar in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction</b> and 50 millimolar in the transverse direction. Maximum stimulation by K+ is obtained at 250 millimolar. At their respective maxima, Mg 2 + and K+ induce equal amounts of extension. However, the relative amount of extension induced by ions is significantly less in the transverse than in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>direction.</b> Ions and acids appear to affect different sites in the wall, inasmuch as neither treatment abolishes {{the effect of the}} other.
