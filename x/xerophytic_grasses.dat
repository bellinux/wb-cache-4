40|$|The seminatural prairie of the Raña of Cañamero (Spain) is a {{degraded}} and unproductive agrosystem with {{acid and}} stony soils, and low coverage of <b>xerophytic</b> <b>grasses.</b> In a project about secondary reconversion of the raña-prairie {{to a more}} productive cropland, an experimental field (EF) was established to assess the effect on plot-productivity {{of the interaction between}} correction of soil pH (liming) with three cropping systems: a no-tilled and annually fertilized and improved prairies, and a conventionally-tilled forage crop. The EF model of management was designed as plant-conservative, because no herbicide was applied after seeding to preserve the post-emergence of wild herbs and the natural grass diversity of the prairie. Between 2008 and 2012, we analysed the effect of managing factors (initial conventional-tillage, fertilization, liming and cropping) and agricultural predictors (pH, C:N ratio, soil bulk density and herbaceous biomass) on the alpha(α) -diversity of one of the major group of soil animals, the oribatids. In relation to the raña-prairie, all EF-plots improved their soil bulk density (ρs) and herbaceous biomass (t/ha), and enhanced desirable α-diversity values (richness, abundance and community equity). We conclude that the plant-conservative model: i) do not affect statistically the species richness of the prairie; ii) the desirable α-diversity responses are negatively correlated with soil bulk density and positively with herbaceous biomass, and iii) the low input or minimum intervention model, of an initial and conventional till and annual fertilisation, is the threshold and optimal model of agricultural management to improving oribatids diversity of the raña-soil...|$|E
40|$|Pine forests Chigirinsky Bor grow {{on fresh}} sod-podzolic soils formed on ancient {{alluvial}} deposits. Pine forests {{are characterized by}} stringent moisture regimes and constantly suffer from lack of productive moisture in soil.   Industrial development of Cherkasy in 60 th years of ХХ century leaded air pollution and emissions of SO 2, NOx, NH 3, and dust. This contributed to significant negative influence on the surrounding forest ecosystems from enterprises of  Cherkassy industrial agglomeration. The grass cover in pine stands of Chigirinsky Bor transforms into <b>xerophytic</b> <b>grasses</b> and ruderal communities under the impact of negative biotic and abiotic factors. They are namely the anthropogenic violation of forest conditions, stands decline, recreational and industrial tree crowns understocking, xerophytic and heliophytic transformations of forest conditions. All the above mentioned caused strong ruderal and adventive transformation of grass cover. We registered the changes in nitrophilous plant spread regards the Cherkasy industrial agglomeration approaching which emits toxic with nitrogen-containing gases. Adventive and other non-forest species displace ferns and mosses, the ratio of ecomorfs is also changes due to increase of the quantity and development activation of annuals, xerophytic, ruderal, and nitrofil plants. The Asteraceae/Brassicaceae 3 : 1 ratio indicates significant anthropogenic violations in the region. We fixed the xerophytic, ruderal, and adventive transformation of grass cover in forest ecosystems. It is also founded the tendency of expanding the fraction of mesophilic plant species due to alterations in water regime (creation of Kremenchug reservoir and draining of floodplain Tyasmyn). When approaching the Cherkasy industrial agglomeration the grass cover degradation is clearly observed on the environmental profile. All this causes the forest ecosystem degradation and gradual loss of forest vegetation typical characteristics. We revealed the domination of plant species that are tolerant to transformed forest conditions due to drastic anthropogenic changes of ecological regimes in Chygyryn's Bor. Key words: grass cover, Chigirin's Bor, anthropogenic impact, forest ecosystem, industrial transformation and degradation of grass cover...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} the phytolith signal of lacustrine environments, which {{are prone to}} preserving faunal remains including hominins, we analyzed the phytolith content of 46 grass and sedge species, and of 26 soil and mud samples. The samples were collected in Chad (Central Africa), in the Sudanian and Sahelian phytogeographical zones, near temporary and permanent water-bodies (including Lake Chad) and in grass-dominated biomes on well-drained soils. Altogether, we observed and counted separately 80 different phytolith types, including 38 grass silica short cells (GSSCs). Phytolith type diversity and relative abundances were analyzed in the botanical specimens to improve the phytolith taxonomic resolution. For the Poaceae, we used a valuetest analysis to identify significant cohorts of phytoliths to characterize aquatic, mesophytic, and xerophytic species. Our {{results show that the}} abundance of Cyperaceae in swampy areas may be deduced from the combined abundance of blocky and elongate phytolith types, but not by the typical silicified Papillae phytoliths, which were barely found preserved in the soil/mud. The abundance of aquatic Poaceae near water-bodies is inferred from the presence and abundance of a cohort of eight GSSC types (including notably several trapeziform GSSCs within the bilobate, cross, and saddle categories), which averages 42 % in the mud samples, but only 23 % and 14 % in the samples from the Sudanian and Sahelian zones, respectively. The characterization is unclear for mesophytic grasses, but obvious for <b>xerophytic</b> <b>grasses</b> whose abundance in the Sahelian grasslands is inferred from the presence and abundance of a cohort of five GSSC types (mainly tabular saddles), which averages 50 % in the soil samples from the arid Sahelian zone, and b 19 % in the more humid Sudanian and swamp samples. In conclusion, considering the full morphological diversity of grass silica short cell phytoliths (rather than just the broad morphological categories) allows greater discrimination of the aquatic environments. Such approach is therefore required for analyzing vegetation distribution at a local scale. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

5000|$|P. bulleri is {{endemic to}} west central Mexico. The total body length for this species is {{typically}} under 270 mm, and its body mass is typically under 250 g. The fur of P. bulleri {{can vary from}} a light shade of gray, to a darker shade depending on its geographic distribution [...] and the tail, often naked and white, has a length that is half the head and body of this species. This pocket gopher is well adapted to burrowing, which {{is evident in the}} characteristic stocky build, fusiform shape, powerful jaws and incisors, large powerful forelimbs, and reduced hind limbs and hips often observed in this species. The diet of this species includes roots of <b>xerophytic</b> shrubs, <b>grasses,</b> and forbs.|$|R
30|$|Should the {{grassland}} {{be fired}} severely and frequently, the less <b>xerophytic,</b> more nutritious <b>grasses</b> decrease in abundance and dominance, yielding place to more xerophytic, less nutritious species. Thus, the relatively well covered Themeda-Andropogon grassland may {{yield to the}} more primitive, semi-open grassland chiefly constituted by species of Aristida, Eragrostis, Sporobolus. At the same time, grassland protected from fire {{for several years and}} then fired may deteriorate both in species and in density of cover.|$|R
40|$|A {{discontinuous}} 200 m-long borehole {{drilled in}} the Bol Archipelago (13 degrees N, Lake Chad) provided 25 samples, which were dated using the Be- 10 /Be- 9 method and analyzed for their micro-biological content. The dating provided ages ranging from 63 +/- 0. 1 to 2. 6 +/- 0. 1 Ma, a period contemporaneous with the Pliocene fossil localities {{located in the}} current Djurab desert of Chad (16 - 17 degrees N). Well-preserved diatom assemblages first occurred at 4. 7 +/- 0. 1 Ma and were dominated by the freshwater planktonic genera Aulacoseira and Stephanodiscus {{until the end of}} the Pliocene. This supports the recurrence of lacustrine conditions at Bol during all the Pliocene. The presence of pelite and argillaceous deposits in the core before 4. 7 +/- 0. 1 Ma, however, suggests that the lake settled earlier, at least since 6. 3 +/- 0. 1 Ma. The abundance of Afromontane pollen taxa at 4. 2 +/- 0. 1 Ma and the occurrence of trapeziform polylobate phytoliths throughout the sequence suggest significant vegetation inputs from the southern highlands, while the importance of kaolinite in the clay sediments indicates a water supply predominantly from the south during the Pliocene. Phytolith assemblages are all dominated by lobate grass silica short cells and by blocky and elongate types, which attest to the presence of herbaceous-dominated vegetation around Bol and/or in the southern drainage basin during the Pliocene. This result is also supported by the pollen assemblage described at 4. 2 +/- 0. 1 Ma, which shows highest affinity for the savanna biome. Moreover, low values for the <b>Xerophytic</b> <b>grass</b> phytolith index indicate the presence of humid-loving (mesophytic and aquatic) grass communities in this vegetation. At last, significant variations in the abundance of blocky and elongate phytoliths are indicative of local alternations of fully lacustrine and marshy conditions at Bo!. Particularly between 3. 6 and 2. 7 Ma, the abundance of silicified bulliform cells combined with the absence of diatoms support a significant lacustrine reduction at Bol favoring the increasing of local marshy vegetation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a phytolith record from a late Holocene sedimentary core from the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi area in northeastern KwaZulu-Natal. Radiocarbon dating showed the oldest sediments {{to be from}} 23 80 ± 40 BP. Phytoliths are present throughout the record. There was {{a high degree of}} unclassifiable phytoliths (> 79 % per sub-sample), but preliminary trends identified include a dominance of C₄ grasses throughout (Chloridoideae and Panicoideae; adapted to higher temperatures and greater insolation), and slightly more C₃ grasses (Pooideae; adapted to cooler temperatures and/or winter rainfall) towards the base. The tree cover density index (D/P) does not reflect increased bush encroachment at this site, but appears to show a closed forest at 36 cm depth and relatively densely-wooded savannas throughout, while the humidity-aridity index (lph) and water stress index (Fs) suggest a move towards a <b>xerophytic</b> short <b>grass</b> savanna, and increased water stress {{at the top of the}} sequence, which could reflect the climate becoming hotter and drier due to global warming. Future studies should be done to identify phytoliths specific to the vegetation of the study site and to calibrate the indices used to confirm their utility for this area...|$|R
