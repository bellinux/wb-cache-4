40|$|Modifications {{were made}} to the <b>X-ray</b> <b>reflectometer</b> located at the Space Sciences Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center. One was an {{automatic}} drive for the Large Micrometer Head. This system, interfaced with the Hewlett Packard Computer System, is used to record data and provides the <b>X-ray</b> <b>reflectometer</b> with an automated data-taking capability. Using this system, a complete scatter curve can be obtained automatically. Previously, it was necessary to manually reset the system after recording for each data point in the scatter curve. The second modification provided an externally controlled electrical drive to move the microfocus X-ray source along its axis. With this modification, one can translate the X-ray source while it is operating to locate the position providing maximum count rate...|$|E

Its core focus concerns with materials and process analysis, concepts that are key {{to a wide range of}} technologies. Some areas the faculty are involved in include the engineering of polymers and other soft materials, the electrochemistry of fuel cells, the bioengineering of artificial organs, the sequencing of the human genome, polymer interactions and synthesis, the biophysics of cellular processes, the physics of DNA, the physical chemistry of nanoparticles, neutron scattering, atmospheric chemistry, and multiple theoretical studies revolving around both mathematical physics and computational analysis.The PhD students in the department obtained their undergraduate degrees from numerous areas of study including engineering, chemistry, physics, biochemistry, and other natural science fields. The program highly emphasizes interdisciplinary research, with some doctoral students advised by two faculty members. The undergraduate program provides a degree that leads to diverse career options that historically includes biochemical engineering, environmental management, pharmaceuticals, and medicine, but also law, banking and finance, and politics.Current research activities at the chemical engineering department encompass the science and engineering of soft materials, genomic engineering, biophysics and soft matter physics, engineering of bioinductive and biomimetic materials, and interfacial engineering and electrochemistry.The chemical engineering department utilizes facilities including a polymer synthesis lab that houses metal evaporator system, a Miligen 9050 peptide synthesizer, and thin-film preparation stations. The department also uses XPS imaging systems, digital analysis systems, <b>X-ray</b> <b>reflectometers,</b> and MCT detectors, among others. For computational studies, a cluster of dedicated computers is available for intensive simulations and numerical calculations. The chemical engineering department shares facilities with the chemistry department. Shared facilities consist of equipments including fluorescence spectrometers, EPR spectrometers, nanosecond laser photlysis instruments, photon counter, and chromatographic devices. The facilities of Columbia Genome Center are also at the department's disposal.|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{application}} of coherence theory to neutron scattering a description is given of the propagation of neutrons or <b>x-rays</b> through a <b>reflectometer.</b> Important coherence effects at the sample position are discussed. Further, an outline is given how to determine the measured count rate in a detector {{on the basis of}} this method including neutron-polarization effects. It is shown in what way the Born approximation and distorted-wave Born approximation can be used within this theory. An outline is given of the phase-object approximation, describing the specular and diffuse scattering from a surface with large surface structure, extending over the existing capabilities of the distorted-wave Born approximation. The incorporation of neutron-polarization effects enables the detailed discussion of neutron spin-echo coding techniques applied to reflectometry.

The measurements were made using 8. 34 A X-rays at various angles of incidence. Selected samples were contaminated after being measured and then remeasured {{to determine the effects}} of contamination.

40|$|InAlAs/InP hetero-interface {{grown by}} MBE was {{compared}} with that grown by MOCVD from the viewpoints of structural and electrical properties by using Grazing Incidence <b>X-ray</b> <b>reflectometer</b> and C-V method. The etching experiments on a thin InP layer were also made to examine {{the influence of the}} interface properties on the etching selectivity. It was revealed that the abruptness of InAlAs/InP interface grown by MBE was better than that grown by MOCVD if the special interface formation process was not employed. In the case of MOCVD epitaxial layer, it was suggested that the transition layer was formed at InAlAs to InP interface and this layer might affect not only electrical properties but also etching process of InP etch-stop layer...|$|E
40|$|Molecularly smooth mica has {{hitherto}} {{not been}} widely {{used as a}} substrate for the X-ray reflectometry (XRR) technique. That {{is largely due to}} the difficulty of achieving flatness over a sufficiently large area of mica. Here we show that this difficulty can be overcome by slightly bending the mica substrate over an underlying cylinder; the enhanced rigidity of the bent mica sheet along the axis of the cylinder provides sufficient flatness along this axis for XRR measurements. To test this method, we have employed it to characterise three types of nanofilms on mica in air: (A) Cr-Au thin films; (B) a surface-grown zwitterionic polymer brush; and (C) a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) phospholipid monolayer, using a table-top <b>X-ray</b> <b>reflectometer.</b> Fitting the obtained reflectivity curves with the standard Parratt algorithm allows us to extract the structural information of the nanofilms (both thickness and apparent roughness). Our simple method points to how XRR may be exploited as a useful characterisation tool for nanofilms on mica...|$|E
40|$|Oblique angle {{deposition}} of oxides is being famous for fabricating inhomogeneous thin films with variation of refractive index along thickness in a functional form. Inhomogeneous layers {{play a key}} role in the development of rugate interference devices for photo-physical applications. Such obliquely deposited thin films show high porosity which is a critical issue related to their mechanical and environmental stability. Hence, it is important to investigate elastic properties of such film in addition to optical properties. Using atomic force acoustic microscopy, we report indentation modulus of HfO 2 thin films deposited at angles 80, 68, 57, 40 and 0 degree with normal to substrate plane on Si (100) substrate. Such films were measured to have indentation modulus of 42 GPa for extreme obliquely deposited film and indentation modulus increases with decrease in angle to become highest with a value of 221 GPa for normally deposited films. We also report microstructural properties and density of films measured by FESEM and grazing angle <b>X-ray</b> <b>reflectometer</b> respectively. Both indentation modulus and density depict a parabolic decreasing behavior with angle of deposition. Variation of density is again confirmed by FESEM cross-sectional morphology of such films...|$|E
