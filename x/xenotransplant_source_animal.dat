40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} a sample that received human rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) in Virginia {{as a result}} of animal exposures in 2002 and 2003 and {{to determine the extent to}} which PEP decisions were appropriate. Methods: PEP surveillance data were requested from 35 Virginia health districts within 5 regions. Retrospective chart review was used to gather demographic, exposure and <b>source</b> <b>animal</b> data from patient records and animal exposure reports. Descriptive statistics are presented. True exposures and appropriateness of PEP were defined using the 2004 Virginia Rabies Control Guidelines and the Recommendations of the 1999 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The 2003 sample was analyzed for appropriateness of PEP because it was more representative than the 2002 sample. Stepwise syntax was created in SPSS utilizing 3 key decision variables and the 2004 Virginia Rabies Control Guidelines Algorithm for PEP decisions to determine appropriateness of PEP. Results: The 2002 and 2003 sample consisted of 838 PEP records, (73. 6 %) of 1139 PEP reported to the Division of Zoonotic and Environmental Epidemiology (central office of the Virginia Department of Health). Most PEP patients were young (mean 32. 3 years) and had true exposures during spring or summer that resulted from approaching and handling a potentially rabid animal. Over half of the <b>source</b> <b>animals</b> were not captured. For the analysis of appropriateness, 55. 2 % (270 / 489) of PEP was appropriate, 22. 5 % (110 / 489) was inappropriate and 22. 3 % (109 / 489) of PEP had missing data on key decision variables. Inappropriate PEP primarily resulted from not true exposures [79 % (87 / 110) ]. Group exposures represented 42 % more inappropriate PEP than individual exposures. Conclusion: Much PEP could be avoided in Virginia if more <b>source</b> <b>animals</b> were captured. The majority of inappropriate PEP occurred because PEP was given for exposures that were not true. New educational strategies for health care providers, public health personnel and the public are recommended to reduce the number of inappropriate PEP. Standardization of data collection methods, linking human and <b>source</b> <b>animal</b> data, computerization and formation of a central database are recommended to improve human rabies PEP surveillance in Virginia...|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{examine the}} {{prevalence}} of bacteriocin production in Streptococcus bovis isolates from Australian ruminants and the feasibility of industrial production of bacteriocin. Methods and Results: Streptococcus bovis strains were tested for production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) by antagonism assay against Lactococcus lactis. BLIS production was associated with <b>source</b> <b>animal</b> location (i. e. proximity of other bacteriocin-positive <b>source</b> <b>animals)</b> rather than ruminant species/breed or diet. One bacteriocin showing strong inhibitory activity (Sb 15) was isolated and examined. Protein sequence, stability and activity spectrum of this bovicin were very similar to bovicin HC 5. Production could be increased through serial culturing, and increased productivity could be partially maintained during cold storage of cultures. Conclusions: BLIS production is geographically widely distributed in Eastern Australia, {{and it appears that}} the bacteriocin+ trait is maintained in animals at the same location. The HC 5 -like bacteriocin, originally identified in North America, is also found in Australia. Production of bacteriocin can be increased through serial culturing. Significance and Impact of the Study: The HC 5 -like bacteriocins appear to have a broad global distribution. Serial culturing may provide a route towards commercial manufacturing for use in industrial applications, and purified bacteriocin from S. bovis Sb 15 could potentially be used to prevent food spoilage or as a feed additive to promote growth in ruminant species...|$|R
