40|$|Graduation date: 1976 A {{liquid crystal}} thermographic {{technique}} {{was developed for}} application to several problems in clinical medicine and physiology. The procedure was inexpensive, rapid, simple, versatile and acceptable to patients. Investigators {{in the past have}} used cholesteric liquid crystals for thermography but their use was limited to research in the medical field because the methods involved called for the direct spraying of the skin surface with the liquid crystals over a black paint. The present research has been involved in the development and fabrication of a liquid crystal dispersion thin film with very high elastomeric properties which provides perfect contact with the skin surface of a body of any configuration. Different films were prepared using plasticized vinyl resins in which the liquid crystals are dispersed. The final film yields optimum optical, thermal and mechanical characteristics and a long shelf life. Liquid crystal dispersions in plasticized polyvinyl chloride or copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate were fabricated. However, polyvinyl butyral was selected since it forms strong, highly resilient films and yields optimum optical characteristics. After the film was perfected, a clinical comparative study was conducted to evaluate the new system. In this study, seventy-five volunteer women were given a breast examination using three modalities: (1) Liquid crystal thermography using the thin film. (2) Liquid crystal thermography using the direct spraying of the liquid crystals over a pre-blackened coat (Trade name [...] Lix Kit). (3) Infrared thermography using AGA Thermovision model 680 infrared thermography system. All positively read thermograms were followed up by a <b>xeroradiography</b> examination, the most recent and widely spread method for breast cancer detection. Positive thermographic signs were defined and a new interpretation scheme was introduced intended to reduce the false positive rate and to free the thermographic interpretation from the dependency on the experience of the reader. The new interpretation method was applied to one thousand random cases of patients who had breast examinations using infrared thermography, <b>xeroradiography</b> and pathological tests. This interpretation scheme is based on a trinary point system which penalizes each positive symptom by 1 or 2 points according to its severity. The total number of points which are assigned to the thermogram would make it negative, positive or equivocal. As a result of this method, the false positive rate which constitutes a major disadvantage of infrared thermographic techniques was reduced from 57. 4...|$|E
40|$|The risk of {{radiation}} carcinogenesis {{has been established}} for breast tissue from experience with total body irradiation and multiple fluoroscopy of the chest with the patient prone. The doubling dose has been estimated to lie between 20 and 50 rads. Before undertaking radiologic screening programs for breast cancer, therefore, {{it is necessary to}} determine whether exposures below this range are safe. Of 792 women who had had tuberculosis and were followed for a minimum of 20 years, 451 had had multiple fluoroscopy while supine; 341 had not had fluoroscopy. The first group received a total radiation dose to the breast averaging 17 rads (141. 5 fluoroscopies); the incidence of breast cancer in this group was not increased. Had fluoroscopy been performed with the patient prone the total radiation dose would have averaged 308 rads. The difference is thought to explain the increased incidence of breast cancer attributable to fluoroscopy given with the patient prone. Mid-breast exposure with mammography or <b>xeroradiography</b> varies between 3 and 6 rads. Repetitive screening would, therefore, appear safe provided total exposure did not exceed 20 rads. With this restriction there would appear to be no reason to curtail screening of women for breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|Some {{details of}} the physics of <b>xeroradiography,</b> and the bearing these have on films of the lung {{obtained}} by this technique, are discussed. In experiments designed to obtain useful films {{with a minimum of}} radiation exposure it was found that an exposure range of 10 - 30 mas at 200 kV at 1. 35 m (4 1 / 2 ft) without a grid or air gap gave very satisfactory results. The positive model of development was considered to give more information than the negative mode. One hundred and fourteen miners who had been exposed to silica dust, asbestos dusts or both, were examined by this technique. The xeroradiographs were compared with silver halide films taken at 200 kV. The xeroradiographs were considered to be superior in several respects, especially in the delineation of vascular shadows, normal and abnormal linear opacities. Linear opacities in asbestos-exposed subjects were better shown on the xeroradiographs and were occasionally seen on these films when the 200 kV conventional film was entirely normal. Small rounded opacities of silicosis were very poorly shown on the xeroradiographs. Pleural thickening and pleural plaques may be very well demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Malignant disease {{very often}} spreads to the skeleton. This is {{particularly}} true for carcinomas of the breast, the lungs, the prostate, and the thyroid. Knowledge {{of the state of}} the skeleton in these disorders is therefore desirable since patient management will largely depend on the early detection of bony deposits. Primary bone disease often spreads to soft tissue (lungs), and the early detection of this may alter significantly the therapeutic approach to the primary lesion. Traditionally, X-ray skeletal surveys and serum enzyme measurements provide indices which can be used in the staging of these disorders. Complementary techniques such as mammography, <b>xeroradiography,</b> thermography, and radionuclide imaging have been used to provide further relevant information. A number of benign bone diseases need early assessment in order to institute the best form of treatment. It is of importance to assess the circulation in localized areas of bone and to predict the appearance of avascular necrosis, to understand the healing mechanisms involved in fractures, and to predict the outcome of bone grafting. In this paper the clinical role of bone scanning is reviewed, particular attention being given to the recent advances brought about by the introduction of the 99 mTc compounds. It is important that the non-specialist should be aware of the great improvement in the results obtained and in the help they can give him in deciding on the best management of each patient as an individual...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims. The imaging {{techniques}} commonly used for foreign body detection include plain radiography, <b>xeroradiography,</b> computed tomography (CT) scans, {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) and ultrasonography. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) with conventional CT scan in determination of the exact location of a foreign body in the maxillofacial area in vitro. Materials and methods. In this descriptive study, seven different materials were selected as foreign bodies with dimen-sions of approximately 2 mm, 1 mm, and 0. 5 mm. These materials consisted of metal, glass, wood, stone, plastic, graphite and tooth. These foreign bodies were placed in a sheep head between the corpus of the mandible and muscle, in the tongue and in an air space. One conventional CT scan and two CBCT scans were made on the models. Results. Tooth, metal, stone and glass foreign bodies were seen clearly on CT and CBCT scans made by NewTom at the smallest size in air. However, CBCT scan by NewTom was a more effective technique for visualization of foreign bodies in air compared to conventional CT. Foreign bodies measuring 0. 5 mm made of metal, stone, glass, graphite and teeth were detected by all devices in muscle tissue and adjacent bone. Conclusion. According to the results, CBCT scans of NewTom and Planmeca are appropriate tools for detecting foreign bodies with relative high density in the maxillofacial area...|$|E

Prior to the development of CT scanners, plane X-rays were used in the investigation of mummies. <b>Xeroradiography</b> has also been employed(4). In a xeroradiograph, objects of similar X-ray density (very difficult to see on a conventional X-ray) appear edge-enhanced and so are seen much more clearly. CT scanners became available in the early 1970 s. A CT scanner produces cross-sectional X-rays of objects. On a conventional X-radiograph individual structures are often very difficult to see because all the structures lying {{in the path of the}} X-ray beam are superimposed, a problem that does not occur with CT. Another advantage of CT is that the information in a series of consecutive images may be combined to produce a three-dimensional reconstruction of an object. Slices of different thickness and magnification may be chosen. Why CT a mummy? Prior to the availability of CT scanners, the only way of finding out about the inside of a mummy in any detail was to unwrap and dissect it. This has been done by various research groups – most notably the Manchester, UK and Pennsylvania University, USA mummy projects(5, 6). Unwrapping a mummy and carrying out an autopsy is obviously very destructive. CT studies hold the possibility of producing a lot more information than is possible from plain X-rays and are able to show the undisturbed arrangement of the wrapped body. CT is also able to provide information about the internal structure of bones, organ packs, etc that wouldn’t be possible without sawing through the bones etc. The mummy we have scanned is encased in a coffin which would have to have been broken open in order to remove the body...|$|E

Notions of sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and accuracy are defined and nained as the basic tools for the imple mentation of such strategies. Doctors are concerned about diagnosing space occupying disease at an easiy stage. It is hoped that the early recognition of pathology will allow for appropriate staging of the disease. Planning of the most adequate form of treatment will even tually lead to an improvement in the patient’s management and follow-up. In order to achieve this aim, clinicians have helped thernselves {{with a variety of}} investigations, of which imaging techniques liave always played an important role. By tradition, con ventional radiology and the utilization of X-rays have been dominant. In recent years, however, a number of different imaging rnethods have established themselves iii clinical medicine and have rnatured into individual arcas of application. These include imaging techniques based on the radioactive tracer rnethod, imaging techniques based on ultra sound waves and imaging techniques based on the use of gamma rays and X-rays and the simultaneous utilization of a computer for image reconstruction of a cross section of an organ (ernission and transrnission computerized tomography, respectively). Ia this article, we review some of the concepts, arcas of application and difficulties which arise with the utilization of these techniques in medicine and an attempt is made to place them within the general diagnostic problem of space occupying disease detection.

40|$|This study investigates {{changes in}} {{ceramics}} at Tell Leilan, Syria, during three consecutive periods between 2500 and 2200 B. C. These changes co-occur with significant socio-political changes: urbanization {{of the region}} and fledgling statehood. The approach developed to examine ceramic change in this work is Ceramic Technical Sequence Analysis (CTSA) which combines the strategies of ceramic ecology, the French technique et culture school, and behavioral archaeology. CTSA is also informed by practice theory; thus, the limitations of previous work in ceramic technology are reduced. This technologically-based work discloses that the ceramic change noted at Leilan is the result of intensified ceramic production, notably faster manufacturing techniques. Estimates of labor costs were attempted through proxy measures of time expended in procuring and processing raw materials, and in pottery production techniques, including vessel formation, decoration and firing. Investigations are ordered according to the chaine operatoires used in ceramic manufacture at Leilan, and each aspect of the chaine operatoire is specifically examined in regard to changes in time expended during manufacture activities. Though archaeologists often inform their research with scientific techniques, this project is atypical in the number of methods applied, as well as the additional information gleaned from interviews with contemporary artisan-craft potters (N > 40). Investigation of multiple lines of evidence, rather than reliance on a single technique, strengthen this study's conclusions. Data were derived from a variety of characterization techniques used in Materials Science and Geosciences. Neutron activation analysis (INAA), systematic refiring tests, examination of petrographic thin sections, strength testing, dilatometry studies (thermal expansion), <b>xeroradiography,</b> observation of and consultation with modern potters and macroscopic examination of artifacts, were used to observe changes in ceramic production between the three stratigraphically delineated temporal phases at Tell Leilan. Not every aspect of chaine operatoire informs equally, nor agrees, on the topic of time expenditure. Vessel forming techniques deduced through "pot reading" of manufacture marks left on vessel surfaces proved to be the most fruitful. Ceramic Technical Sequence Analysis is productive in investigation of ceramic change, and when guided by larger research questions, may provide a link between ceramic- and social change...|$|E
