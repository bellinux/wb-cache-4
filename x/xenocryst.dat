In geology, the term xenolith is almost exclusively used to describe inclusions in igneous rock during magma emplacement and eruption. Xenoliths may be engulfed along the margins of a magma chamber, torn loose from the walls of an erupting lava conduit or explosive diatreme or picked up along {{the base of a}} flowing body of lava on the Earth's surface. A <b>xenocryst</b> is an individual foreign crystal included within an igneous body. Examples of xenocrysts are quartz crystals in a silica-deficient lava and diamonds within kimberlite diatremes.|$|E
40|$|The first U-Pb ages from a ca. 26 – 24 Ma pluton on Guadalcanal, in the intra-oceanic Solomon island arc (southwest Pacific Ocean), reveal Eocene- to Archean-aged zircon xenocrysts. <b>Xenocryst</b> populations at ca. 39 – 33 Ma and ca. 71 – 63 Ma {{correlate}} with previously obtained ages of supra-subduction magmatism within the arc.

Early Cretaceous to Archean zircon <b>xenocryst</b> ages imply continental origins and a cryptic source within the arc crust; {{they may have been}} introduced by Eocene interaction of a continental fragment with the arc, and concealed by ophiolite obduction. The data demonstrate that continentally derived zircons may be transported thousands of kilometers from their source and added to intra-oceanic arc magmas, a process likely facilitated by cyclical subduction zone advance and retreat. The findings highlight the continuum of arcs that occurs between continental and oceanic end members, and the caution with which zircons should be used to determine the provenance and setting of ancient arc terranes accreted to the continental crust...|$|E

The major and minor element compositions of olivine <b>xenocryst</b> cores in EET 79001 correspond to those of homogeneous olivines in the lherzolitic shergottites, reconfirming the previous studies.

The unit forms part of the parautochthonous domain which is stacked between underlying Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic foreland and overlying Variscan nappes. The crystallisation age of the volcanic to subvolcanic rocks has been determined by U-Pb single zircon SHRIMP method at 428 +/- 5. 2 Ma whereas zircon <b>xenocryst</b> ages vary from 500 to 2200 Ma. The shape of the <b>xenocryst</b> grains document proximal Neo- and Paleoproterozoic and distal Mesoproterozoic provenance areas for assimilated sediments.

Those basalts have a deep mantle source with a great contribution of a recycled mantle component such as EM 1 and/or EM 2. The basalts resemble in their composition those from the Meguma terrane of Nova Scotia which are of similar age suggesting a common source and therefore connection of Meguma with Gondwana during this period.

Zircon <b>xenocrysts</b> {{are assumed to}} {{originate}} from crustal rocks. Our SHRIMP (Sensitive High mass Resolution Ion MicroProbe) analyses yielded predominantly concordant U–Th–Pb ages (up to ~ 3570 Ma; Paleoarchean) that clearly predate kimberlite formation. The general U–Th–Pb concordance observed excludes notable disturbance of the zircon <b>xenocrysts</b> U–Th–Pb isotope system during kimberlite ascent and emplacement. In addition, zircon <b>xenocrysts</b> {{were found to be}} significantly more radiation-damaged than would correspond to damage accumulation only since the time of kimberlite formation. This observation first indicates that zircon crystals were sampled by the kimberlite magma at comparably shallow depths not exceeding 10 – 12 km. If, in contrast, zircon crystals originated from deeper levels of the Earth's crust, they would have been exposed to temperatures of 250 – 300 °C or more. This in turn would have caused long-term thermal annealing of the radiation damage, which was however not observed in our study. Second, our observation contradicts the hypothesis that high temperatures experienced by zircon <b>xenocrysts</b> during kimberlite ascent will cause notable structural reconstitution by short-term thermal annealing. Consequently, zircon crystals cannot have spent more than a few hours at temperatures exceeding ca. 700 – 800 °C, or {{more than a few days}} at temperatures exceeding ca. 500 – 600 °C. This in turn suggests that (i) temperatures of the ascending kimberlite magmas were rather moderate, and (ii) kimberlite ascent is a comparably short process followed by rapid cooling...|$|R

40|$|The Higashi-Izu monogenetic volcano {{group is}} {{situated}} in the northeastern part of the Izu Peninsula and is composed of more than 70 monogenetic volcanoes scattered in the area 350 km 2 wide. Tephrochronological studies indicate that the volcanism of the Higashi-Izu monogenetic volcano group started 30, 000 years ago and continued up until less than 3, 000 years before present. Actually the activity possibly began much earlier than 30, 000 years ago. The Si 02 contents of the rocks from this volcano group show a bimodal distribution : i. e., one group {{in the range from}} 49 to 60 wt. % (basalts-andesites) and the other in the range from 68 to 74 wt. % (dacites). Phenocryst assemblages of the basalt-andesite group are olivine+plagioclase, olivine+plagioclase+clinopyroxene, and olivine+plagioclase+clinopyroxene+orthopyroxene. Andesites contain granitic <b>xenocrysts</b> (quartz, plagioclase, hornblende and opaques). The phenocryst assemblage of dacite is plagioclase+orthopyroxene+hornblende+magnetite+ilmenite. Dacite dome lavas contain basaltic <b>xenocrysts</b> (magnesian olivine, Ca-rich plagioclase and clinopyroxene). The rocks of the olivine+plagioclase assemblage are mostly confined to {{the northern part of the}} area and those of the olivine+plagioclase+clinopyroxene assemblage to the southern part of the area. The rocks of the olivine+plagioclase+clinopyroxene+orthopyroxene assemblage are concentrated in the eastern part of the latter. The rocks containing <b>xenocrysts</b> are mostly confined to the northeastern part of the area. Most of the rocks without <b>xenocrysts</b> of this volcano group fall within the high-almina basalt series field and those with phenocrysts fall in the tholeiitic rock series field in the Si 02 versus total alkali diagram. The anhydrous melting expriments of basalts suggest that the unknown but limited amount of water enough to affect the phase relations was dissolved in the basaltic magmas before eruption. Most of the andesite magmas of the Higashi-Izu monogenetic volcano group were produced by the contamination of the basaltic magma with the granitic rocks constituting the crust under the Izu Peninsula. This is supported by the positive corelation between the amount of <b>xenocrysts</b> and the Si 02 and Al 2 O 3 contents and by rare-earth element data. The rocks showing evidence of such contamination are distributed mostly in the northeastern part of the region. Groundmass pyroxene assemblage changes from augite+pigeonite or augite+pigeonite+hypersthene in basalts to augite+pigeonite+hypersthene or augite+hypersthene in andesites. This change is related to the degree of contamination, the hypersthene-bearing assemblages being the product of a more advanced stage of contamination. Dacite magma was probably produced by the partial melting of the granitic rock constituting the crust by the heat of the basaltic magma. This is supported by the close occurrence of the basic and acidic magmas in time and place, the existence of basaltic <b>xenocrysts</b> in dacites and the existence of the granitic xenoliths and <b>xenocrysts</b> in basic magmas.

We performed crystallization experiments, a MELTS calculation and a cooling rate calculation to investigate the formation of DaG 476. The experimental and calculated results suggest that the parent melt of the DaG groundmass was more Fe- and Al-rich than the actual groundmass bulk composition, suggesting that the groundmass of DaG 476 contains a mafic cumulus component, alternatively fractionated liquid has escaped at the last crystallization stage. We evaluated three models for the origin of the olivine megacrysts (1) phenocryst origin, (2) <b>xenocryst</b> origin: homogeneous olivine was modified by exchange with the host magma and diffusion, and (3) <b>xenocryst</b> origin: chemical zoning of olivine was produced by the fractional crystallization. The mineralogy of DaG 476 and calculation results showed that all models were theoretically possible. However, models (1) and (2) need complex processes to produce observed natures of DaG 476. Hence, model (3) seems the most plausible, although this model also leaves some open questions. The fragment-like texture of olivine and the results of cooling rate calculation suggest that the formation of the DaG shergottites occurred in a rapid cooling condition in any of the formation models (1 - 3).

The Cuma and Punta Marmolite trachyphonolitic lava domes are among the oldest Phlegrean products cropping out. The Cuma rocks have an agpaitic groundmass, with early alkali feldspar, Fe-rich clinopyroxene, Fe-edenite and sodalite and late rosenbuschite, fluorite, baddeleyite, pyrochlore, britholite, monazite, aegirine (often Zr-rich) and exceptionally Fe–Mn-rich olivine. The bulk-rock compositions at Cuma have some of the highest concentrations of Zn, Mn, Zr, Nb, Th, U and lanthanides among the Phlegrean Fields rocks, and some of the lowest MgO, P 2 O 5, Sr, Eu and Ba. The Punta Marmolite dome is chemically less evolved, and lacks characteristic agpaitic minerals, but features alkali feldspar, sodalite, nepheline and relatively Na-poor, Fe-rich hedenbergite, with rare Ca-rich plagioclase <b>xenocryst</b> cores. The Accademia dome, belonging to the recent activity, is latitic to trachytic in composition, has highly forsteritic olivine (with chromiferous spinel inclusions), calcic plagioclase and Mg-rich diopside (± phlogopite) xenocrysts in an evolved host rock (with phenocrysts and microlites of alkali feldspar, Fe-rich clinopyroxene, Fe-rich amphibole, magnetite, Fe-rich olivine and accessory baddeleyite, zirconolite and fluorite). There is clear evidence of open-system magma crystallization in the form of interaction between a crystallizing, primitive shoshonitic basalt in a reservoir already filled by rather evolved trachytic magma. The magmatic evolution towards the evolved compositions is dominated by crystallization of more and more Na-rich alkali feldspar in a Cl-, F-rich and relatively H 2 O-poor environment. Input of mafic magma is evident in many trachytic eruptions of the Phlegrean Fields and even in the products of the Campanian Ignimbrite, but eruptions having mineral assemblages rich in <b>xenocryst</b> phases as well as eruptions virtually free of mafic magma input are also frequently observed throughout the history.

40|$|International audienceChemical zoning in xenocrysts may be inherited, {{the result}} of magmatic growth, or {{diffusive}} ion exchange with the host magma. To quantify magma residence times of xenocrysts based on diffusion zoning patterns thus requires knowledge of the contribution of diffusion to the zoning patterns and knowledge of appropriate diffusion coefficients. Using olivine xenocrysts (Fo 75 - 79) from melting experiments run for ca. 1 day, at 1000 - 1150 °C, 200 MPa, fO 2 near NNO, and 1 - 5 wt% H 2 O, we characterize length-scales of growth versus Fe-Mg diffusion zoning, and suggest that hydrous diffusion coefficients for olivine need to be constrained to reliably model <b>xenocryst</b> residence times in magmatic systems. In the experiments, initially angular, unzoned olivine xenocrysts develop subhedral to euhedral crystal outlines, and continuous Fe-Mg core-rim zoning with rim thicknesses of ≤ 40 μm. The euhedral crystal outlines and thick rim zones indicate that the zoning patterns partly result from growth. However, abundant healed micro-fractures, originally present in the xenocrysts, extend into the compositional rim zones, and define minimum length scales for zoning as {{the result of}} diffusion. The maximum length scale of the diffusion zoning profiles are 9. 5 and 17. 5 μm in 1000 and 1150 °C experiments, and we suggest that these profiles represent diffusion close to [001]. Estimating the diffusion coefficient D as ~l 2 /t (l = diffusion length scale; t = time) gives log(D) of ca. - 14. 8 to - 14. 2 m 2 /s- 1 at 1000 and 1150 °C, apparently independent of the amount of H 2 O present. Using the same approximation to calculate D for olivine xenocrysts in an equivalent dry system (using data from [1]), indicate that diffusion in olivine xenocrysts in lowpressure hydrous systems is over ten times faster than in equivalent anhydrous systems. To reliably quantify magma residence times of xenocrysts based on diffusion zoning patterns thus requires (i) that hydrous diffusion coefficient are rigorously constrained and applied, unless it is evident that the xenocrysts were immersed in dry magmas; and (ii) that growth contributions to <b>xenocryst</b> zoning patterns are constrained (e. g., using markers as above, or comparing zoning patterns for multiple elements).

40|$|A genetic {{relationship}} between diamond and subcalcic Cr-pyrope garnet, both being {{produced by a}} metasomatic process, can be inferred from the sampling patterns of kimberlites in the Daldyn-Alakit province, Yakutia, Russia. Pressure-temperature estimates for xenoliths and xenocrysts show a strong concentration of highly depleted rocks in a well-defi ned zone 140 – 190 km deep; diamond inclusions and diamond-bearing xenoliths show that most diamonds come from harzburgites within this layer. <b>Xenocryst</b> distribution curves indicate that diamondiferous kimberlites have sampled both garnet and chromite from the harzburgitic layer, but low-grade pipes have sampled only chromite. Diamond formation probably {{is due to the}} oxidation of methane-rich, silica-bearing fluids: Fe₂O₃ (in chromite) + CH₄ → C + H₂O + FeO (in chromite), accompanied by another reaction: chromite ± olivine ± orthopyroxene + Si, Ca (in fluid) → low-Ca, high-Cr garnet. The presence or absence of diamond in kimberlites thus reflects the distribution of metasomatized fluid conduits in a lithospheric mantle that originally consisted of highly refractory harzburgites containing neither garnet nor diamond. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Peridotitic garnet <b>xenocrysts</b> {{from five}} {{kimberlite}} pipes in the Kaavi-Kuopio area of eastern Finland {{have been studied}} using major and trace element geochemistry to obtain information on the stratigraphy, compositional variability and evolutionary history of the underlyinglithospheric mantle. Ni thermometry on garnet <b>xenocrysts</b> gives 650 – 1350 °C and, when extrapolated to the geotherm determined using mantle xenoliths, indicates a sampling interval of c. 80 – 230 km. Three distinct mantle layers are recognized based on the xenolith/xenocryst record: (1) A shallow, 180 km, composed largely of fertile material. The chondrite-normalized REE profiles of subcalcic harzburgitic garnet <b>xenocrysts</b> originating from layer 2 bear evidence of an extensive ancient melt extraction event, similar to that observed in lithosphere underlying Archean cratons elsewhere. Memory of this eventhas possibly also been preserved in the REEN signatures of rare depleted garnets from layer 3 and in the CCGE pyropes from layer 1 despite their saturation in Ca. The lherzolitic and megacryst garnet varieties exhibit LREEN depletion relative to MREEN and HREEN, withthe steady enrichment from SmN to YbN typical of Ca-saturated mantle garnets. The enrichment of MREE and HREE probably derives from a metasomatic event caused by silicate melts close in composition to megacryst magma, which also imprinted a Ti-metasomatic overprint on many pyrope garnets. Harzburgitic and rare lherzolitic garnets, however, appear to have escaped this metasomatism...|$|R
40|$|Basalts {{associated}} with sapphire deposits are widespread in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. In Vietnam, blue, {{green and yellow}} sapphires are recovered from eluvial and alluvial placers hosted in basaltic fields of the Dak Lak Province. Two distinct basalt suites are recognized in this field: a tholeiitic suite without any <b>xenocrysts</b> and an alkaline suite with mantle and lower crustal <b>xenocrysts.</b> The sapphires are enriched in Fe (0. 43 to 1. 26 wt. %), with moderate contents of Cr (33 - 1582 ppm), Ti (35 - 1080 ppm), Ga (149 - 308 ppm) and V (28 - 438 ppm) and they are poor in Zn and Mg. Their O-isotope compositions range from 6. 0 to 6. 9 parts per thousand and are not in equilibrium with the alkali basalts which have delta(18) O values between 5. 0 and 5. 7 parts per thousand. The U-Pb dating of zircons recovered from the basaltic placers provides evidence of two eruptional events: one at similar to 6. 5 Ma followed by another one at similar to 1 Ma. The petrography of the basalts and the oxygen isotopic composition of the sapphires suggest that the sapphires are <b>xenocrysts</b> and that they crystallized in a deep magma chamber, at the lower continental lithosphere and the upper mantle boundary, in evolved melts issued from the fractionation of alkali basaltic magmas contaminated with lower crustal fluids...|$|R
