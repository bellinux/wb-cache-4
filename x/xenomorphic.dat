40|$|The kind, {{sedimentation}} rate, and diagenesis {{of organic}} particles {{delivered to the}} North Atlantic seafloor during the Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous {{were responsible for the}} presence of carbonaceous sediments in Hole 534 A. Organic-rich black clays formed from the rapid supply of organic matter; this organic matter was composed of either abundant, well-preserved, and poorly sorted particles of land plants deposited in clays and silty clays within terrigenous turbiditic sequences (tracheal facies) or abundant amorphous debris (<b>xenomorphic</b> facies) generated through the digestive tracts of marine zooplankton and sedimented as fecal pellets. Evidence for the fecal-pellet origin of <b>xenomorphic</b> debris is illustrated. Black clays were also produced in sediments containing less organic matter {{as a result of the}} black color of carbonized particles composing all or most of the residues (micrinitic facies). Slowly sedimented hematitic Aptian clays contain very little carbonized, organic debris that survived diagenetic oxidation. In the red calcareous clay sequence of the Late Jurassic, larger amounts of this oxidized debris turned several clay layers black or blackish red. Carbonized debris also dominates the residues recovered in interbedded black and green Albian clays. Carbonization of organic matter in these sediments either turned them black or provided the diagenetic environment for reduced iron. Carbonized debris is also appreciable in burrow-mottled black-green Kimmeridgian clay. The study of Hole 534 A organic matter indicates that during the middle Callovian there was a rapid supply of terrigenous organic matter, followed by a late Callovian episode of rapidly supplied <b>xenomorphic</b> debris deposited as fecal pellets.

Schreibersite occurs an idiomorphic and <b>xenomorphic</b> crystals and its mode of occurrence is variable in iron meteorites. <b>Xenomorphic</b> schreibersite is subdivided into 6 types {{on the basis}} of their textures and relationships with coexisting minerals.

Based on the Fe-Ni-P phase diagram, it is estimated that <b>xenomorphic</b> and coarse-grained schreibersite in Y- 75031 and in DRPA 78007 were crystallized from stability field of taenite and schreibersite at about 800 â under rapid diffusion conditions. Cooling rates within the parent bodies are calculated by using the diffusion rate of Ni between schreibersite and kamacite as follows; Canyon Diablo: 1. 1 Ã 10 ^ 6, Odessa: 1. 7 Ã 10 ^ 6, North Chile: 2. 3 Ã 10 ^ 6, ALH- 77263 : 8. 7 Ã 10 ^ 7 (year/â). It is considered that ALH- 77263 had been cooled keeping more equilibrated state with slower cooling rate than Canyon Diablo. Variable textures and chemical compositions of schreibersite suggest that it had been maintained a local equilibrium with kamacite. Estimated temperatures at which the reaction mostly completed among metals and sulfide tend to show higher value in unequilibrated iron meteorites than equilibrated ones.

40|$|The late Triassic is {{characterized}} by several pulses of biotic turnover, both regional and global, before the end-Rhaetian mass extinction. The development of a solid lithostratigraphic framework of the continental sandstones and mudstones at Petrified Forest National Park revealed that a faunal turnover took place within the Norian stage of the Chinle Formation. With an uncertainty of ~ 2. 3 meters from the interval of faunal turnover, the abundance of Pteridosperm and Palaeozoic Conifer pollen types decline. Overall diversity drops at this interval, whereas the alleged Mesozoic Conifer pollen species Klausipollenites gouldii becomes dominant, at some point comprising over 50 % of the assemblage. There is a short lived spike in spore taxa and some other pollen taxa. These taxa {{can be associated with}} an increased supply of moisture and/or a short decline in light intensity, as ferns are known to thrive under low light. Following the spike in spore taxa, K. gouldii stays dominant, but other taxa, which declined at the faunal turnover, increase in abundance again. The occurrence of <b>xenomorphic</b> structures in Klausipollenites gouldii can be interpreted as signals for environmental deterioration. There is a large increase in <b>xenomorphic</b> structures in K. gouldii at the same interval where the spore taxa occur and after both the <b>xenomorphic</b> structures and the post disaster taxa are on the decline again, the tetrahedral tetrad Froelichsporites traversei increases in abundance. The occurrence of the enigmatic spore taxa F. traversei could be indicative of continued drought or environmental stress. Measurements on Î´ 13 CTOC throughout the interval show large fluctuations through the entire section. Ideally this could be attributed to fluctuations in the moisture supply at the interval, although this also could be a local anomaly, or to fluctuations in the stable isotope values of atmospheric CO 2. However, it is a possibility that these fluctuations are the result of variable sediment types, as the total organic carbon percentage varies from 0. 01 % in claystone deposits, to 35 % in highly coalified plant beds. There are some signatures here of a short biotic perturbance, causing local or regional flora to change. The increased spore taxa suggest that moisture supply and/or light intensity played a role in this. The increase of <b>xenomorphic</b> structures and the disappearance and/or decline of multiple pollen taxa suggest that environmental circumstances deteriorated; this implies that changes in the moisture supply was not the only environmental component affected. It remains to be investigated what the cause of this turnover was, which occurs in a relatively short time span and if the turnover only occurs locally or in more sections throughout North America. There is a very rough correspondence between the dating of the Manicouagan impact in eastern Canada and the change occurring at Petrified Forest National Park.

Three palynofacies were distin-guished, based {{on the distribution of}} palynomorphs and palynodebris. The exinitic palynofacies is characterized by numerous specimens and species of sporomorphs to the almost total exclusion of dinoflagellate cysts and small acritarchs, and by structured palynodebris such as vascular plant cuticle and tracheids. It is con-sidered to have been emplaced during times of high rates of sedimen-tation of land plant materials contributed from actively prograding deltas. The micrinitic palynofacies is characterized by abundant amorphous palynodebris in the form of small, apparently carbonized, opaque or semi-opaque carbonaceous particles and a palynoflora composed of fewer specimens dominated by Classopollis, bisaccates, and dinoflagellates. It represents the much diminished sedimentation of terrigenous vegetal materials, and was deposited by marine cur-rents which concentrated those sporomorph types morphologically adapted for selective transportation. The <b>xenomorphic</b> palynofacies contains a palynoflora {{similar to that of the}} micrinitic fades, but is distinquished by an abundance of amorphous palynodebris com-posed of optically translucent particles which show safranin stain well. Palynomorphs may be rare or abundant in this facies. The close correspondence between the sporomorph abundance and organic carbon curves indicates that the organic carbon com-position of the more carbonaceous intervals of the investigated sec-tion is terrigenous and derived from land plants. The smaller carbonaceous content of the micrinitic facies may be the result of the much smaller contribution of land plant materials. The lack of a direct correspondence between the sporomorph assemblages and organic carbon composition in the <b>xenomorphic</b> facies suggests that factors other than, or additional to, the sedimentation of terrigenous plant materials were responsible for the carbonaceous composition of these sediments...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of structural, petrographic, mineralogical and chemical studies of dunite veinlets in spinel peridotite from the Kraka ophiolites. It is demonstrated that plastic deformation of polycrystalline olivine, which form dunite, was accompanied by precipitation of impurities (aluminum and chrome) as newly formed chrome spinels. The thinnest acicular inclusions of 0. 3 - 0. 5 micron thick are aligned in olivine grains along [010] axis. Bigger elongated irregular chrome spinel grains usually occur along grain and sub-grain olivine boundaries, and, occasionally, inside the grains along [100] axis. Alteration from the fine <b>xenomorphic</b> grains of chrome spinels to the bigger idiomorphic crystals was observed. Analogically to dynamic ageing (dispersion hardening) in metals, the structural and chemical alterations in dunites are interpreted as deformation induced segregation of impurities.

This process may be a key factor in the formation of ophiolitic chrome ore deposits...|$|E

The PâT path was obtained after a detailed study of the textural relationships and mineral assemblage succession in the aluminous granulites, and comparing these with an appropriate petrogenetic grid. Additional thermobarometry was also performed. The granulites are highly heterogeneous, with distinct compositional domains that may alternate even at thin-section scale.

40|$|The Palynology of two {{sections}} recovered during Leg 93 drilling by the Deep Sea Drilling Project {{in the continental}} rise along the western margin of the North Atlantic is reported. In Hole 603 B at Site 603, the dinoflagellate stratigraphy indicates that the interval from Cores 603 B- 82 to 603 B- 26 ranges in age from late Berriasian to Santonian. The BlakeBahama Formation ranges from late Berriasian to Aptian. The Hatteras Formation ranges from Aptian to Cenomanian, although the uppermost part may be Turonian. Dinoflagellate evidence from the middle part of the Plantagenet Formation indicates an age from late Coniacian or early Santonian to Santonian within the interval of Cores 603 B- 28 to 603 B- 26. Magnetic polarity evidence of the stratigraphy of the Early Cretaceous for the western North Atlantic indicates a reliable correlation with the dinoflagellate zonation. The stratigraphic sequence of palynologically defined organic facies in carbonaceous claystone lithologies in Hole 603 B shows that organic stratigraphic units consisting predominantly of fecal-pellet-derived, pelagic organic matter (<b>xenomorphic</b> facies) alternate with units consisting predominantly of terrigenous organic matter (tracheal and exinitic facies), corresponding to that described from other sites in the North Atlantic. A terrigenous organic facies is identified {{for the first time}} from the Plantagenet Formation. The claystone organic facies and major lithofacies are closely correlated. The tracheal and exinitic facies occur in carbonaceous terrigenous claystones and claystone turbidites associated with sandstone/siltstone terrigenous turbidites. The <b>xenomorphic</b> facies occurs in claystones within pelagic limestones lacking any turbidites, and in blackish, noncalcareous claystones which correlate in age with the marine-carbon-rich sapropels which are widespread in the North Atlantic Cenomanian. This facies also occurs with an admixture of terrigenous organic particles in the Blake-Bahama Formation, but the mixture is consistent with the submarine fan setting of this interval. The concentration of refractory organic matter (carbonized particles) in the micrinitic and carbonized tracheal facies is considered to be the result, at least in part, of the oxidation of sediment buried below a surface slowly accumulating pelagic clays below the carbonate compensation depth. The progressive increase in number of dinoflagellate species per stage through the Early Cretaceous (except for the late Barremian-Aptian) may have resulted indirectly from the generally progressive rise in global sea level during this time. At Site 605, the dinoflagellate stratigraphy across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary is remarkably close to that published from the Maestrichtian and Danian of Denmark. The Maestrichtian/Danian boundary is placed precisely within Section 605 - 66 - 1 by dinoflagellate evidence, agreeing with that predicted by other microfossils.

This, Zedd says, is akin to Nietzscheâs âbeyond good and evilâ and the formulation is also redolent of Steven Shaviroâs Bataillean-Deleuzian variety of film theory in The Cinematic Body (1993), which claims that, above all, film should be âpraised as a technology for intensifying and renewing experiences of passivity and abjectionâ.

Barthes proposed a sort of âtransgression of transgressionâ which would steer jouissance away from the violence of heroic countercultural avant-gardism. Jouissance is not simply to be aligned with the violence of an assault on culture, but rather with the space between avant-garde and mainstream. This, potentially, is the space of a âminoritarianâ (Deleuze and Guattari) anti-heroic cult cinema which sets out to cross-fertilize mainstream linearity with avant-garde techniques of estrangement...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{origin of}} {{carbonate}} ooze particles is often poorly understood. This {{is due to}} their polygenic origin and potential post-depositional alteration. Here, {{the outcome of a}} physical separation study with regard to different component classes of micritic carbonates is shown. The focus is on grain size and morphology, mineralogy and isotope signatures. Two contrasting proximal-to-distal transects were investigated: (1) the Miocene leeward margin of Great Bahama Bank (ODP Leg 166) and (2) the transition between the Maiella platform and the UmbriaâMarche basin in central Italy near the CenomanianâTuronian boundary. In both case settings, carbonate particles of biogenic origin include at least three groups of organisms: (i) planktonic foraminifera, (ii) calcareous nannofossils and (iii) fragments of unspecified neritic skeletal material. Two further particle types lack diagnostic structures, and based on particle size and mineralogy, are here referred to as (iv) macroparticles (5 â 20 Î¼m, mainly <b>xenomorphic)</b> and (v) microparticles (< 12 Î¼m, mainly automorphic to sub-automorphic). Macro- and microparticles represent 50 to 80 % of the carbonate phase in slope and toe-of-slope domains and share characteristic carbon and oxygen isotope signatures. Macro- and microparticles are considered shallow-water precipitation products subsequently exported into the slope and toe-of-slope domains. Macroparticles are probably related to the fragmentation of neritic skeletal components while microparticles point to inorganic and/or bioinduced precipitation in the water column. In some cases, macro- and microparticles may have an early diagenetic origin. The identification of the origin of fine-grained particles allows for a quantitative assessment of exported, in situ and diagenetic carbonate materials in periplatform environments. The data shown here represent an important step towards a more complete characterization of carbonate ooze and micrite...|$|E
40|$|Chloride-bearing clasts {{from the}} Udachnaya-East pipe kimberlites, Yakutia, Russia, contain {{abundant}} to accessory rasvumite, KFe 2 S 3, and djerfisherite, K 6 Na 0 - 1 (Fe,Ni,Cu) (24) S 26 Cl, {{which have been}} previously described in the groundmass of the host kimberlite. Rasvumite occurs in chloride-"nyerereite" and carbonate clasts, where it forms prismatic crystals (up to 5 mm) or is associated with djerfisherite in a rim around pyrrhotite. Djerfisherite is the omnipresent sulfide in all types of chloride-containing clasts, in which it rims pyrrhotite and forms individual <b>xenomorphic</b> to subhedral grains and, more rarely, octahedral crystals at the contact with host kimberlite. In chloride clasts and the host kimberlites, the following sequence of crystallization was found: pyrrhotite - rasvumite - djerfisherite, reflecting {{an increase in the}} activity of Cl in the evolved melt. The composition of rasvumite from the Udachnaya-East pipe is close to ideal KFe 2 S 3, with low abundances of Rb, Cs and Na (< 0. 9, < 0. 2 and < 0. 15 wt. %, respectively). Analyses of the rasvumite by the LA-ICP-MS technique indicates the presence of T 1 (95 - 480), Ba (110 - 215), Pb (25 - 190), Te (up to 60), Se (20 - 135) and Co (25 - 100 ppm). These data also indicate compositional differences between unaltered rasvumite and its oxidized rim; the levels of Na, Mg, V, Mn, Ni, As, Sr, Sb and W increase by an order of magnitude. Unlike djerfisherite in the kimberlite groundmass, that in the chloride clasts is generally characterized by higher amounts of Fe and lower amounts of Cu, with low contents of Rb (< 2000 ppm), Cs (< 100 ppm), and Tl (< 330 ppm).

40|$|The {{features}} of sandstones in productive horizons of the Permian bituminous deposits of Tatarstan (Russia) have been considered. The composition and internal structure of sandstones {{have been studied}} by optical microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and electron microscopy, as well as using a number of physical and chemical methods to solve special problems. The investigated sandstones belong to the greywacke group. The clastic material of sandstones contains grains of feldspar, quartz, mica, and particles of volcanic rocks. The nature and composition of cement are important parameters that determine the filtration-capacity properties of sedimentary rocks. Bituminous deposits are characterized by vertical zoning, which is expressed in the alternation of sites {{with varying degrees of}} cementation of rocks. Atten-tion has been also paid to post-sedimentation processes, such as pyritization and calcification. Pyrite forms rare <b>xenomorphic</b> isometric grains. The formation of pyrite occurs in diagenesis and is associated with the processes of biogenic sulfate reduction. The source of calcium for the crystallization of dispersed cal-cite in the porous space of sandstones is the underground waters of red-colored Ufimian deposits characterized by the alkaline properties favorable for calcium migration. According to the data of X-ray computed tomography, the internal space of the studied rocks is not homogeneous and represented by a system of communicated and isolated pores. In the studied samples, two types of organic matter differing in organic radicals have been detected. The first type is an organic substance of coal origin. The second type of organic matter belongs to the oil origin and refers to bitumens in its properties. The presence of a significant percentage of asphaltenes in the bitumen composition indicates the destruction of the oil substance in the near-surface conditions...|$|E
40|$|Observations of thin {{sections}} of rocks from a fresh and representative specimen of iron ore of skarn type under polarized light microscope, electron probing analyses and Raman analyses for minerals and melt inclusions were carried out. Melt inclusions in garnet have been found. Main characteristics of these inclusions are great disparities in varying sizes and distributions in groups and in zones, the largest melt inclusion {{is up to}} 98 mu m x 5 mu m, the smallest one is about 1 mu m x 1 mu rn, {{the majority of the}} melt inclusions are 5 similar to 30 mu m in length and 2 similar to 7 mu m in width. Some melt inclusions are scattered within garnet in isolation. They have variety in the shape and they total spindle, dumbbell, string of beads, lotus root, round-like and <b>xenomorphic</b> forms. Stadied skarn mainly consists of garnet with high component of andradite, magnetite, quartz, tremolite and pyroxene, apatite with directional and sporadic distributions, minor zircon and spheric. Melts trapped by melt inclusions in garnet originally consisted of Ca, Fe, Al and volatile components (H, O and CO 2) bearing silicate melt. During cooling process of the melt inclusions, hematite, andradite, quartz, calcite and diopside separated out from the silicate melt mentioned above due to slowly cooling, immiscibility of residual melts occurred, Ca and Si-bearing iron melt, Si and Fe-bearing carbonate melt, and Ca. Al, Fe-bearing silicate melt formed respectively. Raman analyses show that the melt inclusions in garnet contain garnet, hematite and calcite; only one melt inclusion contains water vapour. Magnetite mainly contains questionable melt inclusions with silica and iron of variable proportion. Fact {{that a large number of}} melt inclusions in the garnet from iron ore of skarn type within diopside-tremolite rock have been found is undoubted. The melt inclusions were observed for the first time in garnet in such type of iron ore, which may possibly invoke new ideas in regard to the genetic study on Shilu iron deposit and how to explore in situ ores from the old mines...|$|E
40|$|Crystal-rich lithic clasts {{occurring}} in volcanic deposits are key tools to understand processes of storage, cooling, and fractionation of magmas in pre-eruptive volcanic systems. These clasts represent snapshots of the magma-chamber-host-rock interface before eruption and {{provide information on}} crystallization, differentiation, and degrees of interaction between magma and wall-rock. In this study we {{have focused on the}} petrology of clasts of cumulate and skarn rocks from the Colli Albani Volcanic District with the aim of shedding light on magma-carbonate interaction and CO 2 emission in volcanic areas. By means of phase relations, bulk-rock chemistry, mineral compositions and isotope data we have identified different types of cumulates and skarns. Cumulates containing either clinopyroxene Â± olivine associated with Cr-bearing spinel or glass + phlogopite have been classed as primitive and differentiated, respectively. Cumulates originate at the interface between either a primitive or differentiated magma and carbonate-bearing wall-rock characterized by the occurrence of CaO-rich melt. Skarns have been classed as exoskarns, characterized by <b>xenomorphic</b> textures and abundant calcite, and endoskarns, characterized by a hypidiomorphic texture, Ca-Tschermak-rich mineral phases, and interstitial glass. Exoskarns formed by means of solid-state reactions in a dolomite-bearing protolith whereas endoskarns crystallized from a silicate melt that experienced exoskarn assimilation. Our study indicates that magma-carbonate interaction is a multi-step process that proceeds beyond the formation of skarn shells. Magma and carbonate rocks, when in contact, continuously interact leading to the formation of exoskarns, endoskarns, cumulates (primitive and differentiated types), and differentiated melts. The geochemical characteristics of the studied endoskarn and cumulate rocks indicate that crustal contamination of the Colli Albani magmas occurs through the simultaneous assimilation of both solid crustal material (dolomite and/or exoskarns) and partially molten crustal material (CaO-rich melt). The oxygen and carbon isotope compositions of calcite in equilibrium with the skarns suggest that dolostone-limestone assimilation and decarbonation are able to provide the massive CO 2 release observed in carbonate-hosted magmatic systems, such as Colli Albani.

40|$|Crystal-rich lithic clasts {{occurring}} in volcanic deposits are key tools to understand processes of storage, cooling, and fractionation of magmas in pre-eruptive volcanic systems. These clasts, indeed, represent snapshots of the magma-chamber/host-rock interface before eruptions and {{provide information on}} crystallization, differentiation, and degrees of interaction between magma and wall-rocks. In this study, with the aim {{to shed light on}} magma-carbonate interaction and CO 2 emission in volcanic areas, we focused on the petrology of cumulate and skarn rocks by using as case study a suite of mafic and calcite-bearing lithic clasts from the Colli Albani Volcanic District. By means of phase relations, bulk rock chemistry, phase compositions, and stable isotope data we have recognized different types of cumulates and skarns. Cumulates containing either clinopyroxeneÂ±olivine associated with Cr-bearing spinel or glass+phlogopite have been divided in primitive and differentiated, respectively. Primitive cumulates originate at the interface between a relatively primitive magma and carbonate-bearing rocks and show evidences of olivine instability (i. e. heteradcumulate texture) due to carbonate assimilation. Differentiated cumulates, characterized by Ca-rich olivines, phlogopite, and glass containing calcite, form from a differentiated magma in a system open to CaO-contamination. Skarns has been divided in exoskarns, characterized by <b>xenomorphic</b> texture and abundant calcite, and endoskarns, characterized by hypidiomorphic texture, Ca-Tschermak-rich mineral phases, and interstitial glass. Exoskarns formed by means of solid state reactions in a dolostone protolith whereas endoskarns crystallized at subliquidus temperature from a silicate melt that experienced exoskarns assimilation. Our study evidences that magma-carbonate interaction can not be considered a one step process exhausting just after the formation of skarn shells. Magma and carbonate rocks, when in contact, continuously interact leading to the formation of exoskarns, endoskarns, cumulates (primitive and differentiated ones), and differentiated melts. Finally, by means of oxygen and carbon isotope compositions of calcite in equilibrium with skarns, we demonstrate that carbonate assimilation represents a source of massive CO 2 degassing mechanism due to the consumption of calcite and removing of CO 2 during the decarbonation process...|$|E
40|$|This sedimentological {{study of}} the Godavari quarry is the first {{relating}} to the Palaeozoic Tethyan sedimentary rocks of the Katmandu nappe (Central Nepal). Sedimentological analyses led to the identification of six microfacies belonging to a large carbonate mud-mound complex, which {{can be divided into}} mound, flank and off-mound main depositional settings. Identification of two dasycladaceans (Dasyporella cf. silurica (Stolley, 1893) and Vermiporella sp.) in the mound facies gives a Mid-Late Ordovician age to this newly discovered Godavari carbonate mud-mound, which makes this mound one of the oldest ever described in the Asian continent. The mound microfacies are characterized by a high micritic content, the presence of stromatactis and the prevalence of red coloured sediments (the red pigmentation probably being related to organic precipitation of iron). The flank microfacies are characterized by a higher crinoid and argillaceous content and the presence of bio- and lithoclasts concentrated in argillaceous lenses. Finally, the off-mound microfacies show very few bioclasts and a high argillaceous content. Palaeoenvionmental interpretation of microfacies, in terms of bathymetry, leads us to infer that the Godavari mud-mound started to grow in a deep environment setting below the photic and wave action zones and that it evolved to occupy a location below the fair weather wave base. Cementation of cavities within the mound facies underlines a typical transition from a marine to a burial diagenetic environment characterized by: (1) a radiaxial non luminescent feroan calcite cement (marine) showing a bright orange luminescent band in its middle part; (2) a bright zoned orange fringe of automorphic feroan calcite (meteoric phreatic); (3) a dull orange <b>xenomorphic</b> feroan calcite cement in the centre of cavities (burial) and (4) a saddle dolomite within the centre of larger cavities. The faunal assemblage (diversity and relative proportion) of the Godavari mound facies is dominated by crinoids and ostracods, which makes this carbonate mud-mound comparable to the Meiklejohn Peak mounds (Nevada).

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{petrology}} and geochemistry of Northwest Africa (NWA) 4215, an unbrecciated diogenite recovered in the Sahara. This single stone, weighing 46. 4 g, displays a wellpreserved cumulative texture. It consists of zoned <b>xenomorphic</b> orthopyroxene grains {{on the order of}} 500 Î¼m in size, along with a few large chromite crystals (< 5 vol%, up to 3 mm). Accessory olivine and scarce diopside grains occur within the groundmass, usually around the chromite crystals. Minor phases are cristobalite, troilite, and metal. Unlike other diogenites, orthopyroxenes (En 76. 2 Wo 1. 1 Fs 22. 7 to En 68. 6 Wo 5. 5 Fs 25. 9), olivines (Fo 76 to Fo 71), and chromites (Mg# = 14. 3 44. 0, Cr# = 42. 2 â 86. 5) are chemically zoned. The minor element behavior in orthopyroxenes and the intricate chemical profiles obtained in chromites indicate that the zonings do not mirror the evolution of the parental melt. We suggest that they resulted from reaction of the crystals with intercumulus melt. In order to preserve the observed zoning profiles, NWA 4215 clearly cooled significantly faster than other diogenites. Indeed, the cooling rate determined from the diffusion of Cr in olivine abutting chromite is in the order of 10 â 50 Â°C/a, suggesting that NWA 4215 formed within a small, shallow intrusion. The bulk composition of NWA 4215 has been determined for major and trace elements. This meteorite is weathered and its fractures are filled with calcite, limonite, and gypsum, typical of hot desert alteration. In particular, the FeO, CaO abundances and most of the trace element concentrations (Sr, Ba, Pb, and REE among others) are high and indicate a significant contribution from the secondary minerals. To remove the terrestrial contribution, we have leached with HCl a subsample of the meteorite. The residue, made essentially of orthopyroxene and chromite, has similar major and trace element abundances to diogenites as shown by the shape of its REE pattern or by its high Al/Ga ratio. The connection of NWA 4215 with diogenites is confirmed by its O-isotopic composition (Î´ 17 O = 1. 431 Â± 0. 102 â°, Î´ 18 O = 3. 203 Â± 0. 205 â°, Î 17 O = â 0. 248 Â± 0. 005 â°) ...|$|E
