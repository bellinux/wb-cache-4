50|$|<b>Xenosauridae</b> is {{a family}} of anguimorph lizards whose only living {{representative}} is the genus Xenosaurus, which is native to Central America. <b>Xenosauridae</b> also includes the extinct genera Exostinus and Restes. Also known as knob-scaled lizards, they have rounded, bumpy scales and osteoderms. Most living species prefer moist or semi-aquatic habitats, although they are widespread within their native regions, with some even inhabiting semi-arid scrub environments. They are carnivorous or insectivorous, and give birth to live young.|$|E
5000|$|Carusioidea is a clade (evolutionary grouping) of lizards that {{includes}} the family <b>Xenosauridae</b> (knob-scaled lizards) from Central America and the extinct genus Carusia from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia. It was named in 1998 after a sister-group relationship was found between Carusia and <b>Xenosauridae.</b> Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Carusioidea is the most basal clade within Anguimorpha. Features that help define Carusioidea include closely spaced orbits or eye sockets separated by fused frontal bones, {{a connection between the}} jugal and squamosal bones below the supratemporal arch, and a covering of bony osteoderms over the skull roof. Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic relationships of carusioids from Gao and Norell (1998): ...|$|E

It is now placed in its own family: Shinisauridae.|$|E
5000|$|Femoral {{pores are}} present in all genera in the {{families}} Cordylidae, Crotaphytidae, Hoplocercidae, Iguanidae, Phrynosomatidae, and Xantusiidae. [...] They are absent in all genera in the Anguidae, Chamaeleonidae, Dibamidae, Helodermatidae, Scincidae, <b>Xenosauridae,</b> and Varanidae families. [...] They {{are present in}} other lizards and amphisbaenians quite variably, some geckoes, Phelsuma, for example have these pores, others {{in the same family}} do not.|$|E
50|$|Carusia is an extinct genus of lizard {{from the}} Late Cretaceous of Mongolia. It {{is a close}} {{relative}} of the family <b>Xenosauridae,</b> which includes living knob-scaled lizards. Fossils of the type and only species Carusia intermedia come from the late-Campanian age Barun Goyot Formation and {{have been found in}} the Flaming Cliffs, Ukhaa Tolgod, and Kheerman Tsav fossil localities. Carusia was first described in 1985 under the name Carolina intermedia, but since the name Carolina was preoccupied by a genus of scarab beetles that had been named in 1880, it was renamed Carusia intermedia. Carusia had initially been known from fragmentary skull material, complicating efforts to determine its evolutionary relationships with other lizards; it had variously been described as an indeterminate scincomorph, a xenosaurid, or some other type of autarchoglossan lizard convergent with xenosaurids. However, the discovery of 35 complete skulls in the 1990s, three of which were described in a detailed 1998 monograph, revealed that Carusia was the sister taxon (closest relative) of <b>Xenosauridae,</b> compelling the authors of the monograph to create a new clade called Carusioidea to include both taxa.|$|E
50|$|Although it lived {{during the}} Early Cretaceous, A 2005 {{study found that}} Dalinghosaurus was related to several modern-day lizards in the family <b>Xenosauridae,</b> the knob-scaled lizards. Its {{relatives}} include the modern Chinese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus) of southern China, the extinct Exostinus of Montana and Wyoming, and the extinct Carusia of Mongolia. It is differentiated from Carusia by having fewer, more conical shaped teeth. Differences in skull and mandible shape separate it from Shinisaurus.|$|E
50|$|Platynota {{was given}} a phylogenetic {{definition}} in 1997. It was erected as a stem-based clade that included Heloderma (the Gila monster and Beaded lizard), Lanthanotus (the Earless monitor lizard), and Varanus (monitor lizards), and all lizards that are {{more closely related to}} them than to other anguimorphs. These other anguimorphs were traditionally called Diploglossa, and include Anguidae, Anniellidae (American legless lizards), and <b>Xenosauridae</b> (knob-scaled lizards). A node-based definition was first given in 1998 in which Platynota included the last common ancestor of Monstersauria (helodermatids) and Varanidae (monitor lizards) and all of its descendants. Under this definition, Platynota includes the same forms as Varanoidea in its traditional sense. Varanoidea, however, has been redefined as a node-based clade including the extinct Telmasaurus and varanids.|$|E
50|$|Nordenosaurus is an extinct genus of crocodilian. When first {{named in}} 1973 the genus {{was thought to}} be a squamate and was {{assigned}} to the family <b>Xenosauridae.</b> A single frontal bone was found from the Norden Bridge locality of the lower Valentine Formation in Brown County, Nebraska, thought to date back to the late Miocene. The size of the bone was initially taken as evidence that it was a giant xenosaurid. The specific name of the type species, N. magnus, alludes to its extremely large size in comparison to other xenosaurids known at the time. In 1982, paleontologist Jacques Gauthier reinterpreted Nordenosaurus as a small crocodilian rather than a giant xenosaurid. The frontal bone is hour-glass shaped and covered in deep pits, unlike those of any lizard but similar to the frontals of most crocodilians.|$|E
50|$|Chometokadmon is an extinct genus of anguimorph lizard {{from the}} Early Cretaceous of Italy. The type and only species is Chometokadmon fitzingeri, named by Italian {{zoologist}} Oronzio Gabriele Costa in 1864. It is known from only one specimen, a nearly complete skeleton from the comune of Pietraroja in the Apennine Mountains. Costa identified the specimen as a lizard, but in 1915 paleontologist Geremia d'Erasmo reclassified the skeleton {{as that of}} a rhynchocephalian on the basis of another rhynchocephalian specimen Costa had described, which d'Erasmo thought belonged to the same species. Later studies of the anatomy of these two specimens revealed that they belonged to two different species; Costa's Chometokadmon was a lizard whereas the other specimen, renamed Derasmosaurus in honor of d'Erasmo, was a rhynchocephalian. The first detailed description of Chometokadmon came in 2006, allowing it to be incorporated into a phylogenetic analysis of lizards. The analysis placed Chometokadmon {{as a member of the}} clade (evolutionary grouping) Anguimorpha, which includes Anguidae, <b>Xenosauridae,</b> and Varanoidea.|$|E
50|$|Asia has a rich reptile fauna. Earless monitor lizards, snakes of the {{families}} Uropeltidae, Acrochordidae and Xenopeltidae and gavials are endemic to Asia. The crocodiles include mugger crocodile, gharial, false gharial and saltwater crocodile. The more common of the numerous snakes are pipe snakes (Melanophidium, Plectrurus, Rhinophis, Uropeltis), sea snakes, Elapids (king cobra, Bungarus, Calliophis, Naja, Walterinnesia), vipers (Azemiops, Daboia, Dendrelaphis, Echis, Hypnale, Protobothrops, Trimeresurus, Ovophis, Pseudocerastes, Gloydius etc.), colubrids (Achalinus, Amphiesma, Boiga, Calamaria, Cerberus, Coluber, Enhydris, Lycodon, Oligodon, Opisthotropis, Rhabdophis, Pareas, Psammophis, Ptyas, Sibynophis, Spalerosophis, Trachischium etc.) and blind snakes. The lizards include geckos (Agamura, Alsophylax, Asaccus, Calodactylodes, Cyrtodactylus, Chondrodactylus, Cnemaspis, Cyrtopodion, Dixonius, Gehyra, Gekko, Gonydactylus, Hemidactylus, Hemiphyllodactylus, Lepidodactylus, Luperosaurus, Perochirus, Pristurus, Teratolepis, etc.), <b>Xenosauridae</b> (Shinisaurus), monitor lizards, skinks. There are also about 100 species of turtles and tortoises (Russian tortoise, keeled box turtle, Batagur, Aspideretes, Chinemys, Chitra, Cistoclemmys, Cuora, Geochelone, Heosemys, Indotestudo, Mauremys, Ocadia, Pangshura, Pelochelys, Rafetus, Sacalia etc.).

5000|$|Gauthier {{is the son}} of Edward Paul Gauthier and Patricia Marie Grogan. He {{received}} a B.S. degree in Zoology at San Diego State University in 1973, a Master of Biological Science at the same institute in 1980, and a PhD in Paleontology from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1984. [...] Currently he is a Professor of Geology and Geophysics and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology and Vertebrate Zoology at Yale University. His master's thesis, the content of which was published in 1982, is a classic work on the paleontology and phylogeny of the lizard clade Anguimorpha that remains a core reference for morphological research on <b>Xenosauridae</b> and Anguidae in particular. His PhD thesis constituted the first major cladistic analysis of Diapsida, as well as arguing for the monophyly of the dinosaurs. He followed this with an important paper on the origin of birds from theropods. This was the first detailed cladistic analysis of the theropod dinosaurs, and initiated a revolution in dinosaur phylogenetics, in which cladistics replaced the Linnaean system in the classification and phylogenetic understanding of the dinosaurs.|$|E
40|$|Strike-induced chemosensory searching (SICS) {{was found}} in two {{families}} of lizards (Teiidae, Anguidae) but not in two other lizard families (Scincidae, Iguanidae). Experiments on another family (<b>Xenosauridae)</b> were inconclusive as to its possession of SICS. The rate of tongue-flicking was significantly increased after a simulated prey strike compared to controls in Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and Barisia imbricata. SICS {{may be part of}} a complex foraging strategy evolved in certain reptiles rather than part of a generalized chemosensory behavior because two species of skinks did not exhibit SICS in spite of a well developed vomeronasal olfactory apparatus and known abilities to use chemosensation extensively in sexual and individual recognition behaviors. Additional studies in other saurian families are needed to further understand the relationship between SICS and other chemosensory behaviors...|$|E
40|$|New {{specimens}} of lizards {{collected by the}} Mongolian Academy of Sciences-American Mu-seum of Natural History Expeditions from the Gobi Desert include a large sample of superbly preserved cranial material of Carusia intermedia. Study of these specimens resolves problematic as-pects of the cranial morphology and phylogenetic relationships of this poorly known lizard taxon. Analyses of 105 morphological characters across 30 selected ingroup and three outgroup taxa yield a phylogeny. This result refutes a previously sug-gested?Scincomorphan relationship of Carusia, instead supporting placement of this taxon in the Anguimorpha. A new lizard clade including the basal Carusia and the crown group <b>Xenosauridae</b> is recognized. This clade occupies the basalmost position within the Anguimorpha. Recognition of this taxon as a basal anguimorphan resolves the Xenosauridae/Anguidae/Varanoidea polytomy. Relationships of platynotan taxa known from the Gobi Desert are also discussed and problems with these taxa are addressed...|$|E
40|$|Lizards in {{the genus}} Xenosaurus (<b>Xenosauridae)</b> show a {{flattened}} morphology, which is presumably an adaptation for their crevice-dwelling habits. Despite their general morphological similarities (Ballinger et al., 2000 a), {{there is considerable}} variation among species and populations in ecological traits, and even populations of nominally the same species (e. g., X. grandis grandis and X. g. agrenon; Ballinger et al., 1995; Lemos-Espinal et al., 2003 a) show variation, sometimes as much as between different species. Populations of Xenosaurus are often geographically isolated (e. g., Pérez Ramos et al., 2000; Nieto Montes de Oca, 2001), and movement appears to be minimal (Lemos-Espinal et al., in press), and thus each population may be relatively isolated genetically and subject to local adaptation. Unfortunately, {{there are very few}} studied populations of Xenosaurus and in only one species has more than one population been studied (X. grandis; Ballinger et al., 1995; Lemos-Espinal et al., 2003 a). In order to further our understanding of variation within this genus, we report on the ecology of a distinct population of X. platyceps from Querétaro. This is the second population of X. platyceps for which we have ecological data (see Lemos-Espinal et al., 1997 b for a population of X. platyceps from Tamaulipas). These two populations are separated by 280 km. Both populations are found in oak forest, although the Querétaro population is in denser forest than the Tamaulipas population. In addition, the area in which the Querétaro population lives is rockier and on a greater slope than the Tamaulipas population...|$|E
