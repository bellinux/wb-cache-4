25|$|A common {{photonic}} crystal nanocavity design shown {{is essentially a}} {{photonic crystal}} with an intentional defect (holes missing). This structure having periodic changes in refractive index {{on the order of}} the length of the optical wavelength satisfies Bragg reflection conditions in the y and z directions for a particular wavelength range, and the slab boundaries in the <b>x</b> <b>direction</b> create another reflective boundary due to oblique reflection at dielectric boundaries. This results in theoretically perfect wave confinement in the y and z directions along the axis of a lattice row, and good confinement along the <b>x</b> <b>direction.</b> Since this confinement effect along the y and z directions (directions of the crystal lattice) is only for a range of frequencies, it has been referred to as a photonic bandgap, since there is a discrete set of photon energies which cannot propagate in the lattice directions in the material. However, because of the diffraction of waves propagating inside this structure, radiation energy does escape the cavity within the photonic crystal slab plane. The lattice spacing can be tuned to produce optimal boundary conditions of the standing wave inside the cavity to produce minimal loss and highest Q.|$|E
25|$|Alternative proofs exist – for example, Fermat {{computed}} {{the area}} via an algebraic trick of dividing the domain into certain intervals of unequal length; alternatively, one can prove this by recognizing a symmetry of the graph y=x'n under inhomogeneous dilation (by d in the <b>x</b> <b>direction</b> and d'n in the y direction, algebraicizing the n {{dimensions of the}} y direction), or deriving the formula for all integer values by expanding the result for n=1 and comparing coefficients.|$|E

Quasi-static compressive tests {{were performed on}} seven types of HEXCEL aluminium honeycombs with different cell size and wall thickness. The deformed layers produced 'X’ shaped bands in honeycomb samples when crushed in the <b>X</b> 1 <b>direction,</b> while the deformed layers were almost perpendicular to the loading direction when crushed in the <b>X</b> 2 <b>direction.</b> The plateau stresses in the <b>X</b> 1 <b>direction</b> agree well with Lu and Yu’s theory, while the plateau stresses in the <b>X</b> 2 <b>direction</b> agree well with Gibson and Ashby’s theory. Finite element analysis (FEA) was also conducted by using ABAQUS/STANDARD on four types of the honeycombs and a comparison was made between quasi-static experimental and FEA results. Dynamic tests on six types of aluminium honeycombs were conducted by using a gas gun and a fixture. Impact velocities varied from 5 m/s to 14 m/s. The 'X' deformation mode was observed in honeycombs when crushed in the <b>X</b> 1 <b>direction</b> at these relatively low velocities. On the other hand, the deformed layers were developed parallel to the impact plate when honeycombs were crushed in the <b>X</b> 2 <b>direction.</b> The dynamic plateau stresses were compared with the static tests {{as well as our}} previous FEA results...|$|R
25|$|Birefringence is {{utilized}} in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used with optical microscopes {{is a pair}} of crossed polarizing filters. Light from the source is polarized in the <b>X</b> <b>direction</b> after passing through the first polarizer, but above the specimen is a polarizer (a so-called analyzer) oriented in the Y direction. Therefore, no light from the source will be accepted by the analyzer, and the field will appear dark. However areas of the sample possessing birefringence will generally couple some of the X-polarized light into the Y polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the dark background. Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate between positive and negative birefringence.|$|E

500|$|The {{reason for}} this is that a quantum disjunction, unlike the case for {{classical}} disjunction, can be true even when both of the disjuncts are false and this is, in turn, attributable to the fact that it is frequently the case, in quantum mechanics, that a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate, while each of its members are necessarily indeterminate. This latter property can be illustrated by a simple example. Suppose we are dealing with particles (such as electrons) of semi-integral spin (spin angular momentum) for which there are only two possible values: positive or negative. Then, a principle of indetermination establishes that the spin, relative to two different directions (e.g., x and y) results in a pair of incompatible quantities. Suppose that the state ɸ of a certain electron verifies the proposition [...] "the spin of the electron in the <b>x</b> <b>direction</b> is positive." [...] By the principle of indeterminacy, the value of the spin in the direction y will be completely indeterminate for ɸ. Hence, ɸ can verify neither the proposition [...] "the spin in the direction of y is positive" [...] nor ...|$|E
