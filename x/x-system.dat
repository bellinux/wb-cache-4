40|$|Electron {{microscope}} {{studies of}} relay {{cells in the}} lateral geniculate nucleus of the CAT {{have shown that the}} retinal input of X-cells is associated with a special synaptic circuitry, termed the spine-triad complex. The retinal afferents make an asymmetrical synapse with both a dendritic appendage of the X-cell and a geniculate interneuron. The interneuron contacts in turn the same dendritic appendage with a symmetrical synaptic profile. The retinal input to geniculate Y-cells is predominately found on dendritic shafts without any triadic arrangement. We explore the integrative properties of X- and Y-cells resulting from this striking dichotomy in synaptic architecture. The basis of our analysis is the solution of the cable equation for a branched dendritic tree with a known somatic input resistance. Under the assumption that the geniculate interneuron mediates a shunting inhibition, activation of the interneuron reduces very efficiently the excitatory post-synaptic potential induced by the retinal afferent without affecting the electrical activity {{in the rest of the}} cell. Therefore, the spine-triad circuit implements the analogy of an AND-NOT gate, unique to the <b>X-system.</b> Functionally, this corresponds to a presynaptic, feed-forward type of inhibition of the optic tract terminal. Since Y-cells lack this structure, inhibition acts globally, reducing the general electrical activity of the cell. We propose that geniculate interneurons gate the flow of visual information into the <b>X-system</b> as a function of the behavioral state of the animal, enhancing the center-surround antagonism and possibly mediating reciprocal lateral inhibition, eye-movement related suppression and selective visual attention...|$|E

This thesis develops a prototypic integer programming model {{to aid in}} solving the Naval Postgraduate School academic course scheduling problem. The simplified model schedules faculty members to teach their assigned courses in specific rooms at specific times and schedules groups of students to the courses they have requested. The model assures, as best possible, that room capacity is no exceeded, students and faculty have time for lunch and faculty requesting 'back-to-back' courses are accommodated. To make the problem manageable, we concentrate on just one building, Glasgow Hall, and three departments, Operations Research, Mathematics and National Security Affairs. Even doing this, the model generated in GAMS (Generalized Algebraic Modeling System) has about 287, 778 variables and 148, 161 constraints and is too large to solve.

40|$|Abstract. It {{is pointed}} out that the Trojan-Horse method is a {{suitable}} tool to investigate subthreshold resonances. TRANSFER REACTIONS AND TROJAN HORSE METHOD A similarity between cross sections for two-body and closely related three-body reactions under certain kinematical conditions [1] led to the introduction of the Trojan-Horse method [2, 3, 4]. In this indirect approach a two-body reaction A+x → C+ c (1) that is relevant to nuclear astrophysics is replaced by a reaction A+a → C+ c+b (2) with three particles in the final state. One assumes that the Trojan horse a is composed predominantly of clusters x and b, i. e. a = (x + b). This reaction can be considered as a special case of a transfer reaction to the continuum. It is studied experimentally under quasi-free scattering conditions, i. e. when the momentum transfer to the spectator b is small. The method was primarily applied to the extraction of the low-energy cross section of reaction (1) that is relevant for astrophysics. However, the method can also be applied to the study of single-particle states in exotic nuclei around the particle threshold. The basic assumptions of the Trojan Horse Method are discussed in detail in [4], see also [5]. It is the purpose of this contribution to study the transition from the bound (EAx 0) region. We study the case where there is an open channel c+C ̸ = A+x at the EAx = 0 threshold. We show that there is a continuous transition. If there is a subthreshold resonance in the B = A + <b>x-system</b> it can be experimentally studied in the A+(b+x) → C+ c+b reaction. cross section [arb. units...|$|E

The basis of our analysis is the solution of the passive cable equation in a HRP-stained and reconstructed geniculate X-cell with known somatic input resistance. Recent evidence shows that geniculate interneurons stain for glutamic acid decarboxylase, the synthesizing enzyme for the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA). Under the assumption that the GABAergic inhibition has a reversal potential close to the resting potential of the cell, activation of the interneuron reduces very efficiently the excitatory postsynaptic potential induced by the retinal afferent without affecting the electrical activity {{in the rest of the}} cell. Therefore, the spine [...] triad circuit implements the analogue version of an AND [...] NOT gate. Functionally, this corresponds to a presynaptic, feed-forward type of inhibition of the optic tract terminal although inhibition actually occurs at a postsynaptic site.
