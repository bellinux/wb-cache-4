60|$|The {{swordfish}} {{has been}} so long and so well known that its right to its peculiar name has seldom been infringed upon. The various species of Tetrapturus have sometimes shared its title, {{and this is not}} to be wondered at, since they closely resemble <b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius,</b> and the appellative has frequently been applied to the family Xiphiidæ--the swordfish--which includes them all.|$|E
60|$|This {{species has}} been {{particularly}} fortunate in escaping the numerous redescriptions to which almost all widely distributed forms have been subjected. By the writers of antiquity it was spoken of under its Aristotelian name, and in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturæ, at the very inception of binomial nomenclative, Linnaeus called it <b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius.</b> By this name it has been known ever since, and only one additional name is included in its synonym, Xiphias rondeletic of Leach.|$|E
60|$|The swordfish, <b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius,</b> ranges {{along the}} Atlantic coast of America from Jamaica (latitude 18° N.), Cuba, and the Bermudas, to Cape Breton (latitude 47° N.). It {{has not been}} seen at Greenland, Iceland, or Spitzbergen, but occurs, {{according}} to Collett, at the North Cape (latitude 71°). It is abundant along the coasts of western Europe, entering the Baltic and the Mediterranean. I can find no record of the species on the west coast of Africa south of Cape Verde, though Lutken, who may have access to facts unknown to me, states that they occur clear down to the Cape of Good Hope, South Atlantic in mid-ocean, to the west coast of South America and to southern California (latitude 34°), New Zealand, and in the Indian Ocean off Mauritius.|$|E

50|$|Stomias boa boa is a {{predator}} and mainly feeds on fish. It is itself preyed {{on by the}} deepwater hakes Merluccius paradoxus and Merluccius capensis, the blackmouth catshark Galeus melastomus and the swordfish <b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius.</b>|$|E
50|$|Teuthowenia megalops are preyed upon by {{predatory fish}} like the blue shark (Prionace glauca) and {{swordfish}} (<b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius).</b> They also constitute {{a major part}} of the diet of cetaceans like the long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melaena), bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), and Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris).|$|E
50|$|As expected, teleosts (bony fish) are not {{repelled}} by the electropositive metal’s cation liberation in seawater. This is because teleosts lack the ampullae of Lorenzini. Teleost response was confirmed using captive Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). In July 2008 swordfish (<b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius)</b> catch was reported on experimental hooks treated with electropositive metal.|$|E
50|$|Tuna and {{tuna-like fishes}} are highly migratory, and stocks cross {{numerous}} international boundaries. ICCAT {{is involved in}} management of 30 species, including the Atlantic bluefin (Thunnus thynnus thynnus), yellowfin (T. albacares), albacore (T. alalunga) and bigeye tuna (T. obesus); from the billfishes, swordfish (<b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius),</b> white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), sailfish (Istiophorus albicans); mackerels such as spotted Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) and king mackerel (S. cavalla); and, small tunas like skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis).|$|E
50|$|Bony fish, Marlins, sea birds, sharks, and rays prey on {{the little}} tunny. Other tunas, {{including}} conspecifics and yellowfin tuna (Thynnus albacares) are predators of the little tunny. Fish such as the dolphin fish (Coryphaena hippurus), wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), Atlantic sailfish (Istiophorus albicans), swordfish (<b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius),</b> and various sharks {{as well as other}} large marine carnivores all prey {{on the little}} tunny. Among those sharks is the whale shark, who feeds on the little tunny's recently spawned eggs. Seabirds prey on small little tunny.|$|E
5000|$|The 12 {{species of}} true {{billfish}} {{are divided into}} two families and five genera. One family, Xiphiidae, contains only one species, the swordfish <b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius,</b> and the other family, Istiophoridae contains 11 species in four genera, including marlin, spearfish, and sailfish. Controversy exists about whether the Indo-Pacific blue marlin, Makaira mazara, is the same species as the Atlantic blue marlin, M. nigricans. FishBase follows Nakamura (1985) in recognizing M. mazara as a distinct species, [...] "chiefly because of differences {{in the pattern of}} the lateral line system".|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} found in the mesopelagic zone of the ocean at depths down to 1600 metres. Spawning takes place on the bottom and the paralarvae live at even greater depths, down to 3000 metres. Adults often live in groups at depths of 200 to 300 metres, often in areas where shrimps are found. Predators that feed on this squid include {{dolphins}} (Grampus griseus), the velvet belly lantern shark (Etmopterus spinax), the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus), the small-spotted catshark, (Scyliorhinus canicula), the swordfish (<b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius)</b> and tuna (Thunnus alalunga).|$|E
50|$|Big game {{fishing is}} an {{activity}} {{practiced in the}} Azores essentially during the summer, aboard vessels properly equipped {{for this type of}} fishing with pole-and-line. The target species are the large pelagic fish such as Blue Marlin (Makaira nigricans), swordfish (<b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius)</b> and various tuna. Usually after the fight given by the fish, they are subsequently released, unless they constitute potential records. The occurrence of these species {{in the vicinity of the}} Condor Bank has been considered a preferred location for this type of fishing, since the 80's, when it became more popular in the Azores.|$|E
50|$|Swordfish (<b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius),</b> {{also known}} as broadbills in some countries, are large, highly migratory, predatory fish {{characterized}} by a long, flat bill. They are a popular sport fish of the billfish category, though elusive. Swordfish are elongated, round-bodied, and lose all teeth and scales by adulthood. These fish are found widely in tropical and temperate parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and can typically be found from near the surface {{to a depth of}} 550 m. They commonly reach 3 m in length, and the maximum reported is 4.55 m in length and 650 kg in weight.|$|E
50|$|The Strait of Messina is an {{important}} migratory route of the Mediterranean Sea. The best known and important, from an economic point of view, are the great pelagic fish - that is the Tuna (Thunnus thynnus), the Albacore (Thunnus alalunga), the Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda), the Mediterranean Spearfish (Tetrapturus belone) and the Swordfish (<b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius).</b> The fish of the Strait are captured with boats called feluche or small engine powered fishing boats called passerelle. These pelagic fish are assets unique {{to this part of}} the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, only in the Strait, using various techniques, it is possible to capture Tuna throughout the year and in all age classes (from juveniles to adults) as the population moves between the Tyrrhenian and the Ionian Seas. The Strait of Messina is also an established route for the migration of Cetacea, and it is probably the most important in the Mediterranean Sea in terms of whale species diversity. Worthy of note, besides the several species of Dolphins are the Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and particularly the Sperm Whales which migrate to the Strait to their breeding area, probably the Aeolian Islands. Sharks also migrate through the Strait of Messina, including the Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (Hexanchus griseus).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{swordfish}} (<b>Xiphias</b> <b>gladius)</b> is {{a cosmopolitan}} large pelagic fish inhabiting tempered and tropical waters {{and it is}} a target species for fisheries all around the world. The present study investigated the ability of COI barcoding to reliably identify swordfish and particularly specific stocks of this commercially important species. METHODOLOGY: We applied the classical DNA barcoding technology, upon a 682 bp segment of COI, and compared swordfish sequences from different geographical sources (Atlantic, Indian Oceans and Mediterranean Sea). The sequences of the 5 ' hyper-variable fragment of the control region (5 'dloop), were also used to validate the efficacy of COI as a stock-specific marker. CASE REPORT: This information was successfully applied to the discrimination of unknown samples from the market, detecting in some cases mislabeled seafood products. CONCLUSIONS: The NJ distance-based phenogram (K 2 P model) obtained with COI sequences allowed us to correlate the swordfish haplotypes to the different geographical stocks. Similar results were obtained with 5 'dloop.
