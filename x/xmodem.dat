25|$|Transfer {{protocol}} (<b>XMODEM)</b> - {{the protocols}} {{to be used}} for transferring files containing FidoNet mail between systems.|$|E
25|$|As {{is it was}} prohibitively {{expensive}} for the hobbyist SysOp to have a dedicated connection to another system, FidoNet was developed as a store and forward network. Private email (Netmail), public message boards (Echomail) and eventually even file attachments on a FidoNet-capable BBS would be bundled into one or more archive files over a set time interval. These archive files were then compressed with ARC or ZIP and forwarded to (or polled by) another nearby node or hub via a dialup <b>Xmodem</b> session. Messages would be relayed around various FidoNet hubs until they were eventually delivered to their destination. The hierarchy of FidoNet BBS nodes, hubs, and zones was maintained in a routing table called a Nodelist. Some larger BBSes or regional FidoNet hubs would make several transfers per day, some even to multiple nodes or hubs, and as such, transfers usually occurred at night or early morning when toll rates were lowest. In Fido's heyday, sending a Netmail message to a user on a distant FidoNet node, or participating in an Echomail discussion could take days, especially if any FidoNet nodes or hubs in the message's route only made one transfer call per day.|$|E
2500|$|CP/M {{software}} {{often came}} with installers that adapted it {{to a wide}} variety of computers. Most forms of copy protection were ineffective on the operating system, and the source code for BASIC programs was easily accessible. The lack of standardized graphics support limited video games, but various character and text-based games were ported, such as Telengard, Gorillas (video game), Hamurabi, Lunar Lander, along with early interactive fiction including the Zork series and Colossal Cave Adventure. A text adventure specialist, Infocom was one of the few publishers to consistently release their games in CP/M format. Lifeboat Associates started collecting and distributing user-written [...] "free" [...] software. One of the first was <b>XMODEM,</b> which allowed reliable file transfers via modem and phone line. The last significant program native to CP/M was the outline processor KAMAS.|$|E
50|$|NMODEM is a file {{transfer}} protocol developed by L.B. Neal in 1990. NMODEM is essentially a version of XMODEM-CRC using larger 2048 byte blocks, as opposed to <b>XMODEM's</b> 128 byte blocks. NMODEM was implemented as a separate program, written in Turbo Pascal 5.0 for the IBM PC compatible family of computers. The block size was chosen to match the common cluster size of the MS-DOS FAT file system on contemporary hard drives, making buffering data for writing simpler.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} new {{versions}} of <b>XMODEM</b> were introduced {{in order to address}} these problems. Like earlier extensions, these versions tended to be backward-compatible with the original <b>XMODEM,</b> and like those extensions, this led to a further fracturing of the <b>XMODEM</b> landscape in the user's terminal emulator. In the end, dozens of versions of <b>XMODEM</b> would emerge.|$|E
5000|$|To {{avoid the}} delay, the sender and {{receiver}} would generally list XMODEM-CRC separately from <b>XMODEM,</b> allowing {{the user to}} select [...] "basic" [...] <b>XMODEM</b> if the sender didn't explicitly list it. Ironically, any software that did support -CRC in their basic <b>XMODEM</b> transfer, as it was intended, surreptitiously suggested the user should not attempt to use -CRC. To the average user, XMODEM-CRC was essentially a [...] "second protocol", and treated as such.|$|E
5000|$|WXmodem, {{short for}} [...] "Windowed Xmodem", is {{a variant of}} the <b>Xmodem</b> file {{transfer}} protocol developed by Peter Boswell optimized for high-latency data links. It supports block sizes of up to 512 bytes. <b>Xmodem</b> uses stop and wait protocol while WXmodem uses sliding window protocol.|$|E
5000|$|File transfer: ASCII, Kermit, <b>XMODEM,</b> YMODEM/YMODEM-G, and ZMODEMj ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} YMODEM {{was essentially}} the same as <b>XMODEM</b> except that it sent the file's name, size, and timestamp in a regular <b>XMODEM</b> block, [...] "block 0", before actually transferring the file. Sending the file size solved XMODEM's problem of superfluous padding {{at the end of the}} file.|$|E
5000|$|SEAlink was {{designed}} to be completely backward compatible with existing <b>XMODEM</b> implementations. On the receiver side, all that was required was that the receiver send back the packet number (contained in all <b>XMODEM</b> packets) along with the normal ACK or NAK character. On reception of the very first ACK or NAK, the SEAlink sender would [...] "notice" [...] the packet number and continue to use windows. If the packet number was missing, it was assumed it was sending to a non-SEAlink <b>XMODEM,</b> and set the window size to one.|$|E
5000|$|<b>XMODEM</b> became {{extremely}} {{popular in the}} early bulletin board system (BBS) market, largely {{because it was so}} simple to implement. It was also fairly inefficient, and as modem speeds increased this problem {{led to the development of}} a number of modified versions of <b>XMODEM</b> to improve performance or address other problems with the protocol. Christensen believed his original <b>XMODEM</b> to be [...] "the single most modified program in computing history". Chuck Forsberg collected a number of modifications into his YMODEM protocol, but poor implementation led to a further fracturing before they were re-unified by his later ZMODEM protocol.|$|E

5000|$|<b>XMODEM</b> is {{a simple}} file {{transfer}} protocol developed as a quick hack by Ward Christensen for use in his 1977 MODEM.ASM terminal program. It allowed users to transmit files between their computers when both sides used MODEM. Keith Petersen made a minor update to always turn on [...] "quiet mode", and called the result <b>XMODEM.</b>|$|E
5000|$|TeLink avoided MODEM7's {{problems}} by standardizing a new [...] "zero packet" [...] containing {{information about the}} original file. This included the file's name, size, and timestamp, which were placed in a regular 128 byte <b>XMODEM</b> block. Whereas a normal <b>XMODEM</b> transfer would start with the sender sending [...] "block 1", the TeLink header packet was labeled [...] "block 0".|$|E
5000|$|Many authors {{introduced}} extensions to <b>XMODEM</b> {{to address}} these and other problems. Many asked for these extensions to be included {{as part of a}} new <b>XMODEM</b> standard. However, Ward Christensen refused to do this, as it was precisely the lack of these features, and the associated coding needed to support them, that led to XMODEM's widespread use. As he explained: ...|$|E

50|$|BLAST (BLocked ASynchronous Transmission), like <b>XMODEM,</b> is a {{communications}} protocol designed for file transfer over asynchronous communication ports and dial-up modems that achieved {{a significant degree}} of popularity during the 1980s. Reflecting {{its status as a}} de facto standard for such transfers, BLAST, along with <b>XMODEM,</b> was briefly under official consideration by ANSI in the mid-80s as part of that organization's ultimately futile attempt to establish a single de jure standard.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} {{contemporary}} protocols, PTP is slower than YMODEM and ZMODEM but {{faster and more}} reliable than <b>XMODEM.</b>|$|E
5000|$|SEAlink is a file {{transfer}} protocol that is backward compatible with <b>XMODEM</b> but features a sliding window system for improved throughput. SEAlink was written in 1986 {{as a part of}} the SEAdog FidoNet mailer written by System Enhancement Associates, creators of the famous ARC program. It was licensed with a simple [...] "give credit" [...] requirement, but nevertheless was not very widely used except in FidoNet mailers. SEAlink, and most other <b>XMODEM</b> enhancements, were quickly displaced following the introduction of ZMODEM.|$|E
5000|$|On the downside, BLAST {{was criticized}} by <b>XMODEM</b> {{developer}} Chuck Forsberg {{because of its}} proprietary nature, making it [...] "tightly bound to the fortunes of supplier".|$|E
50|$|The Commodore 1650 shipped with a {{rudimentary}} piece of terminal software called Common Sense. It provided basic <b>Xmodem</b> functionality and contained a 700 line scrollback feature.|$|E
5000|$|Communication: USB port (using the Kermit or <b>XModem</b> protocols), IrDA (infrared), 4-pin {{asynchronous}} {{serial port}} (not RS-232 voltage levels) using a serial cable with a 4-pin mini-USB connector.|$|E
50|$|A {{backwards}} compatible extensions of <b>XMODEM</b> with 32k and 64k block lengths {{was created by}} Adontec for better performance on high-speed error free connections like ISDN or TCP/IP networks.|$|E
50|$|The program interoperates {{well with}} both Commodore and non-Commodore {{terminal}} programs; it supports ASCII, ANSI, and PETSCII output in 40 or 80 columns. Punter and <b>XMODEM</b> protocols {{are used for}} file transfers.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>XMODEM</b> was robust {{enough for}} a {{journalist}} in 1982 to transmit stories from Pakistan to the United States with an Osborne 1 and acoustic coupler over poor-quality telephone lines, the protocol had several flaws.|$|E
50|$|In Non-Stream mode (which {{can be set}} by the {{receiver}} or the sender), Zmax is a super Batch <b>Xmodem</b> or Ymodem depending on the block size, because it uses 32 bit CRCs instead of 16.|$|E
50|$|MODEM7 {{sent the}} {{filename}} as normal text, which meant {{it could be}} corrupted by the same problems that <b>XMODEM</b> was attempting to avoid. This led {{to the introduction of}} TeLink by Tom Jennings, author of the original FidoNet mailers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>XMODEM,</b> {{like most}} file {{transfer}} protocols, breaks up the original data {{into a series}} of [...] "packets" [...] that are sent to the receiver, along with additional information allowing the receiver to determine whether that packet was correctly received.|$|E
50|$|File {{transfer}} protocols usually {{operate on}} top of a lower-level protocol in a protocol stack. For example, the HTTP protocol operates at the topmost application layer of the TCP/IP stack, whereas <b>XMODEM,</b> YMODEM, and ZMODEM typically operate across RS-232 serial connections.|$|E
50|$|JMODEM is a file {{transfer}} protocol developed by Richard Johnson in 1988. It {{is similar to the}} seminal <b>XMODEM</b> in most ways, but uses a variable-size packet in order to make better use of the available bandwidth on high-speed modems.|$|E
5000|$|SEAlink also {{included}} a number of features included in other <b>XMODEM</b> derivatives. Notable {{was the use of}} a [...] "zero packet", which was introduced in the FidoNet-related TeLink protocol in order to send file information and support batch file transfers.|$|E
5000|$|Supported {{connectivity}} {{options are}} Telnet, rlogin, SSH, [...] "Raw" [...] sockets, standard modem connections and direct serial connections (using parts of SEXPOTS), and a pty interface on *nix. File transfer options include the ZMODEM, <b>XMODEM</b> and YMODEM transfer protocols (using parts of SEXYZ.) ...|$|E
50|$|YMODEM-1K uses a {{block size}} of one {{kilobyte}} {{instead of the}} standard 128 bytes. 1K blocks were an option in the original YMODEM standard, but this variant is missing {{the rest of the}} features, and is best described as a 1k variant of <b>XMODEM.</b>|$|E
