50|$|In {{the absence}} of {{suitable}} plate culture techniques, some microbes require culture within live animals.

Another useful identification method is <b>Xenodiagnosis,</b> {{or the use of}} a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent. Chagas disease is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis. In this case, <b>xenodiagnosis</b> involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi, an uninfected triatomine bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected.

40|$|In {{order to}} upgrade the {{reliability}} of <b>xenodiagnosis,</b> attention has been directed towards population dynamics of the parasite, with particular interest for the following factors: 1. Parasite density which by itself is not a research objective, but by giving an accurate portrayal of parasite development and multiplication, has been incorporated in screening of bugs for <b>xenodiagnosis.</b> 2. On the assumption that food availability might increase parasite density, bugs from <b>xenodiagnosis</b> have been refed at biweekly intervals on chicken blood. 3. Infectivity rates and positives harbouring large parasite yields were based on gut infections, in which the parasite population comprised of all developmental forms was more abundant and easier to detect than in fecal infections, thus minimizing the probability of recording false negatives. 4. Since parasite density, low in the first 15 days of infection, increases rapidly in the following 30 days, the interval of 45 days has been adopted for routine examination of bugs from <b>xenodiagnosis.</b> By following the enumerated measures, all aiming to reduce false negative cases, we are getting closer to a reliable xenodiagnostic procedure. Upgrading the efficacy of <b>xenodiagnosis</b> is also dependent on the xenodiagnostic agent. Of 9 investigated vector species, Panstrongylus megistus deserves top priority as a xenodiagnostic agent. Its extraordinary capability to support fast development and vigorous multiplication of the few parasites, ingested from the host with chronic Chagas' disease, has been revealed by the strikingly close infectivity rates of 91. 2 % vs. 96. 4 % among bugs engorged from the same host in the chronic and acute phase of the disease respectively (Table V), the latter comporting an estimated number of 12. 3 x 10 [raised {{to the power of}} 3] parasites in the circulation at the time of <b>xenodiagnosis,</b> as reported previously by the authors (1982) ...|$|E

40|$|In Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT) endemic areas, {{there are}} a number of {{subjects}} that are positive to serological tests but in whom trypanosomes are difficult to detect with the available parasitological tests. In most cases and particularly in West Africa, these subjects remain untreated, thus posing a fundamental problem both at the individual level (because of a possible lethal evolution of the disease) and at the epidemiological level (since they are potential reservoirs of trypanosomes). <b>Xenodiagnosis</b> may constitute an alternative for this type of cases. The objective of this study was to update the use of <b>xenodiagnosis</b> to detect trypanosomes in infected host characterized by low parasitaemia levels.

40|$|We {{performed}} a comparatÍve study bebween <b>xenodiagnosis</b> and serological tests for Chagasfdisease. 150 Patients from several endemic areas were studied. Four of them {{appeared to have}} a peculiar status with positive <b>xenodiagnosis</b> and negative serclogy carr'ied out with four classical techniques (Immunofluores-cence test, ELrsA: Enzyme Linked rmmunosorbent Assay, complement fixation test and Imrnunoelectrophoresis). One serum out of the four patients presenting humoral depression showed a high quantity of circulating antigen proved by immunoelectrophoresis. The Authors suggest the use of one serological test for detecting circulating antigens of Trypanosoma cruzi in ad. dition to the classical serology. rt would allow the diagnosis of chagas ' disease in patients v¡ith low production of specific antibodies. UDC 593. 161. 13 616. 937. 3. Chronic stage of Chagas, disease is cha-racterized by a high production of specific anti-bodies 'whioh alloLws an easv diagnosis (CA-MARGO & TAKEDAS). During this stage, se-veral serolqgical tests are available for detect-ing circulating antibodies, i. e. : complement fixa-tion test, immunofluorescence test, Enayrne Lin-ked Immunosorbent Assay (GUERREIRO & MA,CHADOe, LELCHITK et alt 2. VOLLER, et a 1. 21). Antibodies are present during all the infectÍon and even after treatment (BARCLAY et aI. 3, COURA et al. 7). <b>Xenodiagnosis</b> test allows a pa,rasitological confirmation of the in-lection, but it is of low sensitivity compared with the serological diagnosis.

40|$|A micro double {{diffusion}} test (MD), allowing {{the identification of}} precipitation brand 5 by identity reaction, using a rabbit specific anti-component 5 serum, was evaluated for the immunological diagnosis of Chagas' disease. The previous studies on the Trypanosoma cruzi specificity of component 5 [g] were completed, showing it to be absent in Leishmania brazilienis, but present in different strains of T. cruzi. 200 sera from Bolivian patients were studied. (88 with a positive <b>xenodiagnosis,</b> 45 with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis but without Chagas' disease, and 67 controls). Band 5 was found in 74 (84. 1 %) of the sera with positive <b>xenodiagnosis</b> but was never found either in the leishmaniasis or in the control groups. MD, allowing an easy detection of T. cruzi specific band 5, cheap and simple to perform, can be recommended in association with other serological tests, when highly specific immunodiagnosis of Chagas' disease is required.
