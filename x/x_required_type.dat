40|$|Combinatorics is {{a branch}} of {{mathematics}} that generally deals with a finite or at most countably infinite set and collections of its subsets. These collections must then satisfy certain criteria depending on the class of objects and the problem being considered. The most fundamental problem in combinatorics {{is the problem of}} existence: Does a combinatorial structure that satisfies the given requirements exist? In general, it is straightforward to verify that a proposed structure satisfies the required criteria, but finding a structure of the <b>required</b> <b>type</b> is difficult. If a structure of the <b>required</b> <b>type</b> exists, any method that constructs one is sufficient to settle the existence question. Two problems closely related to the existence problem are the enumeration problem—how many different combinatorial structures of the <b>required</b> <b>type</b> exist—and the optimization problem—which combinatorial structure of the <b>required</b> <b>type</b> is the best, judged by some criterion.
