Simple generalized Langevin simulations, using <b>equilibrium</b> <b>xenon</b> {{as a model}} solvent, fail to reproduce molecular dynamics vibrational relaxation data.

40|$|We used a novel, overdamped {{oscillator}} {{aboard the}} Space Shuttle {{to measure the}} viscosity eta of xenon near its critical density rho(sub c), and temperature T(sub c). In microgravity, useful data were obtained within 0. 1 mK of T(sub c), corresponding to a reduced temperature t = (T -T(sub c)) /T(sub c) = 3 x 10 (exp - 7). The data extend two decades closer to T(sub c) than the best ground measurements, and they directly reveal the expected power-law behavior eta proportional to t(sup -(nu) z(sub eta)). Here nu is the correlation length exponent, and our result for the small viscosity exponent is z(sub eta) = 0. 0690 +/- 0. 0006. (All uncertainties are one standard uncertainty.) Our value for z(sub eta) depends only weakly on {{the form of the}} viscosity crossover function, and it agrees with the value 0. 067 +/- 0. 002 obtained from a recent two-loop perturbation expansion. The measurements spanned the frequency range 2 Hz {{less than or equal to}} f less than or equal to 12 Hz and revealed viscoelasticity when t less than or equal to 10 (exp - 1), further from T(sub c) than predicted. The viscoelasticity scales as Af(tau), where tau is the fluctuation-decay time. The fitted value of the viscoelastic time-scale parameter A is 2. 0 +/- 0. 3 times the result of a one-loop perturbation calculation. Near T(sub c), the xenon's calculated time constant for thermal diffusion exceeded days. Nevertheless, the viscosity results were independent of the xenon's temperature history, indicating that the density was kept near rho(sub c), by judicious choices of the temperature vs. time program.

40|$|In this report, 129 Xe nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy of xenon gas adsorbed in coal is used to describe some poorly understood features of coal microporous structure, particularly in establishing that a connected network exists, the type of connectivity, and its changes with the rank of coal. Micropore size scale and distribution are also considered. Two methods are developed which are new and versatile tools for the investigation of porous structure. Both utilize xenon gas that is in motion, while undergoing diffusion or exchange in coal, to describe the connectivity of the micropore structure of coal. Time tracking of the adsorption process by NMR, selective saturation, and saturation transfer techniques were used to obtain new information on the coal rank dependence of porous structure. In addition, an existing 129 Xe chemical shift-pore diameter model was used to calculate micropore diameters for coals, {{as well as for}} a microporous carbon, before and after pore-size alteration. In the initial study performed, straightforward 129 Xe NMR spectra at <b>equilibrium</b> <b>xenon</b> adsorption at a series of pressures were acquired for a rank-varied set of six coals. Acquisition of the NMR signal as an echo was tested and found to improve spectral quality. The spectra were used to calculate micropore diameters for the six coals. These range from 5. 6 to 7. 5 � and exhibit a minimum value for the intermediate coal rank. The smallest pores occur in coals of about 82 - 85 % carbon; at both lower and higher coal ranks, the average micropore size tends to be larger. The changes in the spectra with coal rank and surface area were explored. Signal linewidths were found to decrease with increasing coal rank and were interpreted in terms of increasing chemical or physical homogeneity of the coal as rank increases. The packing density of powdered coal was found to alter the spectral appearance in a high volatile bituminous coal, which is preliminary evidence that exchange affects the chemical shift of xenon in this coal...|$|R

Simulated turbine trip transients and several control rod withdrawal transients were analyzed with good results. Sensitivity studies indicated that the time-step size can affect transient results significantly. TITAN was also applied to a quarter core PWR problem based on a real reactor geometry. The steady-state results were compared to a solution produced by MEKIN-B and poor agreement between the horizontal power shapes was found. Calculations with various mesh spacings showed that the mesh spacings in the MEKIN-B analysis were too large to produce accurate results with a finite difference method. The TITAN results were shown to be reasonable. A pair of control rod ejection accidents were also analyzed with TITAN. The computing time requirements for these analyses were less than 1 hour c. p. u. time on a large mainframe computer. This is reasonable for a severe transient in a large reactor. A comparison of the TITAN PWR control rod ejection results with results from coupled point kinetics/thermal-hydraulics analyses showed that the point kinetics method used (adiabatic method for contol rod reactivities, steady-state flux shape for core-averaged reactivity feedback) underpredicted the power excursion in one case and overpredicted it in the other. It was therefore concluded that point kinetics methods should be used with caution and that three-dimensional codes like TITAN are superior for analyzing PWR control rod ejection transients...|$|R
40|$|Spatial burnout {{calculations}} {{have been}} made of two types of water moderated cylindrical reactor using boron as a burnable poison to increase reactor life. Specific reactors studied were {{a version of the}} Submarine Advanced Reactor (sAR) and a supercritical water reactor (SCW). Burnout characteristics such as reactivity excursion, neutron-flux and heat-generation distributions, and uranium and boron distributions have been determined for core lives corresponding to a burnup of approximately 7 kilograms of fully enriched uranium. All reactivity calculations have been based on the actual nonuniform distribution of absorbers existing during intervals of core life. Spatial burnout of uranium and boron and spatial build-up of fission products and <b>equilibrium</b> <b>xenon</b> have been- considered. Calculations were performed on the NACA nuclear reactor simulator using two-group diff'usion theory. The following reactor burnout characteristics have been demonstrated: 1. A significantly lower excursion in reactivity during core life may be obtained by nonuniform rather than uniform startup distribution of uranium. Results for SCW with uranium distributed to provide constant radial heat generation and a core life corresponding to a uranium burnup of 7 kilograms indicated a maximum excursion in reactivity of 2. 5 percent. This compared to a maximum excursion of 4. 2 percent obtained for the same core life when w'anium was uniformly distributed at startup. Boron was incorporated uniformly in these cores at startup. 2. It is possible to approach constant radial heat generation during the life of a cylindrical core by means of startup nonuniform radial and axial distributions of uranium and boron. Results for SCW with nonuniform radial distribution of uranium to provide constant radial heat generation at startup and with boron for longevity indicate relatively small departures from the initially constant radial heat generation distribution during core life. Results for SAR with a sinusoidal distribution rather than uniform axial distributions of boron indicate significant improvements in axial heat generation distribution during the greater part of core life. 3. Uranium investments for cylindrical reactors with nonuniform radial uranium distributions which provide constant radial heat generation per unit core volume are somewhat higher than for reactors with uniform uranium concentration at startup. On the other hand, uranium investments for reactors with axial boron distributions which approach constant axial heat generation are somewhat smaller than for reactors with uniform boron distributions at startup...|$|R
40|$|The {{safe and}} {{economic}} operation {{of nuclear power}} plants (NPPs) requires that the behaviour and performance of the fuel can be calculated reliably over its expected lifetime. This requires highly developed codes that treat the nuclear fuel in a general manner and which {{take into account the}} large number of influences on fuel behaviour, e. g. thermal, mechanical, chemical, etc. Although many mature fuel performance codes are in active use, there are still significant incentives to improve their predictive capability. One particular aspect is related to the strong trend of NPP operators to try and extend discharge burnups beyond current licensing limits. With increasing burnup, more and more fission events impact the material characteristics of the fuel, as well as the cladding, and significant restructuring can be observed in the fuel. At local burnups in excess of 60 - 75 MWd/kgU, the microstructure of nuclear fuel pellets differs markedly from the as fabricated structure. This "high burnup structure" (HBS) is characterised by three principal features: (1) low matrix xenon concentration, (2) sub-micron grains and (3) a high volume fraction of micrometer sized pores. The peculiar features of the HBS have resulted in a significant effort to understand the consequences for fuel performance and safety. In particular there is the concern that the large retention of fission gas within the HBS could lead to significant gas release at high burnups, either through the degradation of thermal conductivity or through direct release. While for the normal fuel microstructure numerous models, investigations and codes exist, only a few models for simulating ssion gas behaviour in the HBS have been developed. Consequently, in this context, {{it is fair to say}} that reliable mechanistic models are largely missing today. In line with this situation the present doctoral work has focussed on the development and evaluation of HBS fission gas transport models, with a view to improve upon the current gap in fuel performance modelling. In particular two features of the HBS have been focussed on, viz. the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>xenon</b> concentration in the matrix of the HBS in UO 2 fuel pellets, and the growth of the HBS porosity and its effect on fission gas release. In a first step a steady state fission gas model has been developed to examine the importance of grain boundary diffusion for the gas dynamics in the HBS. With this model it was possible to simulate the ≈ 0. 2 wt% experimentally observed xenon concentration under certain conditions, viz. fast grain boundary di usion and a reduced grain di usion coeficient. A sensitivity study has been conducted for the principal parameters of the model and it has been shown that the value of the grain boundary diffusion coeficient is not important for diffusion coeficient ratios in excess of ~ 104. Within this grain boundary diffusion saturation regime the model exhibits a high sensitivity to principally three other parameters: the grain diffusion coeficient, the bubble number density and the re-solution rate coeficient. In spite of such sensitivity it has been shown that the model can reproduce the observed HBS xenon depletion with the assumption that grain boundary diffusion of fission gas is significantly faster than lattice diffusion. In particular the results from this study have demonstrated that the release of produced gas from the grains to the HBS porosity corresponds to a dynamic equilibrium, providing a justification for the typical modelling approach used in HBS modelling, viz. fast transport to the porosity, which from a fuel performance modelling point of view largely simplifies the calculations. In a second step, a model describing the evolution of the HBS porosity under annealing conditions has been developed. The model was applied to a high burnup fuel annealing experiment to assess its predictions against measurements. Reasonable agreement was found with respect to the experimental release in the temperature range where the release mechanism was originally interpreted to be due to volume diffusion of the gaseous fission products. In contrast to the original analysis, the developed model interprets the release mechanism as being due to pore growth, coalescence and, ultimately, venting. The model results for annealing conditions have been compared with available PIE data and this comparison has indicated that, for burnups examined to date, most of the fission gas is expected to be retained within the HBS porosity. The model of porosity growth and venting developed for annealing conditions has then been extended to take into account the effect of irradiation on the defect population and accumulation of fission gas in the HBS porosity. The power history of a high burnup fuel rod from a Swiss NPP was used to model the local behaviour of the HBS and good agreement was found between the calculation of porosity growth and results from open literature. A comparison between the calculated local gas release was found to be consistent with both the observations from the annealing calculations and measurements performed on the same fuel rod using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). To provide a more comprehensive analysis of the model predictions, a gas release correlation for calculating the release due to pore venting has been developed from the stand-alone in-pile modelling of porosity growth and this was implemented into the fuel performance code TRANSURANUS. The examined high burnup rod was modelled using the thus extended TRANSURANUS code so that the integral behaviour (rather than just the local HBS behaviour) could be calculated. The subsequent fuel performance analysis has revealed that venting from the HBS has a small effect on the integral fission gas release with the release increasing towards the pellet periphery. The principal effect of the HBS for the considered high-burnup irradiation is the presence of the high porosity, which increases the fuel centre temperatures and therefore the fission gas release from the centre of the rod. For the base case analysis 22 % of the integral fission gas was found to be released. However, this is less than the quantity measured by rod puncturing. To address this discrepancy several sensitivity studies have been performed to investigate as to where the additional fission gas release originates, specifically the fuel centre and/or the HBS zones in the pellet periphery. It has been shown from this sensitivity analysis that extra release from just one of these regions is unlikely to account for the discrepancy between measured and calculated fission gas release. It is more likely that the uncertainties for each of the individual regions, when considered together, could account for the observed integral release. In particular the presence of an athermal gas release from within the HBS has been explored in detail and it has been shown that, while significant release could occur, there is still significant retention. Previous examinations of fuel behaviour have assumed little to no release in the HBS; however it is clear from this work that at burnups as high as considered currently, the gas release does have a signi cant component coming from the pellet periphery...|$|R
