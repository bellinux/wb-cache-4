40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For CT scan planning, scan {{projection}} radiographs (SPR) are used. Tube {{tension and}} current for head SPR {{can be reduced}} to a minimum because of the small head diameter and because only high-contrast structures need to be visualized for planning. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate SPR of the head in respect to effective doses, the influence of dose-reduction measures, and comparison with conventional <b>x-ray.</b> <b>MATERIALS</b> AND METHODS: Entrance doses for default and minimal settings were measured on a LightSpeed Ultra CT scanner and on conventional x-ray equipment. Effective doses for different scanning fields of the head were calculated for an adult, a 10 -year-old child, and a neonate by using the commercially available software PCXMC. RESULTS: Depending on projection and technique, SPR effective doses for adults were 1. 9 – 27. 7 Sv; for the 10 -year-old child, 2. 1 – 31. 1 Sv; and for the neonate, 5. 2 – 97. 2 Sv. Doses with the tube under the table were 1. 3 – 3. 4 times lower. Doses for conventional radiography were higher than SPR doses for adults and partially lower for children. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the scanning technique, effective doses for head SPR can differ up to 17 -fold.

40|$|Introduction: Total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) is a {{very common}} procedure and its application is growing, due to better equipment and techniques, {{a broader range of}} ages and the rising prevalence of osteoarthritis of the hip. This makes it even more important to optimize the survival time of the new hip. The position of the cup {{plays a key role in}} the survival of the new hip. A safe zone is known, in which de cup must be placed to minimize this risk of dislocation. This safe zone comprises an inclination angle of 40 ± 10 º and an anteversion angle of 15 ± 10 º. Computer assisted surgery (CAS) has been developed to aid the operator in placing the cup with more accuracy. Nowadays, the position of the cup is postoperatively being measured on a conventional X-ray. Measuring the position of the cup on a conventional X-ray has, however, been determined unreliable. A new method has recently come available to analyze the position of the cup, called the EOS. This is an x-ray machine with which an anterior-posterior (AP) and a lateral x-ray can be made simultaneously. With the sterEOS software, these images can be used to make a three-dimensional reconstruction of the hip and the inclination and anteversion can be calculated. The reproducibility of this method has not yet been determined. Goal: The first goal is to determine the reproducibility of analyzing de position of the cup with EOS after a THA. De second goal is to determine with EOS if the cup can be placed more accurately with CAS. Finally, the inclination measured on the EOS AP-X-ray will be compared with the inclination measured on the conventional <b>X-ray</b> <b>Materials</b> and method: In this study 23 patients with 27 total hips were included. Five of these patients had been operated with computer navigation. A conventional X-ray and an EOS X-ray were taken of all patients. Subsequently, 3 observers measured the inclination and anteversion of the hips with the EOS software, with respect to the anterior pelvic plane (APP) en with respect to the patient plane (PP). One observer also measured the inclination on the EOS AP-X-ray’s and the conventional AP-X-ray’s. Results: The relative and absolute reliability was excellent for the intraobserver reliability with ICC’s ranging from 0, 96 to 0, 98. The interobserver reliability had also an excellent relative and absolute reliability, with ICC’s ranging from 0, 90 to 0, 98. Striking was that the range for measuring the anteversion with respect to the APP was very broad. De mean anteversion was significantly different between the control group and de CAS group. De anteversion of the CAS group was less accurate than the anteversion of the control group. No difference however was found between the control and CAS group for the total amount of outliers. There was a significant difference between the inclination measured on the EOS AP-X-ray’s and the inclination measured on the conventional AP-X-ray’s. There was also a significant difference between the inclination measured on the EOS AP-X-ray’s compared to the inclination measured with the sterEOS software (two-dimensional versus three-dimensional) Conclusion: The reproducibility for determining the positioning of the cup after a THA with EOS is excellent. No conclusion could be made about the use of computer navigation or the measurement of the inclination on de EOS AP-X-ray’s due to the small research population. ...|$|E
40|$|UNLABELLED: Vertebral {{fractures}} {{are common}} but usually remain unrecognized in primary care. Data from 2908 women and 2653 {{men in the}} EPOS study were used to derive algorithms to indicate {{the need for a}} spine X-ray to identify a fracture using easily elicited determinants. At a sensitivity of 50 % for identifying cases, the specificity was increased from 50 % to 78 % in women and from 50 % to 72 % in men compared with a random allocation of X-rays. Use of X-rays can be optimized by selecting patients at high risk using a short screening procedure. INTRODUCTION: Previous osteoporotic fracture is an independent risk factor for further fractures and an indication for treatment. Vertebral fractures are the most common osteoporotic fractures before age 75, accounting for 48 % of all fractures in men and 39 % in women over 50. They usually remain unrecognized, so many patients requiring treatment are denied it, doubling their risk of a further fracture. Our objective was to develop an efficient algorithm indicating the need for an <b>X-ray.</b> <b>MATERIALS</b> AND METHODS: Data from 2908 women and 2653 men >or= 50 years of age in the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study (EPOS) were analyzed. Lateral thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs were taken at baseline and at an average of 3. 8 years later. Prevalent fractures were qualitatively diagnosed by an experienced radiologist. Fracture risk was modeled as a function of age, statural height loss since age 25, gender, and fracture history including limb fractures in the last 3 years using negative binomial regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to summarize a model's predictive ability, and a prediction algorithm was devised to identify those most likely to have a fracture. RESULTS: In a multivariate model for women, the risk of prevalent vertebral fracture significantly increased with age (RR, 1. 67 [95 % CI, 1. 46, 1. 93] per decade), statural height loss (1. 06, [1. 03, 1. 10] per centimeter decrease), self-reported history of spine fracture (7. 52 [5. 52, 10. 23]), and history of other major fracture (1. 83 [1. 46, 2. 28]). Higher body weight reduced risk (0. 86 [0. 79, 0. 95] per 10 -kg increase). In men, the respective RR estimates were as follows: age (1. 32 [1. 18, 1. 49]); height loss (1. 06 [1. 04, 1. 09]); self-reported spine fracture (5. 05 [3. 69, 6. 90]); other major fracture (1. 42 [1. 12, 1. 81]); and weight (0. 86 [0. 79, 0. 94]). Using algorithms based on these easily elicited determinants, specificity was increased from 50 % to 78 % in women and from 50 % to 72 % in men at a sensitivity of 50 % compared with a random allocation of X-rays. At a sensitivity of 75 %, the specificity was 50 % in women and 40 % in men. Inclusion of hip BMD (femoral neck or trochanter), measured in 1360 women and 1046 men, significantly improved the area under the ROC curves by 4 % in women (p 0. 350). Spine BMD, measured in 982 women and 847 men, produced a significant 5 % AUC improvement in women (p = 0. 007) but not in men (p = 0. 554). CONCLUSION: A woman 65 years of age with one vertebral fracture has a one in four chance of another fracture over 5 years, which can be reduced to one in eight by treatment. Positive treatment decisions are often contingent on identifying a vertebral fracture. Selective use of lateral vertebral X-rays can be optimized using a 2 -minute screening procedure administered by a nurse...|$|E

40|$|The Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) {{instrument}} onboard the Mars Curiosity rover has detected abundant amounts (approx. 25 - 30 weight percentage) of <b>X-ray</b> amorphous <b>materials</b> in a windblown deposit (Rocknest) {{and in a}} sedimentary mudstone (Cumberland and John Klein) in Gale crater, Mars. On Earth, X-ray amorphous {{components are}} common in soils and sediments, but usually not as abundant as detected in Gale crater. One hypothesis for the abundant <b>X-ray</b> amorphous <b>materials</b> on Mars is limited interaction of liquid water with surface materials, kinetically inhibiting maturation to more crystalline phases. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the chemistry and mineralogy of soils formed in the Antarctica Dry Valleys, one of the driest locations on Earth. Two soils were characterized from different elevations, including a low elevation, coastal, subxerous soil in Taylor Valley and a high elevation, ultraxerous soil in University Valley. A variety of techniques were used to characterize materials from each soil horizon, including Rietveld analysis of X-ray diffraction data. For Taylor Valley soil, the X-ray amorphous component ranged from about 4 weight percentage in the upper horizon to as high as 15 weight percentage in the lowest horizon just above the permafrost layer. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the presence of short-range ordered (SRO) smectite was the most likely candidate for the <b>X-ray</b> amorphous <b>materials</b> in the Taylor Valley soils. The SRO smectite is likely an aqueous alteration product of mica inherited from granitic materials during glaciation of Taylor Valley. The drier University Valley soils had lower X-ray amorphous contents of about 5 weight percentage in the lowest horizon. The <b>X-ray</b> amorphous <b>materials</b> in University Valley are attributed to nanoparticles of TiO 2 and possibly amorphous SiO 2. The high abundance of <b>X-ray</b> amorphous <b>materials</b> in Taylor Valley is surprising for one of the driest places on Earth. These materials may have been physically and chemical altered during soil formation, however, the limited interaction with water and low temperatures may result in the formation of "immature" X-ray amorphous or SRO materials. Perhaps, a similar process contributes to the formation of the high content of <b>X-ray</b> amorphous <b>materials</b> detected on Mars...|$|R
