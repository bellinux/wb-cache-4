40|$|In this work, {{a new and}} {{improved}} SFM is presented. This SFM can measure many variables such as the individual dynamic and active temperature regulation of the sample and the cantilever, miscellaneous friction modes, <b>x-,</b> <b>y-,</b> <b>z-</b> linearization and an increased scan speed, simultaneous with high spatial resolution. The scan width is also laterally extended to 1 millimetre by 1 millimetre. This extension of the lateral scan range requires a larger tilt compensation. Therefore, the z-scanner has a range of more than 300 µm. Summary In this thesis, a novel scanning force microscope was presented. Other than the large scan range of approximately 1000 µm by 1000 µm, the thermal guidance of the cantilever and sample is the most labour-intensive component of the microscope. Detailed construction of the cantilever holder and sample holder, light beam guidance for the normal and lateral forces, the positioning and scan unit, and ECU, control software and communication software have been discussed. The entire microscope was constructed as symmetrically as possible using mechanical construction to avoid thermal drift. For thermal measurements and thermally assisted friction measurements, a concept for separately heating the cantilever holder and the sample holder was discussed. A simulation on the cantilever holder showed that a temperature difference of 150 °K could be reached after 40 s and that the cool down cycle took only 38 s, without any disturbance of the nearest piezo. The same analysis was performed for the sample holder. Only the junction temperature for unknown samples and the temperature behaviour of these samples was calculated. After 15 s of heating, the junction reached 150 °K above the ambient temperature. The thermal path to the next piezo element is more critical than the one for the cantilever holder setup, therefore, the thermal management is more complex. However, the analysis has shown a maximum rise of 32 K above the ambient temperature at the piezo element for the heating and cooling scenario described above. For the beam deflection setup, a single-mode glass fibre supply of the laser light beam was used. A special grinding technique was used to form fibre tips, which can be short-duration fused to form a small lens for pre-focusing the light beam (two patents have been submitted). A sample setup showed that the self-assembled laser beam has a diameter of approximately 60 µm. With 10 µW {{of light on the}} 4 Q-PD using a standard cantilever, the electronics produced a displacement equivalent to the noise of approximately 0. 1 nm with a 10 kHz low-pass filter. With the beam deflection system introduced here, even the first and second resonances, in addition to the basic one, were observable. The torsional basic mode and its first harmonic were also observed. The Z-drive was separated into low, mid-range and high-frequency components. This separation aids with the thermal management of the microscope to avoid and/or remove unwanted thermal heating in areas of the system where mechanical drift disturbs the scanning force measurements. The hydraulically driven low frequency Z-component fulfils this requirement. A European patent has been granted for the hydraulic cylinder design. While linearization in x-, y-, and z-direction is always desirable, it is a necessity for the scan range of the microscope introduced here. Each scan range could be assembled with a specially adapted linearization unit (fibre bundle and mirror) as the linear behaviour of each linearization unit is proportional to the numerical aperture of the guiding fibres. Finally, the ECU and the control, communication and visualisation software were presented. The centrepiece of the ECU is a Texas Instruments 6711 floating point DSP. This unit features the real-time capability that is necessary to drive such a microscope. The DSP communicates via a serial, insulated interface (FireWire®) with the PC in burst mode, while collecting data from the sensor channels in strict, fixed time-slices. Again, the data channels have to be precise and very fast due to the large scan range, to keep the scan times in a manageable regime. Six channels have 16 bit resolution at 1 MSPS, four channels have 16 bit resolution at 500 kSPS, and eight channels have 16 bit resolution at 250 kSPS. One time-slice was also used up to 128 times for multiplexing pre-selection for one arbitrary channel, which can be used to detect slowly changing signals. At this sample rate, a meander-shaped scan line could be achieved. Different types of deceleration and acceleration behaviour were calculated to obtain the largest possible linear scan range, resulting in cubical behaviour during deceleration and acceleration for even the smallest disturbance in the linear scan regime. The mixer electronics were designed with offset and zoom capabilities. This results in linear DAC sample steps within the chosen region, independent of the user-chosen region of interest (angle and size). ...|$|E

40|$|Motivation: A common {{practice}} in X-ray crystallographic structure 15 refinement has been to model atomic displacements or thermal fluctuations as isotropic motions. Recent high-resolution data reveal, however, significant departures from isotropy, described by aniso-tropic displacement parameters (ADPs) modeled for individual atoms. Yet, ADPs are currently reported for a limited set of 20 structures, only. Results: We present a comparative analysis of the experimentally reported ADPs and those theoretically predicted by the anisotropic network model (ANM) for a representative set of structures. The relative sizes of fluctuations along different directions are 25 shown to agree well between experiments and theory, while the cross-correlations between the (<b>x-,</b> <b>y-</b> and <b>z-)</b> components of the fluctuations show considerable deviations.

Body motion through the strong, non-uniform static magnetic field generated by the main superconducting magnet and exposure to gradient-pulsed magnetic fields can result in the induction of electric fields and current densities in the tissue. The interaction of these fields and occupational workers has attracted an increasing awareness. To protect occupational workers from overexposure, the member states of the European Union are required to incorporate the Physical Agents Directive (PAD) 2004 / 40 /EC into their legislation.

A tower - like traverse connecting both cameras in stereo view and the light - sheet optics, guiding the laser beam through the bottom window of the wind tunnel with a traversing system underneath the test section enables moving the stereo PIV measurement volume at the model in <b>x-,</b> <b>y-</b> and <b>z-</b> direction with just one stereo camera calibration needed.

In addition the configurations without strake were measured at angles of attack 7 ° and 16. 5 ° for comparison reasons.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn the event an underwater {{improvised explosive device}} (IED) were placed near a bridge, Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) units would typically mitigate the threat by conducting a controlled detonation of the bomb. The controlled detonation must be executed a safe distance from any critical infrastructure to ensure the survivability of the structure. This thesis implements the Dynamic System Mechanics Advanced Simulation to characterize a safe detonation distance by determining the critical scenario contributing toward bridge failure. Efforts were also made to determine the parameters critical to modeling bridge foundations. To characterize the most critical scenario, trinitrotoluene was detonated at varying horizontal standoff distances and at varying water depths. The interaction of the underwater explosion (UNDEX) with a bridge foundation modeled from an actual bridge was observed. Intermediate depths were the most damaging to the foundation when the bomb was detonated near {{the surface of the}} water and when the bomb was located at the sand-water interface. Subsequently, EOD units should aim for controlled detonations in shallow or deep water. Two parameters, load and rebar reinforcement volume fraction, were varied to observe their impact on the foundation's response to an UNDEX. The damage to the foundation was minimal as the load fluctuated, indicating that these loads do not need to be properly modeled. When the reinforcement was placed entirely in the <b>X-,</b> <b>Y-,</b> or <b>Z-</b> dimension, the rebar perpendicular to the shockwave proved to be the most critical. Changes in reinforcement volume fraction are also not important in short simulations. As the simulation is extended, the dependence of the damage on the volume fraction increases. As such, foundation models do not need to accurately model the load, but must properly model the reinforcement perpendicular to the shockwave and the volume fraction, if the simulation is long. Understanding which foundational components are critical to its survivability allow bridge foundations to be grouped based on these components, such as reinforcement volume fraction.

3000|$|The {{scanning}} SQUID microscope {{is located}} in a MSB made of two-layered PC permalloy (Fig.  1 b–f, E). There is a large door {{on the front of the}} MSB (Fig.  1 a–c, A) through which the SQUID microscope can be removed for maintenance if necessary. The MSB is supported by an aluminum frame underneath it (Fig.  1 a–d, B), which holds the driving components of the XYZ stage. An aluminum support holds the SQUID microscope in place in the MSB (Fig.  1 a–c, K). Figure  1 b is a side view of the MSB with a sample access door (F), with its hinge on the right-hand side (see Fig.  1 f). The sample access door is tightly locked via the handles at the top and bottom of the door to prevent leakage of the magnetic field lines. The door on the top of the MSB (Fig.  1 b–d, H) can be opened to transfer liquid He, for maintenance, and for fine-tuning of the sensor-to-sample distance with a micrometer spindle. The top door is hinged to the top of the MSB (see Fig.  1 b) and can be opened and closed by using a winch (Fig.  1 b, J) with stainless-steel wire (Fig.  1 b, I), which is going through a pulley attached to the laboratory ceiling (Fig.  1 b, G). The top door can also be tightly locked via the handles on its two unhinged sides. There is a rounded square-shaped hole at the bottom of the MSB (Fig.  1 c, M), within which a cylinder (Fig.  1 c, L) supporting the sample holder moves while scanning with the XYZ stage (Fig.  1 a, b, C). Right before installation, the magnetic field in the center of the MSB was measured using a Helmholtz coil (an approximately 2 -m ×  2 -m rectangle). With the Helmholtz coil, a magnetic field of 0.1 -Hz sine wave was generated at amplitudes of 500  nTpp and the magnetic field was measured at the center of the MSB with a three-axis fluxgate magnetometer (Model FM- 3500, MIT Co.

The results were analyzed, and the shielding factors in the X, Y, and Z directions were calculated as ~ 1 / 257, ~ 1 / 288, and ~ 1 / 91, respectively. After installation of the MSB, the inner wall was demagnetized with a demagnetizing coil. With a three-axis fluxgate sensor (Model 520 A, Applied Physics Systems, Inc.), the residual magnetic field at the measurement position was measured as 2.3, − 3.0, 3.7 nT in <b>X-,</b> <b>Y-</b> and <b>Z-</b> axis, respectively [...].|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{metal filters}} are {{manufactured}} from perforated plate {{and one or}} more layers of woven wire mesh. The perforated plate forms the support portion of the filter, and delivers the overall strength of the filter to withstand operational pressures. The woven wire mesh forms the filter portion with the aperture size chosen to suit the required level of filtration. An ideal filter would have the maximum open area possible to minimise the filters’ resistance when in situ in the conduit. However maximising the open area decreases the overall strength of the filter and so open area must be compromised to deliver the required strength. The design freedoms and capabilities of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology provides the opportunity to design novel filter media that are depth filters with <b>x-,</b> <b>y-</b> and <b>z-</b> planes with integrated support portion and filter portion. This filter mesh has a defined aperture size and by reducing the equivalent wire diameter, these novel filter media have a greater open area compared to the equivalent woven wire mesh. This potentially reduces the pressure drop across the filter and so reduces pumping energy requirements. In preliminary studies AM filter media have been designed using a repeating node unit to form the latticework of the AM filters. Previous test samples demonstrated that this AM integrated filter support and filter portion design decreased the pressure drop across the filter compared to conventional filter design. The aim is to develop the integrated support and filter AM design to incorporate different sizes of repeating nodes, with a larger node providing strength and the smaller node providing the filtration level. It has been possible to develop two node structures to deliver two latticeworks, one with a 1000 μm aperture {{and the other with}} 500 μm aperture. Filter disks comprising of 1, 2 and 3 layers of the individual nodes were tested for strength by collapse pressure. Conical filters were designed and tested for each individual node and for combination of nodes, i. e. layer of 500 μm and 1000 μm. These AM integrated filter supports and filter portion conical filters were tested for strength: collapse pressure and their pressure drop. The pressure drop across these novel AM integrated filters was largest for the AM 500 μm aperture filter alone and least in the AM 1000 μm filter. Combination of repeating nodes of both 1000 μm and 500 μm in one single filter delivered a decreased pressure drop across the filter compared to the AM 500 μm filter with 500 μm apertures alone. The integrated filter support and filter support portion AM design filters shown here have the potential to decrease the end users pumping energy requirements and so reduce energy costs and the end users carbon footprint...|$|R
