5|$|During World War I, Curie {{recognised}} that {{wounded soldiers}} were best served if operated upon {{as soon as}} possible. She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons. After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured <b>X-ray</b> <b>equipment,</b> vehicles, auxiliary generators, and developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies ("Little Curies"). She became {{the director of the}} Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914. Assisted at first by a military doctor and by her 17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals {{in the first year of}} the war. Later, she began training other women as aides.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium {{improves}} many {{physical properties}} when added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron and nickel. Beryllium does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for <b>X-ray</b> <b>equipment</b> and components of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications.|$|E

40|$|Two full {{rotating}} gantry {{with different}} nozzles (Multipurpose nozzle with MLC, Scanning Dedicated nozzle) with conventional cyclotron system is installed and under commissioning for various proton treatment options at Samsung Medical Center in Korea. The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate neutron dose equivalent per therapeutic dose, H/D, to <b>x-ray</b> imaging <b>equipment</b> under various treatment conditions with monte carlo simulation. At first, we investigated H/D with the various modifications of the beam line devices (Scattering, Scanning, Multi-leaf collimator, Aperture, Compensator) at isocenter, 20, 40, 60 cm distance from isocenter and compared with other research groups. Next, we investigated the neutron dose at <b>x-ray</b> <b>equipments</b> used for real time imaging with various treatment conditions. Our investigation showed the 0. 07 ~ 0. 19 mSv/Gy at <b>x-ray</b> imaging <b>equipments</b> according to various treatment options and intestingly 50 % neutron dose reduction effect of flat panel detector was observed due to multi- leaf collimator during proton scanning treatment with multipurpose nozzle.

25|$|In 1906, Ramsay {{performed}} a successful resuscitation {{of the heart}} by massage, opening the thorax of a patient who had clinically died during operation; becoming the first surgeon in Australasia to perform a successful resuscitation. Designing and building St. Margaret's Hospital in Launceston, Ramsay entered private practice in 1912 upon the hospital's foundation. However, he retained his connection with the Launceston General Hospital, serving as an honorary consulting surgeon for the hospital. Interested {{in the works of}} Wilhelm Röntgen in regards to the potential of deep x-ray therapy, Ramsay had permanent scarring on his hands and face as a result of experiments with x-ray.

25|$|Doctors at Royaumont also {{undertook}} cutting-edge research, {{focusing on}} the treatment of gas gangrene. The doctors found X-ray and bacteriology for diagnosis and surgical debridement of affected tissue and antiserum therapy to be especially effective. Doctors at the facility believed the collaboration of different specialties was important in fighting infection and avoiding excess amputations. The hospital had a mobile X-ray car manufactured by Austins and purchased for £300. Installation of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>equipment</b> was assisted by Marie Curie and included water and electrical sources independent {{of the rest of}} the facility. The X-ray car was highly coveted; other hospitals in the area occasionally utilized it and the British military attempted to impound and keep the car for itself. In spite of their work, Dr. Ivans was restricted in her ability to publish and present her results. In 1918 she had to obtain permission from General Célestin Sieur of the French military medical services to publish her results, and she was not allowed to present her work directly to the Société de Chirurgie de Paris, her work being instead presented by a third party.|$|E

500|$|In 1930, Warren {{became an}} Associate Professor of Medicine. That year he {{published}} [...] "A Roentgenologic Study of the Breast". X-ray imaging {{of the breast}} had first been investigated by Albert Salomon at the University of Berlin in 1913. He produced images of over 3,000 mastectomy specimens, and observed different forms and stages of cancer. He was even able to detect an undiagnosed cancer in a breast that had been removed because of a large cyst. However, Salomon apparently did not appreciate the life saving potential of his observations. Warren used radiology to track changes in breast tissue {{as a result of}} pregnancy and mastitis. He developed a stereoscopic technique, using patients rather than specimens and adapting general purpose <b>X-ray</b> <b>equipment</b> to his needs. His method involved having the patient lie on her side with one arm raised while being X-rayed. In 119 women who subsequently underwent surgery, he correctly found breast cancer in 54 out of 58 cases. This represented a leap forward, as it made diagnosis of breast cancer possible without surgery. It also sparked intense interest in the technique around the world. Today mammography saves thousands of lives.|$|E

NDIC-X 75 was applied to radiograpy of welds in small bore steel tube, and the image quality was compared to that taken by radio isotopes. The image quality using NDIC-X 75 were superior to Ytterbium 169 (Yb- 169). Next, NDIC-X 75 and NDIC-X 120 were applied to the welds in steel plate using the X-ray film and the computed radiography (CR), they showed good adaptability to CR...|$|R

2500|$|In anteroposterior (AP) views, the {{positions}} of the x-ray source and detector are reversed: the x-ray beam enters through the anterior aspect and exits through the posterior aspect of the chest. AP chest x-rays are harder to read than PA x-rays and are therefore generally reserved for situations where it is difficult for the patient to get an ordinary chest x-ray, such as when the patient is bedridden. [...] In this situation, mobile <b>X-ray</b> <b>equipment</b> is used to obtain a lying down chest x-ray (known as a [...] "supine film"). [...] As a result, most supine films are also AP.|$|E

40|$|Beryllium (Be) is an {{important}} material with wide applications ranging from aerospace components to <b>X-ray</b> <b>equipments.</b> Yet a precise understanding of its phase diagram remains elusive. We have investigated the phase stability of Be using a recently developed hybrid free energy computation method that accounts for anharmonic effects by invoking phonon quasiparticles. We find that the hcp to bcc transition occurs near the melting curve at 0 <P< 11 GPa with a positive Clapeyron slope of 41 K/GPa. The bcc phase exists in a narrow temperature range that shrinks with increasing pressure, explaining the difficulty in observing this phase experimentally. This work also demonstrates the validity of this theoretical framework based on phonon quasiparticle to study structural stability and phase transitions in strongly anharmonic materials.
