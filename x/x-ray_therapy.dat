The aim of this study was to investigate whether nuclear Ca 2 + buffering could improve the antitumor effect of <b>X-rays</b> <b>therapy</b> on Human Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HSCC). Methods: For these purpose, we developed an experimental protocol that simulated clinical radiotherapy and prevented bystander effects of irradiation. HSCC, A 431 cell line, was submitted to 10 Gy cumulative <b>X-rays</b> <b>therapy</b> alone (XR Cd 10 Gy) or in association with the strategy that selectively buffer nuclear Ca 2 + (Ca 2 + n) signaling. Results: Upon Ca 2 + n buffering, A 431 cell proliferation rate decreased significantly as compared to control. Cell cycle analysis showed that association of Ca 2 + n buffering with XR Cd 10 Gy increased the percentage of A 431 cells at G 2 /M and did not increase nuclear/mitochondrial DNA damages. Nonetheless, Ca 2 + n buffering prevented the increase of the radioresistance-related biomarker ADAM- 17 expression and EGFR activation induced by irradiation. Furthermore, the association therapy almost completely abolished cell survival fraction even using approximately half of the X-rays cumulative dose Conclusions: Nuclear Ca 2 + buffering sensitizes human squamous cell carcinoma to X - rays irradiation treatment...|$|R

The nanoparticles have been modified with cationic polyelectrolytes to allow internalization.

2500|$|Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy, <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy,</b> or irradiation) {{is the use}} of {{ionizing}} radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy can be administered externally via external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or internally via brachytherapy. The effects of radiation therapy are localised and confined to the region being treated. Radiation therapy injures or destroys cells in the area being treated (the [...] "target tissue") by damaging their genetic material, making it impossible for these cells to continue to grow and divide. Although radiation damages both cancer cells and normal cells, most normal cells can recover from the effects of radiation and function properly. The goal of radiation therapy is to damage as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting harm to nearby healthy tissue. Hence, it is given in many fractions, allowing healthy tissue to recover between fractions.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1953, Taft {{began to}} feel pain in his hips, and after a painful golf outing with President Eisenhower in April 1953 he entered Walter Reed Hospital for initial tests which led {{physicians}} to suspect a tumor or arthritis. On May 26 he entered Holmes Hospital in Cincinnati for more extensive tests. The physicians there discovered nodules on his forehead and abdomen, and after doing biopsies of samples of the nodules, found that they were malignant. On June 7, he entered New York Hospital for more tests and treatment; to keep the news {{that he might have}} cancer a secret he registered under the assumed name [...] "Howard Roberts, Jr.". His physicians there agreed with the diagnosis of cancer, but disagreed as to the source of the primary tumor and method of treatment. Some of his doctors advocated exploratory surgery to keep the malignancy from spreading, while other physicians thought the tumors had spread too far, were inoperable, and recommended <b>x-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> to keep him comfortable. After his death, an autopsy determined that Taft had been stricken with pancreatic cancer, which had quickly reached metastasis and spread throughout his body. On June 10, 1953, Taft transferred his duties as Senate Majority Leader to Senator William F. Knowland of California. He did not resign his Senate seat and told reporters that he expected to recover and return to work. However, his condition rapidly worsened, and Taft returned to New York Hospital for surgery on July 4 during a Senate recess. The surgery [...] "did not take long, for the doctors discovered cancer everywhere...there was no longer any doubt" [...] that his condition was terminal. He died at New York Hospital on July 31, following a final brain hemorrhage just hours after his wife's final visit. His body lay in state in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol, where thousands of mourners offered their respects at his coffin. On August 3, 1953, a memorial service was held in the rotunda; in addition to his family the service was attended by Eisenhower, Vice-President Nixon, the cabinet, members of the Supreme Court, and Taft's congressional colleagues. Following the service his body was flown to Cincinnati, where he was buried in a private ceremony at Indian Hill Episcopal Church Cemetery.|$|E

50|$|The first {{attempted}} {{x-ray treatment}} was by Victor Despeignes, a French physician who used {{them on a}} patient with stomach cancer. In 1896, he published a paper with the results: a week-long treatment {{was followed by a}} diminution of pain and reduction {{in the size of the}} tumor, though the case was ultimately fatal. The results were inconclusive, because the patient was concurrently being given other treatments. Freund's first experiment was a tragic failure; he applied x-rays to a naevus in order to induce epilation and a deep ulcer resulted, which resisted further treatment by radiation. The first successful treatment was by Schiff, working with Freund, in a case of lupus vulgaris. A year later, in 1897, the two published a report of their success and this provoked further experimentation in <b>x-ray</b> <b>therapies.</b> Thereafter they did a successful treatment of lupus erythematosus in 1898. The lesion took a common form of a 'butterfly-patch' which appeared on both sides of the face, and Schiff applied the irradiation to one side only, in order to compare the effects.|$|R
40|$|Iodinated {{contrast}} agents, {{which are}} routinely {{used to improve}} contrast in x-ray diagnostic radiography, have been successfully proven to enhance radiation effects in kilovoltage <b>x-ray</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> beams. The studies determined the influence of iodine {{on the level of}} radiation biotoxicity to cells as an indicator of the radiation dose enhancement. The use of other high-atomic-number materials such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) may also provide advantages in terms of radiation dose enhancement. In this work AuNPs have been used for the enhancement of radiation effects on bovine aortic endothelial cells of superficial <b>x-ray</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> and megavoltage electron radiation therapy beams. Results reveal an increase of cell damage with increasing concentration of AuNPs. At 1 mM concentration of AuNPs, enhancement of radiation peaked at 25 times for a kilovoltage x-ray beam. AuNPs showed similar effects on electron beams but to a lesser extent. This study showed that AuNPs can be used to enhance the effect of radiation doses from kilovoltage <b>x-ray</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> and megavoltage electron radiation therapy beams. In the prevailing clinical circumstances, wherein radiation therapy dose is constrained by normal tissue tolerance, this enhancement could in the future be used to improve local control in superficial x-ray treatments, megavoltage electron beam radiation therapy, microbeam radiation therapy, and intraoperative irradiation using kilovoltage x-rays or megavoltage electron beams. Moreover, the value of this work also {{stems from the fact that}} the damage to the endothelial cells lining the highly vasculature structure of tumors deprives tumors of their oxygen and nutrients supply and enhances the efficiency of radiation therapy treatment, where it has been proven that more of the AuNPs injected into animals ends up into the blood than in the tumor...|$|R

5000|$|Historically, {{proton therapy}} has been expensive.

In some clinical situations, proton beam therapy is clearly superior to the alternatives. Another study in 2007 expressed concerns about the effectiveness of proton therapy for treating prostate cancer. Although, with the advent of new developments in proton beam technology, such as improved scanning techniques and more precise dose delivery ('pencil beam scanning'), this situation may change considerably. Amitabh Chandra, a health economist at Harvard University, has been quoted as saying that [...] "Proton-beam therapy is like the death star of American medical technology...
