Long ago I {{read a book}} called [...] "Soul Shapes" [...] that was full of ingenious ideas, but I doubt very much if the thing so revealed would have any shape, any abiding solid outline at all. It is something more fluctuating and discursive than that--at any rate, for every one young enough not to have set and hardened. Things come into it and become it, things drift {{out of it and}} cease to be it, things turn upside down in it and change and colour and dissolve, and grow and eddy about and blend into each other. One might figure it, I suppose, as a preposterous jumble animated by a will; a floundering disconnectedness through which an old hump of impulse rises and thrusts unaccountably; a river beast of purpose wallowing in a back eddy of mud and weeds and floating objects and creatures drowned. Now the sunshine of gladness makes it all vivid, now it is sombre and grimly insistent under the sky of some darkling mood, now an emotional gale sweeps across it and it is one confused agitation....|$|E

50|$|By 1870 Lafont was {{at ease in}} the English {{language}} and began to give scientific lectures for the general public, in which he demonstrated {{that he had a}} particular gift in popularizing scientific knowledge. All the new scientific discoveries and inventions of {{the second half of the}} 19th century were thus made known, always with empirical evidence. So was it of the magic lantern, the telephone, phonograph, <b>X-rays,</b> <b>photography,</b> etc. Through contacts the science enthusiast had brought from Europe the most modern scientific tools, such as the meteograph of Angelo Secchi (meteorology remained his favourite field of activity).

40|$|International audienceEstimating in-vivo {{the life}} span of a total knee {{replacement}} (TKR) prosthesis is currently done by estimating the polyethylene (PE) wear rate from measurement of the femorotibial distance using <b>X-ray</b> <b>photographies.</b> This efficient method requires however to wait for few years to obtain a readout. This paper proposes to use another metric that can be obtained within a couple of months of surgery, namely the center of pressure (COP). This metric represents the point where the axial force applies the most onto the tibial tray. The displacement of the COP with respect to its ideal position can be used toestimate the wear and {{the life span}} of the PE. This requires the implant to be fitted with a telemetry system described briefly. The proposed method is supported by measures and simulations...|$|R
50|$|Until 1885, Caire {{specialized}} {{mostly in}} portrait photography, The {{development of the}} Dry Plate process in 1855 revolutionized what photographers could do with landscape photography. This caused {{him to leave the}} city and set up a new studio in South Yarra. At this point Caire decided to focus on outdoor photography, particularly the Australian landscape. His photography aided in helping the tourism around Gippsland, the place which one of his most popular bodies of work, Gippsland Scenery, was named, this body of work is believed to have contained roughly 60 images. Then when Australia got access to <b>x-ray</b> <b>photography,</b> Caire would shoot <b>X-Ray</b> <b>photography</b> at the Melbourne General Hospital one day each week, he did this for free.|$|E
