40|$|The {{concept of}} ”care”has a long history: “care for the soul”was {{advocated}} by Socrates in Ancient Greek. In Japan, the Kobe earthquake of 1995 drew public {{attention to the}} importance of “mental health care for disaster victims”. In the aftermath of the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011 and its attendant Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, sales spiked of the book Man's Search for Meaning: An Introduction to Logotherapy（Viktor Emil Frankl, 1946; Japanese translation 1956 ）, especially among disaster victims. While Frankl regards the search for the meaning of suffering as “care”, educational theorist Nel Noddings, an advocate of “caring”-related ethics, objects to any such conception of “care”. These definitional discrepancies are reflected in the heightened requirement for “mental health care for disaster victims”, which is now an increasingly salient feature of Japan’s schools. This paper examines the gap between “care for the soul” and “mental health care” in children's writings on their disaster <b>xperience</b> and <b>in</b> teaching materials on disaster prevention and disaster relief...|$|R

40|$|<b>XPERIENCE</b> <b>in</b> {{the use of}} the Cal-Red {{indicator}} of Patton and Reeder (1) in the determination of serum calcium with EDTA has provided some modifications for the method of Bachra et at. (2). These modifications increase the reliability of the standard curve, the stability of the end point, the stability of the indicator, and the ease of manipulations. Titration of the standard calcium solutions of the standard curve with EDTA appears to be most stoichiometric when the concentra-tion of alkali used to maintain the pH above 12 is closely controlled. The data of Fig. 1 show that both the intercept and slope of the standard curve change with varying concentrations of alkali. When NaOH (purity 98. 6 per cent) was used, the optimal concentration was 0. 80 N. When KOH was used, the slope and intercept varied similarly with varying concentrations of alkali, and the optimal concentration was again 0. 8 N. The normality of alkali used for a given batch of reagent should be adjusted so that a titration curve for the standard calcium solution passes through the origin. The concentration of alkali is also a factor in the stability of the end point, as indicated below. The gradual loss of the blue color of the free indicator at the end point of the titration was pointed out by Bachra et at. (2). In the present experiments the end point of the Cal-Red indicator was foun...|$|E
40|$|Most {{development}} objectives {{focus on the}} well-being of individuals. Poli-cies are targeted to increase the percentage of individuals who avoid poverty, who can read, who are free from hunger and illness, or who can find gainful employment. Individual welfare, however, is based {{in large part on}} a com-plex set of interactions among family members. Until recently most policy analyses implicitly viewed the household as having only one set of preferences. This assumption has been a powerful tool for understanding household behavior, such as the distribution of tasks and goods. But a growing body of evidence suggests that this view is an expe-dience that comes at considerable, and possibly avoidable, cost. The article argues that more effective policy instruments will emerge from analyzing the processes by which households balance the diverse interests of their members. E <b>xperience</b> <b>in</b> several sectors shows that, when policymakers neglect pat-terns of distribution within households, they do so at their peril. Con-sider government attempts to target programs to individuals in certain age groups, rather than to households: nutritionists, for example, recognizing the vulnerability of preschool children, often target supplementary feeding to this age group. International experience, however, indicates that such interven-tions will not succeed unless the actions of other household members are taken into account; households often reduce the amount of food given to the target child at home and distribute it among the child's siblings (Beaton and Ghassemi 1982; Kennedy and Alderman 1987). At {{the other end of the}} age spectrum, th...|$|E
40|$|Taking {{the case}} of“spiritual gardening”as a {{starting}} point, this paper reflects on praxis {{as the object}} of practical theology. Praxis is understood as the domain of lived religion and focuses on what people do rather than on official institutionalized religious traditions. Praxis refers to fields of practices like care or community building and to the patterned configurations of action, <b>xperience,</b> and meaning. <b>In</b> pluralized, secularized, and deinstitutionalized contexts, these fields should not be limited to explicitly religious or specifically Christian domains but include the broader field of spiritual and existential practices. Three practical theological perspectives in studying lived religion can be distinguished: pastoral/ecclesial theology, empirical theology, and critical theology. In all three perspectives practical theology is a form of concerned engaged scholarship...|$|R
5000|$|Yomo & Maulkie were a {{hardcore}} hip hop duo {{that was}} associated with the members of N.W.A., although the duo was not a gangsta group. Instead, its lyrics hewed more toward Public Enemy's political style. Both Yomo and Maulkie came from Los Angeles, where the duo signed with Ruthless Records, the label owned by Eazy-E. Yomo and Maulkie first worked with Eazy-E in 1989 when they provided additional vocals to The D.O.C.'s debut album No One Can Do It Better (which Eazy executive produced). In 1991, Eazy worked with them again as executive producer for its only full-length album Are U Xperienced?, distributed by Atco/Atlantic Records. The album's name is derived from Jimi Hendrix's 1967 album Are You Experienced?. The group found little commercial success, however. Maulkie later joined Ice Cube's protégé group Da Lench Mob. The song [...] "For the Love of Money" [...] off of Are U <b>Xperienced?</b> was later, <b>in</b> 1994, reused on the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony single [...] "Foe tha Love of $," [...] from the album Creepin on ah Come Up.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, the Nigerian video industry {{has been the subject of}} a large number of documentary films and festival retrospectives around the world. Their objective was, in most of the cases, introducing the Nigerian video phenomenon to non-African audiences. As much of the literature on the video industry has evidenced, Nollywood’s specific modes of operation made the Nigerian video industry almost incommensurable to other <b>xperiences</b> of filmmaking <b>in</b> the world. As a consequence, during its first decade of existence the Nigerian video phenomenon remained practically “invisible” to non-African audiences. The retrospectives and documentaries that appeared since the early 2000 s had the objective of filling this gap and making Nollywood visible within the global cinematic arena. However, the representation of the video phenomenon that these “metacultural” constructions (Urban) circulated have participated in creating a rigid (and in some cases stereotypical) definition of Nollywood, which has had a specific role in defining the position of the Nigerian video industry in the global cinematic landscape. In this article, I analyze these discursive constructions in order to understand and interpret the representation of the video phenomenon that they have produced. As I will argue, the representation of Nollywood that they circulated can be considered as the result of a specific form of “postcolonial exotic” (Huggan), one in which the fascination for non-Western declinations of modernity takes the place of the fascination for the archaic, the traditional, and the tribal. As I will show in the last section of this essay, in reaction to this kind of representation a number of directors and producers moved toward new economic and narrative strategies. By doing this they aim at moving Nollywood away from the marginal position in which the “postcolonial-exotic” discourse implicit in these representations has positioned it. Peer reviewe...|$|R
