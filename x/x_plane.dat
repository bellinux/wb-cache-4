When motions are perpendicular to the <b>X</b> <b>plane,</b> the magnetic field hinders gravitational instability, increasing the minimum length necessary to produce instability by the factor (1 + alpha) to the 1 / 2 power, where alpha is the ratio of magnetic pressure to gas pressure. When motions are in the plane, no such simple analytical solution is found.

40|$|We study {{both the}} {{classical}} and the quantum target space of (p, q) minimal string theory, using the FZZT brane as a probe. By {{thinking of the}} target space as the moduli space of FZZT branes, parametrized by the boundary cosmological constant x, we see that classically it consists of a Riemann surface Mp,q which is a p-sheeted cover of the complex <b>x</b> <b>plane.</b> However, we show using the dual matrix model that the exact quantum FZZT observables exhibit Stokes ’ phenomenon and are entire functions of x. Along the way we clarify some points about the semiclassical limit of D-brane correlation functions. The upshot is that nonperturbative effects modify the target space drastically, changing it from Mp,q to the complex <b>x</b> <b>plane.</b> To illustrate these ideas, we study in detail the example of (p, q) = (2, 1), which is dual to the Gaussian matrix model. Here we learn that the other sheets of the classical Riemann surface describe instantons in the effective theory on the brane. Finally, we discuss possible applications to black holes and the topological string. Augus...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} example of a {{boundary}} layer tailward of the dawn terminator which is entirely populated by rolled-up flow vortices. Observations were made by Wind on 24 October 2001 as the spacecraft moved across the region at the <b>X</b> <b>plane</b> approximately equal to 13 Earth radii. Interplanetary conditions were steady with a near-radial interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Approximately 15 vortices were observed over the 1. 5 hours duration of Wind's crossing, each lasting approximately 5 min. The rolling up is inferred from the presence of a hot tenuous plasma being accelerated to speeds higher than in the adjoining magnetosheath, a circumstance which {{has been shown to be}} a reliable signature of this in single-spacecraft observations. A blob of cold dense plasma was entrained in each vortex, at whose leading edge abrupt polarity changes of field and velocity components at current sheets were regularly observed. In the frame of the average boundary layer velocity, the dense blobs were moving predominantly sunward and their scale size along the <b>X</b> <b>plane</b> was approximately 7. 4 Earth radii. Inquiring into the generation mechanism of the vortices, we analyze the stability of the boundary layer to sheared flows using compressible magnetohydrodynamic Kelvin-Helmholtz theory with continuous profiles for the physical quantities. We input parameters from (i) the exact theory of magnetosheath flow under aligned solar wind field and flow vectors near the terminator and (ii) the Wind data.

Weak differences were observed in the mean, streamwise velocity and turbulent fluctuations between the static and oscillating turbine cases.
