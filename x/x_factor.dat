5|$|At home in Reykjavík, Paul Oscar {{performs}} regularly as a {{disc jockey}} in clubs and appears {{on radio and}} TV shows. He was a judge in the third season of Idol stjörnuleit (Idol Starsearch, 2005), Iceland's version of the UK reality TV series Pop Idol; and in The <b>X</b> <b>Factor</b> (2006), also modelled on the UK's The <b>X</b> <b>Factor.</b> In 2002 he appeared as Dr. Love in the teenage movie Gemsar (Made in Iceland).|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} year in a row, The <b>X</b> <b>Factor</b> was {{sponsored}} by TalkTalk, as part of a three-year sponsorship deal thought to be worth £20million, including sponsorship of the show, the 2011 live tour and rights to online clips. TalkTalk enlisted series 6 contestants Jedward to launch its interactive initiative on 17 August 2010. Viewers were invited to record a video of themselves performing karaoke in front of a TalkTalk bright lights backdrop, and clips were screened as part of TalkTalk's sponsorship break bumpers. In Ireland, where the series was broadcast on TV3, The <b>X</b> <b>Factor</b> was sponsored by Dominos Pizza.|$|E
40|$|Human <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> was {{isolated}} from Cohn fraction III and characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid composition, and isoelectric focusing. Two molecular forms with biological activity were observed at isoelectric points of 4. 8 and 5. 0. Antisera generated to <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> was monospecific {{and used to}} establish an equilibrium competitive inhibition radioimmunoassay. This assay was specific for human <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> and did not cross-react with human prothrombin or bovine <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> within the sensitivity range of 6 - 300 ng <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> antigen/ml. The mean concentration of <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> based on the antigen was 11. 9 μg/ml, whereas concentration values based on coagulant activity was 7. 8 μg/ml. This 30 % difference in measurement appears to result from {{the presence of a}} subpopulation of <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> molecules devoid of coagulant activity. The radioimmunoassay was used to qualitatively and quantitatively compare purified <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> to plasmic <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> obtained from normal, warfarintreated, acquired Factor X-deficient, and congenitaldeficient patients. In all but one case, the <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> present in these plasmas was immunochemically identical to the purified <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> and permitted precise quantitation of these abnormal <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> molecules. <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> procoagulant activity was analyzed relative to <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> antigen and the specific activities were used to characterize normal and abnormal <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> molecules. Reduced <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> activity in plasmas from warfarin-treated and acquired Factor X-deficient patients was attributed to both decreases in <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> antigen and decreased function of the <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> molecules. Congenitally deficient patients, in general, showed a reduction in <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> antigen in parallel with <b>Factor</b> <b>X</b> procoagulant activities resulting from comparable decreases in specific biological activity of the molecules...|$|R

30|$|In the {{experiments}} with FA for classification with oracle segmentation, we assess different configurations {{for the number}} of <b>x</b> <b>factors</b> and the scoring methods described previously. The UBM employed to compute the statistics has a fixed number of 2, 048 Gaussians to be able to compare the results of the FA systems with the best GMM baseline configuration. Because the boundaries are known, the statistics are calculated over the whole segment without merging underlying partitions. We compute the result using linear scoring and the integration trough the <b>x</b> <b>factors</b> distributions scoring (called as IoChD in this section). The linear scoring needs a final calibration because the scoring is scaled by the module of the target model. A Gaussian back-end (GBE) ([54],[55]) provides benefits in two ways: calibration and score combination. The calibration for the IoChD scoring does not provide substantial benefits because the score is based on a likelihood ratio over a MAP adaptation using the same UBM and the marginal improvement comes from the combination of scores. The experiments are carried out with a single U matrix to compensate all the within-class variability and different numbers of <b>x</b> <b>factors</b> (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300) providing the error for each class. Note that the increment of <b>x</b> <b>factors</b> involves an exponential increment of the computational cost.|$|R
