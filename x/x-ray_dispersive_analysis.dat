40|$|The {{friction}} and wear of pure aluminum {{and a number}} of hypoeutectic aluminum-silicon alloys (with 3 to 12 wt %Si) were studied with a pin-on-disk apparatus. The contacts were lubricated with mineral oil and sliding was in the boundary-lubrication regime at 2. 6 cm/sec. Surfaces were analyzed with photomicrographs, scanning electron microscopy, <b>X-ray</b> <b>dispersive</b> <b>analysis,</b> and diamond pyramid hardness measurements. There were two wear regimes for the alloys - high and low - whereas pure aluminum exhibited a high wear rate throughout the test period. Wear rate decreased and the transition stress from high to low wear increased with increasing hardness. There was no correlation between friction coefficient and hardness. A least squares curve fit indicated a wear-rate dependence greater than the inverse first power of hardness. The lower wear rates of the alloys {{may be due to the}} composites of silicon platelets in aluminum resulting in increased hardness and thus impairing the shear of the aluminum...|$|E
