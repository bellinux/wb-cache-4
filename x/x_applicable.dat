A relatively low contrast enhancement of molecular line emission {{occurs in a}} ringlike zone {{at a distance of}} approximately 3. 5 kpc from the center; there is no evidence for a pronounced central hole. The ring is located {{at the edge of the}} region of rigid rotation and roughly coincides with an inhomogeneous ring of nonthermal radio continuum emission. It is well inside the radius of maximum rotational velocity. The intensities of the 492 GHz [CI] line and various 12 CO and 13 CO transitions observed towards the center and two outlying positions are modelled by multiple molecular gas components: low-density gas at a kinetic temperature Tkin ≈ 10 K, and high-density gas at both Tkin ≈ 10 K and Tkin ≈ 20 K. The molecular gas must be distributed in clumpy or filamentary form. The CO-to-H 2 conversion factor <b>X</b> <b>applicable</b> to the bulge is only half that applicable to the ring and beyond. The latter is still significantly lower than XMilkyWay. Molecular hydrogen is the dominant mass contributor to the interstellar medium in the bulge and in the ring. Far-infrared emission from dust peaks inside the ring at 100 µm (warm dust), and in the ring at 850 µm (colder dust). Beyond the ring, neutral atomic hydrogen is dominant. Inferred total hydrogen mass densities in the ring are about twice those in the bulge. Interstellar gas to dynamical mass ratios are of order 1 % in the bulge, about 1. 5 % in the ring followed by a rise to 3 %. The bulge gas may have originated in mass loss from bulge stars; in that case, the molecular ring is probably caused by a decrease in evacuation efficiency at the bulge outer edge...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It {{is shown}} constructively that a {{strongly}} extensional function of bounded variation on an interval is regulated, in a sequential sense that is classically {{equivalent to the}} usual one. This paper continues the constructive study of monotone functions and functions of bounded variation, begun in [3] and [4] (see also [5]). It can be read by anyone who appreciates the distinction between classical and intuitionistic logic, and {{does not require a}} detailed knowledge of the constructive theory of R, let alone any abstract constructive analysis. However, the reader will find it helpful to have at hand a copy of [1], [2], [6], or [10]. Throughout the paper, I will be a proper interval in R, Y a metric space, 1 and f: I → Y a mapping that is strongly extensional in the sense that ∀x∀y (f(x) 6 = f(y) ⇒ x 6 = y), where, for two elements x, y of a metric space, x 6 = y means ρ(x, y) > 0. It is shown in [4] that an increasing function f: I → R is strongly extensional, and that for all <b>applicable</b> <b>x</b> ∈ I the real numbers f(x−) = limt→x − f(x) and f(x+) = limt→x+ f(t...|$|R

We study the connections between a triangular substochastic matrix A, whose nth column consists of the elements ai,n, i = 1,…, n, and the Banach space ai,n, En ⊂ En + 1, En ≅ l∞n, where A determines the embeddings of the En. The class of these Banach spaces is the class of all separable Lindenstrauss spaces. Sufficient and necessary conditions are stated for a matrix A to represent c 0 and c. Furthermore, we characterize the class of all extreme triangular substochastic matrices which represents C(K), where K is the Cantor set. We investigate how the special biface structure of the dual unit ball of X is reflected in the elements of a matrix A representing the separable Lindenstrauss space <b>X.</b> This is <b>applicable</b> to Gurarij spaces; we give a new proof for the maximality property of Gurarij spaces and show that they are isomorphic to A(S) where S is a Choquet simplex with dense extreme points...|$|R

Power [l], [2] discovered an (n + 1) x (n + 1) <b>X</b> matrix <b>applicable</b> for transforming the a f s of (1) to the b f s of (2), and Fielder [3] developed {{a somewhat different}} Q matrix for the same purpose. In each cases the most rewarding feature of the application matrix (X or Q) was the apparent presence of an extremely simple combinatorial scheme for constructing the application matrix from the barest minimum of information. While many trial values of n assured that either application matrix was safe to use for practical purposes, the analytic validity of the combinatorial schemes defied verification, leaving an understandably disturbing theoretical situation. In this note, a very simple proof {{of the validity of}} the combinatorial method for constructing the Q matrix is presented. The proof is effected through application of generating functions. * It has been shown [3] that the coefficients of (1) and (2) are related through (4) b = i Q a, where a is the (n + 1) X 1 column matrix (1, a-, • • •, a 0), b is the (n + 1) X 1 column matrix (1, b, • • •, b 0) 9 Q is an (n + 1) X (n + 1) application matrix of integers, and A 0 is the sum of the elements of a.

40|$|In rock {{system the}} {{particles}} are jointed irregularly. These discontinuities in joints may occur {{with or without}} gouge filled material. The discontinuity in rock decides {{the strength of the}} rock mass. However, the strength test of these joints is costly and not easy to execute at rock sites. This opens the avenue for the development indirect method which computes the rock strength [...] we can calculate the strength of the rocks by knowing some factors these are roughness parameter, joint factor inclination parameter. By knowing the joint factor value we can evaluate the strength of rocks. Joint factor totally depends upon roughness parameter joint number. Plaster of Paris specimens were made for experiment. Calculate the strength of rocks and also experiment different specimens with various angle of orientation (β 0) which is varying from 00 - 900. These models were Possessing joints with and without gouge fill. Mica with Plaster of Paris used as the gouge material. Here, an attempt was made to compare the results of strength and deformation characteristics of jointed rock mass with and without gouge fill by using model material plaster of Paris. From the experiments it was found that for single jointed rock mass specimen without gouge fill at β= 300 strength was found to be 0. 66 MPa which is minimum and at β= 900 strength was found to be 7. 6 MPa which is maximum.

40|$|Rock is a {{discontinuous}} {{medium and}} the discontinuity {{may be in}} the form of joints or faults. Hence, the strength of rock mass generally depends on the type of discontinuity present in the rock mass. The strength of jointed rock mass generally depends on the joint spacing, inclination parameter and the roughness parameter. This joint roughness is a vital parameter which generally governs the strength of the rock mass. The roughness is usually computed with the help of direct shear test (r = tanφj). The deformation characteristics of rock mass are another parameter which is usually taken care in addition to the strength of rock mass and can be computed with the help of uniaxial compressive strength test. As collection of jointed rock mass and field testing of rock mass is tedious as well as difficult, hence jointed rock mass models are generally made in the laboratory itself. In the present study, plaster of Paris was used for modeling laboratory specimens as it is locally available {{and at the same time}} casting of jointed rock mass specimen can be done easily. The joints in rock mass specimen were made at various angles of orientation (β 0) which is varying from 00 - 900. These models were possessing joints with and without gouge fill. Clay was used as gouge material. Here, an attempt was made to compare the results of strength and deformation characteristics of jointed rock mass with and without gouge fill by using model material plaster of Paris. From the experiments it is found that for single jointed rock mass specimen without gouge fill at β= 300 strength was found to be 0. 22 MPa which is minimum and at β= 900 strength was found to be 7. 34 MPa which is maximum. For single jointed rock mass specimen with gouge, further trend of decrease in strength was found and this is due to decrease in roughness parameter. Here, also at β= 300 strength was found to be 0. 11 MPa which is minimum and at β= 900 strength was found to be 6. 79 MPa which is maximum.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{was motivated}} by the decline in percentage {{of the number of}} Standard 10 pupils who offered History for the National Senior Certificate (Matriculation) Examination in the Mathole Directorate in the Ciskei from 1987 - 1990. The research revealed that the {{decrease in the number of}} pupils doing History in Standard 10 did not indicate loss of interest in the subject. Instead, the multiplicity of new subjects introduced in the school curriculum and some peculiar subject combinations in some schools forced some pupils (reluctantly) to reject History as a school subject. Those who chose to do History in Standard 10 showed their liking for the subject and expressed their interest in it. The study took the form of a survey through the use of questionnaire and informal chats with pupils and teachers on their views about History as a school subject. A questionnaire was designed for pupils offering History in Standard 10 and administered in four of the eight Senior Secondary Schools in the Mathole Directorate in Ciskei. Generally, work on pupils' interest in and attitude towards History as a school subject is very rare. Some of the few available works merely compare pupils' liking for History as opposed to other school subjects and when the response is not favourable; conclude that pupils in Senior Secondary Schools do not enjoy studying History. Pupils' interest in and attitudes towards the subject, the extent of their interest, the causes of their attitude and the internal and external influences on their interest in and attitudes towards the subject were neglected by earlier works, but have been given attention in this study. As a result of very little available work and material, pupils' responses to the questionnaire formed the basis of the material used in this work. A large number of pupils' responses was put in tables according to sex instead of schools. Where <b>applicable,</b> <b>X</b> 2 tests were administered to see if there were any appreciable statistically significant differences between the responses of the boys and girls. In most cases where the X 2 tests were applied, no statistically difference was noticed. The study showed more boys than girls showing interest in and positive attitudes towards History. The general picture of the study showed a deviation from the view commonly expressed by other studies that pupils in modern Senior Secondary Schools do not like History. As this study revealed, it is not the subject itself that pupils did not like, but the way it is handled by some teachers and lack of teaching aids to concretise events. This leads to the role of Teacher Training Institutions: which must be to produce the versatile, duty-conscious and innovating History teacher to revolutionise History teaching to make History alive to pupils. ...|$|R
