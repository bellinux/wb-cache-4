40|$|Abstract. In {{computed}} tomography (CT), reconstructions from conebeam (CB) data acquired with a polychromatic <b>X-ray</b> <b>device</b> show so called beam hardening artifacts. Beam hardening artifacts are highly undesirable {{for a medical}} diagnosis, because details in the reconstructed image are severely disturbed or completely lost. In this work, we demonstrate the significant reduction of beam hardening artifacts by using an iterative reconstruction scheme which consists of a backward and a forward projector. For the backward projector, an exact reconstruction approach was used. The forward projector was extended by a polychromatic model to mimic a realistic <b>X-ray</b> <b>device.</b> The presented experiments use simulated CB data to restrict the evaluation to beam hardening artifacts. The discussion is focused on CB data acquired along a helical trajectory. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Sub-standard {{quality in}} X-ray image {{acquisition}} and interpretation {{is common in}} low-resource countries, and can ultimately result in higher patient morbidity and mortality. This study aimed at evaluating; 1) feasibility of implementing a digital <b>X-ray</b> <b>device</b> in a second level hospital in Angola; 2) quality of digital X-ray images, when digital radiology was {{in the hands of}} local technicians; 3) feasibility of digital teleradiology and its potential impact on case management. METHODS: We developed and tested at the Hospital Divina Providencia (HDP) in Luanda, Angola, a digital <b>X-ray</b> <b>device</b> and a telemedicine network to acquire and print digital X-ray images and send them as DICOM files for remote consultation. RESULTS: 20, 564 digital X-ray images were made at HDP from November 2010 to December 2012, with no major technical problems and no need for on-site supervision. Digital radiology largely improved the number of X-ray images of good and very good quality (100 % of images with digital radiology, compared to 15 % of screen-film images, p< 0. 0001). Teleradiology using digital images was used in 7. 6 % of paediatric cases, and provided, in these cases, an important contribution to case management. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a digital <b>X-ray</b> <b>device</b> is feasible in low resource settings with significant improvement in quality of X-ray images compared to standard screen film radiology...|$|R
40|$|The method {{defined by}} the IEC 60522 for {{determining}} the inherent filtration of an <b>x-ray</b> source <b>device</b> is applicable only for a limited range of tube voltage. Because the users cannot legally remove the x-ray movable diaphragm of the <b>x-ray</b> source <b>device,</b> total filtration, which {{is the sum of}} the additional filtration diaphragm movable for specific filtration and x-ray, cannot be measured. We develop a method for simply obtaining the total filtration for different tube voltage values. Total filtration can be estimated from a ratio R 2 ̆ 7 of the air kerma K_x+T^', which is measured with an Al plate with thickness T, and K_x^' measured without an Al plate. The conditions of the target material of the <b>x-ray</b> source <b>device</b> are then entered into the Report 78 Spectrum Processor to calculate the air kerma K x and K x+T for Al thicknesses x and (x[*][*]+[*][*]T), respectively, to obtain R.
