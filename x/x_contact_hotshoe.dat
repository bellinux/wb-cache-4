40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{invention}} of the transistor, aggressive channel length scaling has been pursued to achieve higher performance and greater packing density. In order to preserve gate control at short channel lengths, the transistor channel has evolved from bulk to low dimensional substrates, such as 2 D thin films and 1 D nanowires. For scaling to continue, it is vital that we understand the processing and physics of low dimensional materials. Chapter 2 focuses on quasi- 2 D ultrathin body InAsSb-on-insulator n-FETs. III-V materials offer high mobilities for excellent on-state currents, and by using a thin film platform we could potentially obtain good off-state characteristics. Previously we have demonstrated high performance InAs-on-insulator n-FETs. In this study we implement InAsSb transistors on SiO 2 and achieve a ~ 2 x enhancement in effective mobility over analogous InAs devices. Top-gated devices are demonstrated with an I ON /I OFF of 10 2 - 10 3 and an intrinsic conductance of ~ 0. 56 mS/μm. 1 D InAs nanowire (NW) n-FETs are explored in chapter 3. In particular, the nanowire transistors are used to study ballistic transport, the theoretical current density upper limit. We experimentally observe ~ 60 nm channel length devices reaching ~ 80 % of the ballistic limit. Length dependent studies on the same nanowire are used to extract a mean free path of ~ 150 nm for the 1 st and 2 nd electron subbands. We find the mean free path to be independent of temperature, suggesting that surface roughness scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism. Chapter 4 explores 2 D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) thin films. TMDC thin films offer the physical limit of scaling, and ohmic contacts to its conduction and valence bands are required for it to realize low power complementary logic. Previous studies show that elemental metal energy levels are pinned near the conduction band of TMDCs and do not offer effective hole injection. To address this we explore a high work function transition metal oxide, substoichiometric molybdenum trioxide (MoO x, x 2 and WSe 2. MoS 2 diodes and p-FETs are demonstrated with MoO <b>x</b> <b>contacts.</b> WSe 2 p-FETs with MoO <b>x</b> <b>contacts</b> show a ~ 10 x on-current improvement over devices with Pd contacts. In chapter 5 we present heterojunction diodes formed by thin films of InAs and WSe 2. In traditional epitaxial heterojunctions, the number of possible material combinations are limited by lattice constraints. In this study we overcome this restraint by transferring one layer upon another to form a heterojunction. Specifically, InAs/WSe 2 heterojunction diodes are fabricated and measured. A forward/reverse current ratio > 10 6, reverse bias current - 12 μm 2, and ideality factor of 1. 1 are observed...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in two parts. In the first part, two assumptions presented in Janet Helms' White Racial Identity (WRI) development model (1990) were tested. First, Helms theorized that one's stage of WRI development is positively related to increased cognitive complexity achievement and suggests that later stages require greater complexity. A second assumption of Helms' theory was that continued interracial contact is essential for advancement in WRI stage development. Part one of this study examined the relationship of cognitive complexity and interracial contact (both formal and informal) to WRI, and the relationship between cognitive complexity and interracial contact as they relate to WRI. Part two of this study consisted of a factor analysis of Helms' WRI measure followed by a second set of analyses examining the relationship between the new obtained factors with contact and cognitive complexity. This analysis allowed a comparison to be made between Helms' 5 WRI stages and the obtained factor solution from the factor analysis. It also allowed a comparison {{of the relationship between the}} stages and cognitive complexity and contact and the obtained factor solution and these same variables. Three hundred and sixty eight White undergraduates completed Helms' White Racial Identity Attitude Scale, a 4 x 6 Repertory Grid, measuring cognitive complexity in social settings, and an interracial contact measure, including a measure of both formal and informal types of contact. Results of part one of the analyses indicated that neither cognitive complexity nor cognitive complexity <b>x</b> <b>contact</b> were significantly related to WRI scores. However, contact was significantly related to WRI scores. WRI stage two was positively related and WRI stage four was negatively related to scores on formal contact. Stage 4 was negatively related and stages 2 and 3 were positively related to scores on informal contact. The results of part two indicated again that neither cognitive complexity nor cognitive complexity <b>x</b> <b>contact</b> were significantly related to the obtained WRI factors. However, contact once again was significant. The factor analysis produced a 5 factor solution that while similar in theme and number to the 5 stages, nonetheless indicated a different relationship with contact scores than the stages did. Factor 3 (representing stage 4) was positively related and factor 4 (representing stages 2 and 3) was negatively related to formal contact scores. However, factor 3 (representing stage 4) was positively related and factor 4 (representing stages 2 and 3) were negatively related to scores on informal contact. There were discrepancies across the two parts of the study as to the stages and direction of the relationships between interracial contact (formal and informal) and WRI scores. Some of these results were in opposite directions than either the theory or study expected. These discrepancies are dealt with in chapter 5.

50|$|Simplifying, ANDNA {{works as}} follows: {{to resolve a}} {{symbolic}} name the host applies a function Hash on behalf. The Hash function returns an address that the host contacts asking for the resolution generated by the hash. The contacted node receives a request, searches in its ANDNA database for the address associated with the name {{and returns to the}} applicant host. Recording is in a similar way. For example, let's suppose that the node X should record the address FreakNet.andna, X calculates the hash name and obtains the address 11.22.33.44 associated with node Y. The node <b>X</b> <b>contacts</b> Y requiring registration for 11.22.33.44 hash as its own. Y stores the request in its database and any request for resolution of 11.22.33.44 hash, will answer with the X address.The protocol is obviously more complex as the system provides a public/private key to authenticate the hosts and prevent unauthorized changes to ANDNA database. Furthermore, the protocol provides redundancy database to make the protocol resistant to any failures and also provides for the migration of the database if the network topology changes. The protocol does not provide for the possibility of revoking a symbolic name, this after a certain period of inactivity (currently 3 days) is simply deleted from the database. The protocol also prevents a single host to record an excessive number of symbolic names (at present 256 names) in order to prevent spammers to store a high number of terms commonly used or to perform actions of cybersquatting.|$|R

The insertion of TiO 2 at the source-drain contact interface results in significant improvement in the on-current and field effect mobility (up to 10 x). The reduction in RC and FB has been explained through interfacial doping of MoS 2 and validated by first-principles calculations, which indicate metallic behavior of the TiO 2 -MoS 2 interface. Consistent with DFT results of interfacial doping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data also exhibit a 0. 5 eV shift toward higher binding energies for Mo 3 d and S 2 p peaks in the presence of TiO 2, indicating Fermi level movement toward the conduction band (n-type doping). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) further corroborates the interfacial doping model, as MoS 2 flakes capped with ultrathin TiO 2 exhibit a reduction of 0. 3 eV in the effective work function. Finally, a systematic comparison of the impact of selective doping with the TiO 2 layer under the source-drain metal relative to that on top of the MoS 2 channel shows a larger benefit for transistor performance from the reduction in source-drain contact resistance...|$|R

Here we investigated the efficacy of electrochemical disinfection for inactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores – a model microorganism of highly resistant pathogens. The effect of electrochemical disinfection with TinO 2 n− 1 ceramic electrodes which generate active chlorine from chloride in situ, was compared to the traditional chlorination in which active chlorine was produced from addition of sodium hypochlorite. Research was performed in a batch scale with a synthetic buffered drinking water containing 35. 5 mg/l of chloride ions. Spore viability was analysed with both cultivation and cell potential for dividing (direct viable count method). The results showed that at the similar residual disinfectant concentrations <b>x</b> <b>contact</b> time (CT value) electrochemical disinfection was {{more than three times}} more effective to neutralize both cultivable and able to divide B. subtilis spores than traditional chlorination. Like in chlorination, electrochemical disinfection showed to be water-pH dependent and the lowest CT value of 112 mg/l min− 1 (2 -log removal) was obtained at pH 6. The lowest efficiency for both techniques was observed at pH 8. In conclusion, electrochemical disinfection is a viable in situ method even at low level of chlorides in drinking water and appears to be more effective than simple chlorination with the addition of the active chlorine species when highly resistant microbial forms are analysed, however, to apply the technology on a wide scale additional studies on potential formation of disinfection by-products must be performed. ...|$|R
