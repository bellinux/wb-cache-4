40|$|It is {{well known}} that seeding can be used to produce narrow-bandwidth and fully {{coherent}} x-ray free-electron lasers (FELs). Self-seeding, which uses an extra undulator to generate the seed pulse, is {{perhaps one of the most}} promising methods to accomplish this. In the hard x-ray regime with high-energy electrons, this method requires a large magnetic chicane to match the path-length delay of the x-ray monochromator that selects a narrow bandwidth of radiation. Such a chicane not only takes a large footprint to build, but also may degrade the electron-beam qualities through incoherent and coherent synchrotron radiation. In this paper, we present an alternative two-bunch self-seeding scheme. The two bunches are precisely separated to match the <b>x-ray</b> <b>delay</b> of the monochromator and eliminate the need for a long, complex magnetic chicane. The spectrally filtered self-amplified spontaneous emission x-ray pulse produced by the first bunch is combined with the second electron bunch at the entrance of the second undulator and then amplified to the saturation level.

40|$|The {{wide-band}} X-ray {{spectra of}} the high mass X-ray binary Cygnus X- 3 exhibits a pivoting behavior in the `low' (as well as `hard') state, correlated to the radio emission. The time scale of the soft and hard X-rays' anti-correlation, which {{gave rise to the}} pivoting feature, was found to be less than a day from the monitoring observations by RXTE [...] ASM and CGRO [...] BATSE. In this Letter we report the detection of a lag of ≲ 1000 s in the anti-correlation of the hard X-ray emission (20 [...] 50 keV) to that of the soft X-ray emission (2 [...] 7 keV), which may be attributed to the viscous time scale of flow of matter in the accretion disk. This suggests the geometrical picture of a truncated accretion disc with a Compton cloud inside the disc, the relative sizes of which determine the spectral shape. Any change in the disc structure will take place in a viscous time scale, with corresponding anti-correlated change in the Compton cloud.

40|$|We {{show that}} the time delay between the optical and X-ray outbursts of the black-hole soft X-ray {{transient}} source GRO J 1655 - 40, observed in April 1996, requires that the accretion flow in this object must consist of two components: a cold outer accretion disk and an extremely hot inner advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). In quiescence, the model predicts a spectrum which is in good agreement with observations, {{with most of the}} observed radiation coming from the ADAF. By fitting the observed spectrum, we estimate the mass accretion rate of the quiescent system and the transition radius between the disk and the ADAF. We present a detailed numerical simulation of a dwarf-nova type instability in the outer disk. The resulting heat front reaches the ADAF cavity promptly; however, it must then propagate inward slowly on a viscous time scale, thereby delaying the onset of the X-ray flux. The model reproduces the observed optical and X-ray light curves of the April 1996 outburst, as well as the 6 -day <b>X-ray</b> <b>delay.</b> Further, the model gives an independent estimate of the quiescent mass accretion rate which is in very good agreement with the rate estimated from fitting the quiescent spectrum. We show that a pure thin disk model without an ADAF zone requires significant tuning to explain the X-ray delay; moreover, such a model does not explain the quiescent X-ray emission of GRO J 1655 - 40.

40|$|On 2015 June 15 {{the burst}} alert {{telescope}} (BAT) on board Swift detected an X-ray outburst {{from the black}} hole transient V 404 Cyg. We monitored V 404 Cyg for the last 10 years with the 2 -m Faulkes Telescope North in three optical bands (V, R, and i^'). We found that, one week prior to this outburst, the optical flux was 0. 1 [...] 0. 3 mag brighter than the quiescent orbital modulation, implying an optical precursor to the X-ray outburst. There is also {{a hint of a}} gradual optical decay (years) followed by a rise lasting two months prior to the outburst. We fortuitously obtained an optical spectrum of V 404 Cyg 13 hours before the BAT trigger. This too was brighter (∼ 1 mag) than quiescence, and showed spectral lines typical of an accretion disk, with characteristic absorption features of the donor being much weaker. No He II emission was detected, which would have been expected had the X-ray flux been substantially brightening. This, combined with the presence of intense Hα emission, about 7 times the quiescent level, suggests that the disk entered the hot, outburst state before the X-ray outburst began. We propose that the outburst is produced by a viscous-thermal instability triggered close to the inner edge of a truncated disk. An <b>X-ray</b> <b>delay</b> of a week is consistent with the time needed to refill the inner region and hence move the inner edge of the disk inwards, allowing matter to reach the central BH, finally turning on the X-ray emission.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the {{long-term}} optical {{observation of the}} faint soft X-ray transient SAX J 1810. 8 - 2609 from OGLE and MOA. We {{have focused on the}} 2007 outburst, and also did the cross-correlate between its optical light curves and the quasi-simultaneous X-ray observations from RXTE/Swift. Both the op-tical and X-ray light curves of 2007 outburst show multi-peak features. Quasi-simultaneous optical/X-ray luminosity shows that both the X-ray reprocessing and viscously thermal emission can explain the observed optical flux. There is a slightly <b>X-ray</b> <b>delay</b> of 0. 6 ± 0. 3 days during the first peak, while the X-ray emission lags the optical emission by ∼ 2 days during the rebrightening stage, which suggests that X-ray reprocessing emission contributes significantly to the optical flux in the first peak, but the viscously-heated-disk origin dominates the optical flux during rebrightening. It implies variation of the physical environment of the outer disk, even the source stayed in low-hard state during the whole out-burst. The ∼ 2 -day X-ray lag indicates a small accretion disk of the system, and the optical counterpart was not detected by OGLE and MOA during quiescence, which constrained it to be fainter than MI = 7. 5 mag. There is a suspected short-time optical flare detected at MJD = 52583. 5 without X-ray counterpart detected, this single flux increase may imply a magnetic loop reconnection in the outer disk as proposed by Zurita et al (2003). The observations cover all stages of the outburst, however, due to the low sensitivity of RXTE/ASM, we cannot conclude whether it is an optical precursor at the initial rise of the outburst...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experiments on}} the effects of ultraviolet radiation and of x-rays on the eggs and sperm of the sea urchin Arbacia punclulata, carried out during the summer of 1950. 1 These, together with earlier findings already described (Blum and Price, 1950 a, b; Blum, Loos, and Robinson, 1950) permit certain conclusions to be reached regarding the locus of action of these radia-' tions, and that of photorecovery after ultraviolet radiation. To aid in understanding the rationale of the experiments and their interpretation the results will be briefly recapitulated. Locus of Delay of Cleavage In moderate doses both ultraviolet radiation and <b>x-ray</b> <b>delay</b> cell division (cleavage) of the eggs of the sea urchin. To determine the locus of this action advantage was taken {{of the fact that the}} eggs of Arbacia can be separated by centrifugation into nucleate and enucleate halves. Thus whole eggs, nucleate, or enucleate halves may be exposed to ultraviolet or x-radiation, either before or after fertilization with normal sperm. Or the sperm may be exposed to the radiation before it is used to fertilize the eggs or halves. The various combinations are indicated in Text-fig. 1 A, which also summarizes our findings with regard to delay of cleavage by ultraviolet radiation. Cleavage is delayed in all cases except when the enucleate half is exposed to ultraviolet radiation before fertilization with normal sperm. This is also the only case in which the part that receives the radiation contains no nucleus. If the sperm nucleus is introduced into the enucleate half by fertilization before exposure, or if the sperm itself is exposed to ultraviolet radiation, there is delay of cleavage. We conclude that the locus of action of the radiation is the nucleus or something closely associated with the nucleus...|$|E

40|$|Core-level {{spectroscopy}} in {{the soft}} X-ray regime is {{a powerful tool for}} the study of chemical bonding processes. The ultrafast, ultrabright X-ray pulses generated by the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) allow these reactions to be studied in greater detail than ever before. In this study, we investigated a conceptual design of a spectrometer for the LCLS with imaging in the non-dispersive direction. This would allow single-shot collection of X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) measurements with varying laser pump <b>X-ray</b> probe <b>delay</b> or a variation of incoming X-ray energy over the illuminated area of the sample. Ray-tracing simulations were used to demonstrate how the components of the spectrometer affect its performance, allowing a determination of the optimal final design. These simulations showed that the spectrometer's non-dispersive focusing is extremely sensitive {{to the size of the}} sample footprint; the spectrometer is not able to image a footprint width larger than one millimeter with the required resolution. This is compatible with a single shot scheme that maps out the laser pump <b>X-ray</b> probe <b>delay</b> in the non-dispersive direction as well as resonant XES applications at normal incidence. However, the current capabilities of the Soft X-Ray (SXR) beamline at the LCLS do not produce the required energy range in a small enough sample footprint, hindering the single shot resonant XES application at SXR for chemical dynamics studies at surfaces.

40|$|We {{show for}} five DN systems, SS Cyg, VW Hyi, RU Peg, WW Cet and T Leo that the UV and X-ray power spectra {{of their time}} {{variable}} light curves are similar in quiescence. All of them show a break in their power spectra, which {{in the framework of}} the model of propagating fluctuations indicates inner disk truncation. We derive the inner disk radii for these systems in a range (10 - 3) × 10 ^ 9 cm. We analyze the RXTE data of SS Cyg in outburst and compare it with the power spectra, obtained during the period of quiescence. We show that during the outburst the disk moves towards the white dwarf and recedes as the outburst declines. We calculate the correlation between the simultaneous UV and X-ray light curves of the five DN studied in this work, using the XMM-Newton data obtained in the quiescence and find X-ray time lags of 96 - 181 sec. This {{can be explained by the}} travel time of matter from a truncated inner disk to the white dwarf surface. We suggest that, in general, DN may have truncated accretion disks in quiescence which can also explain the UV and <b>X-ray</b> <b>delays</b> in the outburst stage and that the accretion may occur through coronal flows in the disk (e. g., rotating accretion disk coronae). Within a framework of the model of propagating fluctuations the comparison of the X-ray/UV time lags observed by us in the case of DN systems with those, detected for a magnetic Intermediate Polar allows us to make a rough estimate of the viscosity parameter α∼ 0. 25 in the innermost parts of the accretion flow of DN systems.

The soft x-ray emission from such a remnant may not become centre bright during its observable lifetime. This can explain the observations that show that mixed-morphology supernova remnants preferentially occur close to denser, molecular environments. Remnants expanding into denser environments tend to be smaller, making it easier for thermal conduction to make larger changes in the temperatures of their hot gas bubbles. We show that the lower temperatures make it very favorable to use high-stage ions as diagnostics of the hot gas bubbles in SNRs. In particular, the distribution of O VIII transitions from shell-bright at early epochs to centre-bright at later epochs in the evolution of an SNR expanding in a dense ISM when the physics of thermal conduction is included.

40|$|Introduction. Nutritional {{deficiencies}} {{are rarely}} reported in developed countries. We report {{a child of}} Pakistani origin brought up in Dubai who developed skeletal manifestations of scurvy due to peculiar dietary habits. Case Presentation. A 4. 5 year old boy presented with pain and swelling of multiple joints for three months and inability to walk for two months. Dietary history was significant for exclusive meat intake for the preceding two years. On examination the child’s height and weight were below the 5 th percentile for his age. He was pale and tachycardic. There was significant swelling and tenderness over the wrist, knee and ankle joints, along with painful restriction of motion. Basic blood workup was unremarkable except for anemia. However, <b>X-rays</b> showed <b>delayed</b> bone age, severe osteopenia of the long bones, epiphyseal separation, cortical thinning and dense zone of provisional calcification, suggesting a radiological diagnosis of scurvy. The child was started on vitamin C replacement therapy. Over the following two months, the pain and swelling substantially reduced and the child became able to walk. Repeat X-rays showed improvement in the bony abnormalities. Conclusion. Although scurvy {{is not a very}} commonly encountered entity in the modern era, inappropriate dietary intake can lead to skeletal abnormalities which may be confused with rickets. A high index of suspicion is thus required for prompt diagnosis of scurvy in patients with bone and joint symptoms...|$|R
