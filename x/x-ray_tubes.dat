5|$|A new factory was {{constructed}} at 230 Duffy Avenue, Hicksville, New York, to manufacture electron tubes and semiconductors. Miniature receiving tubes, magnetrons, <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes,</b> Geiger-Muller tubes, and large transmitting tubes were also manufactured at this location. This location became the headquarters for North American Philips (NAP). The factory {{was completed in}} 1953 and closed in 1989.

30|$|In summary, we have {{demonstrated}} a vacuum-sealed miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> based on CNT field-emission electron source. The <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> can be operated up to 70 kV, and high-dose X-rays are generated with a comparatively good spatial dose distribution. Due {{to the small}} electron beam size in the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> the prototype <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> can be further miniaturized.

5|$|After graduation, Kerst {{worked at}} General Electric Company for a year, {{working on the}} {{development}} of <b>x-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> and machines. He found this frustrating, as x-ray research required high energies that could not be produced at the time. In 1938 he accepted an offer of an instructorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where the head of the physics department, F. Wheeler Loomis encouraged Kerst in his efforts to create a better particle accelerator. The result of these efforts was the betatron. When it became operational on July 15, 1940, Kerst became the first person to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction, reaching energies of 2.3 MeV.|$|E
5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for X-rays, {{the oldest and}} {{still one of the}} most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes.</b> Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.|$|E
5|$|Niche uses {{of heavy}} metals with high atomic numbers occur in {{diagnostic}} imaging, electron microscopy, and nuclear science. In diagnostic imaging, heavy metals such as cobalt or tungsten {{make up the}} anode materials found in <b>x-ray</b> <b>tubes.</b> In electron microscopy, heavy metals such as lead, gold, palladium, platinum, or uranium are used to make conductive coatings and to introduce electron density into biological specimens by staining, negative staining, or vacuum deposition. In nuclear science, nuclei of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, or zinc are sometimes fired at other heavy metal targets to produce superheavy elements; heavy metals are also employed as spallation targets {{for the production of}} neutrons or radioisotopes such as astatine (using lead, bismuth, thorium, or uranium in the latter case).|$|E

An object holder (44) is designed to hold an object (26) to be investigated in the beam path of the x-ray radiation (16) that has been generated. A detector (30) is designed to detect a projection of the x-ray radiation with which said object is irradiated.

The diameter of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> is 10 mm; the total length of the tube is 50 mm, and no external vacuum pump {{is required for the}} operation. The maximum tube voltage reaches up to 70 kV, and the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> generates intense <b>X-rays</b> with the air kerma strength of 108 Gy·cm 2 min− 1.

40|$|A {{miniature}} <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> {{based on}} a carbon-nanotube electron emitter has been employed for the application to a dental radiography. The miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> has an outer diameter of 7  mm and a length of 47  mm. The miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> is operated in a negative high-voltage mode in which the X-ray target is electrically grounded. In addition, X-rays are generated only to the teeth directions using a collimator while X-rays generated to other directions are shielded. Hence, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> can be safely inserted into a human mouth. Using the intra-oral <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> a dental radiography is demonstrated where the positions of an X-ray source and a sensor are reversed compared with a conventional dental radiography system. X-ray images of five neighboring teeth are obtained and, furthermore, both left and right molar images are achieved by a single X-ray shot of the miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube...</b>|$|R
5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E
25|$|<b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are used}} in medical imaging among other uses. <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> used for continuous-duty {{operation}} in fluoroscopy and CT imaging equipment may use a focused cathode and a rotating anode to dissipate the large amounts of heat thereby generated.

40|$|An {{introduction}} to the fundamental concepts of X-ray physics and <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> design is given. This discussion also includes {{a brief description of}} various <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> types available commercially for a number of different industrial applications. The design of a high-energy MgO cold cathode <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> which is to be used in an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer, is described in detail with emphasis placed on the electron beam focusing mechanism and the theory of operation as well as the construction of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> MgO cold cathode, which functioned as the electron emitter of the device. A detailed account is also given of the output characteristics of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> power supply, which has a direct effect on the design requirements and consequently the performance ofthe <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube.</b> An investigation into the manufacture of the vacuum envelope with particular attention focused on the production of reliable metal-to-ceramic seals was performed. A number of tests were conducted especially with regard to the maximum temperature that such seals may withstand without becoming permanently damaged. These tests were essential, since high temperature gradients tend to develop in an <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> during operation, which the metal-to-cerarnic seals of the tube must be capable of withstanding if damage to the device is to be avoided. The set-up of the XRF spectrometer in which the completed <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> was tested is discussed, in which the X-ray current and voltage measuring techniques are described. Furthermore a detailed account of the operation of the X-ray detector system and the multichannel analyser is given, which was used to detect and record spectra of the sample elements excited by the primary radiation of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube.</b> Finally the measured <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> performance characteristics are discussed and compared to the predicted results...|$|R
30|$|Figure 2 b {{shows the}} dose rate of X-ray that is {{produced}} from the miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> and {{the stability of}} the dose rate with time. The dose rate was measured with an ionization chamber and an electrometer (PTW 34013 and Unidos-E both from PTW, Freiburg, Germany) at 1 cm apart from the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> in air. The air kerma strength of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> operating at 50 kV with the tube current of 252 μA was as high as 108.1 Gy·cm 2 min− 1, which is approximately 15 times higher than that of a 10 -Ci HDR 192 Ir radioisotope source [20] that is widely used for brachytherapy. The fluctuation of the X-ray dose rate was as low as ± 2.7 %. In addition, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> has worked for over 2 months with no significant change in the electron beam current (0.25 mA at 50 kV) and the X-ray dose rate. The <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> has been continuously operated for approximately 1 h/day. Consequently, the developed miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> produces high enough X-ray output and exhibits very good short-term and long-term stabilities.|$|R
50|$|An X-ray {{imaging system}} {{consists}} of a generator control console where the operator selects desired techniques to obtain a quality readable image(kVp, mA and exposure time), an x-ray generator which controls the <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> current, <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> kilovoltage and <b>x-ray</b> emitting exposure time, an <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> that converts the kilovoltage and mA into actual x-rays and an image detection system which can be either a film (analog technology) or a digital capture system and a PACS.|$|R
25|$|The many {{applications}} of X-rays immediately generated enormous interest. Workshops began making specialized versions of Crookes tubes for generating X-rays and these first-generation cold cathode or Crookes <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> were used until about 1920.|$|E
25|$|The Coolidge X-ray tube {{was invented}} during the {{following}} year by William D. Coolidge. It made possible the continuous emissions of X-rays. <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> similar to this are still in use in 2012.|$|E
25|$|A {{specialized}} {{source of}} X-rays which is becoming {{widely used in}} research is synchrotron radiation, which is generated by particle accelerators. Its unique features are X-ray outputs many orders of magnitude greater than those of <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes,</b> wide X-ray spectra, excellent collimation, and linear polarization.|$|E

50|$|Peak kilovoltage (kVp) is {{the maximum}} voltage applied across an <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube.</b> It determines the kinetic {{energy of the}} {{electrons}} accelerated in the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> and the peak energy of the X-ray emission spectrum.

25|$|This {{criterion}} assigns a photon to an unambiguous category, but is {{only possible}} if wavelength is known. (Some measurement techniques do {{not distinguish between}} detected wavelengths.) However, these two definitions often coincide since the electromagnetic radiation emitted by <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> generally has a longer wavelength and lower photon energy than the radiation emitted by radioactive nuclei.|$|E
25|$|So the {{resulting}} output of a tube {{consists of a}} continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum falling off to zero at the tube voltage, plus several spikes at the characteristic lines. The voltages used in diagnostic <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> range from roughly 20 kV to 150 kV and thus the highest energies of the X-ray photons range from roughly 20 keV to 150 keV.|$|E
25|$|Electrostatic {{machines}} are typically used in science classrooms to safely demonstrate electrical forces and high voltage phenomena. The elevated potential differences achieved have been {{also used for}} a variety of practical applications, such as operating <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes,</b> medical applications, sterilization of food, and nuclear physics experiments.

30|$|Figure 1 c,d show a {{photograph}} and an X-ray radiograph (XR) of the fabricated miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> which show the exterior {{and the interior}} of the tube, respectively. The diameter of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> is 10 mm, and the total length is 50 mm. The weight of the tube is only 14.5 g. All of the connection parts of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> are tightly vacuum-sealed. The both ends of the alumina ceramic tube were vacuum-brazed with a focusing electrode assembly and a connecting anode, respectively. Both electrodes were made of Kovar (Carpenter Technology Corporation, Reading, PA, USA) that has a similar thermal expansion coefficient to alumina. The connecting anode was used to interconnect a ceramic tube and a Be X-ray window that have different thermal expansion coefficients. The connecting anode and the Be window were also vacuum-brazed. All the components of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> were baked at 550 °C for 10 h, and subsequently, these were brazed through a single-step brazing process at 680 °C for 30 min in a vacuum furnace. Before the brazing process, electron emission and transport tests of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> have been carried out inside a vacuum chamber. The position of the cathode inside the focusing electrode could be finely controlled through this process. A non-evaporable getter film was installed around the focusing electrode to evacuate the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube.</b> The getter was activated during the brazing process. The outer part of the sealed <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> except the target, was covered with a layer of silicone resin to improve high-voltage insulation between the cathode and the X-ray target. We observed that the fabricated <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> was stably operated up to 70 kV without any high-voltage breakdown or discharge at both the inner vacuum side and the outer air side.|$|R

25|$|Being a {{differential}} phase technique, GBI {{is not as}} sensitive as crystal interferometry to low spatial frequencies, {{but because of the}} high resistance of the method against mechanical instabilities, the possibility of using detectors with large pixels and a large field of view and, of crucial importance, the applicability to conventional laboratory <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes,</b> grating-based imaging is a very promising technique for medical diagnostics and soft tissue imaging.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} before, for {{the formation}} of the Fresnel fringes, the constraint on the spatial coherence of the used radiation is very strict, which limits the method to small or very distant sources, but in contrast to crystal interferometry and analyzer-based imaging the constraint on the temporal coherence, i.e. the polychromaticity is quite relaxed. Consequently, the method cannot only be used with synchrotron sources but also with polycromatic laboratory X-ray sources providing sufficient spatial coherence, such as microfocus <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|E
