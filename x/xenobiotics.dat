5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called <b>xenobiotics.</b> <b>Xenobiotics</b> such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of <b>xenobiotics</b> than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe nuclear {{receptor}}s pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) were cloned and/or {{established as}} <b>xenobiotic</b> receptors in 1998. Due to their {{activities in the}} transcriptional regulation of phase I and phase II enzymes as well as drug transporters, PXR and CAR have been defined as the master regulators of <b>xenobiotic</b> responses. The discovery of PXR and CAR provides the essential molecular basis by which drugs and other <b>xenobiotic</b> compounds regulate the expression of <b>xenobiotic</b> enzymes and transporters. This article is intended to provide a historical overview on the discovery of PXR and CAR as <b>xenobiotic</b> receptors...|$|R

25|$|Drugs {{continue}} to {{be taken off the}} market due to late discovery of hepatotoxicity. Due to its unique metabolism and close relationship with the gastrointestinal tract, the liver is susceptible to injury from drugs and other substances. 75% of blood coming to the liver arrives directly from gastrointestinal organs and then spleen via portal veins that bring drugs and <b>xenobiotics</b> in near-undiluted form. Several mechanisms are responsible for either inducing hepatic injury or worsening the damage process.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{number of}} <b>xenobiotic</b> {{carboxylic}} acids, including 3 -phenoxybenzoic acid (3 PBA), {{have been shown}} to form ‘hybrid” di- and tri-acylglycerols both in vivo and in vitro. Experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis that naturally occurring <b>xenobiotic</b> diacylglycerols may stimulate protein kinase C. The activity of protein kinase C was measured in the presence of different diacylglycerols. 1 -Acyl- 2 -(3 PBA) -sn-glycerol but not l, 2 -di- 3 PBA-sn-glycerol stimulated protein kinase C, but less effectively than either dioleoylglycerol or phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate. The <b>xenobiotic</b> diacylglycerols were also more resistant to lipolysis. The possibility exists therefore that some <b>xenobiotic</b> diacylglycerols may behave, like phorbol diesters, as tumour promoters.

40|$|The steroid and <b>xenobiotic</b> {{receptor}} (SXR) (also {{known as}} pregnane X receptor or PXR) is a nuclear hormone receptor activated by a {{diverse array of}} endogenous hormones, dietary steroids, pharmaceutical agents, and <b>xenobiotic</b> compounds. SXR has an enlarged, flexible, hydrophobic ligand binding domain (LBD) which is remarkably divergent across mammalian species and SXR exhibits considerable differences in its pharmacology among mammals. The broad response profile of SXR {{has led to the}} development of "the steroid and <b>xenobiotic</b> sensor hypothesis". SXR has been established as a <b>xenobiotic</b> sensor that coordinately regulates <b>xenobiotic</b> clearance in the liver and intestine via induction of genes involved in drug and <b>xenobiotic</b> metabolism. In the past few years, research has revealed new and mostly unsuspected roles for SXR in modulating inflammation, bone homeostasis, vitamin D metabolism, lipid homeostasis, energy homeostasis and cancer. The identification of SXR as a <b>xenobiotic</b> sensor has provided an important tool for studying new mechanisms through which diet, chemical exposure, and environment ultimately impact health and disease. The discovery and pharmacological development of new PXR modulators might represent an interesting and innovative therapeutic approach to combat various diseases...|$|R
40|$|Background: The liver is {{the central}} organ for <b>xenobiotic</b> {{metabolism}} (XM) and is regulated by nuclear receptors such as CAR and PXR, which control the metabolism of drugs. Here we report that gut microbiota influences liver gene expression and alters <b>xenobiotic</b> metabolism in animals exposed to barbiturates. Principal findings: By comparing hepatic gene expression on microarrays from germfree (GF) and conventionally-raised mice (SPF), we identified a cluster of 112 differentially expressed target genes predominantly connected to <b>xenobiotic</b> metabolism and pathways inhibiting RXR function. These findings were functionally validated by exposing GF and SPF mice to pentobarbital which confirmed that <b>xenobiotic</b> metabolism in GF mice is significantly more efficient (shorter time of anesthesia) {{when compared to the}} SPF group. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that gut microbiota modulates hepatic gene expression and function by altering its <b>xenobiotic</b> response to drugs without direct contact with the liver...|$|R
25|$|Endocrine {{disruption}} as a mode {{of action}} for <b>xenobiotics</b> was brought into awareness by Our Stolen Future by Theo Colborn. Endocrine disrupting chemicals are known to accumulate in body tissue and are highly persistent in the environment. Many toxicants are known EDCs including pesticides, phthalates, phytoestrogens, some industrial/commercial products, and pharmaceuticals. These chemicals are known to cause endocrine disruption via a few different mechanisms. While the mechanism associated with the thyroid hormone receptor is not well understood, two more established mechanisms involve the inhibition of the androgen receptor and activation of the estrogen receptor.|$|E
25|$|The aging {{red blood}} cell {{undergoes}} changes in its plasma membrane, making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocyte system (spleen, liver and lymph nodes), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This process is termed eryptosis, {{red blood cell}} programmed cell death. This process normally occurs {{at the same rate}} of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating red blood cell count. Eryptosis is increased {{in a wide variety of}} diseases including sepsis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, malaria, sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, phosphate depletion, iron deficiency and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, energy depletion as well as a wide variety of endogenous mediators and <b>xenobiotics.</b> Excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. Inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin, nitric oxide, catecholamines and high concentrations of urea.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} nuclear receptors, {{referred}} to as orphan receptors, have no known (or at least generally agreed upon) endogenous ligands. [...] Some of these receptors such as FXR, LXR, and PPAR bind a number of metabolic intermediates such as fatty acids, bile acids and/or sterols with relatively low affinity. [...] These receptors hence may function as metabolic sensors. [...] Other nuclear receptors, such as CAR and PXR appear to function as xenobiotic sensors up-regulating the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize these <b>xenobiotics.</b>|$|E
50|$|The exact {{compounds}} {{an organism}} {{is exposed to}} will be largely unpredictable, and may differ widely over time; these are major characteristics of <b>xenobiotic</b> toxic stress. The major challenge faced by <b>xenobiotic</b> detoxification systems is {{that they must be}} able to remove the almost-limitless number of <b>xenobiotic</b> compounds from the complex mixture of chemicals involved in normal metabolism. The solution that has evolved to address this problem is an elegant combination of physical barriers and low-specificity enzymatic systems.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated {{transcription}} {{factors that}} regulate {{the expression of}} their target genes. NRs play important roles in many human diseases, including metabolic diseases and cancer, {{and are therefore a}} key class of therapeutic targets. Steroids play important roles in regulating nuclear receptors; in addition to being ligands of steroid receptors, steroids (and their metabolites) also regulate other NRs, such as the pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstane receptor (termed <b>xenobiotic</b> receptors), which participate in steroid metabolism. <b>Xenobiotic</b> receptors have promiscuous ligand-binding properties, and their structurally diverse ligands include steroids and their metabolites. Therefore, steroids, their metabolism and metabolites, <b>xenobiotic</b> receptors, steroid receptors, and the respective signaling pathways they regulate have functional interactions. This review discusses these functional interactions and their implications for activities mediated by steroid receptors and <b>xenobiotic</b> receptors, focusing on steroids that modulate pathways involving the pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstane receptor. The emphasis of the review is on structure-function studies of <b>xenobiotic</b> receptors bound to steroid ligands...|$|R
50|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) {{is involved in the}} induction of several enzymes that participate in <b>xenobiotic</b> metabolism. The ligand-free, cytosolic form of the {{aryl hydrocarbon}} receptor is complexed to heat shock protein 90. Binding of ligand, which includes dioxin and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, results in translocation of the ligand-binding subunit only to the nucleus. Induction of enzymes involved in <b>xenobiotic</b> metabolism occurs through binding of the ligand-bound AhR to <b>xenobiotic</b> responsive elements in the promoters of genes for these enzymes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{human body}} {{identifies}} almost all drugs as foreign substances (i.e. <b>xenobiotics)</b> and subjects them to various chemical processes (i.e. metabolism) {{to make them}} suitable for elimination. This involves chemical transformations to (a) reduce fat solubility and (b) to change biological activity. Although almost all tissues in the body have some ability to metabolize chemicals, smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the liver is the principal [...] "metabolic clearing house" [...] for both endogenous chemicals (e.g., cholesterol, steroid hormones, [...] fatty acids, proteins) and exogenous substances (e.g., drugs, alcohol). The central role played by liver in the clearance and transformation of chemicals makes it susceptible to drug-induced injury.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between some gut flora and humans {{is not merely}} commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather a mutualistic relationship. Some human gut microorganisms benefit the host by fermenting dietary fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetic acid and butyric acid, which are then absorbed by the host. [...] Intestinal bacteria {{also play a role}} in synthesizing vitamin B and vitamin K as well as metabolizing bile acids, sterols, and <b>xenobiotics.</b> [...] The systemic importance of the SCFAs and other compounds they produce are like hormones and the gut flora itself appears to function like an endocrine organ, and dysregulation of the gut flora has been correlated with a host of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.|$|E
2500|$|ESI {{interface}} for LC-MS systems {{was developed}} by Fenn and collaborators in 1988. This ion source/ interface [...] {{can be used for}} the analysis of moderately polar molecules (e.g., metabolites, <b>xenobiotics,</b> and peptides). The liquid eluate coming out of the LC column is pumped through a metal capillary kept at 3 to 5 kV. The liquid is nebulized {{at the tip of the}} capillary and a fine spray of charged droplets is formed. To avoid contamination, this capillary is usually perpendicularly located at the inlet of the MS system. The heat created by the electric potential is used to rapidly evaporate the droplets in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Later, the ionized analytes are transferred into the high vacuum chamber of the MS as the charged ions flow through a series of small apertures with the aid of focusing voltages. Positively and negatively charged ions can be detected and it is possible to switch between the negative and positive modes of operation. Most ions produced in the ESI interface are multiply charged. The use of 1–3nbsp&mm ID microbore columns is recommended for LC-MS systems using electrospray ionization (ESI) interfaces because optimal operation [...] is achieved with flow rates in the 50-200 μl/min range.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was created to}} examine how <b>xenobiotic</b> ligands that bind to nuclear receptor proteins may affect transcriptional activation of hormone-regulated genes. The model included binding of the natural ligand (e. g. hormone) and <b>xenobiotic</b> ligands to the receptor, binding of the liganded receptor to receptor-specific DNA response sequences, binding of co-activator or co-repressor proteins (Rp) to the resulting complex, and the consequent transcriptional rate relative {{to that in the}} absence of the <b>xenobiotic</b> agent. The model predicted that the <b>xenobiotic</b> could act as a pure agonist, a pure antagonist, or a mixed agonist whose dose–response curve exhibits a local maximum. The response to the agent depends on the affinity of the liganded receptor–DNA complex for binding additional transcription factors (e. g. co-activator proteins). An inverted U-shaped dose–response occurred when basal levels of the natural ligand did not saturate receptor binding sites and the affinity for co-activator is weaker when the <b>xenobiotic</b> ligand is bound to the receptor than when the endogenous ligand is bound. The dose–response curve shape was not dependent on the affinity of the receptor for the <b>xenobiotic</b> agent; alteration of this value merely shifted the curve along the concentration axis. The amount of receptor, the density of DNA response sequences, and the affinity of the DNA-bound receptor for Rp determine the amplitude of the computed response with little overall change in curve shape. This model indicates that a non-monotonic dose–response is a plausible outcome for <b>xenobiotic</b> agents that activate nuclear receptors in the same manner as natural ligands...|$|R
50|$|The {{metabolism}} of <b>xenobiotics</b> {{is often}} {{divided into three}} phases:- modification, conjugation, and excretion. These reactions act in concert to detoxify <b>xenobiotics</b> and remove them from cells.|$|E
50|$|The body removes <b>{{xenobiotic}}s</b> by xenobiotic metabolism. This {{consists of}} the deactivation and the excretion of <b>xenobiotics,</b> and happens mostly in the liver. Excretion routes are urine, feces, breath, and sweat. Hepatic enzymes {{are responsible for the}} metabolism of <b>xenobiotics</b> by first activating them (oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and/or hydration of the xenobiotic), and then conjugating the active secondary metabolite with glucuronic acid, sulphuric acid, or glutathione, followed by excretion in bile or urine. An example of a group of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism is hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450. These enzymes that metabolize <b>xenobiotics</b> are very important for the pharmaceutical industry, because they are responsible for the breakdown of medications.|$|E
