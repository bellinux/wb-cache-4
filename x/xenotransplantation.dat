5|$|<b>Xenotransplantation</b> {{research}} involves transplanting tissues or organs {{from one}} species to another, {{as a way}} to overcome the shortage of human organs for use in organ transplants. Current research involves using primates as the recipients of organs from pigs that have been genetically modified to reduce the primates' immune response against the pig tissue. Although transplant rejection remains a problem, recent clinical trials that involved implanting pig insulin-secreting cells into diabetics did reduce these people's need for insulin.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUbiquitous gene {{expression}} has {{a variety of}} applications in transgenesis that include, for example cell lineage analyses in chimeras and gain-of-function related to <b>xenotransplantations.</b> Although several promoters have already been used to these aims, they often do not reliably or reproducibly target {{gene expression}} in mice. We have recently reported the site-independent expression of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) -derived goat alpha-lactalbumin transgene in the mammary gland of mice and the subsequent localisation within the insert of this BAC of the cyclin T 1 locus. This ubiquitously expressed gene encodes for a protein that acts as a co-factor for the HIV nuclear transcriptional activator. In the present paper, we report that the goat BAC transgene, which encompasses around 30 kb of the cyclin T 1 promoter, also confers ubiquitous expression of this gene in the six transgenic mouse lines analysed. These results suggest that the cyclin T 1 promoter could be a useful alternative to target ubiquitous gene expression in transgenics...|$|R
40|$|In various {{vertebrate}} species, the dorsal aorta (Ao) is {{the site}} of specification of adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). It has been observed that the upregulation of essential hematopoietic transcription factors and the formation of specific intra-aortic hematopoietic cell clusters occur predominantly in the ventral domain of the Ao (AoV). In the mouse, the first HSCs emerge in the AoV. Here, we demonstrate that in the human embryo the first definitive HSCs also emerge asymmetrically and are localized to the AoV, which thus identifies a functional niche for developing human HSCs. Using magnetic cell separation and <b>xenotransplantations,</b> we show that the first human HSCs are CD 34 +VE-cadherin+CD 45 +C-KIT+THY- 1 +Endoglin+RUNX 1 +CD 38 −/loCD 45 RA−. This population harbors practically all committed hematopoietic progenitors and is underrepresented in the dorsal domain of the Ao (AoD) and urogenital ridges (UGRs).

Eltrombopag is a small molecule thrombopoietin receptor agonist {{that might be a}} new option to treat thrombocytopenia in these diseases, provided that it does not stimulate malignant hematopoiesis. In this work, we studied the effects of Eltrombopag on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, colony formation, and malignant self-renewal of bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients with AML and MDS. Malignant bone marrow mononuclear cells did not show increased proliferation, or increased clonogenic capacity at concentrations of Eltrombopag ranging from 0. 1 to 30 μg/mL. On the contrary, we observed a moderate, statistically nonsignificant (P =. 18), decrease of numbers of malignant cells (mean, 56 %; SD, 28 %). Eltrombopag neither led to increased 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine incorporation, decreased apoptosis, an increase of malignant self-renewal, nor enhanced in vivo engraftment in <b>xenotransplantations.</b> Furthermore, we found that Eltrombopag was capable of increasing megakaryocytic differentiation and formation of normal megakaryocytic colonies in patients with AML and MDS.

40|$|Taking Sweden {{into the}} future – Bio-objectification of new medical {{technology}} In this article, we analyze how contemporary discursive silences around new biotechnologies such as cybrids and {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSC), have been enabled by earlier policy processes in the area, e. g. boundary work around what is human and non-human, living and non-living, subject and object. The analysis of policy processes around <b>xenotransplantations</b> and the use of human embryonic stem cells, shows that the stem cells’ and xenografts’ “bio-identities” become stabilized through high expectations for the future, a lack of therapeutic possibilities and struggles over definitions of life. The policy processes around human embryonic stem cells and organs from other animals, are characterized by a normalization of certain understandings of ”life”, trust in scientific progress and it’s national financial potentials and a categorization of criticism as irrational. Through these “bio-objectification processes”, debate and decision making has been moved from a political and public context into ethical committees and research funding bodies. The article concludes by discussing consequences of this political non-handling of biomedical technologies and how these bioobjects could be re-politicized.

40|$|We have {{isolated}} and characterised two divergent simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLV), not {{belonging to the}} established human and simian T-lymphotropic virus lineages HTLV- 1 /STLV- 1 and HTLV- 2. STLV-L, from an Eritrean sacred baboon (Papio hamadryas), has been typed as a third type of simian T-lymphotropic virus, distinct from HTLV- 1 /STLV- 1 and HTLV- 2. The other virus, isolated from Congolese bonobos (Pan paniscus), is a distinct member of the HTLV- 2 clade and has been designated STLV- 2. The isolation of these two simian viruses shows that the spectrum of HTLVs/STLVs is larger than previously expected. Our data indicate that the two lineages STLV-L and HTLV- 2 /STLV- 2 are of African origin, while the HTLV- 1 /STLV- 1 lineage {{has been shown to}} be of Asian origin. These data, together with our phylogenetic analyses, suggest an African origin of the HTLV/STLV ancestor, which provides new clues about virus dissemination. Furthermore, the atypical serological profiles exhibited by STLV-L or STLV- 2 infected animals in western blot, raise questions about the efficiency of current screening methods to type highly divergent HTLVs/STLVs. Considering the growing interest in <b>xenotransplantations,</b> more epidemiological and biological knowledge of simian and human T-lymphotropic viruses is necessary to estimate the risk of interspecies transmissions. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Transgenes {{may soon}} be used for <b>xenotransplantation</b> from pig organs. Through the study of xeno-organ {{rejection}}, {{it was found that}} an acute rejection of the transplanted organ occurs upon the organ's contact with blood from the recipient due to the recognition of foreign antibodies on endothelial cells of the transplanted organ. Scientists have identified the antigen in pigs that causes this reaction, and therefore are able to transplant the organ without immediate rejection by removal of the antigen. However, the antigen begins to be expressed later on, and rejection occurs. Therefore, further research is being conducted.|$|E
5000|$|Endogenous retroviruses are {{remnants}} of ancient viral infections, {{found in the}} genomes of most, if not all, mammalian species. Integrated into the chromosomal DNA, they are vertically transferred through inheritance. Due to the many deletions and mutations they accumulate over time, they usually are not infectious in the host species, however the virus may become infectious in another species. PERVS were originally discovered as retrovirus particles released from cultured porcine kidney cells. Most breeds of swine harbor approximately 50 PERV genomes in their DNA. Although {{it is likely that}} most of these are defective, some may be able to produce infectious viruses so every proviral genome must be sequenced to identify which ones pose a threat. In addition, through complementation and genetic recombination, two defective PERV genomes could give rise to an infectious virus. There are three subgroups of infectious PERVs (PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C). Experiments have shown that PERV-A and PERV-B can infect human cells in culture. To date no experimental <b>xenotransplantations</b> have demonstrated PERV transmission, yet this does not mean PERV infections in humans are impossible. [...] Pig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 PERVs in the genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.|$|R
40|$|Inbred mini-pigs {{are ideal}} organ donors for future human <b>xenotransplantations</b> {{because of their}} clear genetic background, high homozygosity, and high {{inbreeding}} endurance. In this study, we chose fibroblast cells from a highly inbred pig line called Banna mini-pig inbred line (BMI) as donor nuclei for nuclear transfer, combining with transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and successfully generated α- 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase (GGTA 1) gene biallelic knockout (KO) pigs. To validate the efficiency of TALEN vectors, in vitro-transcribed TALEN mRNAs were microinjected into one-cell stage parthenogenetically activated porcine embryos. The efficiency of indel mutations at the GGTA 1 -targeting loci was as high as 73. 1 % (19 / 26) among the parthenogenetic blastocysts. TALENs were co-transfected into porcine fetal fibroblasts of BMI with a plasmid containing neomycin gene. The targeting efficiency reached 89. 5 % (187 / 209) among the survived cell clones after a 10 d selection. More remarkably 27. 8 % (58 / 209) of colonies were biallelic KO. Five fibroblast cell lines with biallelic KO were chosen as nuclear donors for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Three miniature piglets with biallelic mutations of the GGTA 1 gene were achieved. Gal epitopes {{on the surface of}} cells from all the three biallelic KO piglets were completely absent.
