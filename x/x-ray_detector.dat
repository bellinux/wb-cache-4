40|$|AbstractThe lack of {{efficient}} <b>x-ray</b> <b>detectors</b> {{is often}} the main factor limiting the effective use of ever more powerful synchrotron light sources. Spectroscopic <b>X-ray</b> <b>detectors</b> are used {{for a wide variety}} of synchrotron experiments including X-ray micro/nano-probes and X-ray absorption spectroscopy for biology and geophysical applications. The current state-of-art spectroscopic <b>X-ray</b> <b>detectors</b> are semiconductor devices, and their energy resolutions are approaching their theoretical limit of about 100 eV at 6 keV. We describe a detector research and development program to develop the next-generation of high-resolution spectroscopic <b>X-ray</b> <b>detectors</b> using superconducting Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs). With a required energy per charge carrier four orders of magnitude smaller than that of Si, superconducting detectors offer up to two orders of magnitude increase in energy resolution. In addition, KIDs can be optimized for detection of photons ranging in energy from hard X-ray to IR...|$|R

25|$|<b>X-ray</b> <b>detector</b> All plasma loses {{energy by}} {{emitting}} light. This covers the whole spectrum: visible, IR, UV, and X-rays. This occurs anytime a particle changes speed, for any reason. If {{the reason is}} deflection by a magnetic field, the radiation is Cyclotron radiation at low speeds and Synchrotron radiation at high speeds. If the reason is deflection by another particle, plasma radiates X-rays, known as Bremsstrahlung radiation. X-rays are termed in both hard and soft, based on their energy.|$|E
25|$|In CT, an X-ray tube {{opposite}} an <b>X-ray</b> <b>detector</b> (or detectors) in a ring-shaped apparatus rotate {{around a}} patient, producing a computer-generated cross-sectional image (tomogram). CT is {{acquired in the}} axial plane, with coronal and sagittal images produced by computer reconstruction. Radiocontrast agents are often used with CT for enhanced delineation of anatomy. Although radiographs provide higher spatial resolution, CT can detect more subtle variations in attenuation of X-rays (higher contrast resolution). CT exposes the patient to significantly more ionizing radiation than a radiograph.|$|E
25|$|Phase-contrast X-ray imaging (PCI) or phase-sensitive X-ray imaging is {{a general}} term for {{different}} technical methods that use information concerning changes in the phase of an X-ray beam that passes through an object {{in order to create}} its images. Standard X-ray imaging techniques like radiography or computed tomography (CT) rely on a decrease of the X-ray beam's intensity (attenuation) when traversing the sample, which can be measured directly with the assistance of an <b>X-ray</b> <b>detector.</b> In PCI however, the beam's phase shift caused by the sample is not measured directly, but is transformed into variations in intensity, which then can be recorded by the detector.|$|E

25|$|Different views (also {{known as}} projections) {{of the chest}} can be {{obtained}} by changing the relative orientation of the body and the direction of the x-ray beam. The most common views are posteroanterior, anteroposterior, and lateral. In an posteroanterior (PA) view, the x-ray source is positioned so that the x-ray beam enters through the posterior (back) aspect of the chest, and exits out of the anterior (front) aspect where the beam is detected. To obtain this view, the patient stands facing a flat surface behind which is an <b>x-ray</b> <b>detector.</b> A radiation source is positioned behind the patient at a standard distance (most often 6 feet, 1,8m), and the x-ray beam is fired toward the patient.|$|E
25|$|Crystal interferometry, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} X-ray interferometry, {{is the oldest}} but also the most complex method used for experimental realization. It consists of three beam splitters in Laue geometry aligned parallel to each other. (See figure to the right) The incident beam, which usually is collimated and filtered by a monochromator (Bragg crystal) before, is split at the first crystal (S) by Laue diffraction into two coherent beams, a reference beam which remains undisturbed and a beam passing through the sample. The second crystal (T) acts as a transmission mirror and causes the beams to converge one towards another. The two beams meet at {{the plane of the}} third crystal (A), which is sometimes called, the analyzer crystal, and create an interference pattern the form of which depends on the optical path difference between the two beams caused by the sample. This interference pattern is detected with an <b>X-ray</b> <b>detector</b> behind the analyzer crystal.|$|E

2500|$|Then on 10 July 2005, JAXA {{was finally}} able to launch a new X-ray {{astronomy}} mission named Suzaku (ASTRO-EII). This launch was important for JAXA, because in the five years since the launch failure of the original ASTRO-E satellite, Japan was without an x-ray telescope. [...] Three instruments were included in this satellite: an X-ray spectrometer (XRS), an X-ray imaging spectrometer (XIS), and a hard <b>X-ray</b> <b>detector</b> (HXD).

2500|$|Propagation-based imaging (PBI) is {{the most}} common name for this {{technique}} but it is also called [...] in-line holography, refraction-enhanced imaging [...] or phase-contrast radiography. The latter denomination derives {{from the fact that the}} experimental setup of this method is basically the same as in conventional radiography. It consists of an in-line arrangement of an X-ray source, the sample and an <b>X-ray</b> <b>detector</b> and no other optical elements are required. The only difference is that the detector is not placed immediately behind the sample, but in some distance, so the radiation refracted by the sample can interfere with the unchanged beam.|$|E

An derivative technique from projectional radiography used in dental radiography is orthopantomography.
