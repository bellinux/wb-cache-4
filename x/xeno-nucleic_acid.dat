Whether similar structures can be formed from <b>xeno-nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (XNA) polymers with a shorter backbone repeat unit is an unanswered question with significant implications on the fold space of functional XNA polymers. Here, {{we examine the}} potential for TNA (α-l-threofuranosyl nucleic acid) to adopt a four-stranded helical structure based on a planar G-quartet motif. Using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), circular dichroism (CD) and solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that despite a backbone repeat unit that is one atom shorter than the backbone repeat unit found in DNA and RNA, TNA can self-assemble into stable G-quadruplex structures that are similar in thermal stability to equivalent DNA structures. However, unlike DNA, TNA {{does not appear to}} discriminate between Na+ and K+ ions, as G-quadruplex structures form equally well in the presence of either ion. Together, these findings demonstrate that despite a shorter backbone repeat unit, TNA is capable of self-assembling into stable G-quadruplex structures...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a common}} {{interest}} for studying <b>xeno-nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> systems {{in the fields of}} synthetic biology and the origin of life, in particular, those with an engineered backbone and possessing novel properties. Along this line, we have investigated xylonucleic acid (Xy-loNA) containing a potentially prebiotic xylose sugar (a 3 ′-epimer of ribose) in its backbone. Herein, we report {{for the first time the}} synthesis of four Xy-loNA nucleotide building blocks and the assembly of XyloNA oligonucleotides containing all the natu-ral nucleobases. A detailed investigation of pairing and structural properties of XyloNAs in comparison to DNA/RNA has been performed by thermal UV-melting, CD, and solution state NMR spectroscopic studies. XyloNA has been shown to be an orthogo-nal self-pairing system which adopts a slightly right-handed extended helical geometry. Our study on one hand, provides understanding for superior structure-function (-pairing) properties of DNA/RNA over Xy-loNA for selection as an informational polymer in the prebiotic context, while on the other hand, finds po-tential of XyloNA as an orthogonal genetic system for application in synthetic biology...|$|E
40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2009. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Biotechnology has empirically established {{that it is}} easier to construct and evaluate variant genes and proteins than to account for the emergence and function of wild-type macromolecules. Systematizing this constructive approach, synthetic biology now promises to infer and assemble entirely novel genomes, cells and ecosystems. It is argued here that the theoretical and computational tools needed for this endeavor are missing altogether. However, such tools may not be required for diversifying organisms at the basic level of their chemical constitution by adding, substituting or removing elements and molecular components through directed evolution under selection. Most importantly, chemical diversification of life forms could be designed to block metabolic cross-feed and genetic crosstalk between synthetic and wild species and hence protect natural habitats and human health through novel types of containment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{plausible}} {{release of}} deeply engineered or even entirely synthetic/artificial microorganisms raises {{the issue of}} their intentional (e. g. bioremediation) or accidental interaction with the Environment. Containment systems designed in the 1980 s– 1990 s for limiting the spread of genetically engineered bacteria and their recombinant traits are still applicable to contemporary Synthetic Biology constructs. Yet, the ease of DNA synthesis and the uncertainty on how non-natural properties and strains could interplay with the existing biological word poses yet again the challenge of designing safe and efficacious firewalls to curtail possible interactions. Such barriers may include <b>xeno-nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> (XNAs) instead of DNA as information-bearing molecules, rewriting the genetic code to make it non-understandable by the existing gene expression machineries, and/or making growth dependent on xenobiotic chemicals...|$|R
