50|$|Anabasis {{articulata}} is a plant of {{the genus}} Anabasis. It a salt-tolerant <b>xerophyte</b> that {{is found in the}} Syrian desert. Bedouins often use the plant's ashes as a soap substitute. The plant is also known by its medical properties. Algerian traditional medicine practitioners use the plants leaves to make anti-diabetic decoction.|$|E
50|$|Thymus moroderi is a <b>xerophyte</b> plant which {{thrives in}} areas with a total annual {{precipitation}} of 300mm and less, as recorded {{in the southern part}} of the Alicante province and contiguous areas in Murcia. It also shows a preference for otherwise extremely poor soils, especially those showing traces of gypsum.|$|E
50|$|Most wild {{lettuces}} are <b>xerophytes,</b> {{adapted to}} dry habitat types. Some occur in more moist areas, {{such as the}} mountains of central Africa.|$|R
50|$|The flora is {{characterized}} by <b>xerophytes.</b> The fauna includes species such as hares,puma, viscachas, Elegant Crested Tinamous, guanacos, various forest birds and silversides.|$|R

50|$|An easily cultivated, {{fast growing}} {{epiphyte}} or <b>xerophyte.</b> Needs a compost containing plenty of humus and sufficient moisture in summer. It {{should not be}} kept under 10 °C (50 °F) in winter. Can be grown in semi-shade or full sun. Extra light {{in the early spring}} will stimulate budding. Flowers in summer or autumn.|$|E
50|$|The {{coniferous}} zone {{reaches up}} to 2200 m in altitude, {{making it the}} highest limit of tree vegetation. These forests are composed of black pine, white spruce, and black spruce. Coniferous forests are dense, and the plant cover is composed of kserofile (<b>xerophyte)</b> vegetation that favours fungi growth. Herbaceous plants include Fiershqipja (Pteridophyte), strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from its}} {{geological}} features, the reserve is home for <b>Xerophyte</b> plant life comprising many plant species. Animal species are also {{noted in the}} reserve. The endemic animal species recorded are Skink Désirade, the Gaïac, and Iguana Lesser Antilles (Iguana delicatissima). There are also few Green Iguana (Iguana iguana), considered an invasive species which needs to be excluded from the reserve.|$|E
50|$|Coopernookia is a {{plant genus}} of {{understory}} <b>xerophytes</b> and mesophytes in the Goodeniaceae family. Species are distributed in south, southwestern, and southeastern Australia. Some species are threatened with habitat loss.|$|R
5000|$|Ecological area - {{two rows}} of hardy aquatic plants, and {{selected}} species grouped by ecological adaptations, such as monoecious and dioecious flowers, dune plants, lianas, rhizomes, salt plants, root climbers, <b>xerophytes,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|Xerophytic {{plants can}} have less overall surface area than other plants, so {{reducing}} {{the area that}} is exposed to the air and reducing water loss by evaporation. <b>Xerophytes</b> can have smaller leaves or fewer branches than other plants. An example of leaf surface reduction are the spines of a cactus. An example of compaction and reduction of branching are the barrel cacti. Other <b>xerophytes</b> may have their leaves compacted at the base, as in a basal rosette, which may be smaller than the plant's flower. This adaptation is exhibited by some Agave and Eriogonum species, {{which can be found}} growing near Death Valley.|$|R
5000|$|Cucurbita galeottii is a {{plant species}} of the genus Cucurbita. It is native to Oaxaca, Mexico. It has not been domesticated. There is very little known about this species. Nee reports that the species is a <b>xerophyte</b> and that Bailey only saw the species in photographs. It is only known from {{specimens}} that [...] "lack roots, female flowers, fruits and seeds".|$|E
50|$|The carob genus, Ceratonia, {{belongs to}} the Fabaceae (legume) family, and is {{believed}} to be an archaic remnant of a part of this family now generally considered extinct. It grows well in warm temperate and subtropical areas, and tolerates hot and humid coastal areas. As a <b>xerophyte</b> (drought-resistant) species, carob is well adapted to the ecological conditions of the Mediterranean region with 250 to 500 mm of rainfall per year.|$|E
50|$|It {{can reach}} a height up to 3 m. The leaves are oval shaped {{and due to}} its <b>xerophyte</b> adaptations it is {{leathery}} on the underparts. Also stipules are present. The petals are between 5 and 6 cm and they grow asymmetrically. They are bell-shaped and the coloring is dark red with a white background. The capsule is globular and contains up to 10 black seeds. The flowering time is from June to October.|$|E
50|$|They are {{commonly}} thorny, with simple leaves often coated with tiny scales or hairs. Most {{of the species}} are <b>xerophytes</b> (found in dry habitats); several are also halophytes, tolerating high levels of soil salinity.|$|R
5000|$|Peperomia columella is {{a species}} of plant in the Piperaceae family. The species is endemic to deserts of western South America. It is fairly unusual among <b>xerophytes</b> from outside Africa, in having leaf windows.|$|R
5000|$|A general {{definition}} of succulents {{is that they}} are drought resistant plants in which the leaves, stem or roots have become more than usually fleshy by the development of water-storing tissue. Other sources exclude roots as in the definition [...] "a plant with thick, fleshy and swollen stems and/or leaves, adapted to dry environments." [...] This difference affects the relationship between succulents and [...] "geophytes" [...] - plants that survive unfavorable seasons as a resting bud on an underground organ. These underground organs, such as bulbs, corms and tubers, are often fleshy with water-storing tissues. Thus if roots are included in the definition, many geophytes would be classed as succulents. Plants adapted to living in dry environments such as succulents are termed <b>xerophytes.</b> However, not all <b>xerophytes</b> are succulents, since there are other ways of adapting to a shortage of water, e.g., by developing small leaves which may roll up or having leathery rather than succulent leaves. Nor are all succulents <b>xerophytes,</b> since plants like Crassula helmsii are both succulent and aquatic.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Xerophyte</b> - A {{plant that}} {{is able to}} grow where the water supply is small. Xerophytes are plants {{that are able to}} control the loss of water from their aërial parts. Xerophytes employ many {{different}} tools to control the loss of water, such as; waxy deposits, varnish, or mineral crusts on the epidermis; reduction of air spaces; storage organs; thick-walled epidermis; and cork in woody plants. Some xerophytes are annual plants that grow quickly during the rainy season.|$|E
50|$|Another notable {{species is}} milfoil (Achillea tenuifolia) which usually grows up to 80 cm. This species {{is very common}} for <b>xerophyte</b> {{associations}} of the Ararat plain, particularly in sandy semi-desert. Native communities collect milfoil and use it for preparation of food. Milfoil is usually surrounded by numerous ant hills. Ants are vitally tied to this {{as well as other}} sand species. Links between ants and myrmecophilous species (Euphorbia marschalliana, Oligochaeta divaricata, Ziziphora tenuior, Z. persica, etc.) are not yet fully understood.|$|E
50|$|Drought {{tolerance}} {{refers to}} {{the degree to which}} a plant is adapted to arid or drought conditions. Desiccation tolerance is an extreme degree of drought tolerance. Plants naturally adapted to dry conditions are called <b>xerophytes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{characteristic}} vegetation in {{the terrestrial}} zone is drought-adapted flora: largely agave, prickly pear, dwarf fan palms, {{and a number}} of <b>xerophytes</b> (some of which are endemic). There is Posidonia seagrass in the marine zone.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>xerophytes</b> have tiny {{hairs on}} their surface {{to provide a}} wind break and reduce air flow, thereby {{reducing}} the rate of evaporation. When a plant surface is covered with tiny hairs, it is called tomentose.|$|R
