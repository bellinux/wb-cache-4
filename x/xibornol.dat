50|$|<b>Xibornol</b> is a {{lipophilic}} drug mainly used in Italy and Spain in spray dosage {{forms for}} the local treatment of infection and inflammation of the throat. Its poor water solubility makes difficult the development of aqueous formulations of the drug, thus giving rise to {{a limited number of}} stable and pharmaceutically accepted preparations. In fact, <b>xibornol</b> is actually marketed only as spray aqueous suspension. The aim of this work was to evaluate the possibility of developing a stable liquid formulation of the drug intended for oral spray administration using a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS). These systems are able to adequately improve the drug solubility, allowing the introduction of relatively high concentration of drugs in the form of solution.|$|E
50|$|SMEDDS in {{research}} or development include formulations {{of the drugs}} anethole trithione, oridonin, curcumin, vinpocetine, tacrolimus,Mitotane, berberine hydrochloride, nobiletin, piroxicam, anti-malaria drugs beta-Artemether and halofantrine, anti-HIV drug UC 781, nimodipine, exemestane, anti-cancer drugs 9-nitrocamptothecin (9-NC) paclitaxel, and seocalcitol, alprostadil (intraurethral use), probucol, itraconazole, fenofibrate, acyclovir, simvastatin, <b>xibornol,</b> silymarin, alpha-asarone, enilconazole, puerarin (an isoflavone found in Pueraria lobata), atorvastatin, heparin, carvedilol, ketoconazole, gentamicin, labrasol, flurbiprofen, celecoxib, danazol, cyclosporine, and idebenone.|$|E
50|$|Labrafil M1944, Labrafil M2125 and Labrafac CC were {{screened}} as oil phases, Labrasol and Labrafac PG as surfactants and Transcutol as co-surfactant. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed, by titration with the aqueous phase of different oil phases and surfactant/co-surfactant mixtures {{in order to}} identify the self-microemulsification region and the optimal micro-emulsion composition. Then, complete pharmaceutical formulations were prepared and evaluated for stability and viscosity properties. The final selected formulations, containing Labrafil M1944, Transcutol, Labrafac PG and a hydrophilic co-solvent (propylene glycol or PEG 200) allowed complete solubilization of the required <b>xibornol</b> concentration (3%, w/v) and showed physical good stability up to 2 months at 25 and 4 Â°C, suitable viscosity and organoleptic properties.|$|E
40|$|The virucidal {{activity}} of <b>xibornol</b> {{has been known}} since the 70 s, but its determination is primarily based on few clinical data. Experimental quantitative estimation in vitro {{is limited by the}} absence of appropriate test neither the European nor the American Pharmacopoeia; however some recent standards, concerning antiseptics, could be utilized for this purpose. The tests were carried out by following the European Standard EN 14476, which foresees contact test between viruses and 3 different concentrations of <b>xibornol,</b> in two experimental conditions and viral titer estimation by cell culture method. The tested viruses were chosen among those ones most closely responsible of upper respiratory tract infections: Human Adenovirus, Human Rhinovirus and Human Corona virus. For the commercial concentration (3...|$|E
