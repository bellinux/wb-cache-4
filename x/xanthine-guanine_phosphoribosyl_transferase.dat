40|$|The Escherichia coli gene coding for {{the enzyme}} <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (gpt) {{has been widely}} used as a {{dominant}} selectable marker {{in a variety of}} mammalian cells. We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the 1057 base pair (bp) segment of DNA containing this gene. The coding sequence for the enzyme is 456 nucleotides long and can code for a 152 amino acid (16. 9 Kd) polypeptide. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the bacterial enzyme with that of the mammalian hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) reveals no significant homology between the two polypeptides...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the claim that a single, mutant {{oncogene}} can transform NIH 3 T 3 mouse fibroblasts into transformed, tumorigenic cells, acting in a genetically dominant fashion. A c. Ha-ras 1 oncogene, cloned from the EJ human bladder carcinoma cell line, was inserted into a shuttle vector carrying the selectable marker gene gpt, which encodes the enzyme XPRT (<b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase).</b> This construct, pSV 2 gptEJ, was transfected into NIH 3 T 3 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method and cells which had incorporated the plasmid were selected by growth in mycophenolic acidcontaining medium, to which gpt confers resistance. A number of clonal lines were established and their tumorigenicity tested. Tumour cell lines derived from these transfectants were back-selected using 2 -thioxanthine, a cytotoxic analogue of the <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> substrate, to isolate clones which no longer contained functional pSV 2 gptEJ sequences. Six sub-clones which did not express detectable levels of the ras oncogene product, p 21 H. ras, were obtained. All were judged to be less transformed than the transfected parent cells: they appeared morphologically normal, were more serum-sensitive, showed clear saturation densities and were more anchorage-dependent. Three of these sub-clones were found to be tumorigenic at all sites tested. Cytological examination of the NIH 3 T 3 transfectants revealed that significant perturbation of their chromosome complement accompanied transfection. The transfection process, in the absence of DNA or with pSV 2 gpt alone, was found to be capable of transforming NIH 3 T 3 cells. Finally, a brief investigation of the effect of a "functional EJ- ras gene upon the differentiated phenotypes of these cell lines was attempted by comparing their ability to produce an extracellular matrix. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} fusion of protoplasts bearing amplified {{plasmids}} and human diploid fibroblasts or other cell types in suspension is described.

All three human X-linked markers studied, i. e., hypoxanthineguanine <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (EC 2. 4. 2. 8), glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 49), and phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2. 7. 2. 3), were present together, or absent together, {{in most of these}} clones and sublines. However, loss or retention of only phosphoglycerate kinase was occasionally observed, {{even in the absence of}} selective growth, while no evidence of separation of hypoxanthine-guanine <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> from glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase occurred. Cytological examination of eight man-hamster clonal lines by the quinacrine fluorescent technique showed that human phosphoglycerate kinase was only present when the translocation chromosome carrying most of the long arm of the X chromosome was present.

40|$|Cultured {{mammalian}} cells transduced {{with the}} Escherichia coli gene, Ecogpt, synthesize the bacterial enzyme <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (XGPT) (1). This paper describes {{a method for}} measuring XGPT activity in crude cell extracts by following the conversion of 14 C-xanthine (X) to 14 C-xanthine monophosphate (XMP) and 14 C-xanthosine (XR) by thin layer chromatography. The method is rapid, easy to use, sensitive and linear {{over a wide range}} of XGPT activity and has been useful for detecting XGPT in cells that were transiently transfected or stably transformed with Ecogpt. During our studies, we have found that a human cell line (XP 20 S) converts xanthine to XMP. This activity is probably catalyzed by a variant hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPT) since the low activity is readily inhibited by hypoxanthine. A low level of conversion of X to XMP may explain why some cell lines are not killed in a medium containing mycophenolic acid and X...|$|E
40|$|Two {{hypoxanthine}} phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient {{human cell}} lines, D 98 /AH- 2 and HT 1080 - 6 TG, were stably transfected with pSV 2 gpt, a plasmid containing the selectable marker Escherichia coli <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (Eco gpt). Hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine-resistant transformants arose with a frequency of ca. 10 (- 6) and contained mostly single, but occasionally multiple, {{copies of the}} plasmid sequences. These transformants actively express the Eco gpt marker. Single chromosomes from two different HT 1080 gpt transformants and one D 98 gpt transformant, containing the integrated plasmid sequences, were transferred via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-deficient mouse A 9 cells. The transferred human chromosomes were identified as 2, 4, and 22, by {{using a combination of}} G- 11 staining, G-banding, isoenzyme analysis, and in situ hybridization.

A mixture of proteins with affinity to porcine transferrin (PAPT) from Haemophilus parasuis Nagasaki strain (serovar 5) was inoculated intramuscularly (PAPT(M)) and intratracheally (PAPT(Cp)), along with a commercial bacterin. PAPT were separated using 2 dimensional electrophoresis (2 DE) gels and with them, 2 DE Western blots were carried out. A total of 17 spots were identified as positive with sera of pigs {{from any of the}} three vaccinated groups, the highest number of immunoreactive proteins being detected in those having received PAPT(Cp).

40|$|The {{rearrangement}} of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) {{genes in}} lymphocytes by V(D) J recombinase {{is essential for}} immunological diversity in humans. These DNA rearrangements involve cleavage by the RAG 1 and RAG 2 (RAG 1 / 2) recombinase enzymes at recombination signal sequences (RSS). This reaction generates two products, cleaved signal ends and coding ends. Coding ends are ligated by non-homologous end-joining proteins to form a functional Ig or TCR gene product, while the signal ends form a signal joint. In vitro {{studies have demonstrated that}} RAG 1 / 2 are capable of mediating the transposition of cleaved signal ends into non-specific sites of a target DNA molecule. However, to date, in vivo transposition of signal ends has not been demonstrated. We present evidence of in vivo inter-chromosomal transposition in humans mediated by V(D) J recombinase. T-cell isolates were shown to contain TCRα signal ends from chromosome 14 inserted into the X-linked hypo <b>xanthine–guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> locus, resulting in gene inactivation.

40|$|Mouse 3 T 6 {{cells were}} {{transformed}} with a chimeric DNA plasmid, pSVMgpt, {{in which the}} mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter was fused to the Escherichia coli gene encoding <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (Eco gpt). The transformants exhibited glucocorticoid-inducible expression of Eco gpt. With limiting xanthine concentrations, conditions were established in which cell growth became hormone dependent. Cells selected {{for their ability to}} grow in limiting concentrations of both xanthine and glucocorticoids contained amplified levels of Eco gpt DNA, and expression of Eco gpt remained glucocorticoid inducible in these amplified cells. Thus, amplification of the MMTV promoter region in itself did not abolish hormonal responsiveness of a gene. In addition to increased levels of Eco gpt DNA, some of the selected cells also exhibited increased levels (two- to threefold) of glucocorticoid receptors. Lastly, we found that excessive expression of Eco gpt is toxic to 3 T 6 cells; by maintaining low hormone levels and, therefore, low levels of expression, we were able to select cells with amplified Eco gpt. Thus, the MMTV promoter may be of general utility in expressing genes whose products may be lethal if they are produced in excessive quantities...|$|E

To activate the IFN signaling pathway, we made receptor chimeras, consisting of the IFN type I receptor intracellular and transmembrane domains, fused to either the interleukin- 5 (IL- 5) receptors or erythropoietin (Epo) receptor extracellular domains as model systems. 2 fTGH cells, stably transfected with these receptor chimeras, responded to very low concentrations of IL- 5 or Epo (IC 50 values of similar to 15 pg and 3 pg/ml, respectively) and thus {{can be used as a}} very sensitive bioassay for both ligands, Background activity of IL- 5, Epo, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL- 6, or leptin on cells that did not carry the receptor chimeras was very low.

40|$|A {{combined}} proteomics and metabolomics {{approach was}} utilised {{to advance the}} identification and characterisation of secondary metabolites in Aspergillus fumigatus. Here, implementation of a shotgun proteomic strategy led to the identification of non-redundant mycelial proteins (n = 414) from A. fumigatus including proteins typically under-represented in 2 -D proteome maps: proteins with multiple transmembrane regions, hydrophobic proteins and proteins with extremes of molecular mass and pI. Indirect identification of secondary metabolite cluster expression was also achieved, with proteins (n = 18) from LaeA-regulated clusters detected, including GliT encoded within the gliotoxin biosynthetic cluster. Biochemical analysis then revealed that gliotoxin significantly attenuates H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress in A. fumigatus (p. 0. 0001), confirming observations from proteomics data. A complementary 2 -D/LC-MS/MS approach further elucidated significantly increased abundance (p, 0. 05) of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), NADH-quinone oxidoreductase and the gliotoxin oxidoreductase GliT, along with significantly attenuated abundance (p, 0. 05) of a heat shock protein, an oxidative stress protein and an autolysis-associated chitinase, when gliotoxin and H 2 O 2 were present, compared to H 2 O 2 alone. Moreover, gliotoxin exposure significantly reduced the abundance of selected proteins (p, 0. 05) involved in de novo purine biosynthesis.

40|$|Many {{examples}} of internal translation initiation in eucaryotes have accumulated in recent years. In many cases terminators of upstream reading frames precede the internal initiation site, suggesting that translational reinitiation {{may be a}} mechanism for initiation at internal AUGs. To test this idea, a series of recombinants was constructed in the mammalian expression vector pSV 2. Each contained a dicistronic transcription unit comprising the coding sequence for mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) followed by the gene for <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (XGPRT) from Escherichia coli. Various versions of this pSV 2 dhfr-gpt recombinant plasmid altered the location at which the DHFR reading frame was terminated relative to the XGPRT initiation codon and demonstrated {{that this is a}} critical factor for the expression of XGPRT activity in transfected Cos- 1 cells. Thus, when the DHFR frame terminated upstream or a very short distance downstream of the XGPRT initiator AUG, substantial levels of XGPRT activity were observed. When the DHFR frame terminated 50 nucleotides beyond the XGPRT initiator, activity was reduced about twofold. However, when the DHFR and XGPRT sequences were fused in-frame so that ribosomes which initiated at the DHFR AUG did not terminate until they encountered the XGPRT terminator, production of XGPRT activity was abolished. This dependence of internal translation initiation on the position of terminators of the upstream reading frame is consistent with the hypothesis that mammalian ribosomes are capable of translational reinitiation...|$|E

Steady-state kinetics indicate that only the complete octameric complex is active and non-competitively inhibited by the pathway product histidine. The rationale for these findings {{is provided by the}} crystal structure revealing a total of eight histidine binding sites that are located within each of the four HisGS-HisZ subunit interfaces formed by the ATP <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> complex. While the structure of the catalytic HisGS subunit is related to the catalytic domain of another family of (HisGL) 2 ATP <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferases</b> that is functional in the absence of additional regulatory subunits, the structure of the regulatory HisZ subunit is distantly related to class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. However, neither the mode of the oligomeric subunit arrangement nor the type of histidine binding pockets is found in these structural relatives.

For human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), all naturally occurring genomes have a PBS complementary to tRNA 3 Lys. However, within HIV- 1 virions, there are approximately equal amounts of tRNA 1 Lys, tRNA 2 Lys, and tRNA 3 Lys. We have used an endogenous reverse transcription-PCR technique specific for the tRNA species within isolated HIV- 1 virions to demonstrate {{that in addition to}} tRNA 3 Lys, tRNA 1 Lys and tRNA 2 Lys could be used for initiation of HIV- 1 reverse transcription. Using a single-round infection assay which employed an HIV- 1 genome with a gpt gene encoding <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> in place of the env gene, we generated cell lines resistant to mycophenolic acid. Analysis of the U 5 -PBS from single-cell clones revealed PBS complementary to tRNA 3 Lys, not tRNA 1 Lys or tRNA 2 Lys. A mutant HIV- 1 genome was then created which would favor the completion of reverse transcription with tRNA 1, 2 Lys. Using this provirus in the complementation system, we again found only genomes with a PBS complementary to tRNA 3 Lys from proviral DNA isolated from gpt-resistant single-cell colonies. Finally, infection of cells with a mutant HIV genome with a PBS complementary to tRNA 1, 2 Lys resulted in gpt-[*]resistant cell colonies which contained integrated provirions with a PBS complementary to tRNA 1, 2 Lys.

The lack of incorporation of formate, glycine, hypoxanthine, inosine, and xanthine into the nucleotide pool suggests {{the absence of}} de novo purine nucleotide synthesis and the inability to form IMP as the precursor of AMP and GMP in G. lamblia. Only adenine, adenosine, guanine, and guanosine were incorporated. Further analysis of the labeled nucleotides by HPLC indicated that adenine and adenosine are converted only to adenine nucleotides whereas guanine and guanosine are only incorporated into guanine nucleotides. There is no competition of incorporation between adenine/adenosine and guanine/guanosine, {{and there is no}} interconversion between adenine and guanine nucleotides. Results from analyzing [5 '- 3 H]guanosine incorporation indicate that the ribose moiety is not incorporated with the guanine base. Assays of purine salvage enzymic activities in the crude extracts of G. lamblia revealed the presence of only four major enzymes; adenosine and guanosine hydrolases and adenine and guanine <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferases.</b> Apparently, G. lamblia has an exceedingly simple purine salvage system; it converts adenosine and guanosine to corresponding purine bases and then forms AMP and GMP by the actions of corresponding purine <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferases.</b> The guanine <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> in G. lamblia is interesting because it does not recognize either hypoxanthine or xanthine as substrate. It thus must have a unique substrate specificity and may be regarded as a potential target to attack as a rational approach to chemotherapeutic control of giardiasis...|$|R
2500|$|The first {{mechanism}} is simple dietary lack of niacin. Second, it {{may result from}} deficiency of tryptophan, an essential amino acid found in meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and peanuts that the body converts into niacin. Third, it {{may be caused by}} excess leucine, as it inhibits quinolinate <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (QPRT) [...] and inhibits the formation of Niacin or Nicotinic acid to Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) causing pellegra like symptoms to occur.|$|R
40|$|Adenine <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> {{deficiency}} {{is a rare}} {{metabolic abnormality}} presenting with 2, 8 dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis. The stones are characteristically radiolucent and therefore need to be differentiated from uric acid stones which are also radiolucent and have identical chemical reactivity. No cases of 2, 8 - dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis have been reported from India. We report a 3 year old child with 2, 8 - dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis and acute renal failure...|$|R

Aspartate carbamoyltransferase, the committed step of the pathway, {{was found to be}} strictly confined to the chloroplasts. Dihydro-orotase, orotate <b>phosphoribosyl</b> <b>transferase,</b> and orotidine decarboxylase activities were also found only in the plastids. The remaining enzyme of the pathway, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, was shown to be mitochondrial...|$|R
