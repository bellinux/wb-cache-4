40|$|Abstract Data from highly weathered, low pH, sodic Australian soils {{have been}} used to develop a method for {{estimating}} soil exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) or soil extract sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) from soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) data. The method {{can also be used to}} calculate soil pH in soil salinity models using SAR and EC values. The pH was calculated as pH- A + (B <b>x</b> <b>SAR</b> 112) /(1 + C x EC). Rewriting the equations in terms of SAR (or ESP), gives SAR (or ESP) -[(pH- A) (1 + C x EC) /B] 2. This study was conducted to determine whether these same methods could be used to predict the pH and SAR values for arid climate soils that are only slightly weathered and are often sodic under natural conditions. Existing pH, EC, and SAR data from Declo loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic, Xerollic Cal-ciorthids), Freedom silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic, Xerollic Calciorthids), and Ma-zuma sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed (calcareous), mesic Typic Torriorthents) were used to calculate the A, B, and C coefficients for the three high sodium soils.

Remote sensing approaches in the optical and infrared wavelength domain provide only limited insights into such features for obvious reasons, and they can provide only indirect information about the subsurface if combined with topographic data. The SAR-based imaging potential to investigate surface and shallow subsurface structures has been noticed after Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR) A to C imagery was successfully used to map geomorphic features over less vegetated topography (McHone et al. 2002).

In this paper the influence of these features on the results of the classification is examined in a quantitative manner. A set of multi-channel (P, L, C and <b>X</b> band) <b>SAR</b> data was acquired by an airborne system over a site in Southern Europe. A groundtruth mission defined the classes for learning and validation. A feature-based classification method, based on logistic regression, is used for detecting each of the classes. Logistic regression combines the input features into a non-linear function, the logistic function, in order to distinguish that class from all others. For each class a „detection image‟, with a well-defined statistical meaning, is obtained. The value at each pixel in the detection image represents the conditional probability that the pixel belongs to that class, given all input features. The logistic regression is performed using a step-wise method in which, at each step, the most discriminating feature is added to the selected feature set, but only if its addition contributes significantly to the detection. The logistic regression thus also performs a feature selection. Moreover, logistic regression allows combining input data with very diverse statistical distributions. The main aim of the current paper is to investigate the usefulness of each feature for the detection of the different classes...|$|R

The proposed change detection method is primarily {{based on the}} comparison between two <b>X</b> band <b>SAR</b> images acquired during the accumulation (winter) and the melting (spring) seasons, in the French Alps. The new membership decision method is relying on the local intensity statistics of the SAR images by considering the backscattering ratio as a stochastic process: the probability that " the intensity ratio is smaller than the corresponding locally varying dry/wet snow threshold " is larger than a predefined confidence level. The proposed snow backscattering simulations indicate a far more complex relation between the backscattering properties of the two snow types, {{with respect to the}} conventional assumption of the augmented electromagnetic absorption associated to the wet snow. The most conclusive results are confirmed at X band by in situ measurements. We show that this complexity is mostly caused by the dominance of a different backscattering component for each type of snow, leading to a significant angular sensitivity. Therefore, we introduce a variable threshold matrix instead of an unique threshold: the threshold is expressed {{as a function of the}} local incidence angle (LIA) for each pixel. The proposed snow backscattering simulator (SBS) allows deriving the locally varying threshold as the ratio between dry and wet snow backscattering coefficients computed for the SAR system parameters (polarization, frequency), the local topography parameters (LIA) and for the a priori derived and spatially averaged target parameters (underlying ground and snow cover surface properties, snow grain size, underlying ground dielectric permittivity, snow wetness).

Images with this mode offer exciting new potentials, but the interferometric data processing requires some care and algorithmic modifications compared to conventional stripmap mode processing: 1) The dynamic antenna squint angle in azimuth direction requires accurate imaging control at the sensor and the resulting fast Doppler drift rate needs to be taken account for in the InSAR processor. The paper demonstrates that excellent spotlight interferometry results have been achieved in several test sites. 2) The high range bandwidth brings the range resolution rather close to the dimension of the wavelength. In consequence simple approximations for the geometric distortions of the SAR images are no more sufficient. Instead, SAR interferometry and radargrammetry have to be considered jointly in data processing. The paper shows how InSAR processing has to be modified to achieve good results. 3) Furthermore the high resolution can help in interferometric phase unwrapping by exploiting the wavelength dispersion with split bandwidth techniques. The paper shows some first results of this new application. The algorithms and results are illustrated with numerous high resolution images mainly from urban areas. ...|$|R

All the compounds were characterized by means of FT-IR and mono- and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. According to in vitro cytotoxicity studies, complex [AuIIICl 2 (dtc-D,L-Pro-Aib 2 -O(t- Bu)) ] (3 b) {{turned out to be the}} most effective toward all the human tumor cell lines evaluated (PC 3, 2008, C 13, and L 540), reporting IC 50 values lower than cisplatin. Remarkably, it showed no crossresistance with cisplatin itself and was proved to inhibit tumor cell proliferation by inducing almost exclusively late apoptosis/necrosis.

40|$|Remote sensing {{has been}} widely used in {{disaster}} management. However, application of optical imageries in damage detection is not always feasible for immediate damage assessment. In {{the case of the}} Sichuan earthquake in 2008, the damaged areas were covered by cloud and fog for most of the time. The all weather SAR imageries could instead provide information of the damaged area. Therefore, more efforts are needed to explore the usability of SAR data. In regards to this purpose, this research focuses on studying the ability of using various SAR data in damage identification through image classification, and furthermore the effectiveness of fusion of various sensors in classification is evaluated.   Three different types of SAR imagery were acquired over the heavily damaged zone Qushan town in the Sichuan earthquake. The 3 types of SAR data are ALOS PALSAR L-band, RADARSAT- 1 C-band and the TerraSAR-X X- band imageries.   Maximum likelihood classification method is applied on the imageries.   Four classes: Water, collapsed area, built-up area and landslide area are defined in the study area. The ability of each band in identifying these four classes is studied and the overall classification accuracy is analysed. Furthermore, fusion of these 3 types of imageries is performed and the effectiveness and accuracy of image fusion classification are evaluated.   The results show that classification accuracy from individual SAR imagery is not ideal. The overall accuracy which PALSAR gives is 30. 383 %, RADARSAT- 1 is 31. 268 % while TerraSAR-X only achieves 37. 168 %. Accuracy statistics demonstrate that TerraSAR-X performs the best in classifying these four classes.   SAR image fusion shows a better classification result. Double image fusion of PALSAR and RADARSAT- 1, PALSAR and TerraSAR-X, and RADARSAT- 1 and TerraSAR-X give an overall classification accuracy of 41. 88 %, 42. 478 % and 37. 758 % respectively. The result from triple image fusion even reaches 52. 507 %. They are all higher than the result given by the individual images.   The study illustrates that the VHR TerraSAR <b>X</b> band <b>SAR</b> data has a higher ability in classification of damages, and fusion of different band can improve the classification accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{regression}} is {{the result}} of the development of linear regression method, wherein the location or spatial aspects of the analyzed data are also must be considered. The phenomenon that includes spatial data of which is the deployment of a minimum wage. Minimum Wages District/City is a minimum standard that is used by employers to provide wages to employees in its business environment on a district/city in any given year. Minimum Wages District/City is determined by considering the welfare of workers and the state of the local economy. Factors in worker welfare such as Worth Living Needs and the Consumer Price Index (CPI), while one important indicator to determine the economic conditions in the region within a certain time period is Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Modeling the influence of these factors can be determined by using multiple linear regression and spatial regression. Based on the data processing result, there is a spatial dependence in the Minimum Wages District/City variable in Central Java, so Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) method is used in this study. Variables that significantly affect the UMK in Central Java through multiple linear regression method and SAR is the Worth Living Needs (X 1) and CPI (<b>X</b> 2). The <b>SAR</b> model generates the value of R 2 at 72. 269 % and AIC at 66. 393, better than the multiple linear regression model that generates the value of R 2 at 68 % and AIC at 68. 482...|$|R

The former {{is the first}} monomeric 18 -electron nickel amide to be synthesized and the latter is the first structurally characterized monomeric nickel methoxide complex, The amido complex Cp*Ni(PEt 3) NHTol reacts with various Bronsted acids (HX) to produce complexes of the type Cp*Ni(PEt 3) X (X = NHAr, OR, Osilica, SR), and compounds with hydridic hydrogens to give the hydridonickel complex Cp*Ni(PEt 3) H. The polarity of Ni-N and Ni-O bonds is also demonstrated by reactions with alkali metal salts and trimethylsilyl chloride, and by the crystallographic and NMR characterization of phenol adducts of Cp*Ni(PEt 3) OTol. The phosphine ligands in Cp*Ni(PEt 3) X (<b>X</b> = OTol, <b>SAr)</b> compounds exchange with PMe 3 through an associative mechanism; the rate increases with the electronegativity of X. The thermodynamics of reactions interconverting Cp*Ni(PEt 3) X + HX' and Cp*Ni(PEt 3) X' + HX have been analyzed using solution equilibrium studies and calorimetry. Instead of being 1 : 1, the correlation between H-X and M-X bond energies shows a marked preference for nickel binding to more electronegative ligands. This preference is not specific to nickel: examples of similar thermodynamic preferences occur throughout transition metal chemistry. These results may be attributable to a large electrostatic component in the bonding between Ni and X. This qualitative E-C model explains the reactivity, thermodynamics, and phosphine exchange rates of this series of nickel complexes, and may be general to many metal-ligand bonds...|$|R
