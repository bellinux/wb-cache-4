[...] In 1897, the Los Angeles Times published an article on Yoakum's claim that he had discovered a new method of [...] "X-Ray Prospecting" [...] for gold. [...] Yoakum {{reported that he had}} laid [...] a bit of gold-bearing quartz on the <b>x-ray</b> <b>plate</b> while taking an x-ray of a patient with a tumor. [...] The x-ray showed the location of the gold deposits in the quartz, and Yoakum proposed using x-rays in mine tunnels to [...] "ascertain decisively if gold is present, and if so, exactly where it lies and in what quantities." [...] Following this report, Yoakum became active in gold and copper mining. [...] In 1902, he ran a newspaper advertisement (pictured at left) offering stock at 25 cents a share in his new mining company. Yoakum later claimed that it was while traveling in Mexico, the location of his mining interests, that he spoke {{for the first time in}} [...] "tongues."

Previously, we proposed to use a hybrid 2 D– 3 D registration scheme to determine the postoperative acetabular cup orientation and developed an object-oriented cross-program called “HipMatch. ” However, its accuracy and robustness have not been fully investigated. To assess the potential factors that may affect the accuracy and robustness of the hybrid 2 D– 3 D registration scheme in determining the postoperative acetabular cup orientation, a comprehensive validation study using a cadaver pelvis was performed. Nine X-ray radiographs taken from different pelvic positions relative to the <b>X-ray</b> <b>plate</b> and two computed tomography volumes of the pelvis with one acquired before the cup implantation and the other acquired after the cup implantation {{were used in the}} validation study. Potential factors that may affect the accuracy and robustness of the hybrid 2 D– 3 D registration scheme were experimentally determined. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) the plain radiograph-based method is not accurate; (2) the hybrid 2 D– 3 D registration scheme helps to improve the estimation accuracy; (3) the hybrid 2 D– 3 D registration scheme can robustly and accurately estimate the cup orientation even when a big portion of the radiograph is occluded; and (4) image resolution has minor effect on the estimation accuracy.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} estimating postoperative cup alignment from single standard X-ray radiograph with gonadal shielding. The widely used procedure of evaluation of cup orientation following total hip arthroplasty using single standard anteroposterior radiograph is known inaccurate, {{largely due to the}} wide variability in individual pelvic position relative to <b>X-ray</b> <b>plate.</b> 2 D- 3 D image registration methods have been introduced to estimate the rigid transformation between a preoperative CT volume and postoperative radiograph(s) for an accurate estimation of the postoperative cup alignment relative to an anatomical reference extracted from the CT data. However, these methods require either multiple radiographs or a radiograph-specific calibration, both of which are not avaiable for most retrospective studies. Furthermore, these methods were only evaluated on X-ray radiograph(s) without gonadal shielding. In this paper, we propose to use a hybrid 2 D- 3 D registration scheme combining an iterative landmark-to-ray registration with a 2 D- 3 D intensity-based registration to estimate the rigid transfromation for a precise estimation of cup alignment. Quantitative and qualitative results evaluated on clinical and cadaveric datasets are given which indicate the validity of our approach...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Extensive {{collections}} of frogs from Queensland (reported in detail, Straughan, 1966) failed {{to include the}} species Cyclorana inermis (Peters), although Slevin (1955) recorded it as abundant in central Queensland. However a widely ranging species of ground Hyla (undescribed in that genus) occurred frequently in collections from central and northern Queensland. In all external features this species fitted the description of Cyclorana inermis given by Parker (1940 : 17). In the present paper Peters' syntype of C. inermis (reg. no. RMNH 1888) in the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden, is examined, and compared with the apparently new species of Hyla. MATERIAL AND METHODS X-ray plates of {{the feet of the}} syntype were provided by the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historic X-rays of five specimens of Hyla sp. were made by the X-ray section of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy, University of Queensland. A further ten specimens were cleared and stained with Toluidine Blue and Alizarin Red S. to distinguish bone from cartilage. All measurements were made with vernier calipers to the nearest 0. 1 mm or with an eyepiece micrometer to the nearest 0. 01 mm. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Examination of the digits of the syntype of Cyclorana inermis by <b>X-ray</b> (<b>plate</b> 1) established the presence of intercalary cartilages and claw shaped terminal phalanges which are characters diagnostic of the family Hylidae in the Procoelous Anura.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} study the influence of commercial maize seed processing on seed quality. In particular, it aimed to determine: 1) the particular stage or stages of processing which could be responsible for a reduction in seed germination, 2) whether seed cracking contributes {{to the problem of}} seed deterioration after storage, 3) which of the various stages of processing seed cracking occurs, 4) possible ways of reducing seed damage caused by seed processing. The results showed that seed processing adversely affected seed quality. The damage which occurred, however, did not cause any immediate reduction in seed viability but was strongly implicated in hastening seed deterioration in storage. The stages of seed processing which most likely contributed to a reduction in seed germination following storage were cob drying, seed drying, shelling and the final stages of dressing, grading and treating. Hybrid XL 72 aa was less susceptible to processing damage than Hybrids D 54 and XL 81 although the former had less potential to germinate as indicated by its lower initial seed germination. Remarkable levels of stress cracking occurred due to seed drying. In this particular experiment, stress cracking had no direct damaging effect on essential seed structures even though it hastened seed deterioration in storage {{depending on the type of}} cracks. Stress cracks which were not seen by X-ray in a longitudinal position but which could often be seen visually did not affect seed viability after storage for 12 months. This kind of crack appeared as tiny shallow cracks in a transverse line in seeds on an <b>X-ray</b> <b>plate.</b> Similarly, fissures located outside the germ area as revealed by X-ray radiography had no adverse effect on seed viability after storage. However, cracks which were detected by X-ray along the side or extending into the germ area seriously reduced seed viability in storage. X-ray radiography is a useful technique for determining the specific location or magnitude of seed cracking in maize and can be used to critically assess the likely affects of seed cracking on seed storage longevity. Machine shelling at a seed moisture content of 22 % produced more broken seeds than shelling at either 18 % or 14 % moisture content. After ear drying, tempering of the ears before shelling reduced the level of stress cracking after seed drying, particularly at temperatures of 30 C and 20 C. Generally, the germination after storage was higher in seeds from tempered ears before shelling than from ears which were not tempered at this stage. Reducing seed drying temperature from 40 C to 20 C drastically reduced the levels of stress cracking and resulted in better seed viability after storage. Seed drying starting with a initial seed moisture content of 14 % at 30 C or 18 % at 40 C reduced the level of stress cracking. After seed drying, seed tempering at the same drying temperature of 40 C did not reduce stress cracking but did reduce seed viability after storage. Seed tempering at a drying temperature of 30 C reduced stress cracking and resulted in higher seed viability after seed storage compared with non-tempered seeds. Tempering had no effect when seeds were dried at 20 C. This study has clearly shown that mechanical seed processing is a major contributory cause of reduction in seed quality. Although seed damage may not be evident before seed storage it is clearly involved in hastening seed deterioration in storage. The study concludes that particular attention to ensure artificial seed drying at a relatively lower temperature and lower initial seed moisture content and tempering, play an important part in ensuring that seed damage and deterioration are both greatly reduced...|$|E
