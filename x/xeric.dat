5|$|A. m. columbianum:Genetic {{evidence}} for the 'central' subspecies (A. m. columbianum) suggests {{that it does not}} extend north into British Columbia, but is restricted to the Blue and Wallowa Mountains of central to northeastern sections of Oregon. Populations are restricted to these areas by the Snake River Canyon (Idaho) to the east and low dry or <b>xeric</b> lands in the Madras basin to the west.|$|E
5|$|The {{western and}} {{southern}} sides, which {{lie in the}} rain shadow of the central highlands, are home to dry deciduous forests, spiny forests, and deserts and <b>xeric</b> shrublands. Due to their lower population densities, Madagascar's dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau. The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting {{is a major problem}} caused by sediment from the high levels of inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people of the}} Everglades region arrived in the Florida peninsula {{of what is now}} the United States approximately 14,000 to 15,000years ago, probably following large game. The Paleo-Indians found an arid landscape that supported plants and animals adapted to prairie and <b>xeric</b> scrub conditions. Large animals became extinct in Florida around 11,000 years ago. Climate changes 6,500years ago brought a wetter landscape. The Paleo-Indians slowly adapted to the new conditions. Archaeologists call the cultures that resulted from the adaptations Archaic peoples. They were better suited for environmental changes than their ancestors, and created many tools with the resources they had. Approximately 5,000years ago, the climate shifted again to cause the regular flooding from Lake Okeechobee that gave rise to the Everglades ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Historical records {{indicate}} river otters were once populous throughout most major drainages {{in the continental}} United States and Canada prior to European settlement. North America’s largest otter populations were found in areas with an abundance and diversity of aquatic habitats, such as coastal marshes, the Great Lakes region, and glaciated areas of New England. In addition, riverine habitats in interior regions supported smaller, but practical, otter populations. The otter existed on {{all parts of the}} Pacific Coast, including the seashore and inland streams and lakes. However, large populations never occurred in areas of Southern California such as the chaparral and oak woodlands and Mojave Desert seasonal waterway regions, or in the <b>xeric</b> shrubland regions in New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, and Colorado. In Mexico, the otters lived in the Rio Grande and Colorado River Deltas.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 Barsbold {{suggested}} that oviraptorids fed on molluscs, but Longrich and colleagues {{rejected the idea}} that they practised shell-crushing altogether, since such animals tend to have teeth with broad crushing surfaces. Instead, the shape of the dentary bones in the lower jaws of oviraptorids suggests they had a sharp-edged beak used for shearing tough food, not for cracking hard food items such as bivalves or eggs. The symphyseal shelf {{at the front of the}} dentary may have given some ability for crushing, but as this was a relatively small area, it was probably not the main function of the jaws. The fact that most oviraptorids have been found in sediments that are interpreted as having been <b>xeric</b> and arid or semi-arid environments also argues against them having been specialised eaters of shellfish and eggs, as it is unlikely there would have been enough of these items under such conditions to support them.|$|E
5|$|Suillus collinitus is {{the most}} {{frequent}} fungus associating with Aleppo pine – a hardy tree utilised for reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in the Mediterranean region. A study performed {{in the south of}} France discovered that S.collinitus and S.mediterraneensis are multi-stage ectomycorrhizal fungi, associating with both young and mature stands of Aleppo pine. These two species may {{play a key role in}} the survival and adaptation of this species of pine on disturbed calcareous sites. Roots mycorrhizal with S.collinitus were found capable of surviving successive disturbances by fire or ploughing. Moreover, the fungus retained its viability to propagate via its mycelial network which helped the recolonisation effort of newly introduced trees. The fungus has also been shown to improve the growth of Mediterranean pines grown in greenhouses and nurseries. Unlike other Suillus species that grow in wet climates, such as S.grevillei and S.spraguei, S.collinitus does not typically produce fruit bodies in young plantations. This fruiting behaviour may be attributed to the typically nutrient-poor <b>xeric</b> Mediterranean environment in combination with a lack of tree canopy. The absence of above-ground indicators of fungal presence makes analysis of underground populations difficult; molecular markers have been developed to assist in monitoring fungal growth and ectomycorrhizal formation and persistence in young plantations.|$|E
5|$|Turbulent {{forces in}} {{air and water}} affect the {{environment}} and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global trade winds. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems. For example, wind running {{over the surface of}} a lake creates turbulence, mixing the water column and influencing the environmental profile to create thermally layered zones, affecting how fish, algae, {{and other parts of the}} aquatic ecosystem are structured. Wind speed and turbulence also influence evapotranspiration rates and energy budgets in plants and animals. Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western North America to produce a rain shadow on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called orographic lift and can cause precipitation. This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the <b>xeric</b> ecosystems (e.g., of the Columbia Basin in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.|$|E
5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} {{was found}} in a stratigraphic area indicating that oviraptorids preferred nesting near streams that provided soft, sandy substrate and food in environments that were otherwise <b>xeric</b> (receiving a small amount of moisture). Many oviraptorids have been found in brooding positions, indicating they may have brooded for relatively long periods, similar to modern birds such as the ostrich, emu, and black-breasted buzzard, which brood for more than 40 days with a limited supply of sustenance. Nesting in desert environments can be harmful to adults that stay in the nest for large parts of the day, and for eggs and nestlings, due to heat stress. The choice of nesting area may therefore have been a mechanism for successful incubation in extreme heat. It has also been suggested that the evolution of tail-feathers in oviraptorosaurs was an adaptation for shading and protecting eggs in their nests. That the second finger of ingeniine oviraptorids was reduced in size compared to the robust first finger may be explained by a change in function; it {{may be related to the}} presence of long wing feathers that were attached to the second finger. These wing feathers were probably used to protect the eggs during nesting. When the second finger began functioning as a feather support, its ability to grasp was reduced, and this function was taken over by the first finger, which therefore became more robust. The third finger was reduced in size, too, probably because it was positioned behind the wing feathers in a way where it would not be effective for grasping.|$|E

25|$|During the Pliocene, the {{detachment}} of Baja California, {{the development of}} the Gulf of California and the Subartic California current drastically reduced moisture coming into Sonora leading to severe regional aridity in both this state and neighboring Baja California.

25|$|Australia rafted {{north and}} became drier; the humid Antarctic flora {{retreated to the}} {{mainland}} east coast and Tasmania, {{while much of the}} rest of Australian vegetation became dominated by Acacia, Eucalyptus, Casuarina and <b>xeric</b> shrubs and grasses.

25|$|Ricord's iguana inhabits dry <b>xeric</b> {{scrubland}} with {{sandy and}} earthen soils {{in which they}} excavate burrows for retreats and nest sites that they expand over time. Entrances to these burrows are generally dug under dense thorny vegetation, shrubs, stumps, or exposed rocks. The adults of the species are primarily terrestrial whereas juveniles tend to occupy arboreal retreats.|$|E

25|$|Brazil's immense area is {{subdivided}} into different ecoregions in {{several kinds of}} biomes. Because of {{the wide variety of}} habitats in Brazil, from the jungles of the Amazon Rainforest and the Atlantic Forest (which includes Atlantic Coast restingas), to the tropical savanna of the Cerrado, to the <b>xeric</b> shrubland of the Caatinga, to the world's largest wetland area, the Pantanal, there exists a wide variety of wildlife as well.|$|E
25|$|Southwest Australia is a {{biodiversity}} hotspot {{that includes}} the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions of Western Australia. The region has a wet-winter, dry-summer Mediterranean climate, covers 356,717km², consisting of a coastal plain 20-120 kilometers wide, transitioning to gently undulating uplands made up of weathered granite, gneiss and laterite.

25|$|Under the Köppen–Geiger climate {{classification}} system, Dnipro has a hot-summer humid {{continental climate}} (Dfa) with hot summers and cold, snowy winters. However, according to other schemes (such as the Salvador Rivas-Martínez bioclimatic one), Dnipro has a Supratemperate bioclimate, and {{belongs to the}} Temperate <b>xeric</b> steppic thermoclimatic belt, due to high evapotranspiration, Dnipro is in the transition zone between a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa), with relatively drier summers {{than the rest of}} the year.|$|E
25|$|In the north, a scrub-covered, {{semi-desert}} plain {{referred as}} the Guban lies {{parallel to the}} Gulf of Aden littoral. With a width of twelve kilometres {{in the west to}} as little as two kilometres in the east, the plain is bisected by watercourses that are essentially beds of dry sand except during the rainy seasons. When the rains arrive, the Guban's low bushes and grass clumps transform into lush vegetation. This coastal strip is part of the Ethiopian <b>xeric</b> grasslands and shrublands ecoregion.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of skin pigmentation dates to after this, perhaps some 1.5 {{million years ago}} (about {{the time of the}} {{emergence of}} Homo heidelbergensis), when the earth endured a megadrought that drove early humans into arid, open landscapes. Such conditions likely caused excess UV-B radiation. This favored the emergence of skin pigmentation in order to protect from folate depletion due to the increased exposure to sunlight. A theory that the pigmentation helped counter <b>xeric</b> stress by increasing the epidermal permeability barrier has been disproved.|$|E
25|$|The common ostrich is a <b>xeric</b> animal, due to {{the fact}} that it lives in {{habitats}} that are both dry and hot. Water is scarce in dry and hot environment, and this poses a challenge to the ostrich's water consumption. Also the ostrich is a ground bird and cannot fly to find water sources, which poses a further challenge. Because of their size, common ostriches cannot easily escape the heat of their environment; however, they dehydrate less than their small bird counterparts because of their small surface area to volume ratio. Hot, arid habitats pose osmotic stress, such as dehydration, which triggers the common ostrich’s homeostatic response to osmoregulate.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of micro-endemism, therefore, states that speciation occurs in small specific habitats as aided by adaptive mechanism occurring in geological, topographical, and climatic isolation. Geologically and topographically, plant populations in <b>xeric</b> climates are {{broken down into}} smaller groups. The microclimate responds to the given location transforming it into a habitat. Isolated, the duplicity of organization in Pachypodium form through geology and location significant variation where over evolutionary time a new species might develop, if not have developed. The development of new species is through, in part, the adaptive mechanisms of pachycaul and spinescence as well as strict and flexible structural organization at various levels of plant physiology.|$|E
25|$|The Euphrates {{flows through}} a number of {{distinct}} vegetation zones. Although millennia-long human occupation {{in most parts of the}} Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape, patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a <b>xeric</b> woodland. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various oaks, pistachio trees, and Rosaceae (rose/plum family). The drier parts of the <b>xeric</b> woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and Rosaceae. Here can also be found the wild variants of many cereals, including einkorn wheat, emmer wheat, oat and rye. South of this zone lies a zone of mixed woodland-steppe vegetation. Between Raqqa and the Syro–Iraqi border the Euphrates flows through a steppe landscape. This steppe is characterised by white wormwood (Artemisia herba-alba) and Chenopodiaceae. Throughout history, this zone has been heavily overgrazed due to the practicing of sheep and goat pastoralism by its inhabitants. Southeast of the border between Syria and Iraq starts true desert. This zone supports either no vegetation at all or small pockets of Chenopodiaceae or Poa sinaica. Although today nothing of it survives due to human interference, research suggests that the Euphrates Valley would have supported a riverine forest. Species characteristic of this type of forest include the Oriental plane, the Euphrates poplar, the tamarisk, the ash and various wetland plants.|$|E
25|$|Vegetation in {{the region}} includes, firs, oaks, conifers, platanus, willow, olive trees, poplar, hawthorn, oriental plane, cherry plum, rose hips, {{pistachio}} trees, rosaceae, pear, mountain ash poplar. The desert in the south is mostly steppe and would feature <b>xeric</b> plants such as palm trees, tamarix, date palm, fraxinus, poa, white wormwood and chenopodiaceae. Animals found {{in the region}} include the Syrian brown bear, wild boar, gray wolf, golden jackal, Indian crested porcupine, red fox, goitered gazelle, Eurasian otter, striped hyena, Persian fallow deer, onager, mangar and the Euphrates softshell turtle. Bird species include, the see-see partridge, Menetries's warbler, western jackdaw, hooded crow, European nightjar, rufous-tailed scrub robin, masked shrike and the pale rockfinch.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{shifting}} patterns of temperature and changing oceanic conditions, precipitation patterns {{are expected to}} change in location, frequency and intensity. Larger and more frequent storms are expected when oceans can transfer more energy to the forming storm systems. This may have {{the greatest impact on}} <b>xeric,</b> or arid, ecosystems. It has been shown that soil respiration in arid ecosystems shows dynamic changes within a raining cycle. The rate of respiration in dry soil usually bursts to a very high level after rainfall and then gradually decreases as the soil dries. With an increase in rainfall frequency and intensity over area without previous extensive rainfall, a dramatic increase in soil respiration can be inferred.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of trogons are birds of tropical and subtropical forests. They have a cosmopolitan {{distribution in the}} worlds wet tropics, being found in the Americas, Africa and Asia. A few species are distributed into the temperate zone, with one species, the elegant trogon, reaching {{the south of the}} United States specifically southern Arizona and the surrounding area. The Narina trogon of Africa is slightly exceptional in that it utilises a wider range of habitats than any other trogon, ranging from dense forest to fairly open savannah, and from the Equator to southern South Africa. It is the most widespread and successful of all the trogons. The eared quetzal of Mexico is also able to use more <b>xeric</b> habitats, but preferentially inhabits forests. Most other species are more restricted in their habitat, with several species being restricted to undisturbed primary forest. Within forests they tend {{to be found in the}} mid-story, occasionally in the canopy.|$|E
25|$|Pignut hickory {{frequently}} {{grows on}} dry ridgetops and sideslopes throughout its range {{but it is}} also common on moist sites, particularly in the mountains and Piedmont. In the Great Smoky Mountains pignut hickory has been observed on dry sandy soils at low elevations. Whittaker (27) placed pignut in a submesic class and charted it as ranging up to 1480 m (4,850ft)-the hickory with the greatest elevational range in the Great Smoky Mountains. In southwest Virginia, south-facing upper slopes from 975 to 1050 m (3,200 to 3,445ft) of Beanfield Mountain are dominated by pignut hickory, northern red oak Quercus rubra), and white oak (Q. alba). This site is the most <b>xeric</b> habitat on the mountain because of high insolation, 70 percent slopes, and medium- to coarse-textured soils derived from Clinch sandstone. Mid-elevation slopes from 800 to 975 m (2,625 to 3,200ft) are dominated by chestnut oak (Q. prinus), northern red oak, and pignut hickory and coincide with three shale formations (12).|$|E
25|$|Ranging {{throughout}} Hispaniola, Haiti and the Dominican Republic; rhinoceros iguana {{populations are}} stable only on Isla Beata and the extreme of the Barahona Peninsula inside Parque Nacional Jaragua. There are moderately dense {{populations in the}} southeastern region of Haiti and its offshore islands including the saltwater lake of Etang Saumatre. Populations in Haiti are even more endangered due to the deforestation and human clearing practices. In general, the iguanas are found most abundantly in, although not restricted to, scrub woodland, dry forests characterized by <b>xeric,</b> rocky habitats of eroded limestone in coastal terraces and lowlands of the mainland and several offshore islands and small cays {{in a variety of}} subtropical life zones and habitat types. An individual was photographed on May 4, 2008 on the Limbe Island in Northern Haiti. It had been caught by a group of fishermen from Bas-Limbe, Bord de Mer village. The rhinoceros iguanas caught on Limbe Island are eaten by the local population. This sighting represents a new area previously not thought to be in the range of Cyclura cornata.|$|E
500|$|The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero {{appears to}} favour dry (<b>xeric)</b> scrub forests—often mixed with cacti and thorny scrub—on rocky hillsides. It {{has been found}} at sea level, {{although}} not on the beach among the seaweed litter or in piles of rotting palm debris in the littoral zone, like the more abundant and larger big-scaled least gecko (S.macrolepis) with which it shares its range. Also unlike the big-scaled least gecko, they do not [...] "swarm" [...] in the leaf litter, but are only uncommonly found hiding under rocks, which are considered moist or mesic microhabitats within their dry ecological niche.|$|E
500|$|An arid {{region of}} high <b>xeric</b> {{scrubland}} and desert steppe, the canyon and wider basin average [...] of rainfall annually; the park averages [...] Chaco Canyon {{lies on the}} leeward side of extensive mountain ranges {{to the south and}} west, resulting in a rainshadow effect that fosters the prevailing lack of moisture in the region. The region sees four distinct seasons. Rainfall is most likely between July and September, while May and June are the driest months. Orographic precipitation, which results from moisture wrung out of storm systems ascending the mountain ranges around Chaco Canyon, is responsible for most of the summer and winter precipitation, and rainfall increases with higher elevation. Occasional aberrant northward excursions of the intertropical convergence zone may boost precipitation in some years.|$|E
500|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{analysis}} identifies {{somewhat different}} ranges for the subspecies lineages. The genetic analysis, for example, identifies an additional pattern of deep divergence {{in the eastern}} part of the range. The spatial distribution of populations and genetics of this species links spatially and historically through the interconnecting mountain and temperate valley systems of western North America. The breeding fidelity of long-toed salamanders (philopatry) and other migratory behaviours reduce rates of dispersal among regions, such as within mountain basins. This aspect of their behavior restricts gene flow and increases the degree and rates of genetic differentiation. Genetic differentiation among regions is higher in the long-toed salamander than measured in most other vertebrate groups. Natural breaks in the range of dispersal and [...] occur where ecosystems grade into drier <b>xeric</b> low-lands (such as prairie climates) and at frozen or harsher terrain at high elevation extremes (...)

500|$|A {{variety of}} soil types with differing {{physical}} properties are found at Level Mountain. Shallow, coarse, textured, steep to strongly sloping soils dominate {{peaks of the}} Level Mountain Range and owe their origin to weathering of volcanic bedrock. These well drained soils are strongly acidic and <b>xeric</b> in nature and show little or no horizon development. The gently undulating alpine portions of Level Mountain {{have been affected by}} cryoturbation, resulting in patterned ground in which coarse material has been separated from each other as patches or stripes. Surface horizons are strongly to very strongly acidic, becoming medium to slightly acidic approximately [...] in depth. At lower elevations, soils develop on fluvio-glacial deposits. Many of these fluvio-glacial materials contain a high percentage of fine materials while the soils which have developed from them contain a subsurface horizon enriched by clay accumulation. Very poorly drained organic soils are extensive on the southern portion of the lava plateau.|$|E
