50|$|Unlike {{other cameras}} in the series, the flash <b>sync</b> <b>terminals</b> are present, however covered due to the {{integrated}} flash gun.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon F offered FP, M, and ME bulb synchronizations, in {{addition}} to the <b>X</b> <b>sync.</b>|$|R
50|$|The shutter is a Synchro-Compur {{behind the}} lens unit, {{which is part}} of the camera body. The {{aperture}} is now in the interchangeable lenses, which eliminates the overexposure problem of the original Retina Reflex. Speed are from 1 sec. to 1/500th plus bulb. It features M and <b>X</b> <b>syncs</b> and a self-timer.|$|R
50|$|Outlook 2011 {{initially}} supported Mac OS <b>X's</b> <b>Sync</b> Services {{only for}} contacts, not events, tasks or notes. It {{also does not}} have a Project Manager equivalent to that in Entourage. With Service Pack 1 (v 14.1.0), published on April 12, 2011, Outlook can now sync calendar, notes and tasks with Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{hot shoe}} {{on the top of}} the prism and a self-timer. The {{selector}} around the release button had four positions: L (lock), Auto, 100X (1/100, <b>X</b> <b>sync)</b> and B. The Pentax ME could attach an external winder ME I (1.5 i/s) or the later ME II (2i/s). The Pentax ME could also mount a Dial Data ME databack, or the later Digital Data M databack via a cord adapter.|$|R
5000|$|<b>X</b> (xenon) <b>sync</b> is a mode {{designed}} for use with electronic flash. [...] In this mode, {{the timing of the}} contacts coincides exactly with the full opening of the shutter, since xenon flashes respond almost instantly.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{dangerous}} loops when connecting equipment in complex studio setups, better adapters offer voltage protection and galvanic isolation of the units. Such adapters will ensure {{that there is no}} electrical connection of any kind between both sides of the adapter, including ground. They either use transformers or opto-couplers to transfer the trigger impulse from the camera to the flash. Their electronics cannot be powered from the flash and therefore needs a power supply in form of a small battery.As an example, Minolta offered the PC terminal adapter PCT-100 (8825-691) for this purpose, which worked as a galvanic isolator and could withstand 400 volts DC or AC. The similar Sony flash <b>sync</b> <b>terminal</b> and ISO hotshoe adapters FA-ST1AM and FA-HS1AM offer galvanic isolation as well, but can withstand voltages up to 60 volts DC or AC only.|$|R
50|$|Cameras {{designed}} for use with flash bulbs generally had {{one or more of}} S (slow) sync, M (medium) sync, F (fast) sync, or FP/FPX (flat peak) sync, {{designed for}} use with corresponding bulb types. These sync modes close the contacts a few milliseconds before the shutter is open, to give the flashbulb time to reach peak brightness before exposing the film. Class M bulbs reach their peak illumination at around 20-25 milliseconds after ignition, and class F lamps reach their peak at approximately 5 milliseconds. Most standard flash bulbs used M <b>sync.</b> <b>X</b> <b>sync</b> closes the flash contact just as the shutter blades are almost completely open, and M sync closes the flash contact 20 milliseconds before the blades are completely open.|$|R
50|$|The Mamiya Press {{is a line}} of medium-format {{rangefinder}} system camera {{manufactured by}} Mamiya. The first model was introduced in 1960, and the final model was discontinued in the 1970s. It was targeted at the professional press photography market, and {{a wide array of}} accessories was offered. The maximum image size that can be captured is 6 cm Ã— 9 cm, but images can be taken {{in a number of different}} formats, and using several types of film. All of the lenses have leaf shutters, which are released on the lens itself, not through the body as is typical with most cameras. The shutter is typically triggered from one of several models of removable grips, all of which have a built-in release cable. The lenses also have flash <b>sync</b> <b>terminals.</b> The camera lacks an internal dark slide, so one has to be inserted into the film holder before changing the lens.|$|R
50|$|The Pentax MG was {{a manual}} focus, {{aperture}} priority camera, with no manual settings of speeds. The Pentax MG had an electronic {{focal plane shutter}} from 1s to 1/1000, synchronized at 1/100. The shutter curtains were metal and had a vertical movement. However, if the batteries fail the camera still operated at 1/100s or B, thus the selector around the release button had three positions: Auto, 100X (1/100, <b>X</b> <b>sync)</b> and B.The exposure meter was center-weighted TTL type with open aperture measuring for Pentax M compatible lenses.The Pentax MG could use any pentax K-mount and can still be used with current Pentax lensesThere was a self-timer and a hot shoe with an additional contact for dedicated Pentax flash units.The Pentax MG used 2 SR-44 batteries or equivalent to power it.|$|R
50|$|Baiyun International Airport {{is served}} by the Airport South Station on Line 3 of the Guangzhou Metro. In the future, The Airport North Station will be opened in <b>sync</b> with the <b>Terminal</b> 2.|$|R
40|$|A {{breadboard}} <b>sync</b> satellite <b>terminal</b> {{has been}} developed incorporating a unique concept of a gimballess multi-access transceiver, which is capable of simultaneously communicating with six independent, asynchronous LEO satellites. The developmental hardware illustrates that low power, weight, and volume is achievable compared to multiple independent gimballed transceivers, while also putting a lesser burden of power, size, and weight on the LEO satellite tranceivers that communicate with the multiple-access transceiver...|$|R
50|$|The Mamiya C {{series is}} a line of twin-lens reflex medium-format system cameras {{manufactured}} by Mamiya between 1956 and 1994. It was developed from the Mamiyaflex series of cameras built from 1949 to 1956. The Mamiya C series was initially aimed at the professional market, but some later models were intended for amateurs. Unlike most TLR cameras, the Mamiya C has interchangeable lenses. The upper and lower lenses come off as a unit, and are available in at least seven different focal lengths. The lower lens of each unit has an aperture diaphragm {{as well as a}} leaf shutter. A flash <b>sync</b> <b>terminal</b> is part of the lens unit, and the delay can be set to M or X mode. The camera has an interlocking baffle that enables lenses to be changed without exposing the film. Focusing is done via a bellows system on the front side of the camera. Early models had separate film advance and shutter cocking mechanisms; on later models the shutter was automatically cocked. There is no metering in the camera body, so an external light meter is necessary. Viewfinders with built-in meters were available as accessories with later models.|$|R
50|$|Apple added Quick Sync {{support in}} OS X Mountain Lion for AirPlay Mirroring, FaceTime and QuickTime X. iMovie 10 and Final Cut Pro <b>X</b> use Quick <b>Sync</b> when {{exporting}} videos. Third party software includes MacX Video Converter Pro and ScreenFlow..|$|R
5000|$|All lenses have {{internal}} electronic Seiko #1 shutters with {{a maximum}} 1/400 sec speed, PC-type <b>X</b> flash <b>sync</b> plug, T-switch for long exposures, a plug for standard remote cable release for B exposures, depth of field preview lever, distance scale, aperture adjust ring. In [...] "B" [...] mode, the RZ67 models will expose up to 30 seconds (a warning beep will sound for the last 10 seconds). In [...] "T" [...] mode, the camera can expose indefinitely without drawing power from the battery. Most lenses, except for the 37 mm, 75 mm shift lenses and the 500 mm lenses have 77 mm filter threads {{on the front of}} the lens. The 75 mm shift lenses and the 500 mm lenses have 105 mm filter threads. Some lenses have a floating element; focusing these lenses involves setting a subject distance ring on the lens after focusing with the bellows.|$|R
