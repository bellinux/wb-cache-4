40|$|The Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) of the SOLAR-A {{mission is}} {{designed}} to produce <b>X-ray</b> <b>movies</b> of flares with excellent angular and time resolution as well as full-disk X-ray images for general studies. A selection of thin metal filters provide a measure of temperature discrimination and aid in obtaining the wide dynamic range required for solar observing. The co-aligned SXT aspect telescope will yield optical images for aspect reference, white-light flare and sunspot studies, and, possibly, helioseismology. This paper describes the capabilities and characteristics of the SXT for scientific observing...|$|E

500|$|To {{study the}} {{behavior}} of converging shock waves, Robert Serber devised the RaLa Experiment, which used the short-lived radioisotope lanthanum-140, a potent source of gamma radiation. The gamma ray source {{was placed in the}} center of a metal sphere surrounded by the explosive lenses, which in turn were inside in an ionization chamber. This allowed the taking of an <b>X-ray</b> <b>movie</b> of the implosion. The lenses were designed primarily using this series of tests. In his history of the Los Alamos project, David Hawkins wrote: [...] "RaLa became the most important single experiment affecting the final bomb design".|$|R

40|$|By {{examining}} many X-ray jets in Hinode/XRT coronal <b>X-ray</b> <b>movies</b> of {{the polar}} coronal holes, we found {{that there is a}} dichotomy of polar X-ray jets. About two thirds fit the standard reconnection picture for coronal jets, and about one third are another type. We present observations indicating that the non-standard jets are counterparts of erupting-loop H alpha macrospicules, jets in which the jet-base magnetic arch undergoes a miniature version of the blowout eruptions that produce major CMEs. From the coronal <b>X-ray</b> <b>movies</b> we present in detail two typical standard X-ray jets and two typical blowout X-ray jets that were also caught in He II 304 Angstrom snapshots from STEREO/EUVI. The distinguishing features of blowout X-ray jets are (1) X-ray brightening inside the base arch in addition to the outside bright point that standard jets have, (2) blowout eruption of the base arch's core field, often carrying a filament of cool (T ~ 10 (exp 4) - 10 (exp 5) K) plasma, and (3) an extra jet-spire strand rooted close to the bright point. We present cartoons showing how reconnection during blowout eruption of the base arch could produce the observed features of blowout X-ray jets. We infer that (1) the standard-jet/blowout-jet dichotomy of coronal jets results from the dichotomy of base arches that do not have and base arches that do have enough shear and twist to erupt open, and (2) there is a large class of spicules that are standard jets and a comparably large class of spicules that are blowout jets...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} establishes {{the feasibility of}} using synchrotron-generated X-ray beams for time-resolved in situ imaging and diffraction of the interior components of an internal combustion engine during its operation. The demonstration experiment was carried out on beamline I 12 (JEEP) at Diamond Light Source, UK. The external hutch of the JEEP instrument is a large-scale engineering test bed for complex in situ processing and simulation experiments. The hutch incorporates a large capacity translation and rotation table and a selection of detectors for monochromatic and white-beam diffraction and imaging. These capabilities were used to record <b>X-ray</b> <b>movies</b> of a motorcycle internal combustion engine running at 1850 r. p. m. and to measure strain inside the connecting rod via stroboscopic X-ray diffraction measurement. The high penetrating ability and high flux of the X-ray beam at JEEP allowed the observation of inlet and outlet valve motion, {{as well as that}} of the piston, connecting rod and the timing chain within the engine. Finally, the dynamic internal strain within the moving connecting rod was evaluated with an accuracy of ~ 50 × 10 (- 6) ...|$|E
40|$|SummaryA {{key feature}} of speech is its stereotypical 5  Hz rhythm [1, 2]. One theory posits that this rhythm evolved through the {{modification}} of rhythmic facial movements in ancestral primates [3, 4]. If the hypothesis has any validity, then a comparative approach may shed some light. We tested this idea by using cineradiography (<b>X-ray</b> <b>movies)</b> to characterize and quantify the internal {{dynamics of the}} macaque monkey vocal tract during lip-smacking (a rhythmic facial expression) versus chewing. Previous human studies showed that speech movements are faster than chewing movements, and the functional coordination between vocal tract structures is different between the two behaviors [5 – 9]. If rhythmic speech evolved through a rhythmic ancestral facial movement, then one hypothesis is that monkey lip-smacking versus chewing should also exhibit these differences. We found that the lips, tongue, and hyoid move with a speech-like 5  Hz rhythm during lip-smacking, but not during chewing. Most importantly, the functional coordination between these structures was distinct for each behavior. These data provide empirical support for {{the idea that the}} human speech rhythm evolved from the rhythmic facial expressions of ancestral primates...|$|E

50|$|Heilman {{was born}} on Christmas Day, 1933 in Tarentum, Pennsylvania, a small Pittsburgh suburb. His father Glenn, Glenn's father U.O., and Glenn's brother and sister were all physicians. Heilman's brother, Dan, and son, Carl, are also physicians. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Arts degree and {{chemistry}} major in 1955, he entered the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine graduating in 1959. There, he developed an interest in medical research and realized that coming technologic advances would provide opportunities for innovative products having breakthrough diagnostic and therapeutic potential. After medical school graduation, he completed a general medical internship in 1960. During this time, a prominent cardiologist from the Cleveland Clinic showed him {{an early version of}} an <b>x-ray</b> <b>movie</b> of blood combined with iodine-based contrast medium moving through a patient's heart. Heilman immediately recognized that angiography, the field of providing contrast media-enhanced moving images of a patient's heart, arteries and veins would provide physicians with an extremely valuable diagnostic tool. Having already decided to pursue a career developing medical devices, Heilman opted to forgo a specialty residency. Instead, he joined the US Air Force to satisfy a deferred military service obligation and was stationed at the Soesterberg Air Force base in the Netherlands, where he spent two years as the Military Officer in charge of the 654th Air Force Tactical Hospital. This facility offered first level medical care for approximately 3,500 US military personnel and dependents stationed in the Netherlands. Specialty care for military personnel was provided by air flight to the USAF Wiesbaden Hospital in Germany and the military dependents received their specialty care from the Dutch economy. The Soesterberg air base supported both Dutch and American aircraft as part of the NATO defense system during the cold war. The American aircraft were supersonic fighter interceptor F-102s having air-to-air guided nuclear missiles.|$|R
40|$|TiAl {{castings}} {{are prone}} to various defects including bubbles entrained during the turbulent filling of moulds. The present research has exploited {{the principles of the}} Durville tilt casting technique to develop a novel process in which the Induction Skull Melting (ISM) of TiAl alloys in a vacuum chamber has been combined with controlled tilt pouring to achieve the tranquil transfer of the metal into a hot ceramic shell mould. Practical casting equipment has been developed to evaluate the feasibility of this process in parallel with the development of novel software to simulate and optimize it. The PHYSICA CFD code was used to simulate the filling, heat transfer and solidification during tilt pouring using a number of free surface modelling techniques, including the novel Counter Diffusion Method (CDM). In view of the limited superheat, particular attention was paid to the mould design to minimize heat loss and gas entrainment caused by interaction between the counter-flowing metal and gas streams. The model has been validated against real-time <b>X-ray</b> <b>movies</b> of the tilt casting of aluminium and against TiAl blade castings. Modelling has contributed to designing a mould to promote progressive filling of the casting and has led to the use of a parabolic tilting cycle to balance the competing requirements for rapid filling to minimize the loss of superheat and slow filling minimize the turbulence-induced defects...|$|E
40|$|From H-alpha movies from Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences {{and from}} Prairie View Solar Observatory, hard <b>X-ray</b> <b>movies</b> from RHESSI, {{line-of-sight}} magnetogram movies from SOHO/MDI, and vector magnetograms from Marshal Space Flight Center, {{we examine the}} magnetic structure and evolution of the large delta-sunspot active region NOAA 10486 {{in relation to the}} onset and development of the two X-class flares that occurred in this active region on 28 and 29 October 2003. We find evidence that each of these flares was triggered by strongly sheared magnetic field via "tether-cutting" reconnection with adjacent/overlying strongly sheared field. In the first flare, the initial brightening in H-alpha: (1) was partly rooted in emerging sheared magnetic field {{along the edge of the}} large positive-polarity flux domain of the delta sunspot, and (2) consisted of four flare kernels, two in negative magnetic flux and two in positive magnetic flux. In the second flare, the brightening started in the core of a Z-shaped sigmoidal sheared magnetic field and the inner two of four H-alpha kernels were visible in 30 - 50 Kev hard X-ray image from RHESSI. Each flare spread from the initial quadrupolar brightening to develop into a much larger two-ribbon flare straddling a much more extensive swath of strongly sheared field along the edge of the large positive-flux domain of the delta sunspot, the first flare on the leading side and the second flare on the trailing side of this domain. Thus, localized internal reconnection triggered the explosion of these extensive sheared magnetic fields...|$|E
40|$|Early {{measurements}} of the vocal tract have led to numerous insights into the way the acoustic signal is shaped by the mouth. One important adjunct to measurement has been analog modeling and detailed acoustic analysis. Some early measurements, such as Stevens’ exemplary x-ray film, are still being analyzed today, due to the continuing challenge of measuring the speech articulators. Although <b>x-ray</b> <b>movies</b> have provided the fullest depiction of the moving vocal tract, they are difficult to obtain and quantify. Recent point source measurements (electromagnetometry and x-ray microbeam) {{have been successful in}} characterizing anterior tongue movements, but their inherent limitations prevent imaging of the pharynx, which has a large effect on the acoustic output. Very recently, cine MRI and optically-corrected ultrasound have surpassed the x-ray capability of obtaining large data sets of images of the vocal tract during running speech. These techniques are less demanding on the speaker and thus applicable to a wider range of talkers. With these new measurements, {{we should be able to}} refine our modeling, which always has compromises, and to better explore the relationship between vocal tract shape and the resulting acoustics. They should also help us address the inverse problem (i. e., that there are, theoretically, many possible tract shapes that can result in a given spectrum), and allow us to examine changes in articulator position that do not result in measurable acoustic differences. We are poised to build upon the substantial foundations of speech production research and advance to additional insights with these new techniques...|$|E
40|$|Soft X-ray {{images of}} solar active regions {{frequently}} show S- or inverse-S (sigmoidal) morphology. We {{have studied the}} Yohkoh Soft <b>X-Ray</b> Telescope video <b>movie</b> for 1993 and 1997. We have classified active regions according to morphology (sigmoidal or non-sigmoidal) and nature of activity (eruptive or non-eruptive). As well, we have used NOAA sunspot areas for each region {{as a measure of}} size. We find that regions are significantly more likely to be eruptive if they are either sigmoidal or large. 1. Introduction As viewed in soft X-rays, coronal active regions consist of discrete bright loops. These loops often collectively form sinuous S or inverse-S shapes [Acton et al., 1992]. This shape has been named "sigmoidal" by Rust and Kumar [1996], who studied the characteristics of sigmoidal brightenings in X-rays. They found that such brightenings typically evolve from a bright, sharp-edged sigmoidal feature into either an arcade of loops or a di#use cloud. It is clear that such arcades o [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{battle at}} LZ X-Ray was {{documented}} in the CBS special report Battle of Ia Drang Valley by Morley Safer and the critically acclaimed book We Were Soldiers Once...

In 1994, Moore, Galloway and men who fought on both the American and North Vietnamese sides, traveled back to the remote jungle clearings where the battle took place. At the time the U.S. did not have diplomatic relations with Vietnam.

In 2002, Randall Wallace depicted the battle at LZ <b>X-Ray</b> in the <b>movie</b> We Were Soldiers starring Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper as Moore and Galloway, respectively. Galloway later described this battle that he calls 'Ia Drang' as [...] "The battle that convinced Ho Chi Minh he could win;" [...] Ho Chi Minh was the leader of North Vietnam at the time.|$|R
40|$|Yamauchi et al (2004, ApJ, 605, 511) {{found that}} there are two {{structurally}} and dynamically distinct types of H macrospicules in polar coronal holes: single-column jet macrospicules and erupting-loop macrospicules. The structure and motion of the single-column jet macrospicules fit the standard Shibata reconnection picture for solar X-ray jets (Shibata et al 1992, PASJ, 44, L 173). The form and motion of the erupting-loop macrospicules is reminiscent of the ejective eruption of the sheared-core-field flux rope in the filament-eruption birth of a bubble-type coronal mass ejection (CME). That roughly half of all polar H macrospicules were observed to be erupting-loop macrospicules suggests {{that there should be a}} corresponding large class of X-ray jets in which the emerging bipole at the base of the jet undergoes a blowout eruption as in a bubble-type CME, instead of staying closed as in the standard picture for X-ray jets. Along with a cartoon of the standard picture, we present a cartoon depicting the signatures to be expected of a blowout jet in high-resolution coronal <b>X-ray</b> <b>movies</b> such as from Hinode/XRT. From Hinode/XRT movies in polar coronal holes, we show: (1) examples of X-ray jets that fit the standard picture very well, and (2) other examples that do not fit the standard picture but do show signatures appropriate for blowout jets. These signatures are (1) a flare arcade inside the emerging bipole in addition to the flare arcade produced between the emerging bipole and the ambient high-reaching unipolar field by reconnection of these two fields as in the standard picture, and (2) in addition to the jet prong expected from the standard reconnection, a second jet prong or strand, one that could not be produced by the standard reconnection but could be produced by reconnection between the ambient unipolar field and one leg of an erupting core-field flux rope that has blown out the emerging bipole. We therefore infer that these "two pronged" jets are made by miniature versions of the sheared-core-bipole explosions that produce bubble-type CMEs.
