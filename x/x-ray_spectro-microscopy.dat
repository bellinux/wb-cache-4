In addition, chemical information—i. e. the elemental distribution—can be retrieved by <b>X-ray</b> <b>spectro-microscopy</b> based on contrast variation around photon absorption edges and X-ray fluorescence. For a long time, X-ray microscopy has been limited in resolution by the fabrication of zone plate lenses, in particular for the hard X-ray range, which is needed to penetrate multicellular samples.

40|$|We {{have used}} a MHz lock-in <b>x-ray</b> <b>spectro-microscopy</b> {{technique}} to directly detect changes of magnetic moments in Cu due to spin injection from an adjacent Co layer. The elemental and chemical specificity of x-rays allows us to distinguish two spin current induced effects. We detect the creation of transient magnetic moments of 3 × 10 ^- 5 μ_B on Cu atoms within {{the bulk of the}} 28 nm thick Cu film due to spin-accumulation. The moment value is compared to predictions by Mott's two current model. We also observe that the hybridization induced existing magnetic moments on Cu interface atoms are transiently increased by about 10...|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the last}} 15 {{years he has}} {{concentrated}} {{on the use of}} polarized soft x-rays to study magnetic materials and phenomena, especially thin films, interfaces and nanoscale structures. He has pioneered <b>x-ray</b> magnetic <b>spectro-microscopy</b> which allows the direct observation of nanoscale antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic domain structures with elemental and chemical state specificity. Motivated by the technological drive of “smaller and faster”, he has also pioneered time-resolved x-ray microscopy techniques with picosecond time resolution. These studies and more generally the whole field of magnetism form the topic of his second book, “Magnetism - From Fundamentals to Nanoscale Dynamics” (Springer, 2006), which he co-authored with Hans Christoph Siegmann.|$|R
40|$|The high {{brightness}} of the bend magnets at the Advanced Light Source has been exploited to illuminate a Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscope (STXM). This is the first diffraction-limited scanning x-ray microscope to operate with useful count rate on a synchrotron bend magnet source. A simple, dedicated beam line has been built covering the range of photon energy from 250 eV to 600 eV. Ease of use and operational availability are radically improved compared to previous installations using undulator beams. This facility provides radiation for C 1 s, N 1 s and O 1 s near edge <b>x-ray</b> absorption <b>spectro-microscopy</b> with a spectral resolution up to about 1 : 5000 and with STXM count rates in excess of 1 MHz...|$|R
40|$|The {{arrangement}} of spins at interfaces in a layered magnetic material often {{has an important}} effect on {{the properties of the}} material. One example of this is the directional coupling between the spins in an antiferromagnet and those in an adjacent ferromagnet, an effect first discovered(1) in 1956 and referred to as exchange bias. Because of its technological importance for the development of advanced devices such as magnetic read heads(2) and magnetic memory cells(3), this phenomenon has received much attention(4, 5). Despite extensive studies, however, exchange bias is still poorly understood, largely {{due to the lack of}} techniques capable of providing detailed information about the {{arrangement of}} magnetic moments near interfaces. Here we present polarization-dependent <b>X-ray</b> magnetic dichroism <b>spectro-microscopy</b> that reveals the micromagnetic structure on both sides of a ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic interface. Images of thin ferromagnetic Co films grown on antiferromagnetic LaFeO 3 show a direct link between the arrangement of spins in each material. Remanent hysteresis loops, recorded for individual ferromagnetic domains, show a local exchange bias. Our results imply that the alignment of the ferromagnetic spins is determined, domain by domain, by the spin directions in the underlying antiferromagnetic layer. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to incorporate cobalt atoms into a magnetite single crystal {{is demonstrated by}} a combination of <b>x-ray</b> <b>spectro-microscopy,</b> low-energy electron diffraction, and density-functional theory calculations. Co is deposited at room temperature on the reconstructed magnetite (001) surface filling first the subsurface octahedral vacancies and then occupying adatom sites on the surface. Progressive annealing treatments at temperatures up to 733 K diffuse the Co atoms into deeper crystal positions, mainly into octahedral ones with a marked inversion level. The oxidation state, coordination, and magnetic moments of the cobalt atoms are followed from their adsorption to their final incorporation into the bulk, mostly as octahedral Co. This precise control of the near-surface Co atoms location opens up the way to accurately tune the surface physical and magnetic properties of mixed spinel oxides. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSilver {{nanoparticles}} (AgNPs) {{are increasingly}} used as antimicrobial additives in consumer products {{and may have}} adverse impacts on organisms when they inadvertently enter ecosystems. This study investigated the uptake and toxicity of AgNPs to the common grass, Lolium multiflorum. We found that root and shoot Ag content increased with increasing AgNP exposures. AgNPs inhibited seedling growth. While exposed to 40 mg L(- 1) GA-coated AgNPs, seedlings failed to develop root hairs, had highly vacuolated and collapsed cortical cells and broken epidermis and rootcap. In contrast, seedlings exposed to identical concentrations of AgNO(3) or supernatants of ultracentrifuged AgNP solutions showed no such abnormalities. AgNP toxicity was influenced by total NP surface area with smaller AgNPs (6 nm) more strongly affecting growth than did similar concentrations of larger (25 nm) NPs for a given mass. Cysteine (which binds Ag(+)) mitigated the effects of AgNO(3) but did not reduce the toxicity of AgNP treatments. <b>X-ray</b> <b>spectro-microscopy</b> documented silver speciation within exposed roots and suggested that silver is oxidized within plant tissues. Collectively, {{this study suggests that}} growth inhibition and cell damage can be directly attributed either to the nanoparticles themselves or to the ability of AgNPs to deliver dissolved Ag to critical biotic receptors...|$|E
40|$|Synchrotron-based sulfur {{spectroscopy}} {{reveals a}} common concern for marine archaeological wood from seawater: accumulation of reduced sulfur compounds in two pathways. The distribution of sulfur {{species in the}} oak wood cell structure was mapped by scanning <b>x-ray</b> <b>spectro-microscopy</b> (SXM). Organically bound sulfur was found within lignin-rich parts, identified mainly as thiols and disulfides by sulfur K-edge x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Particles of iron sulfides, which may form {{in the presence of}} corroding iron, appeared in wood cavities. Cores scanned by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) show that high sulfur accumulation is restricted to the surface layers for the Swedish shipwreck Vasa, while the distribution is rather uniform throughout the hull timbers of the Mary Rose, U. K. Laboratory experiments, exposing fresh pine to simulated seabed conditions, show that the organically bound sulfur develop in reactions between lignin, exposed by cellulose-degrading erosion bacteria, and hydrogen sulfide produced in situ by scavenging sulfate reducing bacteria. With bacteria inoculated from shipwreck samples also iron sulfides formed. The iron sulfides oxidise in high humidity, and are the probable main cause of the numerous outbreaks on the Vasa’s hull of acidic sulfate salts, which were identified by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The iron ions catalyse several wood-degrading oxidative processes. Multi-elemental analyses were performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA). The present amounts of total S remaining in the Vasa and the Mary Rose are estimated to at least 2 tonnes. After the Vasa´s spray treatment with polyethylene glycol solutions ceased in 1979, the continuing oxidation processes are estimated to have produced 2 tonnes of sulfuric acid in the wood. Laboratory experiments to gently neutralize acidic Vasa wood by ammonia gas have been conducted with promising results...|$|E
