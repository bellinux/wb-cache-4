40|$|<b>Xylene</b> is a cyclic hydrocarbon, and an {{environmental}} pollutant. It {{is also used}} in dyes, paints, polishes, medical technology and different industries as a solvent. <b>Xylene</b> easily vaporizes and divides by sunlight into other harmless chemicals. The aim of the present review is to collect {{the evidence of the}} <b>xylene</b> toxicity, related to non-cancerous health hazards, as well as to provide possible effective measurement to minimize its risk ratio. For current study a bibliographic search of more than 250 peer-reviewed papers in scientific data including PubMed, and Google Scholar about <b>xylene</b> was done. But approximately 130 peer-reviewed papers relevant to <b>xylene</b> were included (Figure 1). All scientific data was reviewed with key words of “xylene toxicity”, “xylene toxic health effects”, “environmental volatile organic compounds”, “human exposure to xylene”, “xylene poisoning in laboratory workers”, “effects of <b>xylene</b> along with other hydrocarbons”, “neurotoxicity of selected hydrocarbons”, and “toxic effects of particular <b>xylene</b> isomers in animals”. According to these studies, <b>xylene</b> is released into the atmosphere as fugitive emissions from petrochemical industries, fire, cigarette, from different vehicles. Short term exposure to mixed <b>xylene</b> or their individual isomers result in irritation of the nose, eyes and throat subsequently leading toward neurological, gastrointestinal and reproductive harmful effects. In addition long term exposure to <b>xylene</b> may cause hazardous effects on respiratory system, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and renal system. The health concerns of <b>xylene</b> are well documented in animals and human. It is important to improve health policies, launch <b>xylene</b> related health and toxicity awareness campaigns, to get rid of its dangerous outcomes. Chronic diseases have become a threat to human globally, with special prominence in regions, where <b>xylene</b> is used with other chemicals (benzene, toluene etc.) especially in petroleum and rubber industry.

25|$|In organic chemistry, Carnelley's Rule, {{established}} in 1882 by Thomas Carnelley, states that high molecular symmetry {{is associated with}} high melting point. Carnelley based his rule on examination of 15,000 chemical compounds. For example, for three structural isomers with molecular formula C5H12 the melting point increases in the series isopentane −160°C (113 K) n-pentane −129.8°C (143 K) and neopentane −16.4°C (256.8 K). Likewise in <b>xylenes</b> and also dichlorobenzenes the melting point increases in the order meta, ortho and then para. Pyridine has a lower symmetry than benzene hence its lower melting point but the melting point again increases with diazine and triazines. Many cage-like compounds like adamantane and cubane with high symmetry have relatively high melting points.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Ethylbenzene is an {{important}} constituent of widely used solvent mixtures in industry. The objective {{of the present study}} was to provide information about biological monitoring of occupational exposure to ethylbenzene, and to review the biological limit values corresponding to the threshold limit value of ethylbenzene. METHODS: A total of 20 male workers who had been exposed to a mixture of ethylbenzene and <b>xylene,</b> through painting and solvent mixing with commercial <b>xylene</b> in a metal industry, were recruited into this study. Environmental and biological monitoring were performed during an entire week. The urinary metabolites monitored were mandelic acid for ethylbenzene and methylhippuric acid for <b>xylene.</b> Correlations were analyzed between urinary metabolites and environmental exposure for ethylbenzene and <b>xylene.</b> The interaction effects of a binary exposure to ethylbenzene and <b>xylene</b> were also investigated using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. RESULTS: The average environmental concentration of organic solvents was 12. 77 ppm for <b>xylene,</b> and 3. 42 ppm for ethylbenzene. A significant correlation (R 2 = 0. 503) was found between environmental <b>xylene</b> and urinary methylhippuric acid. Urinary level of methylhippuric acid corresponding to 100 ppm of <b>xylene</b> was 1. 96 g/g creatinine in the worker study, whereas it was calculated as 1. 55 g/g creatinine by the PBPK model. Urinary level of mandelic acid corresponding to 100 ppm of ethylbenzene was found to be 0. 7 g/g creatinine. PBPK results showed that the metabolism of ethylbenzene was highly depressed by co-exposure to high concentrations of <b>xylene</b> leading to a non-linear behavior. CONCLUSIONS: At low exposures, both methylhippuric acid and mandelic acid can be used as indicators of commercial <b>xylene</b> exposures. However at higher concentrations mandelic acid cannot be recommended as a biological indicator due to the saturation of mandelic acid produced by the co-exposure to <b>xylene...</b>|$|R

Results: With a carbon nanotube dose of 1 g/l, <b>xylene</b> concentration of 10 mg/l, pH 7, and a contact time of 10 minutes, the equilibrium adsorption capacity (q e (mg/g)) of SWCNT was 9. 2 mg/g, which was higher than that for MWCNT (8. 9 mg/g). The SWCNT revealed a better performance for <b>xylene</b> sorption than the MWCNT. Results of a desorption study showed that <b>xylene</b> adsorbed onto the SWCNT and MWCNT can be easily desorbed at 105 ± 2 °C. Conclusions: It is concluded that recycled carbon nanotubes on heating for the first time, show a better performance for <b>xylene</b> adsorption than when they are raw.

Black Carbon is released into the air from incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fluids contributing to global climate change and human health effects.

2500|$|MOFs have {{potential}} as heterogeneous catalysts, although applications {{have not been}} commercialized. [...] Their high surface area, tunable porosity, diversity in metal and functional groups make them especially attractive for use as catalysts. Zeolites are extraordinarily useful in catalysis. Zeolites are limited by the fixed tetrahedral coordination of the Si/Al connecting points and the two-coordinated oxide linkers. [...] Fewer than 200 zeolites are known. [...] In contrast with this limited scope, MOFs exhibit more diverse coordination geometries, polytopic linkers, and ancillary ligands (F−, OH−, H2O among others). It is also difficult to obtain zeolites with pore sizes larger than 1nm, which limits the catalytic applications of zeolites to relatively small organic molecules (typically no larger than <b>xylenes).</b> Furthermore, mild synthetic conditions typically employed for MOF synthesis allow direct incorporation of delicate functionalities into the framework structures.

Nonencapsulated CNS strains adhered well to FEP, whereas their adherence to <b>xylene</b> ranged widely. Encapsulated strains with low adherence to <b>xylene</b> showed slight adherence to FEP. Encapsulated strains which adhered well to <b>xylene</b> ranged widely in their adherence to FEP. It was concluded that results obtained from the <b>xylene</b> adherence test were not predictive of the adherence of CNS to the hydrophobic FEP surface.

Bacterial adherence to FEP was decreased when FEP films were exposed to a solution containing extracellular products (EP) obtained from a slime-producing CNS strain. Bacterial adherence to <b>xylene</b> also decreased when the bacterial suspensions contained EP. Apparently, initial adherence of CNS to FEP and <b>xylene</b> is hampered by EP. Nonencapsulated and encapsulated CNS pretreated with proteolytic enzymes failed to adhere to <b>xylene</b> and FEP, indicating that intact surface proteins or constituents associated with surface proteins mediated their adherence to <b>xylene</b> and FEP.

The physicochemical properties of MWCNT such as structure and availability surface were improved due to convert tubes into sheets that cause significantly increase in <b>xylene</b> adsorption. The equilibrium amount (qe (mg/g)) in nano material's dose of 1 g/l, <b>xylene</b> concentration of 10 mg/l, contact time of 10 min, and pH 7, for SCNT (qe 9. 8 mg/g) {{was higher than}} single wall carbon nano tubes (SWCNT) (qe 9. 2 mg/g) and MWCNT (qe 8. 9 mg/g).

In this study, we introduced a novel, non-toxic <b>xylene</b> substitute (SBO), which was generated through a mixture of 86 % of white oil No. 2 and 14 % of N-heptane. SBO had a high boiling point (188 °C) and flash point (144 °C) coupled with a scentless and decreased volatility. To compare the effectiveness of SBO and <b>xylene</b> in histology, {{a wide range of}} tissue samples from rats and human beings were processed in parallel in SBO and <b>xylene,</b> subjected to various staining procedures. Similar to the xylene-processed paraffin blocks, the SBO-processed counterparts were easy to section without any evidence of cell shrinkage. Assessment of the SBO-treated sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin revealed a good maintenance of cell morphology and structure, and a clear definition of the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Moreover, comparable good results were achieved between the SBO- and xylene-processed tissues in other histochemical and immunohistochemical stainings. Six-month clinical applications at one department of pathology supported the potentials of SBO as a <b>xylene</b> substitute.

In 2005 the environmental risk assessment for musk <b>xylene</b> concluded that there was a need for further information and/or testing because the substance {{is considered to be a}} PBT candidate chemical and a further PBT ¿ testing strategy was proposed. Conclusion regarding persistency: the extractable part of musk <b>xylene</b> in sediment is subject to anaerobic degradation with half-lives of equal to or below 60 days. Musk <b>xylene</b> is therefore considered to be not persistent in sediment. In this assessment the observed irreversible binding to sediment is considered as dissipation. Given the fact that the metabolites in the ocean die-away test stayed in the water phase while the parent compound musk <b>xylene</b> volatilized and the fact that the ratio metabolites : parent compound was still close to one after 159 days, it is concluded that the half-life for biodegradation in seawater is more than 150 days, which significantly exceeds the criterion of 60 days. Musk <b>xylene</b> is therefore considered to be very persistent in water. Conclusion regarding bioaccumulation: The experimental bioaccumulation studies for musk <b>xylene</b> in fish showed a wide range of BCFs, among which values above the vB criterion of 5, 000 l/kg. Based on the evaluation of the critical study and its results it can be concluded that musk <b>xylene</b> is very bioaccumulative. Conclusion regarding toxicity: there is no substantiated evidence that musk <b>xylene</b> can cause endocrine disrupting effects. However, musk <b>xylene</b> is classified as Carcinogenic Category 3), although it is realised that it is a borderline case. The overall conclusion for musk <b>xylene</b> is that regarding toxicity it is considered to be a borderline case. However, in view of the vPvB properties of musk <b>xylene,</b> no additional testing is required.

It is seen that the adsorption isotherms of three <b>xylene</b> isomers over microporous and mesoporous Beta zeolites could be successfully described by the single-site Toth model and the dual-site Toth model, respectively. The enhanced adsorption capacities and decreased Henry’s constants (KH) and the initial heats of adsorption (Qst) for the all <b>xylene</b> isomers are observed after the introduction of mesopores in the zeolites. For three <b>xylene</b> isomers, the order of Henry’s constant is o-xylene > m-xylene > p-xylene, whereas the adsorption capacities of Beta zeolite samples for <b>xylene</b> isomers execute the following order of o-xylene > p-xylene > m-xylene, due to the comprehensive effects from the molecular configuration and electrostatic interaction.
