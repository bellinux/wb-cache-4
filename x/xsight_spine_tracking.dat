40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} the dosimetric impacts of lung tumor motion in robotic hypofractionated radiotherapy for lung cancers delivered through continuous tracking of the vertebrae by the <b>XSight</b> <b>Spine</b> <b>Tracking</b> (XST) mode of the CyberKnife. Materials and Methods: Four-dimensional computed tomography (4 DCT) scans of a dynamic thorax phantom were acquired. Three motion patterns (one-dimensional and three-dimensional) of different range were investigated. Monte Carlo dose distributions were generated with 4 DCT-derived internal target volume (ITV) with a treatment-specific setup margin for 12. 6 Gy/ 3 fractions. Six-dimensional error correction {{was performed by}} kV stereoscopic imaging of the phantom′s spine. Dosimetric effects of intrafractional tumor motion were assessed with Gafchromic films (Ashland Inc, Wayne, NJ, USA) according to 1) the percent measurement dose points having doses above the prescribed (P > Dpres), mean (P > Dm), and minimum (P > Dmin) ITV doses, and 2) the coefficient of variation (CV). Results: All plans attained the prescription dose after three fractions despite marked temporal dose variations. The value of P > Dpres was 100 % after three fractions for all plans, but could be smaller (~ 96 %) for one fraction. The values of P > Dmin and P > Dm varied drastically interfractionally (25 %- 2 %), and could be close to 0 % after three fractions. The average CV ranged from 2. 8 % to 7. 0 %. Correlations with collimator size were significant for P > Dmin and P > Dm (P 0. 05) but not P > Dpres (P > 0. 05). Conclusions: Treating lung tumors with CyberKnife through continuous tracking of the vertebrae should not be attempted without effective means to reduce the amplitude and variability of target motion because temporal dose variations owing to the intrafractional target motion can be significant...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Metastasis to {{adrenal gland}} from lung, breast, and kidney {{malignancies}} are quite common. Historically radiotherapy {{was intended for}} pain palliation. Recent studies with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) including Cyberknife robotic radiosurgery aiming at disease control brings about encouraging results. Here we represent the early clinical experience with Cyberknife stereotactic system from an Indian cancer care center. The main purpose of this retrospective review is {{to serve as a}} stepping stone for future prospective studies with non- invasive yet effective technique compared to surgery. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed four cases of adrenal metastases (three: lung and one: renal cell carcinoma) treated with Cyberknife SBRT. X sight <b>spine</b> <b>tracking</b> was employed for planning and treatment delivery. Patients were evaluated for local response clinically as well as with PETCT based response criteria. Results: With a median gross tumor volume of 20. 5 cc and median dose per fraction of 10 Gy, two patients had complete response (CR) and two had partial response (PR) when assessed 8 - 12 weeks post treatment as per RECIST. There was no RTOG grade 2 or more acute adverse events and organs at risk dosage were acceptable. Till last follow up all the patients were locally controlled and alive. Conclusion: Cyberknife SBRT with its unique advantages like non- invasive, short duration outpatient treatment technique culminating in similar local control rates in comparison to surgery is an attractive option. World literature of linear accelerator based SBRT and our data with Cyberknife SBRT with small sample size and early follow up are similar in terms of local control in adrenal metastases.

40|$|Purpose/Objective(s) : Stereotactic body {{radiation}} therapy (SBRT) {{has been shown}} to have increased local control and overall survival relative to conventional external beam {{radiation therapy}} in patients with medically inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Excellent rates of local control have been demonstrated both in clinical trials as well as in single-center studies at large academic institutions. However, there is limited data on the experiences of small academic hospitals with SBRT for Stage I NSCLC. The {{purpose of this study is}} to report the local control and overall survival rates in patients treated with SBRT for Stage I NSCLC at Winthrop-University Hospital (WUH), a small academic hospital. Materials/Methods: This is a retrospective review of 78 Stage I central and peripheral NSCLC tumors treated between December 2006 and July 2012 with SBRT at WUH. Treatment was given utilizing fiducials and a respiratory tracking system. If the fiducials were not trackable, a <b>spine</b> <b>tracking</b> system was used for tumor localization. CT-based planning was performed using the ray trace algorithm. Treatment was delivered over 4 consecutive days for central tumors to a dose of 4800 cGy delivered in 4 fractions. Peripheral tumors were treated to a dose of 6000 cGy in 3 consecutive fractions. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate local control and overall survival. Results: The median age was 78. 5 years. 54 % of the patient population was female. 67 % of the tumors were Stage IA, and 33 % of the tumors were Stage IB. 53 % of the tumors were adenocarcinomas and 29 % were squamous cell carcinomas, with the remainder being of unknown histology or NSCLC, not otherwise specified The 2 -year local control rate was 87 %, and the two-year overall survival was 68 %.

40|$|This {{retrospective}} analysis examines the local control and toxicity of 5 fraction fiducial-free CyberKnife stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for single vertebral body metastases. All patients had favorable performance status (ECOG 0 - 1), oligometastatic disease and no prior spine irradiation. A prescribed dose of 30 to 35 Gy was delivered in 5 fractions to the planning treatment volume (PTV) using the CyberKnife with X-sight <b>spine</b> <b>tracking.</b> Suggested maximum spinal cord and esophagus point doses were 30 Gy and 40 Gy, respectively. A median 30 Gy (range, 30 - 35 Gy) dose {{was delivered to}} a median prescription isodose line of 70 % (range, 60 - 80 %) to 20 patients. At 34 months median follow-up (range, 12 - 62 months) for surviving patients, the 1 - and 2 -year Kaplan-Meier local control estimates were 80 % and 73 %, respectively. Two of the 5 local failures were infield in patients who had received partial vertebral body irradiation and 3 were paravertebral failures just outside the PTV in patients with prior corpectomy. No local failures occurred in patients who completed total vertebral body radiation alone. The 1 - and 2 -year Kaplan-Meier overall survival estimates were 80 % and 57 %, respectively. Most deaths were attributed to metastatic disease; one death was attributed to local recurrence. The mean maximum point doses were 26. 4 Gy (range, 16. 3 - 31. 8 Gy) to the spinal cord and 30. 7 Gy (15. 4 - 40. 0 Gy) to the esophagus. Patients receiving maximum esophagus point doses greater than 35 Gy experienced acute dysphagia (Grade I/II). No spinal cord toxicity was documented. Five fraction fiducial-free CyberKnife SBRT is an acceptable treatment option for newly diagnosed vertebral body metastases with promising local control rates and minimal toxicity despite the close proximity of such tumors to the spinal cord and esophagus.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} unified around {{the theme of}} disc height loss. Current {{knowledge}} {{in the area of}} spine research identifies mechanical overload as the culprit for the initiation of injury to the spine. While genetic predispositions may play a factor in the severity of spine degeneration or in the resiliency to applied load, ultimately, injury occurs when a load exceeds a tissue’s tolerance. Disc height loss {{has the potential to be}} a primary factor in the progression of spinal degeneration. For example, disc height has been touted as a major component for the initiation of pathological and degenerative changes to the spine. Pathologic, non-recoverable disc height loss can occur through herniation or endplate fracture and could result in a degenerative cascade of injury that eventually involves the facet joints, narrows nerve root space, and increases stress at adjacent segments. What is not known is the degree to which disc height affects the degenerative cascade; that is, there is no quantitative data outlining the progression of mechanical consequences at adjacent segments or at the injured segment itself during disc height loss. Further, the degree to which restoring disc height, if even possible, will reverse the process of degeneration is not entirely clear. There is data which suggests that nucleus replacement can restore stress distributions within an injured disc, but the extent of repair material survivability is unknown. Finally, clinical categories of measuring spinal degeneration are based on visual cues and features from medical imaging. Understanding the links between joint visual cues and aberrant movement may help to guide clinical practice; researchers will gain greater insight into the mechanical consequences of anatomical features associated with degeneration. This thesis was comprised of three studies. Study 1 examined the effect of disc height loss and subsequent restoration using an injectable hydrogel on the relative kinematics of a segment with height loss and an adjacent segment. It was found that disc height loss produced an immediate effect, where relative angular displacement was reduced in the segment with height loss and increased in the adjacent segment. Restoring disc height with an injectable hydrogel brought the relative angular displacement of both segments back to their initial values. This study is the first of its kind to examine the immediate effects of disc height loss via loss of nucleus pulposus and restoration. Whether these effects are as clear in-vivo remains to be seen. Study 2 evaluated the efficacy of a novel repair strategy to restore the mechanical profile of a spine segment with disc height loss initiated via compressive fracture. The strategy employed the use of PMMA injected into the vertebral body to attempt to seal a fracture from above the disc, and an injectable hydrogel to restore disc height. The use of PMMA was found to restore the compressive stiffness of the injured segment to within approximately 20 % of its initial value, while the use of the injectable hydrogel restored the sagittal plane rotational stiffness to within approximately 50 - 80 % of its initial value. After further repetitive compression had been applied to the spine segment however, the restorative influence of both interventions was lost in terms of rotational and compressive stiffness. It was found that large cracks in the endplate prevented the hydrogel from being contained and quickly returned the segment back to its injured profile. Future efforts at restoring the disc while maintaining its anatomical structures need better methods of creating a sufficient seal inside the disc to allow it to re-pressurize and sustain the stresses encountered on a daily basis. Study 3 employed the use of a novel <b>spine</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithm developed as part of this thesis to evaluate sagittal plane cervical spine motion of a series of patient image sequences who had experienced trauma and had a chief complaint related to their neck, head, or shoulders. Some patients had evidence of disc height loss while others did not. Clinical subgroups were created that classified disc height loss as either moderate/severe (3 cases), mild (8 cases), or non-existent (9 cases). When normalized angular displacement of the C 5 /C 6 segment in a group with moderate to severe height loss was compared to the same level in a group with no height loss, there was a statistically significant difference in angular displacement between the two groups (p = 0. 004). Angular displacement at C 5 /C 6 was 20. 2 % ± 2. 3 % of total measured neck angular displacement in the moderate/severe height loss group compared to 30. 6 % ± 4. 0 % of total measured neck angular displacement in the group without height loss. Based on the limited sample size of this study it would appear that disc height loss creates a loss in range of motion. This work has further revealed the heterogeneous nature of individual segmental movement patterns. However, in the group without height loss, there was a systematic trend seen of an increasing angular displacement with descending segmental level. This was not observed in those with moderate to severe disc height loss. The broad implications of this work are that disc height loss influences spine kinematics, which has implications with respect to further injury propagation through the spinal linkage. Angular displacement of a spine segment appears to be governed by its local stiffness. Restoration of disc height under real injury scenarios is a difficult proposition and any attempts at repair need to sufficiently seal the disc space and prevent extrusion of nucleus pulposus or hydrogel-based implants. We now appreciate the difficulty in this objective. Further, repeating the mechanism of injury will reduce the mechanical effects of the restorative intervention, preventing this is highly important...|$|R
40|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is one of}} the most {{frequent}} medical problems in the western world and its consequent cost is enormous. However, despite the high occurrence of low back pain, diagnosis ofthe causes is still a major problem. Research has indicated that low back pain is often related to mechanical disorders of the spinal or holding elements. Therefore, it could be very helpful for clinical diagnosis to study the motion of lumbar spine in order to determine where abnormal motion exists and hence any sources of mechanical instability. Digital videofluoroscopy (DVF) is currently the only practical medical imaging technique to obtain real-time, continuous motion sequences of the lumbar spine. However, DVF images suffer from th~Jresence of noise, poor contrast and adjacent structures near the vertebrae due to the low radiation dosage. Recently, wavelet-based approaches have been applied in edge detection to acquire multiscale gradient images. In multi-scale detection, the edges are more accurately located with low scales but some false edges are produced; with large scales, fewer false edges are identified but traded against a reduced accuracy in the edge location. This project presents a scale multiplication in the identification of spinal vertebrae as a basis for quantifying kinematics. The scale multiplication is defined as the product of the response of the detection filter at different scales so that it combines the advantages of the low and large scales. Once edges are determined as the local maxima in scale multiplication, more robust detection results are obtained after thresholding. The threshold values are decided by the standard. deviation of the noise in the images. With the edge information of the lumbar spine vertebrae, biomechanical parameters, such as rotation and intervertebral angles can be measured via manual landmarking. Another development of this project is the automated tracking technique by using the Generalized Hough transform algorithm. With the mathematical description of the vertebral edges detected by the wavelet scale multiplication method; the vertebral movements in <b>spine</b> motion are <b>tracked.</b> This approach is applied to the DVF image sequences from a calibration model and from ten human subjects to demonstrate its reliability and robustness.

40|$|The brain {{with its}} neurons {{is a complex}} organ which is not yet fully decoded. Many {{diseases}} and human behavior {{are affected by the}} brain. In neurobiological experiments neurons are studied and imaging of neurons is a key technology. 2 -Photon Microscopy (2 PM) enables to image the volume of labeled, living, pyramidal neurons. Moreover, in a second channel a different marker can be used for specific structures. Synapses are not visible in 2 PM. However, the size of spines has a relation to the strength of synapses. Therefore, dendritic spines are of interest. Time series imaging of living neurons is possible too. The analysis of fluorescence images is difficult, time consuming and error-prone even for experts. Furthermore, the reproducibility of manual analysis is not given. Therefore, the automatic detection, segmentation and <b>tracking</b> of dendritic <b>spines</b> in 2 PM data are required. We introduce an approach to detect, segment and <b>track</b> <b>spines</b> in time series from 2 PM. We train a statistical dendrite intensity and spine probability model with 2 D data from Digitally Reconstructed Fluorescence Images (DRFIs). DRFIs are synthetic images computed from geometrical shapes of dendrites and their spines, which can be reconstructed in Electron Microscopy (EM) data. This concept enables us to overcome the issue of expert labeled spines in fluorescence images. We are able to predict the spine probability for 2 D slices due to the information transfer from the EM domain to the fluorescence image domain. In combination with further features a robust spine prediction is feasible. The prediction is projected back to the original space of the image. Thus, a prediction and segmentation of spines in 3 D is possible. Imaging time series of dendrite pieces is a challenging task. The handling of the sample between different imaging steps (e. g. storing the samples in an incubator) requires a registration of the different time points. After segmentation of spines in individual time points a <b>tracking</b> of the <b>spine</b> candidates over the registered time points is required because spines can move. Successful <b>tracking</b> of <b>spines</b> enables to trace intensity changes of individual spines. The tracing of intensity changes is possible for multiple image channels and opens the possibility of manifold applications. We demonstrate the successful detection, segmentation and <b>tracking</b> of <b>spines</b> in single time points and time series in practical applications. We are able to detect spines with a presynaptic bouton in single time point images with multiple channels. Moreover, we demonstrate the successful detection and segmentation of spines in time series. For time series we demonstrate the possibility to track Endoplasmic Reticulum of spines over time. In such experiments the whole complexity of image analysis for fluorescence time series is solved. ...|$|R
