40|$|Abstract − We {{present a}} novel 3 D {{fabrication}} method with single <b>X-ray</b> <b>process</b> utilizing an X-ray mask {{in which a}} micro-actuator is integrated. An X-ray absorber is electroplated on the shuttle mass driven by the integrated micro-actuator during deep X-ray exposures. 3 D microstructures are revealed by development kinetics and modulated in-depth dose distribution in resist, usually PMMA. Fabrication of X-ray masks with integrated electrothermal xy-stage and electrostatic actuator is presented along with discussions on PMMA development characteristics. Both devices use 20 -µm-thick overhanging single crystal Si as a structural material and fabricated using deep reactive ion etching of silicon-on-insulator wafer, phosphorous diffusion, gold electroplating, and bulk micromachining process. In electrostatic devices, 10 -µm-thick gold absorber on 1 mm× 1 mm Si shuttle mass is supported by 10 -µm-wide, 1 -mm-long suspension beams and oscillated by comb electrodes during X-ray exposures. In electrothermal devices, gold absorber on 1. 42 mm diameter shuttle mass is oscillated in x and y directions sequentially by thermal expansion caused by joule heating of the corresponding bent beam actuators. The funda-mental frequency and amplitude of the electrostatic devices are around 3. 6 kHz and 20 µm, respectively, for a dc bias of 100 V and an ac bias of 20 VP-P (peak-peak). Displacements in x and y directions of the electrothermal devices are both around 20 µm at 742 mW input power.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research in}} the area of parameter analysis for X-ray imaging. This work was performed at Philips Healthcare in Best (the Netherlands) as a nal project for the Master study at the Sound and Image Processing Laboratory at Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan (KTH), Stockholm. The objective of this project is to provide methods for automatic parameter analysis and reduction for X-ray tuning. These methods can be used to reduce the amount of parameters involving in X-ray tuning. X-ray processing is performed via a black-box process and parameter analysis consists in looking at the impact on the resulting X-ray image. The visual quality of this image depends on parameter tuning. With a large number of parameters, analysing their visual impact directly is not feasible, which is why objective image quality (OIQ) assessment is used to get numerical results. Several image quality assessment models are reviewed leading to further {{research in the}} full-reference and no-reference model approaches. Both assessments are explored with investigation of four dierent full-reference metrics, namely the Peak-Signalto-Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Structural Similarity (SSIM), the Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) and one using wavelet properties that we have called Wavelet Method (WM), and three no-reference metrics: noise, contrast and sharpness. Search algorithms are used to get a set of parameters which give the same image quality (using OIQ) such that dimensionality reduction can be performed. Several search algorithms are reviewed from the simplest (looking at the function evaluations of all points) to the most sophisticated algorithms for global optimization (e. g. genetic algorithm). Depending on the function to optimize, dierent algorithms are used. Finding corrolated parameters, or parameters that have no impact on the image quality is the way to reduce the amount of parameters. Principal Composent Analysis (PCA) which is one of the most common method for dimensionality reduction is performed on the results of combination of OIQ and search algorithms. For each step of the project, we test the assessments or the algorithms on some examples to validate the used procedure. We will nally test all our methods with one IP function which acts like a real <b>X-ray</b> <b>process.</b> The results will enable us to see if parameter analysis and reduction is feasible...|$|E

40|$|Exploration {{of a new}} ultrafast-ultrasmall {{frontier}} in atomic {{and molecular}} physics has begun. Not only is is possible to control outer-shell electron dynamics with intense ultrafast optical lasers, but now control of inner-shell processes has become possible by combining intense infrared/optical lasers with tunable sources of x-ray radiation. This marriage of strong-field laser and x-ray physics {{has led to the}} discovery of methods to control reversibly resonant x-ray absorption in atoms and molecules on ultrafast timescales. Using a strong optical dressing field, resonant x-ray absorption in atoms can be markedly suppressed, yielding an example of electromagnetically induced transparency for x rays. Resonant x-ray absorption can also be controlled in molecules using strong non-resonant, polarized laser fields to align the framework of a molecule, and therefore its unoccupied molecular orbitals to which resonant absorption occurs. At higher laser intensities, ultrafast field ionization produces an irreversible change in x-ray absorption. Finally, the advent of x-ray free electron lasers enables first exploration of non-linear <b>x-ray</b> <b>processes.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 11 figures, RevTeX 4, submitted to Revista Mexicana de Fisic...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{introduce}} a volume rendering system {{designed for the}} Cell Broadband Engine that only requires {{a minimum of two}} voxel slices at a time to perform image synthesis of a volume data set for a fixed number of user defined views.

Imagine a screening line at the airport where luggage is examined with an x-ray machine. As luggage passes through the scanner multiple x-ray samples are taken from which 2 D voxel slices are derived. These finally form a full volume data set that needs to be displayed for quick analysis. Traditional software volume rendering systems are impractical for such a task as they require the volume data set to be fully available for image synthesis and thus need to wait until the <b>x-raying</b> <b>process</b> has finished.

40|$|EEV {{buried channel}} charge coupled devices (BCCDs) with {{technological}} variations {{have been studied}} {{with respect to their}} response to 70 kVp <b>X-rays.</b> <b>Process</b> variations considered are the conventional BCCD, scintillator coated BCCDs ((Gadox(Eu) and CsI(Tl)) and the inversion mode device. The work was made necessary by the use of these CCDs for dental X-ray imaging. Effects investigated include changes in device operating voltages and dark current. The dark current buildup has been characterised in terms of a prompt component seen immediately following irradiation, and a time dependent component which occurs gradually. A major part of this work was the determination of the location and concentration of the energy states responsible for this dark current buildup. Also a novel aspect of the work was the derivation of an expression describing the time dependent component as a function of time and temperature. Effects associated with the bias dependence of the BCCD have also been considered, with particular regard to the effect of a negative substrate bias, and the theoretical explanation has been developed. The findings of this work have demonstrated the suitability of these devices for the commercial application of imaging x-rays for dentistry.
