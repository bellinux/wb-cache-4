40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{abatement}} {{programs of}} precursors implemented in many industrialized countries, ozone remains the principal air pollutant throughout {{the northern hemisphere}} with background concentrations increasing {{as a consequence of}} economic development in former or still emerging countries and present climate change. Some of the highest ozone concentrations are measured in regions with a Mediterranean climate but the effect on the natural vegetation is alleviated by low stomatal uptake and frequent leaf <b>xeromorphy</b> in response to summer drought episodes characteristic of this climate. However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding of the respective role of the foliage physiology and leaf <b>xeromorphy</b> on the mechanistic effects of ozone in Mediterranean species. Particularly, evidence about morphological and structural changes in evergreens in response to ozone stress is missing. RESULTS: Our study was started after observing ozone -like injury in foliage of holm oak during the assessment of air pollution mitigation by urban trees throughout the Madrid conurbation. Our objectives were to confirm the diagnosis, investigate the extent of symptoms and analyze the ecological factors contributing to ozone injury, particularly, the site water supply. Symptoms consisted of adaxial and intercostal stippling increasing with leaf age. Underlying stippling, cells in the upper mesophyll showed HR-like reactions typical of ozone stress. The surrounding cells showed further oxidative stress markers. These morphological and micromorphological markers of ozone stress were similar to those recorded in deciduous broadleaved species. However, stippling became obvious already at an AOT 40 of 21 ppm•h and was primarily found at irrigated sites. Subsequent analyses showed that irrigated trees had their stomatal conductance increased and leaf life -span reduced whereas the leaf <b>xeromorphy</b> remained unchanged. These findings suggest a central role of water availability versus leaf <b>xeromorphy</b> for ozone symptom expression by cell injury in holm oak...|$|E
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for secondary xylem of 14 species of four genera of Calyceraceae; root wood is studied for acaulescent perennials and one annual. The wood anatomy of most species of Calycera has character states {{identical to those}} seen in wood of most Asteraceae (including phylads of Asteraceae thought to be basic in that family). Goodeniaceae have two features (tracheids, diffuse parenchyma) more primitive than corresponding conditions in Asteraceae and CaIyceraceae according to traditional criteria. Diversity in wood anatomy within Calyceraceae is explainable in terms of adaptation to particular ecological conditions. Although woods of the family as a whole are xeromorphic, most Calycera species show few adaptations to extreme <b>xeromorphy.</b> The highest degree of wood <b>xeromorphy</b> occurs in species of relatively high elevation or high latitude. The presence of pseudoscalariform pitting, with transitions to helical-banded secondary xylem vessels, very much like those of primary xylem, in Boopis graminea and Nastanthus spp., coupled with absence of Iibriform fibers (replaced by axial parenchyma) are probably related to expansion and contraction of the wood in response to fluctuation in moisture availability...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for wood {{anatomy of the}} seven species of Cercidium (including two subspecies of C. floridum {{as well as the}} hybrid C. x sonorae) currently recognized. Data on wood of Parkinsonia are presented for purposes of comparison. Vessel walls of Cercidium show unusual sculpture: coarse excrescences termed verrucae here, crateriform pits, and grooves interconnecting pit apertures. These plus crystal distribution, presence of septa in fibers, pit diameter, presence of vasicentric tracheids, and presence of diagonal vessel aggregations are probably species distinctions to various degrees. The crystal-bearing fibers of Cercidium, some of which have very thin walls, exemplify fiber dimorphism. Wood of Parkinsonia aculeata is amply distinct from that of Cercidium. Vessel element dimensions and density in Cercidium do not indicate exceptional <b>xeromorphy</b> for woods, perhaps because some species grow in desert washes, perhaps because other features (leaflessness, thick cuticle on stems) reduce transpiration. Vessel wall sculpture, vasicentric tracheid presence, and degree of vessel grouping are considered likely indicators of wood <b>xeromorphy</b> within the genus, however...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} evolutionary {{patterns and}} processes {{that account for}} anatomical diversity in relation to ecology and life form diversity, anatomy of storage roots and stems of the genus Adenia (Passifloraceae) were analyzed using an explicit phylogenetic context. Over 65, 000 measurements are reported for 47 quantitative and qualitative traits from 58 species in the genus. Vestiges of lianous ancestry were apparent throughout the group, as treelets and lianous taxa alike share relatively short, often wide, vessel elements with simple, transverse perforation plates, and alternate lateral wall pitting; fibriform vessel elements, tracheids associated with vessels, and libriform fibers as additional tracheary elements; and well-developed axial parenchyma. Multiple cambial variants were observed, including anomalous parenchyma proliferation, anomalous vascular strands, successive cambia, and a novel type of intraxylary phloem. Successive cambia, trichomes, dermal features, and intraxylary phloem were synapomorphic for particular clades, whereas most traits were homoplastic. Several anatomical features of Adenia are consistent with <b>xeromorphy.</b> Repeated loss and gain of cuticularized, photosynthetic mature stems, narrow vessel elements, highly aggregated vessels, and other features indicative of <b>xeromorphy</b> reveal labile evolution of ecologically significant anatomical features, whereas features that are characteristic of the liana life form reveal evolutionary conservation despite diversification of life form within Adenia...|$|E

In gross morphology the leaves are indistinguishable from those of extant Dryandra formosa, and similar to a few other species of Dryandra and Banksia. The fossil specimens demonstrate that subtribe Banksiinae had differentiated by the Late Paleocene and represent the earliest record of angiosperm scleromorphy in Australia to date. The superficial placement of the stomates compared with most modern Banksiinae supports the hypothesis that <b>xeromorphy</b> in this group generally increased {{in response to the}} development of less mesic climates in the Late Tertiary...|$|E

Macroscopical and cuticular analyses with light and scanning electron microscopes enable the description of a new cheirolepidiacean species: Frenelopsis profetiensis. The assemblage shows the classical features of <b>xeromorphy.</b> Sedimentological analysis together with macroscopical and cuticular features of the studied samples, suggests a subtropical climate, probably under semi-arid or arid conditions. The floristic composition shows close affinities with other coeval Tethyan communities, but no similarity with the Gondwanan flora...|$|E
40|$|Wood of Bruniaceae is very {{primitive}} {{according to}} widelyaccepted criteria. Vessels are relatively long, with scalariform perforation plates having numerous bars, fully or vestigially bordered. Many aberrations in disposition of bars and perforations in perforation plates are present, and no species has exclusively normal perforation plates. Lateral wall pitting of vessels, both intervascular and between vessels and rays, is scalariform to opposite. Vessels are solitary or nearly so, angular to round in transection. Helical thickenings {{are present in}} vessels of only a single species. All imperforate elements are thick-walled tracheids, some with gelatinous walls. Tracheids are only slightly longer (in two instances shorter) than the vessel elements they accompany in any given species. Axial parenchyma is diffuse, with very slight tendencies toward aggregates or vasicentric scanty. Rays are heterocellular, with a predominance of upright cells, or upright cells exclusively in species with very narrow multiseriate rays. Multiseriate rays vary from biseriate {{to an average of}} more than five cells in width, according to species. Uniseriate wings are present on at least some multiseriate rays in all species. Borders are frequently present on the tangential walls of ray cells, which tend to be thick. U niseriate and multiseriate rays are present in all species. Growth rings vary from absent to conspicuous, the latter mostly in montane species. Inconspicuous growth rings feature narrow vessels or narrow tracheids in latewood. More pronounced growth rings have more numerous as well as wider vessels in earlywood; vessels may be absent or nearly so in latewood, which would thus constitute an all-tracheid band produced annually. Crystals are present in rays of most species, sometimes chambered in subdivided ray cells. A few species have crystals in chambered axial parenchyma cells. Droplets or massive deposits of amorphous dark-staining compounds are present in all species. Woods of Bruniaceae are exemplary, considering their primitiveness, for adaptation to <b>xeromorphy,</b> based on current concepts of wood <b>xeromorphy.</b> Vessels are notably narrow or numerous per mm 2 of transection, or both. The nature of growth rings and of perforation plate modifications are suggestive of <b>xeromorphy.</b> Although species of moister habitats do have quantitatively more mesomorphic wood features, the span within Bruniaceae is not great, suggesting that wood of the family as a whole is adapted to extremes of water stress in accordance with the dry, hot summers, high incidence of wind, and porous sandstone soils of Cape Province, South Africa. Lignotubers have woods more parenchymatous and mesomorphic than wood of stems in the lignotuber- bearing species. Wood of stems does not differ appreciably from that of roots. Bruniaceous woods are most closely comparable to those of Geissolomataceae and Grubbiaceae, although other 2 ̆ 2 rosoid 2 ̆ 2 families have similar woods. This agrees with the 2 ̆ 2 rosoid 2 ̆ 2 placement accorded Bruniaceae by most phylogenists...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} Holmskioldia sanguinea Retz. {{has been done}} to study the {{structural}} variations in stem and root wood and to correlate them with growth habit and ecology of the plant. Vessels are wider and more abundant while rays (uni- to triserate) are taller in stem wood than in root wood, which possesses broad multiseriate rays. Simple perforation plate, sparse vasicentric paratracheal parenchyma and perforated ray cells are the features common in both stem and root woods, while helical thickenings have been recorded only in the stem wood. Lower value of vulnerability, presence of wider vessels with simple perforation plate, and presence of helical thickening are indicators of wood <b>xeromorphy</b> in Holmskioldia sanguinea. Features like wider vessels and extensive height of rays in stem wood are in consonance with the climbing nature of the stem axis...|$|E

40|$|Wood {{of seven}} {{collections}} of six species of Nolana, a genus (18 spp.) {{of the central}} western coast of South America was studied for quantitative and qualitative features. The wood is ring porous, with moderately wide vessels bearing simple perforation plates and alternate pits with some grooves interconnecting slitlike pit apertures. Imperforate tracheary elements are fiber-tracheids with vestigial borders on pits or libriform fibers; vasicentric tracheids (reported for Nolanaceae for the first time) are present in varying numbers. Axial parenchyma is vasicentric scanty (sometimes absent), sometimes with tangential bands that may be terminal in part. Rays are both multiseriate and uniseriate; ray cells are mostly erect. Crystal sand occurs in some ray cells and some axial parenchyma. The sum of features mark Nolanaceae as very close to Solanaceae. Wood of Nolana varies in xeromorphy; lower degrees of <b>xeromorphy</b> {{may be explained by}} succulence related to maritime habitat or to ephemeral nature of stems. The erect nature of ray cells and a decrease in vessel element length are indicators of paedomorphosis and thereby herbaceous ness of Nolanaceae...|$|E
40|$|Proteaceous {{leaves from}} two Early Tertiary sites in Tasmania are {{described}} and discussed. Based on gross leaf morphological and cuticular characters, 15 species are recognised from Oligocene lacustrine sediments at Cethana. Specimens of two taxa are not distinguishable from the extant species Telopea truncata from Tasmania and Lomatia fraxinifolia from north-eastern Queensland, {{and are therefore}} assigned to these species. Two new species of Banksieaephyllum are recognised. Ten other taxa are difficult to identify to existing genera, and are therefore referred to a new genus Proteaciphyllum. They all possess features typical of subfamily Grevilleoideae. Other, less well preserved, but probable Proteaceae from Cethana are also described. Specimens from the Leven River deposit, probably also of Oligocene age, are assigned to a new species of Orites, O. excelsoides.

Although crystal distribution is likely a systematic feature of some species of Buddleja, other wood features relate closely to ecology. Features correlated with <b>xeromorphy</b> in Buddleja include strongly marked growth rings (terminating with vascular tracheids), narrower mean vessel diameter, shorter vessel elements, greater vessel density, and helical thickenings in vessels. Old World species of Buddleja cannot be differentiated from New World {{species on the}} basis of wood features. Emorya wood is like that of xeromorphic species of Buddleja. Lateral wall vessel pits of Nuxia are small (2. 5 ILm) compared to those of Buddleja (mostly 5 - 7 ILm).

40|$|Premise of the study: Globally, {{the origins}} of xeromorphic traits in modern {{angiosperm}} lineages are obscure but {{are thought to be}} linked to the early Neogene onset of seasonally arid climates. Stomatal encryption is a xeromorphic trait that is prominent in Banksia, an archetypal genus centered in one of the world’s most diverse ecosystems, the ancient infertile landscape of Mediterranean-climate southwestern Australia. Methods: We describe Banksia paleocrypta, a sclerophyllous species with encrypted stomata from silcretes of the Walebing and Kojonup regions of southwestern Australia dated as Late Eocene. Key results: Banksia paleocrypta shows evidence of foliar <b>xeromorphy</b> ~ 20 Ma before the widely accepted timing for the onset of aridity in Australia. Species of Banksia subgenus Banksia with very similar leaves are extant in southwestern Australia. The conditions required for silcrete formation infer fl uctuating water tables and climatic seasonality in southwestern Australia in the Eocene, and seasonality is supported by the paucity of angiosperm closed-forest elements among the fossil taxa preserved with B. paleocrypta. However, climates in the region during the Eocene are unlikely to have experienced seasons as hot and dry as present-day summers. Conclusions: The presence of B. paleocrypta within the center of diversity of subgenus Banksia in edaphically ancient southwestern Australia is consistent with the continuous presence of this lineage in the region for ≥ 40 Ma, a testament to the success of increasingly xeromorphic traits in Banksia over an interval in which numerous other lineages became extinct...|$|E
40|$|Leaves {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} {{anatomical}} and morphologi-cal structures that partially isolate stomata from the turbulent atmosphere (Figs. 1 – 8). Traditionally, such stomatal protection has been considered as an adaptation to dry climates (e. g., Raven et al., 2005), with the suggestion that they increase the effective boundary layer, decreasing stomatal conductance and thereby reducing stomatal transpiration (e. g., Hill, 1998; Roth-Nebelsick, 2007). These features are of particular interest to palaeobotanists because they have often been used to infer dry climates (e. g., Hill, 1998). However, the evidence for any association between stomatal protection and dry climates is largely anecdotal. The physiological function of stomatal protection remains ambiguous because water loss and carbon assimilation vary in concert. One possible advantage of reduced conductance is in-creased instantaneous water use effi ciency (von Caemmerer and Farquhar, 1981) because decreases in conductance result in lower carbon dioxide concentration in the substomatal cavity. As a result, the gradient in carbon dioxide concentration from the leaf to the external atmosphere increases more than the cor-responding gradient in water vapor. However, this does not necessarily imply that stomatal protection is an advantage in dry climates because plants can adjust water use effi ciency by altering the degree of stomatal opening. One possible way of determining if stomatal protection is linked with aridity would be to test for an evolutionary associa-tion with dry climates in an evolutionary model system. The extant and extinct species of Proteaceae, a southern hemisphere family of evergreen trees and shrubs, are especially suitable for investigating the evolution of <b>xeromorphy</b> and scleromorph...|$|E
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for woods of 37 species representing 11 genera; most species included represent a maximal degree of woodiness for the family, and herbaceous groups are mostly omitted. Growth rings are absent or nearly so. Vessel elements have simple perforation plates (except for Kohleria elegans) and alternate circular or oval pits {{of various sizes}} on vessel-vessel walls (often laterally elongate, often with gaping apertures, on vessel-parenchyma and vessel-septate fiber interfaces). Grooves interconnect pit apertures in vessels of four genera. Vessels are grouped, usually in radial chains, to a moderate extent. Tyloses are present. Imperforate tracheary elements are libriform fibers or (Coronanthera) fiber tracheids with vestigial borders on pits. Septa are present in imperforate tracheary elements of most species, but in most species of Cyrtandra, septate fibers occur only near vessels. Uniseriate rays are present in some species, but in most species rays are muItiseriate only or are absent altogether. Vascular and vasicentric tracheids are absent. In Cyrtandra, wood with multiseriate rays can be demonstrated to be rayless earlier in ontogeny. Crystals are present in rays and in septate fibers of a few species. Storying is present in a few species. All features of wood reflect the mesic habitats characteristic of Gesneriaceae, but moderate degrees of <b>xeromorphy</b> are illustrated by species in which narrow vessels, grouped vessels, and grooves in vessel walls occur. The wood anatomy of Drymonia reflects its vining habit. Raylessness may indicate secondary woodiness in Besleria and Cyrtandra. Wood anatomy of Gesneriaceae is consonant with a hypothesis that the family {{is closely related to}} Acanthaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and other families of Scrophulariales...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for 44 collections representing 42 species in 27 genera. Lamiaceae basically have: vessels with simple perforation plates; vessel-to-vessel pitting alternate; imperforate tracheary elements all libriform fibers, fibers commonly septate; axial parenchyma scanty vasicentric; rays Heterogeneous Type IIB. These features ally Lamiaceae closely with Verbenaceae. In {{addition to the}} Mesomorphy ratio (based on vessel element dimensions), features that indicate wood <b>xeromorphy</b> in Lamiaceae, in probable increasing order of importance are: presence of indistinct to marked growth rings; presence of helical thickenings in vessels; presence of vasicentric or vascular tracheids; presence of vessel groups averaging three or more vessels per group. More mesomorphic woods in Lamiaceae occur in species that are arborescent to shrubby, and that occur in areas that have no prolonged drought. Helical sculpture in vessels is expressed not only as thickenings, but also as grooves interconnecting pit apertures (coalesced pit apertures), and inconspicuous thickenings in pairs along the grooves. Vascular tracheids (at ends of growth rings) occur in several genera. Where growth rings are very narrow (Salvia, Trichostema), vessels and tracheids are intermixed, thereby justifying description as vasicentric tracheids of what may have originated phylogenetically as vascular tracheids. This may represent one pathway for origin of vasicentric tracheids. Wide bands of axial parenchyma in Cuminia and Leptosceptrum have originated {{as a result of}} fiber dimorphism. Abundance of upright cells in numerous Lamiaceae is indicative ofpaedomorphosis, and may point to secondary woodiness in some instances; the family as a whole appears ancestrally moderately woody. The ratio between libriform fiber length and vessel element length marks Lamiaceae as specialized. Crystal presence and cambial variants are newly reported for the family...|$|E
40|$|The {{adaptive}} {{significance of}} {{the timing of the}} abrupt change in leaf form in Eucalyptus globulus Labill. spp. globulus was investigated using quantitative genetic analysis of several field trials containing open-pollinated progenies. Five large trials contained progeny from across the whole geographic range of this taxon. On this broad scale, early phase change appears to promote growth on two sites but not the other three, implying differential selection for the timing of phase change. The timing of vegetative phase change varied markedly between broad geographic regions, consistent with either adaptation to broad scale variation or historical differentiation. Data from one small trial demonstrated a genetic basis to a steep local cline in habit, in the size of plants flowering and in the height of the change in foliage type. In this trial, the progeny from an exposed coastal cliff top had markedly slower growth, earlier vegetative phase change and first flowering than the progeny from 1. 5 km inland. This genetically determined combination of slow growth, early phase change and precocious flowering appears to be maintained in exposed coastal environments by current selection, and contrasts with more complex patterns of broad scale geographic variation. The genetic association of the timing of vegetative phase change with growth rate, a fitness surrogate, ranged from positive to negative at different sites. Early phase change may, for example, be favoured in warm, wet environments to reduce damage by leaf fungi, but may also be favoured on exposed dry sites to increase <b>xeromorphy.</b> The patterns of genetic variation in nature may thus result from multiple causes (both biotic and abiotic) and their interpretation will be complex...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{anatomical}} characteristics for 21 taxa of Cassiope are reported. Qualitative features differ somewhat {{from the}} general pattern of the Ericaceae. However, considerable deviation {{is found in the}} quantitative aspects of the wood features. The stems are very slender with narrow growth rings evident in all but one species. Vessel elements are very small and usually have scalariform perforation plates with several bars. Vessels are extremely abundant in transection. Vascular rays are mostly uniseriate with a few biseriates and all are composed exclusively of erect cells. The imperforate elements are tracheids which are the only conductive elements in the late wood. Calluna-type pith is found in most of the taxa while homogeneous pith is found in two species. The recognition of these in the separate genus Harrimanella is supported. Cassiope plants are often found in moist, protected microenvironments in arctic and alpine areas of extreme cold and desiccating winds. Short growing seasons and low mean temperatures probably contribute {{in large part to the}} dwarf stature of the plants, which in turn accommodates the reduced vascular system. The tracheids provide a safe conductive system in the late wood which is less susceptible to loss of function due to air embolisms. The vessel elements with scalariform perforation plates accommodate the presumably slow conductive rates in the earlier part of the growing season. The vessel elements of Cassiope are considerably smaller than most others known to have scalariform perforation plates. The values for vulnerability, an indicator of the degree of vessel redundancy and hence safety, are much lower than any yet calculated for any group. The same is true for figures for mesomorphy, which introduces vessel element length as an independent measure of degree of <b>xeromorphy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} 14 species of Clematis and one species each of Delphinium, Helleborus, Thalictrum, and Xanthorhiza (Ranunculaceae) is {{compared}} to that of Glaucidium palma tum (Glaucidiaceae) and Hydrastis canadensis (Ranunculaceae, or Hydrastidaceae of some authors). Clematis wood has features typical of wood of vines and lianas: wide (earlywood) vessels, abundant axial parenchyma (earlywood, some species), high vessel density, low proportion of fibrous tissue in wood, wide rays composed of thin-walled cells, and abrupt origin of multiseriate rays. Superimposed on these features are expressions indicative of <b>xeromorphy</b> in the species of cold or dry areas: numerous narrow latewood vessels, presence of vasicentric tracheids, shorter vessel elements, and strongly marked growth rings. Wood of Xanthorhiza is like that of a (small) shrub. Wood of Delphinium, Helleborus, and Thalictrum is characteristic of herbs that become woodier: limited amounts of secondary xylem, parenchymatization of wood, partial conversion of ray areas to libriform fibers (partial raylessness). Wood of Ranunculaceae other than Clematis has numerous narrow vessels, probably an adaptation to cold more than drought. Glaucidium has occasional scalariform perforation plates like those almost universally present in Paeonia, but the two genera differ strongly in other wood features. Wood of Hydrastis (scalariform perforation plates occasional in primary xylem, rare in secondary xylem) accords with the idea that Hydrastis is a lineage that separated from the base of Ranunculaceae. Features that ally Ranunculaceae with other families of Ranunculiflorae include presence of wide multiseriate rays (without accompanying uniseriate rays), vessel restriction patterns, and storied structure. Woodiness in Ranunculaceae is probably secondary, at least to some extent; the woodiness of Xanthorhiza, thought by some to represent a primitive genus in the family, could be either primary or secondary...|$|E

Wood of all Myoporaceae represents variation on a basic plan: woods diffuse porous or semi-ringporous; vessels with simple perforation plates; lateral wall pits of vessels alternate and circular, with grooves interconnecting some pit apertures; vessels grouped to various degrees into radial multiples; imperforate tracheary elements all fiber-tracheids with pit cavities 1 - 5 μm in diameter (wider on contacts with ray cells), nonseptate; axial parenchyma vasicentric scanty plus, in some species, tangential para tracheal bands (sometimes terminal); rays multi seriate plus uniseriate (uniseriate almost exclusively in two species of Eremophila); ray cells procumbent exclusively, upright and square in uniseriate rays and in tips of multiseriate rays; rays storied in some species of Eremophila, axial parenchyma variously storied; crystals present in ray cells of some species of Eremophila and in fibers of E. polyclada; amorphous deposits and starch often present in parenchyma. Ofiia differs from Myoporaceae by having: septate libriform fibers rather than fiber-tracheids; large pits on vessel walls; axial parenchyma nearly absent; and erect cells predominant in rays. Oftia may be placed in Scrophulariaceae. Leucophyllum differs from Myoporaceae by having: helical thickenings in vessels; vasicentric tracheids transitional from vascular tracheids; scarce axial parenchyma; and erect cells predominant in rays. Leucophyllum may be excluded from Myoporaceae. Wood anatomy ofMyoporaceae shows relationship between Myoporaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and Gesneriaceae, and is also indicative of derivation from woody ancestors. Wood of Myoporaceae reflects <b>xeromorphy,</b> especially in Eremophila, but the foliar apparatus may partially preempt the role of wood in promoting safety, which is connoted by growth rings, narrow and numerous vessels, and grouped vessels...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for wood anatomy of 35 collections representing 22 Old World species of Ephedra; {{the survey of}} bark and pith anatomy is based {{on some of these}} species. Character-state ranges {{similar to those of the}} New World species are reported, although more numerous species show vessel absence in latewood. Little diminution in vessel diameter or density occurs in latewood of the eight species that are scandant or sprawling. Helical thickenings or sculpture occur in vessels of about a third of the Old World species, but these thickenings are clearly related to pits, often not very prominent, and rarely present in tracheids (alternative expressions characterize helical thickenings in the New World species). Helical thickenings are statistically correlated to xeromorphic wood features such as narrower vessels and fewer vessels per mm 2 of transection. Paucity of vessels is an indicator ofxeromorphy (rather than abundance, as in dicotyledons) because tracheids, which have optimal conductive safety, are present instead of vessels. Near vessellessness is reported for E. distachya var. monostachya, E. gerardiana, and E. monosperma. A high degree of wood <b>xeromorphy</b> characterizes species of the highlands of Central Asia and the Middle East, where extremes of drought and cold prevail. A close approach to storied structure is reported in three species. Procumbent ray cells, absent at first, are produced as stems increase in diameter. Vessel element length also increases with stem size, and is not a phyletic indicator. Minute calcium oxalate crystals cover the outside of wood and bark cells, and suggest relationship to Welwitschia and perhaps conifers. A review of New World as well as Old World species reveals few species criteria, and these are mostly difficult to quantify. Primitive character states cannot be defined with certainty in the genus. Wood of Ephedra is like that of a vessel-bearing gymnosperm; parallelisms with dicotyledons may be caused by the vessel-bearing habit...|$|E
40|$|Reforestation is {{the main}} {{direction}} of rehabilitation of the degraded lands by the coal industry. The substratum of dumps of the coal industry is characterized by sharp deficiency of elements and the expressed <b>xeromorphy.</b> During more than 40 years on the dumps were created over 15 thousand ha of wood plantings, the agrotechnological and scientific foundation of forest recultivation is laid. Biological features of several tens types are studied, their suitability {{for the purposes of}} afforestation of dumps is estimated. Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L., a common sea-buckthorn Hippophaë rhamnoídes L. and a silver birch Betula pendula Tristis appeared certainly suitable, 10 more types are recognized as the perspective. In 1989 and 2005 under the leadership of L. P. Barannik are prepared and approved for application at the regional level of the recommendation about reforestation. Now experiments on selection of types proceed, work on optimization of technologies of forest recultivation taking into account an assessment of the created plantings of the I–II class of age is conducted. The main square of reforestation, about 11 thousand hectares, the scots pine which is capable to grow on the highest classes of site class without decrease in growth processes in the senior age groups borrows. Pure sea-buckthorn plantings are created on the area about 3 thousand hectares, they are used by the population as berry-pickers, the ecological value of a sea-buckthorn consists in fast development of a surface of dumps, unpretentiousness. Joint landings of these two tree species are widely used. The birch hung, along with a birch fluffy, is presented, mainly, in the form of natural renewal. In recent years, in connection with reduction of nurseries on cultivation of seedlings of a pine, the birch began to be used actively at artificial afforestation of dumps, especially in urban areas. The main problems of forest recultivation are: non-selective formation of dumps, unsatisfactory parameters of preparation of sites at a mining stage of recultivation, high density of the created stands, weak formation of the subordinated circles and the slowed-down soil formation, inflammability of the mixed landings of a pine and sea-buckthorn and the small range of the used cultures, absence of due consideration to the above problem...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims The charismatic Himantoglossum s. l. clade of Eurasian orchids {{contains}} {{an unusually large}} proportion of taxa that are of controversial circumscriptions and considerable conservation concern. Whereas our previously published study addressed the molecular phylogenetics and phylogeography of every named taxon within the clade, here we use detailed morphometric data obtained from the same populations to compare genotypes with associated phenotypes, {{in order to better}} explore taxonomic circumscription and character evolution within the clade. Methods Between one and 12 plants found in 25 populations that encompassed the entire distribution of the Himantoglossum s. l. clade were measured in situ for 51 morphological characters. Results for 45 of those characters were subjected to detailed multivariate and univariate analyses. Key Results Multivariate analyses readily separate subgenus Barlia and subgenus Comperia from subgenus Himantoglossum, and also the early-divergent H. formosum from the less divergent remainder of subgenus Himantoglossum. The sequence of divergence of these four lineages is confidently resolved. Our experimental approach to morphometric character analysis demonstrates clearly that phenotypic evolution within Himantoglossum is unusually multi-dimensional. Conclusions Degrees of divergence between taxa shown by morphological analyses approximate those previously shown using molecular analyses. Himantoglossum s. l. is readily divisible into three subgenera. The three sections of subgenus Himantoglossum—hircinum, caprinum and formosum—are arrayed from west to east with only limited geographical overlap. At this taxonomic level, their juxtaposition combines with conflict between contrasting datasets to complicate attempts to distinguish between clinal variation and the discontinuities that by definition separate bona fide species. All taxa achieve allogamy via food deceit and have only weak pollinator specificity. Artificial crossing demonstrates that intrinsic sterility barriers are weak. Although we have found evidence of gene flow among and within the three sections of subgenus Himantoglossum, reports of natural hybrids are surprisingly rare, probably because putative parents are sufficiently similar to questionably warrant the status of species. Phenological separation and increased <b>xeromorphy</b> characterise the origin of subgenus Barlia. Several individual morphological characters show evidence of parallel acquisition, and loss of features is especially frequent in floral markings among members of section caprinum. Detailed patterns of gain and loss demonstrate that several different categories of flower markings are inherited independently. Along with the dimensions of labellar lobes, these pigmentation characters have been over-emphasised in previous taxonomic treatments. Increased plant vigour was a crucial element of the origin of the genus, but vegetative characters underwent remarkably little subsequent evolution. Attempts to reconstruct hypothetical ancestors at internal nodes of the phylogeny are weakened by (a) uncertain placement of Steveniella as sister to Himantoglossum s. l. and (b) uncertain relationships among subtly different putative species within section caprinum. Nonetheless, heterochronic/allometric trends, ultimately limited by functional constraints, clearly dictate transitions between contrasting flower sizes and complex labellum shapes...|$|E
