50|$|Modern wagons {{are usually}} built with {{drawgear}} designed for easy conversion {{to some kind}} of centre coupling such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>AAR</b> or SA3.|$|R
50|$|Whatever the {{advantages}} of the modern SA3 coupler, it is not as widely used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>AAR.</b> It is not clear if the SA3 is suitable for the heaviest (30,000 ton) trains.|$|R

It also includes {{some parts of the}} Jura Mountains.|$|R
50|$|The Russian SA3 coupler works {{according}} to <b>the</b> same principles <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>AAR</b> coupler but <b>the</b> two types are incompatible. It {{was introduced in}} the Soviet Union in 1932 and has since been used on the whole broad-gauge network, including Mongolia and Finland.|$|R

50|$|Wrexham & Shropshire started {{operating}} push-pull {{services with}} DVTs in October 2008 between Wrexham General and London Marylebone {{in conjunction with}} Class 67 diesel locomotives following {{the start of the}} service on 28 April 2008. The DVTs required modification to work with the Class 67, involving adding a notched power controller as is used in the locomotive and a 27 wire jumper cable <b>as</b> used on <b>the</b> GM EMD locomotives which is known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>AAR</b> Multiple Working system. These DVTs were originally used by Virgin Trains until the Pendolinos were fully operational.|$|R

The railroad operates 48 mi of railroad from Flomaton, Alabama to Peterman, Alabama.|$|R
5000|$|The Jefferson Warrior Railroad [...] was a {{terminal}} railroad <b>as</b> reported by <b>the</b> <b>AAR.</b> <b>The</b> JEFW began in 1895 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Marylee Railroad took its current name in 1985.

50|$|VanderCook College of Music {{currently}} resides at 3140 S. Federal Street on {{the campus}} of the Illinois Institute of Technology. Plans on the building began in 1948 and it was built in 1950 by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. <b>The</b> building, known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>AAR</b> Technical Center, was one of three buildings that formed the Association of American Railroads (<b>AAR)</b> Complex. <b>The</b> location of the Association of American Railroads {{on the campus}} of the Illinois Institute of Technology was symbolic of the close relationship between the railroads and technological educational institutions in matters of research. The building is based on the model of a steel system with glass and brick curtain walls. The corner detail of the VanderCook College building is notable for brick that rises higher at the base of the wall before the steel begins above. VanderCook College of Music moved into the building in early 1996.|$|R
