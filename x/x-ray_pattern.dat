We have used the anomalous diffractometry technique to identify the <b>X-ray</b> <b>patterns</b> of this alloy. For the first time, the radial distribution function of the diffuse rings scattered by this alloy is obtained by applying this new technique. Unlike previous methods used for interpreting the <b>X-ray</b> <b>patterns</b> of this phase, we have introduced a new method of separation for interpreting <b>X-ray</b> <b>patterns.</b> The <b>X-ray</b> diffraction <b>pattern</b> has been numerically resolved into a broad diffuse halo and sharp lines. Using this procedure the correlation position was deduced from a high quality interference function. We {{have not been able}} to explain either the origin of the sharp lines or the relationship of the two parts responsible for the lines and rings. In order to explain the above we need an appropriate geometrical model and some structural information on the medium range order of the atoms causing scattered rings. This information is contained in the partial pair-pair correlation function of the coherent background. The result of this work may be of aid in order to comprehend the “genetic” relationship between the structure of the crystalline, amorphous FK phases and this new metastable alloy or icosahedral phase...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Individual <b>X-Ray</b> {{diffraction}} <b>patterns</b> {{of biological}} tissues are obtained via interference of coherent scattering with their electrons. Many scientists have distinguished normal and cancerous breast tissue, bone density, and urinary stone types using the <b>X-Ray</b> diffraction <b>patterns</b> resulting from coherent scattering. The {{goal of this}} study was to introduce an optimized method for obtaining <b>X-ray</b> diffraction <b>patterns</b> of different types from biological tissues. Materials and Methods A special tool constituting primary and scatter collimators as well as a sample holder was designed and built. All measurements were done using an X-ray tube, the above-mentioned tool, and a semiconductor detector (HPGe). The <b>X-ray</b> diffraction <b>patterns</b> of some tissue-equivalent materials (acrylic, polyethylene, nylon, and calcium carbonate) and biological tissues (adipose, muscle, and bone) were obtained. Results The corresponding peak positions for adipose, muscle, bone, acrylic, polyethylene, nylon, and calcium carbonate in corresponding <b>X-ray</b> diffraction <b>patterns</b> are located in 1. 1 ± 0. 055 nm- 1, 1. 41 ± 0. 072, 1. 6 ± 0. 08 nm- 1, 0. 8 ± 0. 04 nm- 1, 1. 03 ± 0. 051 nm- 1, 1. 22 ± 0. 061 nm- 1, and 1. 7 ± 0. 085 nm- 1, respectively.

40|$|Background: Paediatric multidrug-resistant {{tuberculosis}} (MDR-TB) necessitates a prolonged {{duration of treatment}} with an intensive treatment regimen. The chest <b>X-ray</b> <b>patterns</b> of pulmonary TB depend on a multiplicity of factors, including immune status, and therefore identifying the influence of HIV on the chest X-ray appearances of MDR-TB may assist with improving the diagnostic criteria. Objectives: To describe the demographic characteristics and chest <b>X-ray</b> <b>patterns</b> of children with pulmonary MDR-TB and to compare the chest <b>X-ray</b> <b>patterns</b> of pulmonary MDR-TB between children who are HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected. Method: Retrospective chart review of hospital notes and chest X-rays of children with pulmonary MDR-TB at King Dinuzulu Hospital, Durban. The chest X-rays were systematically reviewed {{for the presence of}} the following variables: hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bronchopneumonic opacification, segmental/lobar consolidation, cavities, miliary opacification and pleural effusion. Results: Forty-five children (mean age, 6. 29 years; median age, 6. 00 years) with pulmonary MDR-TB met the inclusion criteria. The most common chest X-ray finding was consolidation (53. 5 %), followed by lymphadenopathy (35. 6 %), bronchopneumonic opacification (33. 3 %) and cavities (31. 1 %). Cavities were more common (OR 6. 1; 95 % CI 1. 52 – 24. 66) in children who had been initiated on standard anti-TB treatment for the current TB episode. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the chest <b>X-ray</b> <b>patterns</b> in HIV-uninfected (n = 22) compared with HIV-infected (n = 20) children. Conclusion: The most common chest X-ray finding was consolidation, followed by lymphadenopathy, bronchopneumonic opacification and cavities. The finding of a significantly higher frequency of cavities in children who had received prior standard anti-TB treatment for the current TB episode could reflect poor disease containment and increased parenchymal damage, owing to a delay in the recognition of MDR-TB. The development of cavitation in chest X-rays of children with TB could raise concern for the possibility of MDR-TB, and prompt further testing. </p...|$|R
40|$|This note is a {{plea for}} authors to include <b>X-ray</b> {{diffractometer}} <b>patterns</b> in their articles and offers some suggestions for {{improving the quality of}} those patterns. The reasons for publishing <b>X-ray</b> <b>patterns</b> of clays are obvious, yet many papers lack such documentation. Published patterns are needed because clay mineral identification may not be straightforward, particularly for mixed-layer clays. An article with an incorrect or incomplete interpretation is still useful if it includes representative <b>patterns.</b> Without <b>X-ray</b> <b>patterns</b> uch an article is doubly dangerous. But even if an author's interpretation is correct on one level of interest, peak shape, peak breadth, low-angle scattering, shoulders, etc., may interest future workers, permitting an extension which would not be possible from tabulated peak positions and intensities. Published iffractometer patterns must be of good quality to be useful. To produce a good pattern, the diffractometer must be well-adjusted, and the clay must have the proper orientation, random for all reflections and as well-oriented as possible for the 001 reflections. Good 00 l reflections can be obtained as follows: 1. Use ultrasonics, rather than grinding or blending only, to disaggregate the clay...|$|R

40|$|Biopolymers from {{agricultural}} starchy commodities can be {{raw materials}} for edible, biologically degradable plastics. They have promising uses, having been proposed for replacing synthetic films. There are several starchy sources not yet quite exploited such as tropical roots and tubers that could be excellent starch sources to produce edible films with distinctive functional properties. The objective {{of this study was}} to formulate edible films from six tropical starchy crops. Starches were extracted and purified to 97 - 99 % purity from Ipomoea batatas, Arracacia xanthorriza roots, Colocasia esculenta, Xanthosoma sagittifolium corms, and Dioscorea trifida tubers (white and purple) cultivated in the Venezuelan Amazons. The non-conventional starches were characterized for purity, amylose content and gelatinization profile by differential scanning calorimetry, starch granular morphometry and rheological properties. Starch-based films were processed by casting solutions prepared with each starch, glycerol, and distilled water. Starch suspensions were gelatinized by heat, degassed, poured in plates and dried. In the films, studies performed were water vapor, oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability, and mechanical properties in terms of tensile strength. Crystallinity patterns of native starches and films were also obtained. Ipomoea batatas and Colocasia esculenta exhibited polymorphism A+B type <b>X-ray</b> <b>pattern,</b> Xanthosoma sagittifolium, an A-type <b>X-ray</b> <b>pattern,</b> and Arracacia xanthorriza and both Diosocrea trifida, B-type patterns; while starch-based films had all a B-type <b>X-ray</b> <b>pattern.</b> As expected, the potential for these types of films are more in the area of decreasing gas exchange rather than retardation of water loss due to their hydrophilic nature. Films from these non-conventional starch sources with barrier and mechanical characteristics tailored for specific uses can be of interest as plastics for the food industry and results may be of significance also, for starch-based foams.
