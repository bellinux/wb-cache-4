40|$|Background: Using {{the fastest}} dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> {{available}} {{is an easy}} way of reducing exposure to ionizing radiation. However, the diagnostic ability of fast films {{for the detection of}} proximal surface caries must be demonstrated before these films will become universally accepted. Methods: Extracted premolar and molar teeth were arranged to simulate a bitewing examination and radiographed using Ultraspeed and Ektaspeed Plus dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>films.</b> Three different exposure times were used for each film type. Six general dentists were used to determine the presence and depth of the decay in the proximal surfaces of the teeth radiographed. The actual extent of the decay in the teeth was determined by sectioning the teeth and examining them under a microscope. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the two films for the mean correct diagnosis. However, there was a significant difference between the means for the three exposure times used for Ultraspeed film. The practitioners used were not consistent in their ability to make a correct diagnosis, or for the film for which they got the highest correct diagnosis. Conclusions: Ektaspeed Plus dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> is just as reliable as Ultraspeed dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> for the detection of proximal surface decay. The effect of underexposure was significant for Ultraspeed, but not for Ektaspeed Plus. Patient exposure can be reduced significantly with no loss of diagnostic ability by changing from Ultraspeed <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> to Ektaspeed Plus <b>X-ray</b> <b>film...</b>|$|R

40|$|The ischiopubic {{index was}} studied in adult pelvic <b>X-ray</b> <b>films</b> of {{subjects}} aged eighteen to seventy years. A total of 120 <b>X-ray</b> <b>films</b> made of 60 males and 60 females {{were collected from}} LUTH, Lagos State. The ischiopubic index was calculated by dividing the pubic length by ischial length and by multiplying by 100. The mean ischiopubic index for males was 101. 05 ± 16. 65 {{and that of the}} females was 115. 99 ± 18. 5. Sex differences of these indices were statistically significant (P< 0. 001) for both sexes. The mean length of the females pubis was significantly longer than that for males (P< 0. 001), and similarly the mean length of ischium in males was significantly longer than that of the females (P< 0. 001). Using <b>X-ray</b> <b>films,</b> sex could be assigned using demarking points to 47 % and 50 % females in Lagos State. In conclusion, this research has provided evidence that the ischiopubic index and the demarking points are reliable in sexing the hip bones of Nigerians (using <b>X-ray</b> <b>films).</b> Thus the ischiopubic index may be of value in forensic and archaeological analyses and in solving medicolegal cases...|$|R

50|$|The first radiographs (X-ray images) {{were made}} by the action of X-rays on {{sensitized}} glass photographic plates. <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> (photographic film) soon replaced the glass plates, and film has been used for decades to acquire (and display) medical and industrial images. Gradually, digital computers gained the ability to store and display enough data to make digital imaging possible. Since the 1990s, computerized radiography and digital radiography have been replacing photographic film in medical and dental applications, though film technology remains in widespread use in industrial radiography processes (e.g. to inspect welded seams). The metal silver (formerly necessary to the radiographic & photographic industries) is a non-renewable resource although silver can easily be reclaimed from spent <b>X-ray</b> <b>film.</b> Where <b>X-ray</b> <b>films</b> required wet processing facilities, newer digital technologies do not.

All landmarks on the film and digital cephalometric image were traced using manual method (via tracing paper) and computerized method (via Rhinoceros 2. 0 software) respectively. The landmarks were identified five times for each method to ensure the precision of the landmark identification. The results of landmark identification for both manual and computerize methods were compared by measurement of angle SNA, SNB, ANB and MMPA, and linear distance between Po-Or, PNS-ANS and Go-Me.
