The phosphates are associated by biotite-chlorite intergrowths, Ti-Fe oxides, carbonates, sulphides, sulphosalts. Studied monazites and <b>xenotimes</b> vary in composition and morphology.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} new age {{constraints}} {{for the lower}} part of the Meso-Neoproterozoic sedimentary Mbuji-Mayi Supergroup (Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC). This Supergroup preserves a large diversity of organic-walled microfossils, evidencing the diversification of early eukaryotes for the first time in Central Africa. We use different methods such as in situ U-Pb geochronology by LA-ICP-MS and U-Th-Pb chemical datings by Electron Microprobe on diagenetic and detrital minerals such as <b>xenotimes,</b> monazites and zircons. We attempt to better constrain the provenance of the Mbuji-Mayi sediments and the minimum age of the Mbuji-Mayi Supergroup to constrain the age of the microfossils. Results with LA-ICP-MS and EMP provide new ages between 1030 and 1065 Ma for the diagenesis of {{the lower part of}} the sedimentary sequence. These results are consistent with data on biostratigraphy supporting the occurrence of worldwide changes at the Mesoproterozoic/Neoproterozoic boundary...|$|R
40|$|The Shisha Pangma pluton forming {{most of the}} Xixabangma (8027 m) massif {{in south}} Tibet {{is one of the}} 20 + larger leucogranite intrusives that mark the highest {{structural}} levels of the Himalayan metamorphic core. The pluton occurs immediately below the Shisha Pangma Detachment, a strand of the South Tibetan Detachment (STD) system, a low angle (30 °) north-dipping normal fault placing Paleozoic black slates atop sillimanitc-grade pelites and calc-silicate rocks. K-feldspar augen gneisses containing fibrolite and sillimanite paragneisses along the footwall show strong internal S-C fabrics indicative of down-to-the-north extension. The Shisha Pangma leucogranite is a heterogeneous, polyphase intrusion with an earlier, foliated biotite-rich phase and a later, tourmaline + muscovite rich phase typically containing the assemblage: Kfs + Pl + Qtz + Ms + Tur ± Gt ± Bt ± Sil ± Ap. The highly peraluminous granites have high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios (0. 738 - 0. 750) typical of pelite-derived anatectites. Nd-depleted mantle model ages (from present Nd isotopic data and an assumed crustal 147 Sm/ 144 Nd of 0. 10 ± 0. 02) are 1. 5 - 2. 2 Ga, indicating a substantial early Proterozoic or older crustal residence age for much of the source material. <b>Xenotimes</b> and monazites from a weakly foliated biotite granite immediately beneath the STD (X 8) give consistent U-Pb ages of 20. 2 ± 0. 2 Ma. Zircon, uraninite, and monazite from the main Shisha Pangma tourmaline + muscovite ± garnet phase (X 20) give an U-Pb age of 17. 3 ± 0. 2 Ma. A sill complex above the main leucogranite body is aligned parallel to the metamorphic fabric dipping at 10 - 30 ° N, although a few dikes cross-cut the metamorphic fabric beneath the STD. Nowhere do the leucogranites cut the STD, and the age of normal faulting must largely post-date 17. 3 ± 0. 2 Ma. Muscovite from the main leucogranite phase has an 40 Ar/ 39 Ar plateau age of 16. 74 ± 0. 22 Ma. Apatite fission track ages for leucogranite samples from 5800 - 8000 m range from 12. 3 ± 1. 9 to 14. 8 ± 0. 8 Ma (± 2 σ), only slightly younger than the main leucogranite crystallization age. Following crustal melting, steep cooling curves (> 90 - 180 °C/myr) and rapid exhumation rates (∼ 4 mm/yr) from 17 - 14 Ma resulted in removal of at least 12 km of overburden, both by erosion and normal faulting. If high erosion and exhumation rates correlate with high topography (and high precipitation) these data suggest that the Himalaya reached their maximum topographic elevation around 17 Ma...|$|R
5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or <b>xenotime</b> are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{ytterbium}} is {{a mixture}} of seven stable isotopes, which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of the minerals monazite, euxenite, and <b>xenotime.</b> The ytterbium concentration is low because it is found only among many other rare earth elements; moreover, it is among the least abundant. Once extracted and prepared, ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant. The metal is a fire and explosion hazard.|$|E
5|$|While {{dysprosium}} {{is never}} encountered {{as a free}} element, it is found in many minerals, including <b>xenotime,</b> fergusonite, gadolinite, euxenite, polycrase, blomstrandine, monazite and bastnäsite; often with erbium and holmium or other rare earth elements. Currently, most dysprosium is being obtained from the ion-adsorption clay ores of southern China, and future sources will include the Halls Creek region in Western Australia. In the high-yttrium version of these, dysprosium {{happens to be the}} most abundant of the heavy lanthanides, comprising up to 7–8% of the concentrate (as compared to about 65% for yttrium). The concentration of Dy in the Earth's crust is about 5.2mg/kg and in sea water 0.9ng/L.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium {{is found}} with other rare earth {{elements}} in several rare minerals. It is most often recovered commercially from monazite sand (0.03% ytterbium). The element {{is also found in}} euxenite and <b>xenotime.</b> The main mining areas are China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. Reserves of ytterbium are estimated as one million tonnes. Ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths, but ion-exchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the mid- to late 20th century have simplified separation. Compounds of ytterbium are rare and have not yet been well characterized. The abundance of ytterbium in the Earth's crust is about 3mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} never {{found in nature}} in pure form, but it is found in small {{quantities}} in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite. However, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, <b>xenotime,</b> and euxenite. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5mg/kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by moles. Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of thulium. Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100,000 tonnes. Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for promethium.|$|E
25|$|Hafnon (HfSiO4), <b>xenotime</b> (YPO4), béhierite, schiavinatoite ((Ta,Nb)BO4), thorite (ThSiO4), and {{coffinite}} (USiO4) {{all share}} the same crystal structure (VIIIX IVY O4) as zircon.|$|E
25|$|Well-known {{minerals}} containing yttrium include gadolinite, <b>xenotime,</b> samarskite, euxenite, fergusonite, yttrotantalite, yttrotungstite, yttrofluorite (a {{variety of}} fluorite), thalenite, yttrialite. Small amounts occur in zircon, which derives its typical yellow fluorescence {{from some of}} the accompanying heavy lanthanides. The zirconium mineral eudialyte, such as is found in southern Greenland, contains small but potentially useful amounts of yttrium. Of the above yttrium minerals, most played a part in providing research quantities of lanthanides during the discovery days. <b>Xenotime</b> is occasionally recovered as a byproduct of heavy-sand processing, but is not as abundant as the similarly recovered monazite (which typically contains a few percent of yttrium). Uranium ores from Ontario have occasionally yielded yttrium as a byproduct.|$|E
500|$|Europium is {{associated}} with the other rare-earth elements and is, therefore, mined together with them. Separation of the rare-earth elements {{is a step in the}} later processing. Rare-earth elements are found in the minerals bastnäsite, loparite-(Ce), <b>xenotime,</b> and monazite in mineable quantities. Bastnäsite is an orthophosphate mineral [...] (Ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except promethium), loparite-(Ce) is an oxide, and <b>xenotime</b> is a fluorocarbonate LnCO3F. Monazite also contains thorium and yttrium, which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive. For the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides, several methods have been developed. The choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate. Roasting the ore and subsequent acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides. If cerium is the dominant lanthanide, then it is converted from cerium(III) to cerium(IV) and then precipitated. Further separation by solvent extractions or ion exchange chromatography yields a fraction which is enriched in europium. This fraction is reduced with zinc, zinc/amalgam, electrolysis or other methods converting the europium(III) to europium(II). Europium(II) reacts in a way similar to that of alkaline earth metals and therefore it can be precipitated as carbonate or is co-precipitated with barium sulfate. Europium metal is available through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten EuCl3 and NaCl (or CaCl2) in a graphite cell, which serves as cathode, using graphite as anode. The other product is chlorine gas.|$|E
500|$|In 1815, the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius {{analysed}} {{an unusual}} sample of gadolinite from a copper mine in Falun, central Sweden. He noted impregnated traces {{of a white}} mineral, which he cautiously assumed to be an earth (oxide in modern chemical nomenclature) of an unknown element. Berzelius had already discovered two elements, cerium and selenium, but {{he had made a}} public mistake once, announcing a new element, gahnium, {{that turned out to be}} zinc oxide. Berzelius privately named the putative element [...] "thorium" [...] in 1817 and its supposed oxide [...] "thorina" [...] after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. In 1824, after more deposits of the same mineral in Vest-Agder, Norway, were discovered, he retracted his findings, as the mineral proved to be mostly yttrium orthophosphate. As the yttrium in this mineral was initially mistaken for a new element, the mineral was named kenotime by the French mineralogist François Sulpice Beudant as a rebuke of Berzelius, from the Greek words κενός (kenos; [...] "empty") and τιμή (timē; [...] "honour"). This became [...] "xenotime" [...] as a misprint from the beginning, blunting the criticism. This misspelt form was later explained as being from ξένος (xenos; [...] "alien") and τιμή, supposedly in reference to the small, rare and easily overlooked crystals that <b>xenotime</b> occurs as.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, {{among the}} {{anhydrous}} rare-earth phosphates, {{it is the}} tetragonal mineral <b>xenotime</b> that incorporates yttrium and the yttrium earths, whereas the monoclinic monazite phase incorporates cerium and the cerium earths preferentially. The smaller size of the yttrium group allows it a greater solid solubility in the rock-forming minerals that comprise Earth's mantle, and thus yttrium and the yttrium earths show less enrichment in Earth's crust relative to chondritic abundance than does cerium and the cerium earths. This has economic consequences: large ore bodies of the cerium earths are known {{around the world and}} are being exploited. Corresponding ore bodies for yttrium tend to be rarer, smaller, and less concentrated. Most of the current supply of yttrium originates in the [...] "ion-absorption clay" [...] ores of Southern China. Some versions provide concentrates containing about 65% yttrium oxide, with the heavy lanthanides being present in ratios reflecting the Oddo–Harkins rule: even-numbered heavy lanthanides at abundances of about 5% each, and odd-numbered lanthanides at abundances of about 1% each. Similar compositions are found in <b>xenotime</b> or gadolinite.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Xenotime</b> is a {{rare earth}} {{phosphate}} mineral, the major component of which is yttrium orthophosphate (YPO4). It forms a solid solution series with chernovite-(Y) (YAsO4) and therefore may contain trace impurities of arsenic as well as silicon dioxide and calcium. The rare earth elements dysprosium, erbium, terbium and ytterbium as well as metal elements such as thorium and uranium (all replacing yttrium) are the expressive secondary components of <b>xenotime.</b> Due to uranium and thorium impurities, some <b>xenotime</b> specimens may be weakly to strongly radioactive. Lithiophyllite, monazite and purpurite are sometimes grouped with <b>xenotime</b> in the informal [...] "anhydrous phosphates" [...] group. <b>Xenotime</b> is used chiefly {{as a source of}} yttrium and heavy lanthanide metals (dysprosium, ytterbium, erbium and gadolinium). Occasionally, gemstones are also cut from the finer <b>xenotime</b> crystals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xenotime</b> has two {{directions}} of perfect prismatic cleavage and its fracture is uneven to irregular (sometimes splintery). It is considered brittle and its streak is white. The refractive index of <b>xenotime</b> is 1.720-1.815 with a birefringence of 0.095 (uniaxial positive). <b>Xenotime</b> is dichroic with pink, yellow or yellowish brown {{seen in the}} extraordinary ray and brownish yellow, grayish brown or greenish brown seen in the ordinary ray. There is no reaction under ultraviolet light. While <b>xenotime</b> may contain significant amounts of thorium or uranium, the mineral does not undergo metamictization like sphene or zircon would.|$|E
50|$|Crystallising in the tetragonal (I41/amd) crystal system, <b>xenotime</b> is {{typically}} translucent to opaque (rarely transparent) {{in shades of}} brown to brownish yellow (most common) but also reddish to greenish brown and gray. <b>Xenotime</b> has a variable habit: It may be prismatic (stubby or slender and elongate) with dipyramidal terminations, in radial or granular aggregates, or rosettes. A soft mineral (Mohs hardness 4.5), <b>xenotime</b> is - in comparison to most other translucent minerals - fairly dense, with a specific gravity between 4.4 - 5.1. Its lustre, which may be vitreous to resinous, together with its crystal system, {{may lead to a}} confusion with zircon (ZrSiO4), the latter having a similar crystal structure and with which <b>xenotime</b> may sometimes occur.|$|E
50|$|Occurring {{as a minor}} {{accessory}} mineral, <b>xenotime</b> {{is found}} in pegmatites and other igneous rocks, as well as gneisses rich in mica and quartz. Associated minerals include biotite and other micas, chlorite group minerals, quartz, zircon, certain feldspars, analcime, anatase, brookite, rutile, siderite and apatite. <b>Xenotime</b> is also known to be diagenetic: It may form as minute grains or as extremely thin (less than 10 µ) coatings on detrital zircon grains in siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. The importance of these diagenetic <b>xenotime</b> deposits in the radiometric dating of sedimentary rocks is only beginning to be realised.|$|E

5000|$|The name <b>xenotime</b> is {{from the}} Greek words κενός vain and τιμή honor, akin to [...] "vainglory".

In terms of crystal structure, it is the vanadate analog of the rare-earth phosphate mineral <b>xenotime.</b> Unlike <b>xenotime,</b> it is more favorable for wakefieldite to contain the lighter rare-earth elements over the heavier ones. Due to the lanthanide contraction, the heavier rare earths have smaller ionic radii than the lighter ones.
