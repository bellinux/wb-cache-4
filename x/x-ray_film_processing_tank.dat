In this report, fundamental study on the feasibility of the ozonation and the combined use of ozone-ultraviolet radiation was performed for the <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> <b>processing</b> wastes discharged from the hospitals. More than 90 % COD reduction was attained, when the wastes, developer or bleaching solution, were diluted to 50 times with water and controlled at pH of about 11, followed with ozonation for 3 hr with 9. 2 mg/l in a 3 l/min air stream...|$|R
40|$|For every diagnostical X-ray {{radiation}} exposure the applied dose {{has to be}} limited to the smallest possible value. Within the scope of a general Swiss survey it has been found that in the various medical practices and hospitals the applied doses varied quite strongly. The main reasons leading to an overdose were the operating conditions of the <b>X-ray</b> and <b>film</b> <b>processing</b> equipment, the <b>film</b> and foil materials and improper filming techniques. The applied single dose served as a measure for the radiation protection assessment of diagnostical X-ray exposures. To prevent this in the future, individual patients who are exposed to unnecessary radiation loads should be regularly checked in quality-ensuring tests...|$|R
40|$|Diseases {{affecting}} the respiratory and cardiovascular systems {{are on the}} increase {{in many developing countries}} and often lead to death. Life style and work environment tend to contribute to the ugly development which is worsened by lack of the right drugs for treatment. Empirical observations showed that the disease was seen more in people exposed to chemical fumes. Unfortunately, majority of the radiology practices in developing countries including Nigeria is darkroom-based, thus exposing radiographers and darkroom staff to <b>x-ray</b> <b>film</b> <b>processing</b> chemical fumes. This experimental research was aimed at investigating the cardiopulmonary reactions in wistar rats exposed to <b>x-ray</b> <b>film</b> developer solutions of varying concentrations. Eighteen apparently healthy wistar rats of 20 - 24 week weighing between 208 g and 210 g were put in three groups A-C of 6 rats each. Group A was the control group while groups Band C were the experimental groups. The rats in the experimental groups were exposed to varying concentrations of the <b>x-ray</b> <b>film</b> developer solution fumes for periods ranging from 15 - 30 days (1 st - 30 th June, 2014) while the rats in the control group were not. At the end of each desired period, two rats from each group were randomly selected, painlessly sacrificed and the lungs and hearts harvested and sent to the medical laboratory sciences department of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital for examination and analysis. Micrographs of the lungs tissues in the experimental groups showed histological changes of tissue injury evidenced by macrophage infiltration, distortion of interstitial tissue architecture, thickening of basement membrane, tissue fibrosis and formation of pleomorphic nuclei which are inflammatory responses indicating cellular injuries. The observed histological changes increased with the concentration of the developer solution and the duration of exposure to the developer solution. Micrographs of the hearts in the experimental and control groups showed normal histological appearances. When the changes in the lungs are extrapolated to a 70 kg human subject, these histological changes would manifest within twenty-five year of exposure to the developer solution...|$|R
50|$|The first radiographs (X-ray images) {{were made}} by the action of X-rays on {{sensitized}} glass photographic plates. <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> (photographic film) soon replaced the glass plates, and film has been used for decades to acquire (and display) medical and industrial images. Gradually, digital computers gained the ability to store and display enough data to make digital imaging possible. Since the 1990s, computerized radiography and digital radiography have been replacing photographic film in medical and dental applications, though film technology remains in widespread use in industrial radiography processes (e.g. to inspect welded seams). The metal silver (formerly necessary to the radiographic & photographic industries) is a non-renewable resource although silver can easily be reclaimed from spent <b>X-ray</b> <b>film.</b> Where <b>X-ray</b> <b>films</b> required wet <b>processing</b> facilities, newer digital technologies do not. Digital archiving of images also saves physical storage space.|$|R
50|$|Instead of <b>X-ray</b> <b>film,</b> digital {{radiography}} uses a digital image capture device. This gives advantages of immediate image preview and availability; elimination of costly <b>film</b> <b>processing</b> steps; a wider dynamic range, {{which makes it}} more forgiving for over- and under-exposure; {{as well as the}} ability to apply special image processing techniques that enhance overall display quality of the image.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of good quality radiographs {{is a complex}} process, given {{the high level of}} image quality required (Sniureviciute & Adliene, 2005 : 260). Exposure of patients to x-rays, a factor in the {{production of}} quality radiographs also entails a risk of radiation injury. In 2006, computerized radiography (CR) was introduced at The Nairobi Hospital to try and reduce the film reject rate, decrease repeats, reduce financial costs of consumables like <b>x-ray</b> <b>films</b> and <b>processing</b> chemicals. However, to date, no formal film reject analysis has been conducted at The Nairobi Hospital. Four years after the incorporation of CR, there is apparently, still a significant number of film rejects, implying operational costs may still be high. The cause of film rejects and overall reject cost is not known. This has led to the research question: “Has the film reject rate in the A & E x-ray unit at The Nairobi Hospital reduced following incorporation of CR?” A quantitative, retrospective, descriptive study involving a reject film analysis of rejected radiographs in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) x-ray unit in the Nairobi Hospital, Kenya was conducted. The researcher collected data for a period of 6 months between 2 / 12 / 07 and 28 / 05 / 08 using a purpose-designed data collection form. All rejected <b>x-ray</b> <b>films</b> during the study period were included. Capture and analysis of the collected data was completed by the researcher using SPSS 10 and EPINFO computer packages. Permission to conduct the study was obtained from The Nairobi Hospital Education Committee and due consideration to patient and radiographer confidentiality was maintained throughout the study. A total of 851 (2. 5 percent) <b>x-ray</b> <b>films</b> were collected during the study period. Four hundred and fourteen (2. 6 percent) radiographs and 437 (2. 5 percent) radiographs were rejected prior to and after the incorporation of CR respectively. Chest radiographs were the most frequently rejected accounting for 277 (66. 9 percent) and 123 (28. 1 percent) prior to and after the incorporation of CR respectively. The most frequently rejected film size was 35 x 35 cm prior to the incorporation of CR (61. 6 percent) and 26 x 35 cm film size after the incorporation of CR (91. 3 percent). The most frequent cause of film rejects was radiographer causes both prior to and after the incorporation of CR accounting for 496 (58. 3 percent). The film reject rate did not significantly reduce after the incorporation of CR, suggesting that there are other factors which contribute to reject rate, other than CR. The study also shows that higher film consumption does not necessarily lead to high reject rates. The percentage value on annual rejects did not change after the incorporation of CR and a demonstrated increase in the annual cost of purchasing <b>x-ray</b> <b>films</b> was attributed to an increase in annual consumption after the incorporation of CR, and also to the higher cost of digital <b>x-ray</b> <b>films.</b> Despite some identified limitations to this study, some recommendations, which included conduction of regular reject analyses and regular continuing professional development with respect to radiographic technique amongst others, were suggeste...|$|R

40|$|Background: Using {{the fastest}} dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> {{available}} {{is an easy}} way of reducing exposure to ionizing radiation. However, the diagnostic ability of fast films {{for the detection of}} proximal surface caries must be demonstrated before these films will become universally accepted. Methods: Extracted premolar and molar teeth were arranged to simulate a bitewing examination and radiographed using Ultraspeed and Ektaspeed Plus dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>films.</b> Three different exposure times were used for each film type. Six general dentists were used to determine the presence and depth of the decay in the proximal surfaces of the teeth radiographed. The actual extent of the decay in the teeth was determined by sectioning the teeth and examining them under a microscope. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the two films for the mean correct diagnosis. However, there was a significant difference between the means for the three exposure times used for Ultraspeed film. The practitioners used were not consistent in their ability to make a correct diagnosis, or for the film for which they got the highest correct diagnosis. Conclusions: Ektaspeed Plus dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> is just as reliable as Ultraspeed dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> for the detection of proximal surface decay. The effect of underexposure was significant for Ultraspeed, but not for Ektaspeed Plus. Patient exposure can be reduced significantly with no loss of diagnostic ability by changing from Ultraspeed <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> to Ektaspeed Plus <b>X-ray</b> <b>film...</b>|$|R
