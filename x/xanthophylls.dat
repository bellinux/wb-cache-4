25|$|Carotenoids like {{lycopene}} {{are important}} pigments found in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes in plants, photosynthetic bacteria, fungi, and algae. They {{are responsible for}} the bright orangered colors of fruits and vegetables, perform various functions in photosynthesis, and protect photosynthetic organisms from excessive light damage. Lycopene is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of many important carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, and <b>xanthophylls.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carotenes {{are found}} in plants in two primary forms {{designated}} by characters from the Greek alphabet: alpha-carotene (α-carotene) and beta-carotene (β-carotene). Gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, and zeta-carotene (γ, δ, ε, and ζ-carotene) also exist. Since they are hydrocarbons, and therefore contain no oxygen, carotenes are fat-soluble and insoluble in water (in contrast with other carotenoids, the <b>xanthophylls,</b> which contain oxygen and thus are less chemically hydrophobic).|$|E
40|$|This Perspective {{summarizes}} {{the state of}} knowledge {{of the impact of}} ultraviolet radiation on the photoprotective <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle in marine phytoplankton. Excess photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400 - 700 nm) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR; 280 - 400 nm) affect various cellular processes and can potentially lead to reduced growth or viability loss in situ. Algae deploy photoprotective mechanisms that limit the hazardous effects of excess light exposure. <b>Xanthophyll</b> cycle pigments {{play a crucial role in}} photoprotection via the development of non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ) during excess radiation exposure. Research on the interacting effects of excess PAR and UVR exposure on <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle pigment synthesis and <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle activity has produced contrasting views. The current contribution summarizes research on photoprotection via photoregulation (<b>xanthophyll</b> cycle activity) and photoacclimation (adjustment of the <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle pigment pool) for marine phytoplankton. Subsequently, UVR effects on the <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle and on <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle pigment pools are discussed and results of supporting experiments with the common diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii are presented. We show that UVR exposure may enhance <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle pigment synthesis. This suggests that UVR-induced reduction in de-epoxidation state does not necessarily imply reduced energy dissipating potential...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In a 16 -day {{experiment}} involving 270 32 -week-old laying hens, dehydrated {{turf grass}} (DTG) and corn gluten meal (CGM) were compared as <b>xanthophyll</b> sources for egg yolk pigmentation. Experimental diets were formulated to contain, 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg total xan-thophyll/kg diet, provided as either DTG or CGM. Neither egg production nor feed consumption {{was affected by}} diet. Egg yolk color dominant wavelength increased slightly with increasing dietary <b>xanthophyll</b> and did not differ with source. Egg yolk color excitation purity increased quadratically (P<. 001) with dietary <b>xanthophyll.</b> The response was similar for both DTG and CGM.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{phytoplankton}} species to initiate photo-protective mechanisms and the rates {{by which they}} do so have been suggested to be partly responsible for species succession. To examine whether this is also true {{in the case of}} diatom spring blooms preceding Phaeocystis globosa, cultures of P. globosa and Thalassiosira sp. were investigated under controlled laboratory conditions for differences in their <b>xanthophyll</b> cycling rates and abilities. It was found that P. globosa exhibited active and rapid <b>xanthophyll</b> cycling when cultures photoacclimated to 10, 50 and 100 µmol quanta m - 2 s - 1, were shifted to 150 and 250 µmol quanta m - 2 s - 1. The early spring diatom Thalassiosira only exhibited <b>xanthophyll</b> cycling when acclimated to 10 µmol quanta m - 2 s - 1. P. globosa always exhibited faster <b>xanthophyll</b> cycling rates than Thalassiosira, giving P. globosa a possible competitive edge over Thalassiosira sp. It was also found that the magnitude of <b>xanthophyll</b> cycling correlates with the intensity of light changes during the one-hour <b>xanthophyll</b> cycling experiments, and thus may be regarded as related to photoacclimation...|$|R
25|$|Chromatography {{was first}} {{employed}} in Russia by the Italian-born scientist Mikhail Tsvet in 1900. He {{continued to work}} with chromatography {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century, primarily for the separation of plant pigments such as chlorophyll, carotenes, and <b>xanthophylls.</b> Since these components have different colors (green, orange, and yellow, respectively) they gave the technique its name. New types of chromatography developed during the 1930s and 1940s made the technique useful for many separation processes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to chlorophylls, {{another group of}} yellow–orange pigments called carotenoids are {{also found in the}} photosystems. There are about thirty photosynthetic carotenoids. They help transfer and dissipate excess energy, and their bright colors sometimes override the chlorophyll green, like during the fall, when the leaves of some land plants change color. β-carotene is a bright red-orange carotenoid found in nearly all chloroplasts, like chlorophyll a. <b>Xanthophylls,</b> especially the orange-red zeaxanthin, are also common. Many other forms of carotenoids exist that are only found in certain groups of chloroplasts.|$|E
2500|$|Lutein ( [...] or from Latin luteus meaning [...] "yellow") is a {{xanthophyll}} {{and one of}} 600 known {{naturally occurring}} carotenoids. Lutein is synthesized only by plants and like other <b>xanthophylls</b> is found in high quantities in green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale and yellow carrots. In green plants, <b>xanthophylls</b> act to modulate light energy and serve as non-photochemical quenching agents to deal with triplet chlorophyll (an excited form of chlorophyll), which is overproduced at very high light levels, during photosynthesis. See xanthophyll cycle for this topic.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{violaxanthin}} cycle {{describes the}} reversible conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin via the intermediate antheraxanthin. This light-dependent <b>xanthophyll</b> conversion {{is essential for}} the adaptation of plants and algae to different light conditions and allows a reversible switch of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes between a light-harvesting state under low light and a dissipative state under high light. The photoprotective functions of zeaxanthin have been intensively studied during the last decade, but much less attention has been directed to the mechanism and regulation of <b>xanthophyll</b> conversion. In this review, an overview is given on recent progress in the understanding of the role of (i) <b>xanthophyll</b> binding by antenna proteins and of (ii) the lipid properties of the thylakoid membrane in the regulation of <b>xanthophyll</b> conversion. The consequences of these findings for the mechanism and regulation of <b>xanthophyll</b> conversion in the thylakoid membrane will be discussed...|$|R
50|$|Antheraxanthin is an {{intermediate}} molecule of the <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle in most photosynthetic eukaryotes, namely plants, and some bacteria.

40|$|ABSTRACT Seven {{samples of}} {{commercial}} canola meal; 17 samples of canola seed; 2 samples of mustard seed; and one sample of acidulated canola soapstock were analyzed for <b>xanthophyll</b> concentration.

2500|$|The unconditioned {{biosynthesis}} of lycopene in eukaryotic {{plants and}} in prokaryotic cyanobacteria is similar, {{as are the}} enzymes involved. Synthesis begins with mevalonic acid, which is converted into dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. [...] This is then condensed with three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (an isomer of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate), to give the twenty-carbon geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. [...] Two molecules of this product are then condensed in a tail-to-tail configuration to give the forty-carbon phytoene, the first committed step in carotenoid biosynthesis. [...] Through several desaturation steps, phytoene is converted into lycopene. [...] The two terminal isoprene groups of lycopene can be cyclized to produce beta-carotene, which can then {{be transformed into a}} wide variety of <b>xanthophylls.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} structure of <b>xanthophylls</b> {{is similar to}} that of carotenes, but <b>xanthophylls</b> contain oxygen atoms, while carotenes are purely hydrocarbons with no oxygen. <b>Xanthophylls</b> contain their oxygen either as hydroxyl groups and/or as pairs of hydrogen atoms that are substituted by oxygen atoms acting as a bridge (epoxide). For this reason, they are more polar than the purely hydrocarbon carotenes, and it is this difference that allows their separations from carotenes in many types of chromatography. Typically, carotenes are more orange in color than <b>xanthophylls.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Xanthophylls</b> are {{the most}} common yellow {{pigments}} that form one of two major divisions of the carotenoid group. The name is from Greek xanthos (ξανθος, [...] "yellow") + phyllon (φύλλον, [...] "leaf"). <b>Xanthophylls</b> are most commonly found in the leaves of green plants, but they also find their way into animals through the food they eat. For example, the yellow color of chicken egg yolks, fat, and skin comes from the feed the chickens consume. Chicken farmers understand this, and often add <b>xanthophylls,</b> usually lutein, to make the egg yolks more yellow.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chemical}} {{nature of}} the yellow pigment in budgerigars and other psittacidae is unknown,and {{in the absence of}} a chemical name George A Smith coined the term [...] "psittacins" [...] to cover the yellow, orange and red pigments found in parrots and parrot-like birds. Psittacins impart a far more constant intensity of colour to feathers than do the more commonly found carotenoid pigments such as <b>xanthophyll,</b> the yellow pigment found in the canary. At each moult the canary extracts <b>xanthophyll</b> directly from its food, and the depth of colouration of the growing feathers is determined by the concentration of <b>xanthophyll</b> in its diet. Budgerigars cannot be colour-fed in this way, because they do not use <b>xanthophyll</b> as a pigment.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{characterize}} the changes induced by iron deficiency in the pigment composition of pear (Pyrus communis L.) leaves grown under high light intensities in field conditions in Spain. Iron deficiency induced decreases in neoxanthin and β-carotene concomitantly with decreases in chlorophyll a, whereas lutein and carotenoids within the <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle were less affected.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{characterize}} the changes induced by iron deficiency in the pigment composition of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) leaves. When sugar beet plants were grown hydroponically under limited iron supply, neoxanthin and -carotene decreased concomitantly with chlorophyll a, whereas lutein and the carotenoids within the <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle were less affected. Iron deficiency caused major {{increases in the}} lutein/chlorophyll a and <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle pigments/chlorophyll a molar ratios. <b>Xanthophyll</b> cycle carotenoids in Fe-deficient plants underwent epoxidations and de-epoxidations in response to ambient light conditions. In dark adapted Fe-deficient plants most of the <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle pigment pool was in the epoxidated form violaxanthin. We show, both by HPLC and by in vivo 505 nanometers absorbance changes, that in Fe deficient plants {{and in response to}} light, the de-epoxidated forms antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin were rapidly formed at the expense of violaxanthin. Several hours after returning to dark, the <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle was shifted again toward violaxanthin. The ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence from intact leaves was decreased by iron deficiency. However, in iron deficient leaves this ratio was little affected by light conditions which displace the <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle toward epoxidation or de-epoxidation. This suggests that the functioning of the <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle is not necessarily linked to protection against excess light input.

5000|$|The yellow {{color of}} the human macula lutea (literally, yellow spot) in the retina of the eye results from the lutein and {{zeaxanthin}} it contains, both <b>xanthophylls</b> again requiring a source in the human diet {{to be present in}} the eye.

40|$|Author abstract]Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of the naturally decreasing day-lengths during the fall months on egg yolk colour and serum <b>xanthophyll</b> content in laying hens. Two years old White Leghorn hens were used in these experiments. They were kept in uncontrolled environment which consisted of individual laying cages without artificial light and were fed a commercial all-mash laying ration as a basal diet. All eggs that were broken out were scored using Roche yolk colour fan and the serum <b>xanthophyll</b> content was determined by the method of Wilson. A declines in egg production and feed consumption were observed as the fall months went by, and then egg production paused steadily almost to the end of the experimental period. It was observed during this period that hens which lay at a heigh rate of production deposit fewer <b>xanthophyll</b> in the blood serum than hens lay at a low rate. About pause in laying the yolk colours were still different but the depth decreased somewhat, while the serum <b>xanthophyll</b> content increased relatively at high level. The great increase in serum <b>xanthophyll</b> content was when the hens paused in laying. This increase occurred because of dietary <b>xanthophyll</b> that could not be deposited in the egg yolk.

40|$|Changes in {{photosynthesis}} {{rate and}} photochemical characteristics {{in response to}} high irradiance, followed by recovery at low irradiance, were determined in four groups of sun-acclimated leaves of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.). These four groups were untreated control leaves, leaves treated with either an inhibitor of energy dissipation associated with the <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle (dithiothreitol, DTT) or an inhibitor of chloroplast-encoded protein synthesis (chloramphenicol, CAP), as well as leaves treated {{with a combination of}} DTT + CAP. In these sun leaves, treatment with either CAP or DTT alone did not result in an inhibition of the recovery from high-light-induced decreases in photochemical efficiency. Only the treatment with a combination of CAP + DTT caused a strong and irreversible depression of photochemical efficiency. We suggest that in the presence of DTT (and in the absence of <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle-associated energy dissipation), protein turnover may be involved in the recovery process. We further suggest that the reversible depression of photochemical efficiency in CAP-treated sun leaves reflects <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle-associated energy dissipation.
