5|$|Though {{molybdenum}} forms compounds {{with various}} organic molecules, including carbohydrates and amino acids, it is transported throughout {{the human body}} as MoO42−. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes were known by 2002, mostly in bacteria, and the number is increasing with every year; those enzymes include aldehyde oxidase, sulfite oxidase and <b>xanthine</b> oxidase. In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of <b>xanthine</b> to uric acid, a process of purine catabolism, is catalyzed by <b>xanthine</b> oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of <b>xanthine</b> oxidase is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} molybdenum in the body. However, an extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the trend and can act as an inhibitor in both purine catabolism and other processes. Molybdenum concentration also affects protein synthesis, metabolism, and growth.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies contain unique {{chemical}} compounds that {{are derived from}} phenylpropanoids. The compounds, named squarrosidine and pinillidine, inhibit the enzyme <b>xanthine</b> oxidase. <b>Xanthine</b> oxidase catalyzes the crystallization of uric acid in the joints, a main cause of gouty arthritis, and inhibitors of this enzyme are being used clinically to reduce this side effect. The natural function of these compounds may be to quench reactive oxygen species produced by plants as a defensive response to fungal infection.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the polar}} lipids, the outer layer of MFGM {{contains}} {{a number of}} glycosylated and non-glycosylated proteins. Proteomic analysis has revealed at least 191 different known proteins in human MFGM, and comparable numbers in bovine milk protein concentrates. While quantitatively these only represent 1% to 2% of total milk protein content, MFGM proteins are of significant interest because many {{are known to have}} bioactive and potentially beneficial properties; almost half of identified proteins have membrane/protein trafficking or cell signaling functions. The glycosylated proteins, including mucins (MUC-1, MUC-4, MUC-15), butyrophilin, lactadherin, and CD36, have been suggested to enhance triacylglyceride digestion efficiency. Furthermore, lactadherin and MUC-1, in addition to the non-glycosylated protein <b>xanthine</b> oxidase, have been shown or suggested in preclinical studies to possess antimicrobial properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xanthines</b> such as {{caffeine}} and theobromine are cAMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitors. However, the inhibitory effect of <b>xanthines</b> on phosphodiesterases are only seen at dosages higher than what people normally consume.Sildenafil are PDE V inhibitors and {{are widely used}} {{in the treatment of}} erectile dysfunction.|$|R
50|$|But {{different}} analogues show varying potency at {{the numerous}} subtypes, {{and a wide}} range of synthetic <b>xanthines</b> (some nonmethylated) have been developed searching for compounds with greater selectivity for phosphodiesterase enzyme or adenosine receptor subtypes. <b>Xanthines</b> are also found very rarely as constituents of nucleic acids.|$|R
50|$|The {{naturally}} occurring compounds caffeine and theophylline are structurally classified as methylated <b>xanthines.</b> The side effects seen in <b>xanthines</b> are seen jittery, over energetic behavior, {{as well as}} potentially insomnia. Other side effects can include diuresis, gastrointestinal irritation, and rarely ringing in the ears. At high doses they can also cause psychological dependence.|$|R
25|$|In mice with hyperuricemia, Phellodendron amurense (whether raw or {{processed}} with salt) reduced blood {{uric acid}} levels by inhibiting <b>xanthine</b> oxidase activity.|$|E

25|$|Theobromine {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1841 in cacao beans by Russian chemist Alexander Voskresensky. Synthesis of theobromine from <b>xanthine</b> was first reported in 1882 by Hermann Emil Fischer.|$|E
25|$|Hypouricaemia {{occurs in}} a number of purine disorders, in {{particular}} xanthinuria. Despite having complete absence of blood uric acid, xanthinuria patients do not have any neuropathology, nor any other disease states – other than the kidney stones caused by accumulation of insoluble <b>xanthine</b> in lieu of uric acid.|$|E
25|$|Some analog {{substances}} {{have been}} created which mimic caffeine's properties with either function or structure or both. Of the latter group are the xanthines DMPX and 8-chlorotheophylline, which is an ingredient in dramamine. Members of a class of nitrogen substituted xanthines are often proposed as potential alternatives to caffeine. Many other <b>xanthine</b> analogues constituting the adenosine receptor antagonist class have also been elucidated.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the prescribing pattern of anti-seizure medications (ASMs) at a tertiary care hospital. The extent and pattern of concurrently used medications for co-exiting illnesses was also studied. Attention was focussed in particular on co-existence of bronchial asthma with epilepsy and co-medication of ASMs with <b>xanthines.</b> The study was carried out at the Central Pharmacy and at the Medical Records Department. Data analysis at the central pharmacy showed 3. 98 % prescriptions for ASMs, with maximum number for males. More drugs were prescribed during the second decade of life and there were 2. 17 drugs per prescription. The data for pattern and extent of use of ASMs along with polytherapy and concurrently used medications revealed the highest number of prescriptions for phenytoin, maximum number with single ASM, and phenytoin with phenobarbitone as most frequently prescribed combination. Co-administration of ASMs with respiratory medications was found in 2. 47 %, with 38. 8 % prescriptions having <b>xanthines</b> prescribed in them. <b>Xanthines,</b> the well known CNS stimulants, a property attributed to their adenosine receptor antagonistic activity, are considered potential seizurogenic agents. The results of the present preliminary survey show an indirect evidence for co-existence of epilepsy with asthma along with the extent of co-medication of ASMs with <b>xanthines.</b> Results indicate the need for further studies to evaluate the consequences of co-medication of ASMs with <b>xanthines...</b>|$|R

50|$|Unlike other <b>xanthines,</b> {{doxofylline}} lacks {{any significant}} affinity for adenosine receptors {{and does not}} produce stimulant effects. This suggests that its antiasthmatic effects are mediated by another mechanism, perhaps its actions on phosphodiesterase.|$|R
25|$|Other purine analogues such as {{allopurinol}} inhibit <b>xanthine</b> oxidase, {{the enzyme}} that breaks down azathioprine, thus increasing the toxicity of azathioprine. On the other hand, low doses of allopurinol {{have been shown}} to safely enhance the efficacy of azathioprine, especially in inflammatory bowel disease non-responders. This may still lead to lower lymphocyte counts and higher rates of infection, therefore the combination requires careful monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Oxidative stress {{may also}} play an {{important}} part in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the enzyme <b>xanthine</b> oxidase (XO) and this enzyme mainly occurs in the liver. One hypothesis is that the increased purine catabolism from placental hypoxia results in increased ROS production in the maternal liver and release into the maternal circulation that causes endothelial cell damage.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{analysis}} of 12C/13C isotopic ratios of organic compounds {{found in the}} Murchison meteorite indicates a non-terrestrial origin for these molecules rather than terrestrial contamination. Biologically relevant molecules identified so far include uracil, an RNA nucleobase, and <b>xanthine.</b> These results demonstrate that many organic compounds which are components of life on Earth were already present in the early Solar System and {{may have played a}} key role in life's origin.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to alkalosis, other factors can cause transient shifting of potassium into cells, presumably by {{stimulation of the}} Na+/K+ pump. These hormones and medications include insulin, epinephrine, and other beta agonists (e.g. salbutamol or salmeterol), and <b>xanthines</b> (e.g. theophylline).|$|R
40|$|Although {{caffeine}} {{has long}} been {{considered to be a}} cerebral cortical stimulant, relatively little is known of its sites and mechanism of action in the cerebral cortex. Therefore, the effects of the methylated <b>xanthines,</b> caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine have been studied on the evoked electrical afterdischarge of the neuronally isolated cerebral cortex preparation of dogs. Electrical stimulation of the neuronally isolated island of suprasylvian gyrus with an intact pial circulation in postanesthetized and immobilized dog preparations elicited a characteristic reproducible spikelike discharge limited within the island. The duration of such afterdischarge was measured before and after the administration of various drugs. Among the methylated <b>xanthines,</b> caffeine in doses as low as 0. 25 mg/kg was the most potent in prolonging cortical afterdischarge. Theophylline and theobromine appeared much less potent. The dose-effect relationship with different doses of the methylated <b>xanthines</b> was determined. It was found that large doses of theophylline and theobromine clearly reduced the duration of cortical afterdischarge. Repeated administration of caffeine appeared to cause no further or even less prolongation of afterdischarge than that produced by the first dose suggesting that tachyphylaxis occurred...|$|R
25|$|Scorpions can consume {{huge amounts}} of food at one sitting. They have a very {{efficient}} food storage organ and a very low metabolic rate combined with a relatively inactive lifestyle. This enables scorpions to survive long periods when deprived of food; some are able to survive 6 to 12 months of starvation. Scorpions excrete very little; their waste consists mostly of insoluble nitrogenous compounds, such as <b>xanthine,</b> guanine and uric acid.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects are fine tremor, anxiety, headache, muscle cramps, dry mouth, and palpitation. Other {{symptoms}} may include tachycardia, arrhythmia, flushing of the skin, myocardial ischemia (rare), and disturbances {{of sleep and}} behaviour. Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of paradoxical bronchospasms, urticaria (hives), angioedema, hypotension, and collapse. High doses or prolonged use may cause hypokalemia, which is of concern especially in patients with renal failure and those on certain diuretics and <b>xanthine</b> derivatives.|$|E
25|$|Guanine can be hydrolyzed {{with strong}} acid to glycine, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. First, guanine gets deaminated to become <b>xanthine.</b> Guanine oxidizes {{more readily than}} adenine, the other purine-derivative base in DNA. Its high melting point of 350°C {{reflects}} the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the oxo and amino groups in the molecules in the crystal. Because of this intermolecular bonding, guanine is relatively insoluble in water, but it is soluble in dilute acids and bases.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} specific, {{sensitive}} high-pressure liquid-chromatographic assay for theophylline in plasma. Only 0. 5 ml of plasma {{is required for}} each determination, and the lower limit of detection by this method is 0. 1 mgI liter. Other <b>xanthines</b> and their metabolites do not inter-fere. This method is suitable for use in studying the pharmacokinetics of this drug in infants and children, from whom only small volumes of blood are available. Additional Keyphrase: pediatric chemistry The original spectrophotometric method for theo-phylline (1) requires a large (5. 0 ml) volume of blood or plasma for each analysis, and appreciable error is involved in determining concentrations less than 5 mg/liter. Also, theophylline is not distinguished from its metabolites or from other <b>xanthines.</b> This is im...|$|R
25|$|Caffeine, {{like other}} <b>xanthines,</b> also {{acts as a}} {{phosphodiesterase}} inhibitor. As a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, caffeine raises intracellular cAMP, activates protein kinase A, inhibits TNF-alpha and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. Caffeine also affects the cholinergic system where it inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>xanthines</b> on various {{microorganisms}} was studied. The antibacterial effect was not high; {{most of the}} test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2, 500 μg/ml. Caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. Caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. The effect was both bacteriostatic and bactericidal against susceptible organisms. The susceptibility of organisms to <b>xanthines</b> differed greatly even in related species. The morphology of Aerobacter aerogenes and A. cloacae was affected {{under the influence of}} caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. Potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. This potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary...|$|R
25|$|Theophylline, {{also known}} as 1,3-dimethylxanthine, is a methylxanthine drug used in therapy for {{respiratory}} diseases such as {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and asthma under a variety of brand names. As a member of the <b>xanthine</b> family, it bears structural and pharmacological similarity to theobromine and caffeine, and is readily found in nature, and is present in tea (Camellia sinensis) and cocoa (Theobroma cacao). A small amount of theophylline is one of the products of caffeine metabolic processing in the liver.|$|E
25|$|Members of the 2Fe-2S {{ferredoxin}} {{family have}} a general core structure consisting of beta(2)-alpha-beta(2), which includes putidaredoxin, terpredoxin, and adrenodoxin. They are proteins of around one hundred amino acids with four conserved cysteine residues to which the 2Fe-2S cluster is ligated. This conserved region is also found as a domain in various metabolic enzymes and in multidomain proteins, such as aldehyde oxidoreductase (N-terminal), <b>xanthine</b> oxidase (N-terminal), phthalate dioxygenase reductase (C-terminal), succinate dehydrogenase iron-sulphur protein (N-terminal), and methane monooxygenase reductase (N-terminal).|$|E
500|$|Uric acid {{is by far}} {{the highest}} {{concentration}} antioxidant in human blood. [...] Uric acid (UA) is an antioxidant oxypurine produced from <b>xanthine</b> by the enzyme <b>xanthine</b> oxidase, and is an intermediate product of purine metabolism. In almost all land animals, urate oxidase further catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin, but in humans and most higher primates, the urate oxidase gene is nonfunctional, so that UA is not further broken down. The evolutionary reasons for this loss of urate conversion to allantoin remain the topic of active speculation. The antioxidant effects of uric acid have led researchers to suggest this mutation was beneficial to early primates and humans. Studies of high altitude acclimatization support the hypothesis that urate acts as an antioxidant by mitigating the oxidative stress caused by high-altitude hypoxia.|$|E
50|$|Because {{chlorophyll}} {{does not}} dissolve in water, food sources of chlorophyll do not bind to mutagenic substances {{to a significant}} extent. Chlorophyllin, being water-soluble, can significantly bind to environmental mutagens such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons benzoapyrene and dibenzo{a,i}pyrene. Chlorophyllin binds to mutagens twenty times better than resveratrol and thousands of times better than <b>xanthines.</b>|$|R
50|$|A cup of warm milk or a {{milk-based drink}} is {{traditionally}} used for sleep induction.

50|$|Methylated <b>xanthines</b> (methylxanthines), {{which include}} caffeine, aminophylline, IBMX, paraxanthine, pentoxifylline, theobromine, and theophylline, affect {{not only the}} airways but stimulate heart rate, force of contraction, and cardiac arrhythmias at high concentrations. In high doses they can lead to convulsions that are {{resistant}} to anticonvulsants. Methylxanthines induce acid and pepsin secretions in the GI tract. Methylxanthines are metabolized by cytochrome P450 in the liver.|$|R
