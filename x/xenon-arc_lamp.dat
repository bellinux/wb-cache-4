A moving fringe pattern was generated by linear {{displacement of the}} movable mirror of the Michelson interferometer coupled to a <b>xenon-arc</b> <b>lamp.</b> This spectrally modulated source was monitored by a reference photomultiplier and used for exciting a Rhodamine B solution. The fluorescence emission at > 645 nm was detected by a second photomultiplier. The two interferograms were acquired by a dual-channel digital oscilloscope, and their discrete Fourier transforms and corresponding power spectra were generated in a computer. The power spectrum of the emission signal represented the excitation spectrum, as was confirmed by comparison with the absorption spectrum of Rhodamine B.

The 84 kWe solar simulator {{is based on an}} array of 12 commercially available <b>xenon-arc</b> <b>lamps</b> (each 7 kWe) coupled with silicone-on-glass Fresnel lenses as the optical concentrator. A ray-tracing model of the xenon lamp has been developed based on the real emitter shape and the Fresnel lens optics; simulations performed using a non-sequential Monte Carlo technique have been validated against experimental test data. The results show that 19. 7 kW of radiative power is delivered on a 200 mm diameter target with and a peak flux of 6. 73 MW/m 2 and an electricity to radiative power efficiency of 23. 4 %.

40|$|A {{new concept}} of solar receiver/reactor is {{developed}} which combines catalytic methane reforming and air heating for solar energy storage {{in a single}} volumetric absorbing monolith. A 5 kW scale prototype has been developed and tested. The design includes a silicon carbide volumetric absorber with separate channels for heating air and for the endothermic methane reforming reaction. The energy transferred to the air stream can potentially be stored and used to provide heat for methane reforming reaction during nighttime operation. The flow rate of the air stream can also be adjusted to match variations in the solar input, such as during cloud passing, so that {{a constant stream of}} fuel products are produced even with variable solar input. Preliminary testing of the prototype has been performed using simulated solar energy provided by <b>Xenon-arc</b> <b>lamps.</b> An example test result is presented showing conversion of methane, steam, and carbon dioxide to products of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in one set of channels while air is heated in the other set of channels.

40|$|The use of plate glass-water thermal {{barriers}} in controlled environment facilities effectively reduces the thermal load within the plant growth chamber. This allows high PPFs {{to be provided}} for plant growth and development studies, adequate simulation of daily light integrals, and simulation of peak PPF's. Further, substantial amounts of incandescent lamp supplementation can be used to achieve simulation of daylight R:FR ratios which are needed to ensure adequate stem development in some species. While the focus in this paper is on the use of entire thermal barriers which separate the lighting enclosure from the plant growth chamber, the same principles apply to the use of water jackets for cooling individual lamps (such as can occur with <b>xenon-arc</b> <b>lamps).</b> In this instance, the barrier separating the lamps from the plant chamber can be much simpler (e. g., plexiglass) as the main function of the barrier is to separate the air ventilation of the lamp enclosure from the air system within the plant growth chamber. The main advantage of water as a thermal barrier is the negligible absorption of radiation in the photosynthetically-active and near infrared wavebands. Consequently, plate glass-water barriers typically allow transmission of approximately 90 % of radiation in these regions. While ventilated double and triple glazing systems appear to be attractive alternative to water barriers from an operating standpoint, their significant absorption in the biologically-important wavebands (7 - 12 %) with each glass layer and longer-wave cut-offs (typically 2500 - 4000 nm) makes them a much less attractive alternative. The data presented here demonstrate clearly that measurement of PPF alone is not an adequate representation of the radiation environment being used in a controlled environment study. The amounts and proportions of long-wave and short-wave radiation in a plant growth chamber are dependent on lamp type, lamp combination, presence of a thermal barrier, the type of thermal barrier between the lamps and the plant growing area and the overall construction and design of the chamber. It is important, therefore, in reporting results of controlled environment studies, to adequately describe both the details of the lighting system used and the characteristics of the radiation produced by that system, so results of different studies can be adequately evaluated and compared...|$|R
40|$|A new {{receiver}} concept utilizing impinging jet cooling {{technology has}} been developed for a small scale solar dish-Brayton system. In a typical impinging receiver design, the jet nozzles are distributed evenly around the cylindrical absorber wall above the solar peak flux region for managing the temperature at an acceptable level. The absorbed solar irradiation is partially lost to the ambient by radiation and natural convection heat transfer, the major part is conducted through the wall and taken away by the impingement jets to drive a gas turbine. Since the thermal power requirement of a 5 kWe Compower® micro gas turbine (MGT) perfectly matches with the power collected by the EuroDish when the design Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) input is 800 W/m 2, the boundary conditions for the impinging receiver design in this work {{are based on the}} combination of the Compower®MGT and the EuroDish system. In order to quickly find feasible receiver geometries and impinging jet nozzle arrangements for achieving acceptable temperature level and temperature distributions on the absorber cavity wall, a novel inverse design method (IDM) has been developed based on a combination of a ray-tracing model and a heat transfer analytical model. In this design method, a heat transfer model of the absorber wall is used for analyzing the main heat transfer process between the cavity wall outer surface, the inner surface and the working fluid. A ray-tracing model is utilized for obtaining the solar radiative boundary conditions for the heat transfer model. Furthermore, the minimum stagnation heat transfer coefficient, the jet pitch and the maximum pressure drop governing equations are used for narrowing down the possible nozzle arrangements. Finally, the curves for the required total heat transfer coefficient distribution are obtained and compared with different selected impinging arrangements on the working fluid side, and candidate design configurations are obtained. Furthermore, a numerical conjugate heat transfer model combined with a ray-tracing model was developed validating the inverse design method and for studying the thermal performance of an impinging receiver in detail. With the help of the modified inverse design method and the numerical conjugate heat transfer model, two impinging receivers based on sintered α-SiC (SSiC) and stainless steel 253 MA material have been successfully designed. The detailed analyses show that for the 253 MA impinging receiver, the average air temperature at the outlet and the thermal efficiency can reach 1071. 5 K and 82. 7 % at a DNI level of 800 W/m 2 matching the system requirements well. Furthermore, the local temperature differences on the absorber can be reduced to 130 K and 149 K for two different DNI levels, which is a significant reduction and improvement compared with earlier published cavity receiver designs. The inverse design method has also been verified to be an efficient way in reducing the calculation costs during the design procedure. For the validation and demonstration of the receiver designs, a unique experimental facility was designed and constructed. The facility is a novel high flux solar simulator utilizing for the first time Fresnel lenses to concentrate the light of 12 commercial high power <b>Xenon-arc</b> <b>lamps.</b> Finally, a prototype of a 253 MA based impinging was experimentally studied {{with the help of the}} 84 kWe Fresnel lens based high flux solar simulator in KTH.

40|$|Two aramid fibers having {{closely related}} {{chemical}} structures {{were chosen for}} important roles in the first tether {{to be used to}} connect pairs of orbiting vehicles. The protective outer jackets of the tethers will consist of woven fibers of poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide), commercially available from du Pont as Nomex. A cylindrical sheath of woven Kevlar 29, whose principal constituent is poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide), will be the load-bearing component for the tethers. Orbiting tethers will be in a hostile environment in which short wavelength electromagnetic radiation and energetic charged particles degrade exposed organic materials. At lower orbiting altitudes atomic oxygen is an especially serious hazard. Studies on the effects of ultraviolet radiation and atomic oxygen on fibers and films of Kevlar and Nomex are in progress. In an experiment to simulate the effects of atomic oxygen in space, small tows of Kevlar and Nomex were mounted in a commercial ashing device filled with oxygen at low pressure. An RF discharge in the instrument dissociated the molecular oxygen producing a strongly oxidizing atmosphere containing O(3 P) (sup 4). Erosion was measured in terms of mass loss.
