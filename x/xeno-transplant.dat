30|$|For the {{evaluation}} of in vivo antitumor activities, both the disseminated and localized human NHL <b>xeno-transplant</b> models were set up. In the localized model, Daudi cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank of SCID mice. When the tumors reached about 50 - 60  mm 3 in volume, mice were randomly treated with free ADR, PC-ADR-BSA and PC-ADR-Fab with an equivalent ADR amount of 5  mg/kg [25, 38]. The mice were treated {{once a week for}} SCID mice based on previous study and our preliminary experimental results [39]. The tumor volume was recorded and illustrated in Figure  6 C. Our results indicated that mice treated with PC-ADR-Fab and PC-ADR-BSA demonstrated a remarkable decrease in tumor burden compared with free ADR and control treatment as measured by tumor volume. Otherwise, PC-ADR-Fab exhibit a more excellent antitumor ability comparing with PC-ADR-BSA, with 2 / 4 mice of complete remission (CR) indicated by no measurable mass.|$|E
40|$|Ewing sarcomas (ES) {{are highly}} {{malignant}} bone or soft tissue tumors. Genetically, ES {{are defined by}} balanced chromosomal EWS/ETS translocations, which give rise to chimeric proteins (EWS-ETS) that generate an oncogenic transcriptional program associated with altered epigenetic marks throughout the genome. By use of an inhibitor (JQ 1) blocking BET bromodomain binding proteins (BRDs) we strikingly observed a strong down-regulation of the predominant EWS-ETS protein EWS-FLI 1 in a dose dependent manner. This was further enhanced by co-treatment with an inhibitor of the PI 3 K pathway. Microarray analysis further revealed JQ 1 treatment to block a typical ES associated expression program. The effect on this expression program was mimicked by RNA interference with BRD 3 or BRD 4 expression, indicating that the EWS-FLI 1 mediated expression profile is {{at least in part}} mediated via such epigenetic readers. Consequently, contact dependent and independent proliferation of different ES lines was strongly inhibited. Mechanistically, treatment of ES resulted in a partial arrest of the cell cycle as well as induction of apoptosis. Tumor development was suppressed dose dependently in a <b>xeno-transplant</b> model in immune deficient mice, overall indicating that ES may be susceptible to treatment with epigenetic inhibitors blocking BET bromodomain activity and the associated pathognomonic EWS-ETS transcriptional program...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative stress {{may cause}} severe {{cellular}} damage to both allo- and <b>xeno-transplanted</b> islets, additional to islet graft-directed immunity, in diabetic patients. We thus aimed {{to examine the}} effects of antioxidants on in vitro culture-maintained, neonatal porcine cell clusters (NPCCs). NPCCs were treated with antioxidants (vitamin D 3 and E) by a certain time of their maturation and differentiation process. Insulin recovery showed that both vitamins D 3 and E, unlike untreated controls, resulted in preservation of the islet function for significantly long periods of time...|$|R
40|$|Forty-two {{cell lines}} recapitulating mammary {{carcinoma}} heteroge-neity were profiled for all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) sensitivity. Luminal and ER+ (estrogen-receptor-positive) cell lines are gener-ally sensitive to ATRA, while refractoriness/low sensitivity is associ-ated with a Basal phenotype and HER 2 positivity. Indeed, only 2 Basal cell lines (MDA-MB 157 and HCC- 1599) are highly {{sensitive to the}} retinoid. Sensitivity of HCC- 1599 cells is confirmed in <b>xeno-transplanted</b> mice. Short-term tissue-slice cultures of surgical samples validate the cell-line results and support the concept that {{a high proportion of}} Luminal/ER+ carcinomas are ATRA sensitive, while triple-negative (Basal) and HER 2 -positive tumors tend to be retinoid resistant. Pathway-oriented analysis of the constitutive gene-expression profiles in the cell lines identifies RARa as the member of the retinoid pathway directly associated with a Lumina...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that certain subpopulations of human adult stem cells can generate hepatocyte-like cells when transplanted into adult immunosuppressed mice. In the present study, we wanted to explore whether xeno-transplantation of human cord blood CD 34 (+) (hCBCD 34 (+)) cells during pre-immune stages of development in immunocompetent mice might also lead to human-mouse liver chimerism. Freshly isolated hCBCD 34 (+) cells were <b>xeno-transplanted</b> into non-immunosuppressed mice by both intra-blastocyst and intra-fetal injections. One and four weeks after birth, immunostaining for different human-specific hepatocyte markers: human hepatocyte-specific antigen, human serum albumin, and human alpha- 1 -antitrypsin indicated the presence of human hepatocyte-like cells in the livers of transplanted animals. Detection of human albumin mRNA further corroborated the development of pre-immune human-mouse chimeras. The current report, besides providing new evidence of the potential of hCBCD 34 (+) cells to generate human hepatocyte-like cells, suggests novel strategies for generating immunocompetent mice harboring humanized liver...|$|R
40|$|Suppression of {{apoptosis}} by TP 53 mutation {{contributes to}} resistance of {{acute myeloid leukemia}} (AML) to conventional cytotoxic treatment. Using differentiation to induce irreversible cell cycle exit in AML cells could be a p 53 -independent treatment alternative, however, this possibility requires evaluation. In vitro and in vivo regimens of the cytosine analogue decitabine that deplete the chromatin modifying enzyme DNA methyl-transferase 1 (DNMT 1) without phosphorylating p 53 or inducing early apoptosis were determined. These decitabine regimens but not equimolar DNA-damaging cytarabine up regulated the key late differentiation factors CEBP&#x 3 b 5; and p 27 /CDKN 1 B, induced cellular differentiation, and terminated AML cell-cycle, even in cytarabine-resistant p 53 - and p 16 /CDKN 2 A-null AML cells. Leukemia initiation by xeno-transplanted AML cells was abrogated but normal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment was preserved. In vivo, the low toxicity allowed frequent drug administration to increase exposure, an important consideration for S-phase specific decitabine therapy. In <b>xeno-transplant</b> models of p 53 -null and relapsed/refractory AML, the non-cytotoxic regimen significantly extended survival compared to conventional cytotoxic cytarabine. Modifying in vivo dose and schedule to emphasize this pathway of decitabine action can bypass a mechanism of resistance to standard therapy...|$|E
30|$|Unlike most malignancies, {{chemotherapy}} but not surgery {{plays the}} most important role in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Currently, liposomes {{have been widely used}} to encapsulate chemotherapeutic drugs in treating solid tumors. However, higher in vivo stability owns a much more important position for excellent antitumor efficacy in treating hematological malignancies. In this study, we finely fabricated a rituximab Fab fragment-decorated liposome based on 1, 2 -bis(10, 12 -tricosadiynoyl)-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DC 8, 9 PC), which can form intermolecular cross-linking through the diacetylenic group by ultra-violet (UV) irradiation. Our experimental results demonstrated that after the UV irradiation, the liposomes exhibit better serum stability and slower drug release with a decreased mean diameter of approximately 285  nm. The cellular uptake of adriamycin (ADR) by this Fab-navigated liposome was about four times of free drugs. Cytotoxicity assays against CD 20 + lymphoma cells showed that the half maximal (50 %) inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of ADR-loaded immunoliposome was only one fourth of free ADR at the same condition. In vivo studies were evaluated in lymphoma-bearing SCID mice. With the high serum stability, finely regulated structure, active targeting strategy via antigen-antibody reaction and passive targeting strategy via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, our liposome exhibits durable and potent antitumor activities both in the disseminated and localized human NHL <b>xeno-transplant</b> models.|$|E
30|$|In vivo {{experimental}} {{results indicated that}} the immunoliposomes are selectively accumulated in tumor tissues, while the administration of free drugs resulted in high concentration of ADR in either normal or malignant tissues with no specificity. This remarkable discrepancy can significantly improve the bioavailability and reduce the detrimental cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. The in vivo antitumor experiments carried out both in the localized and disseminated human NHL <b>xeno-transplant</b> models suggest that our immunoliposome was significantly more effective than either free ADR or non-targeting liposomal ADR in inhibiting primary tumor growth and prolonging the graft survival. What's more, our immunoliposome still showed great advantage in tumor suppressing efficacy when compared with other drug delivery systems. For example, comparing with the anti-CD 30 antibody-conjugated liposomal doxorubicin constructed by Ommoleila Molavi et al., the treatment of which can respectively decrease the tumor burden to approximately 1 / 7 and approximately 1 / 2 in comparison with PBS and free ADR treatment [44]; our immunoliposome can remarkably decrease the tumor burden to approximately 1 / 14 and approximately 1 / 4, respectively. In our opinion, this exceptional excellent in vivo antilymphoma activity of the ADR-loaded Fab fragment-decorated liposome is the cooperative action of the following effects: (1) enhanced intracellular uptake due to effective endocytosis based on well-defined liposomal structure and size distribution; (2) enhanced serum stability and controlled drug release (as a result of UV irradiation polymerizing) can contribute to long circulation time and durable antilymphoma activity; (3) enhanced tumor accumulation and retention in vivo through dual targeting function, passive targeting through EPR effects and active targeting through antigen-antibody reaction.|$|E
40|$|Skeletal {{muscle tissue}} {{is a rare}} site of tumor {{metastasis}} but is the main target of the degenerative processes occurring in cancer-associated cachexia syndrome. Beneficial effects of physical activity in counteracting cancer-related muscle wasting have been described in the last decades. Recently {{it has been shown}} that, in tumor <b>xeno-transplanted</b> mouse models, physical activity is able to directly affect tumor growth by modulating inflammatory responses in the tumor mass microenvironment. Here, we investigated the effect of physical activity on tumor cell growth in colon carcinoma C 26 cells injected tibialis anterior muscles of BALB/c mice. Histological analyses revealed that 4 days of voluntary wheel running significantly counteracts tumor cell growth in C 26 -injected muscles compared to the non-injected sedentary controls. Since striated skeletal muscle tissue is the site of voluntary contraction, our results confirm that physical activity can also directly counteract tumor cell growth in a metabolically active tissue that is usually not a target for metastasis...|$|R
40|$|Human mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (hMSCs) from {{umbilical}} cord (UC) blood (UCB) and matrix are tested clinically {{for a variety}} of pathologies but in vitro expansion using culture media containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) is essential to achieve appropriate cell numbers for clinical use. Human UCB plasma (hUCBP) {{can be used as a}} supplement for hMSCs culture, since UCB is rich in soluble growth factors and due to worldwide increased number of cryopreserved UCB units in public and private banks, without the disadvantages listed for FBS. On the other hand, the culture media enriched in growth factors produced by these hMSCs in expansion (Conditioned medium- CM) can be an alternative to hMSCs application. The CM of the hMSCs from the UC might be a better therapeutic option compared to cell transplantation, as it can benefit from the local tissue response to the secreted molecules without the difficulties and complications associated to the engraftment of the allo- or <b>xeno-transplanted</b> cells. These facts drove us to know the detailed composition of the hUCBP and CM, by 1 H-NMR and Multiplexing LASER Bead Technology. hUCBP is an adequate alternative for the FBS and the CM and hUCBP are important sources of growth factors, which can be used in MSCs-based therapies.

40|$|Neural {{stem and}} {{progenitor}} cells (NSPC) can differentiate to neurons and glial cells. NSPC are easily propagated in vitro {{and are therefore}} an attractive tool for tissue regeneration. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause for death and disabilities. A fundamental problem following TBI is tissue loss. Animal studies aiming at cell replacement have encountered difficulties in achieving sufficient graft survival and differentiation. To improve outcome of grafted cells after experimental TBI (controlled cortical impact, CCI) in mice, we compared two transplantation settings. NSPC were transplanted either directly upon CCI to the injured parenchyma, or one week after injury to the contralateral ventricle. Enhanced survival of transplanted cells and differentiation were seen when cells were deposited in the ventricle. To further enhance cell survival, {{efforts were made to}} reduce the inflammatory response to TBI by administration of ibuprofen to mice that had been subjected to CCI. Inflammation was reduced, as monitored by a decrease in inflammatory markers. Cell survival as well as differentiation to early neuroblasts seemed to be improved. To device a 3 D system for future transplantation studies, NSPC from different ages were cultured in a hydrogel consisting of hyaluronan and collagen. Cells survived and proliferated in this culturing condition and the greatest neuronal differentiating ability was seen in cells from the newborn mouse brain. NSPC were also used in a model of peripheral nervous system injury, and <b>xeno-transplanted</b> to rats where the dorsal root ganglion had been removed. Cells survived and differentiated to neurons and glia, furthermore demonstrating their usefulness as a tool for tissue regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Background: Micro {{ribonucleic acid}} (miR- 101) can {{regulate}} {{the expression of}} cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) {{and participate in the}} pathogenesis of malignant tumors. This study investigates the effects of miRNA- 101 and COX- 2 in lung cancer and the impact of miR- 101 on the proliferation and invasion of human lung cancer A 549 cell line. Methods: The expression of miR- 101 in 20 separate lung cancer tissues was detected by real time polymerase chain reaction; COX- 2 expression was also detected. A 549 cells were transfected with miR- 101 or negative control oligonucle-otide duplex mimic (miR-NC). In vivo tumorigenesis abilities were detected in localized human lung cancer <b>xeno-transplant</b> models in BALB/c nude mice. Results: MiR- 101 expression was significantly lower and the level of COX- 2 signifi-cantly higher in lung cancer tissues than in adjacent parenchyma (2. 918 ± 1. 006 vs. 5. 953 ± 1. 976,P = 0. 001; 0. 887 ± 0. 260 vs. 0. 355 ± 0. 156,P = 0. 001, respectively). Cor-relation analysis revealed that miR- 101 negatively correlated with COX- 2 in lung cancer tissues (R = − 0. 596, P = 0. 002). Compared with A 549 -miR-NC cells, the expression of COX- 2 was significantly decreased in A 549 cells transfected withmiR- 101 (P < 0. 001). The proliferation of A 549 cells was markedly inhibited after trans-fection of miR- 101. The in vivo tumor growth of A 549 cells transfected with miR- 101 was significantly slower than wide type A 549 cells. Conclusion: MiR- 101 expression is decreased in lung cancer, inducing an increase in COX- 2 level. Enforced expression of miR- 101 can remarkably reduce the cell pro-liferation and invasion ability of lung cancer cells...|$|E
40|$|Phosphoinositide- 3 -kinase {{and protein}} kinase B (PI 3 K-AKT) is {{upregulated}} in multiple myeloma (MM). Using {{a combination of}} short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentivirus-mediated knockdown and pharmacologic isoform-specific inhibition we investigated {{the role of the}} PI 3 K p 110 γ (PI 3 Kγ) subunit in regulating MM proliferation and bone marrow microenvironment-induced MM interactions. We compared this with inhibition of the PI 3 K p 110 δ (PI 3 kδ) subunit and with combined PI 3 kδ/γ dual inhibition. We found that MM cell adhesion and migration were PI 3 Kγ-specific functions, with PI 3 kδ inhibition having no effect in MM adhesion or migration assays. At concentration of the dual PI 3 Kδ/γ inhibitor duvelisib, which can be achieved in vivo we saw a decrease in AKT phosphorylation at s 473 after tumour activation by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and interleukin- 6. Moreover, after drug treatment of BMSC/tumour co-culture activation assays only dual PI 3 kδ/γ inhibition was able to induce MM apoptosis. shRNA lentiviral-mediated targeting of either PI 3 Kδ or PI 3 Kγ alone, or both in combination, increased survival of NSG mice <b>xeno-transplanted</b> with MM cells. Moreover, treatment with duvelisib reduced MM tumour burden in vivo. We report that PI 3 Kδ and PI 3 Kγ isoforms have distinct functions in MM and that combined PI 3 kδ/γ isoform inhibition has anti-MM activity. Here we provide a scientific rationale for trials of dual PI 3 kδ/γ inhibition in patients with MM...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{transfer}} for β-thalassemia requires {{gene transfer}} into hematopoietic stem cells using integrat-ing vectors that direct regulated expression of β globin at therapeutic levels. Among integrating vectors, oncoretroviral vectors carrying the human β-globin gene and {{portions of the}} locus control region (LCR) have suffered from problems of vector instabil-ity, low titers and variable expression. In recent studies, human immunodeficiency virus–based lentiviral (LV) vectors were shown to stably transmit the human β-globin gene and a large LCR element, resulting in correction of β-thalassemia intermedia in mice. Several groups have since demonstrated correction of the mouse thalassemia intermedia phenotype, with variable levels of β-globin expression. These levels of expression were insufficient to fully correct the anemia in thalassemia major mouse model. Insertion of a chicken hypersensitive site- 4 chicken insulator element (cHS 4) in self-inactivating (SIN) LV vectors resulted in higher and less variable expression of human β-globin, similar to the observa-tions with cHS 4 -containing retroviral vectors carrying the human γ-globin gene. The levels of β-globin expression achieved from insulated SIN-LV vectors were sufficient to phenotypically correct the thalas-semia phenotype from 4 patients with human thalas-semia major in vitro, and this correction persisted long term for up to 4 months, in <b>xeno-transplanted</b> mice in vivo. In summary, LV vectors have {{paved the way for}} clinical gene therapy trials for Cooley’s anemia and other β-globin disorders. SIN-LV vectors address several safety concerns of randomly integrating viral vectors by removing viral transcriptional elements and providing lineage-restricted expression. Flanking the proviral cassette with chromatin insulator ele-ments, which additionally have enhancer-blocking properties, may further improve SIN-LV vector safety...|$|R
40|$|Background Tumor {{development}} is recently hypothesized {{to depend on}} a rare cell population with stem cell properties, such cells are called cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs). From various cancer tissues or cancer cell lines, CD 133 expressing cells were found to define a unique CSC/TIC phenotype. To study whether that also could {{be the case in}} lung cancer, we examined different lung cancer cell lines for CD 133 expression. Results Among the 4 cell lines studied, only the cell line LC- 42 expressed CD 133. Therefore, LC- 42 was further characterized and studied with special emphasis on identifying the presence of CD 133 + CSCs/TICs. FACS sorted CD 133 high and CD 133 dim subpopulations from LC- 42 showed no differences in soft agar colony-forming capacity and spheres-forming capacity in serum-free cultures. LC- 42 cells contained Side Population (SP), and only SP cells were able to form spheres. Furthermore, Nanog expression was significantly higher in SP than in non-SP. However, no difference was observed of CD 133 expression in SP and non-SP. When CD 133 high and CD 133 dim cells were serially <b>xeno-transplanted</b> in NOD/SCID mice, both formed tumours similar to their parental LC- 42 cells. There were no expression differences for NANOG, OCT 4 and SOX 2 examined immunohistochemically in the xenografts from both cell fractions. Conclusion Our data do not show a difference in tumorigenic potential of CD 133 high and CD 133 dim cells with respect to any of the parameters analyzed in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that CD 133 expression is not restricted to cancer-initiating cells in the human lung cancer cell line LC- 42...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{identified the}} AP 4 transcription factor as a c-MYC-inducible mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition/EMT in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here {{we report that}} AP 4 is down-regulated after DNA damage in a p 53 -dependent manner. p 53 repressed AP 4 via inducing the microRNAs miR- 15 a and miR- 16 - 1, which are encoded by the DLEU 2 gene and represent tumor suppressors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. miR- 15 a/ 16 - 1 acted via a conserved seed-matching sequence in the AP 4 3 ’-UTR. Ectopic miR- 15 a/ 16 - 1 also down-regulated AP 4 expression and induced mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) of CRC cells. Induction of miR- 15 a/ 16 - 1 was necessary for p 53 -induced MET and mediated, at least in part, inhibition of migration by p 53. Down-regulation of AP 4 was necessary for miR- 15 a/ 16 - 1 -induced MET and suppression of migration and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, constitutive ectopic expression of miR- 15 a/ 16 - 1 in <b>xeno-transplanted</b> CRC cells suppressed the formation of lung metastases in NOD/SCID mice. In addition, ectopic AP 4 suppressed the expression of miR- 15 a/ 16 - 1 by direct occupancy of E-boxes {{in the vicinity of}} the two alternative DLEU 2 promoters. Finally, expression of miR- 15 a and DLEU 2 was significantly down-regulated in primary colon and colorectal cancer samples, which displayed elevated AP 4 protein levels, a marker previously shown to correlate with distant metastasis and poor survival. In conclusion, miR- 15 a/ 16 - 1 and AP 4 therefore constitute a double-negative feed-back loop, which may serve to stabilize epithelial and mesenchymal states, respectively. During CRC progression, and presumably in other tumor entities, the deregulation of this circuitry by inactivation of p 53 or/and DLEU 2, or activation of AP 4 may contribute to metastasis...|$|R
