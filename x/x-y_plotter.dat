5000|$|An <b>X-Y</b> <b>plotter</b> is a plotter that {{operates}} in two axes of motion ("X" [...] and [...] "Y") {{in order to}} draw continuous vector graphics. The term was used to differentiate it from standard plotters which had control only of the [...] "y" [...] axis, the [...] "x" [...] axis being continuously fed to provide a plot of some variable with time. Plotters differ from Inkjet and Laser printers in that a plotter draws a continuous line, much like a pen on paper, while inkjet and laser printers use a very fine matrix of dots to form images, such that while a line may appear continuous to the naked eye, it in fact is a discrete set of points.|$|E

The advantage of our system is that costs are reduced by using equipment that is readily available at most laboratories: <b>X-Y</b> <b>plotter</b> and slide projector.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a laboratory study of beach erosion. The study compares the erosion and accretion on an unprotected dune beach with a beach protected with a rubble mound sea wall. There has been considerable debate in the coastal engineering community about the effects of sea walls on beaches. Accurate, controlled experiments are required to compare how sea walls and natural beaches interact with waves. This experiment was conducted in the J. Robert Gunther Family Ocean Wave Facility in the Parsons Laboratory at MIT. The experiment used a 4 meter wide by 11 meter long section of the basin. The beach is split in two sections, one with an unprotected dune and the other with a 1 : 1. 5 sloping rubble mound sea wall. A probe that uses reflected light to measure the sand or water surface is used to measure the sand elevation. This is mounted on a square <b>X-Y</b> <b>plotter</b> capable of moving the probe anywhere within a 4 meter by 4 meter area.

40|$|An azimuth-sensing {{system was}} used for {{continuous}} ground monitoring of the azimuth orientation of the balloon-borne Planetary Entry Parachute Program (PEPP) spacecraft. The system utilized two magnetic field sensors located in the spacecraft so as to produce {{a unique set of}} voltage outputs for any azimuth. Electronics onboard the spacecraft encoded the magnetometer outputs and fed the encoded signal to a C-band modulator which imposed the intelligence onto the radar tracking beacon pulses. A conveniently located ground radar received the modulated pulses and the magnetometer outputs were reproduced after demodulation. For fast, direct readout, an <b>X-Y</b> <b>plotter</b> was calibrated to cross plot the reproduced signal of the two magnetometers on a combination rectangular-polar graph indicating the correct true azimuth in real time.
