The company WACOM has also {{a long history of}} <b>xenon</b> <b>lamp</b> production. Some lamps have envelopes made out of ultra-pure synthetic fused silica (such as [...] "Suprasil"), which roughly doubles the cost, but which allows them to emit useful light into the vacuum UV region.

2500|$|In a pure <b>xenon</b> <b>lamp,</b> the {{majority}} of the light is generated within a tiny, pinpoint-sized cloud of plasma situated where the electron stream leaves the face of the cathode. [...] The light generation volume is cone-shaped, and the luminous intensity falls off exponentially moving from cathode to anode. [...] Electrons passing through the plasma cloud strike the anode, causing it to heat. As a result, the anode in a xenon short-arc lamp either has to be much larger than the cathode or be water-cooled, to dissipate the heat. The output of a pure xenon short-arc lamp offers fairly continuous spectral power distribution with a color temperature of about 6200K and color rendering index close to 100. However, even in a high pressure lamp there are some very strong emission lines in the near infrared, roughly in the region from 850–900nm. This spectral region can contain about 10% of the total emitted light. Light intensity ranges from 20,000 to 500,000cd/cm2. An example is [...] "XBO lamp", which is an OSRAM trade name for pure xenon short-arc lamp.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Xenon</b> arc <b>lamp</b> was {{introduced}} in Germany in 1957 and in the US in 1963. After film platters became commonplace in the 1970s, <b>Xenon</b> <b>lamps</b> became the most common light source, as they could stay lit for extended periods of time, whereas a carbon rod used for a carbon arc could last for an hour at the most.|$|R

50|$|The usual {{light source}} in these {{instruments}} {{is a high}} pressure, short-arc <b>xenon</b> <b>lamp.</b> Ordinary xenon arc lamps are unsuitable {{for use in the}} low UV. Instead, specially constructed lamps with envelopes made from high-purity synthetic fused silica must be used.|$|E
5|$|Xenon {{is used in}} {{light-emitting}} devices called <b>xenon</b> flash <b>lamps,</b> used in photographic {{flashes and}} stroboscopic lamps; to excite the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light; and, occasionally, in bactericidal lamps. The first solid-state laser, invented in 1960, was pumped by a <b>xenon</b> flash <b>lamp,</b> and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by <b>xenon</b> flash <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Xenon</b> flash <b>lamps</b> {{are used}} for medium- and high-intensity strobe applications. Sufficiently rapid or bright {{flashing}} may require active cooling such as forced-air or water cooling to prevent the <b>xenon</b> flash <b>lamp</b> from melting.|$|R
40|$|An outline is {{presented}} {{of changes in}} measurement procedures concerning solar cells. Outdoor measurements of cell performance based on pyranometer or pyrheliometer determination of intensity are discouraged. The absolute scale of irradiance is to be adopted as soon as possible. The standard atmosphere conditions are 1000 W/sq m irradiance, temperature 28 C, air mass 1. 5, and precipitable water vapor content of 2 cm. The allowable light sources for solar simulation are short arc <b>xenon</b> <b>lamps,</b> pulsed <b>xenon</b> <b>lamps,</b> and dichroic filtered tungsten lamps. Key considerations {{in the design of}} a reference cell are considered and approaches for the matching of a reference cell to a test cell or modules are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{most recent}} {{development}} related to photoplotting is LDI (Laser Direct Imaging) which utilizes a high-power laser or <b>Xenon</b> <b>lamp</b> to directly expose photoresist on a coated substrate instead of exposing photographic film. This eliminates {{the handling of}} photographic film. LDI machines currently sell for prices in the one-half million U.S. dollar range.|$|E

50|$|The {{lights were}} first {{manufactured}} in 1956.

In the 1980s and as carbon arc lamps fell into decreasing use, the spotlight began to employ a high-intensity <b>xenon</b> <b>lamp</b> as its light source.|$|E
