5|$|The Ka-band {{subsystem}} {{was used}} for demonstration purposes. Due to lack of spectrum at 8.41GHz <b>X-band,</b> future high-rate deep space missions will use 32GHz Ka-band. NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) implemented Ka-band receiving capabilities at all three of its complexes (Goldstone, Canberra and Madrid) over its 34-m beam-waveguide (BWG) antenna subnet. During the cruise phase, spacecraft Ka-band telemetry was tracked 36 times by these antennas proving functionality at all antennas. Ka-band tests were also planned during the science phase, but during aerobraking a switch failed, limiting the <b>X-band</b> high gain antenna to a single amplifier. If this amplifier fails all high-speed <b>X-band</b> communications will be lost. The Ka downlink is the only remaining backup for this functionality, and since the Ka-band capability {{of one of the}} SDST transponders has already failed, (and the other might have the same problem) JPL decided to halt all Ka-band demonstrations and hold the remaining capability in reserve.|$|E

5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's <b>X-band</b> Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E

It operates at L-, Sand <b>X-bands</b> with a frequency ratio of 1 : 2. 8 : 8. This TBDP shared-aperture array is assembled by two L/S and L/X DBDP shared-aperture sub-arrays with one L-band dual-polarized sub-array. A prototype array has been fabricated and measured, which exhibits wide impedance bandwidth (VSWR ≤ 2) of 13. 4 %, 14. 8 %, and 16. 8 % in L-, S-, and <b>X-bands,</b> respectively. The measured array isolation is better than - 27 dB in all three bands. The measured radiation patterns agree well with the simulation, confirming the cross-polarization level of below dB within the main lobe region, and the array scanning capability of ± 27 ° in S- and <b>X-bands.</b> This array design approach can be further extended to shared-aperture arrays with more than three bands. 9 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Even {{before the}} {{downlink}} signal was lost due to distance, the hydrazine attitude control {{fuel on board}} the spacecraft was considered likely to freeze, as the radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs) failed to generate enough power for the heaters to overcome radiative heat loss into space. Once the hydrazine froze, the spacecraft {{would no longer be}} able to maneuver to keep its high gain antenna pointing towards Earth, and the downlink signal would then be lost in a matter of days. The failure of the <b>X-band</b> communications subsystem hastened this, because the coldest part of the fuel pipework was routed over the <b>X-band</b> TWTAs, because when one of them was operating, this kept this part of the pipework warm enough.|$|E

40|$|Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (Pol-InSAR) {{has shown}} great promise for {{estimating}} {{the height of}} agricultural crops through the inversion of a scattering model of the plant canopy and the soil. The inversion also provides estimates of model parameters describing the microwave attenuation within the canopy and the relative scattering contributions from canopy and soil surface. Here, we investigate how vegetation characteristics including biomass, water content (VWC) and canopy structure are related to these parameters and provide a first assessment of the potential of estimating such characteristics using Pol-InSAR time series in L-, C- and <b>X-Bands.</b> The overall attenuation for maize is positively related to total VWC in L- and C-Bands. Furthermore, larger attenuation in VV than HH points toward the existence of anisotropic propagation effects due to vertical orientation of the stalks. Conversely, for wheat in C- and <b>X-Bands</b> there is no consistent relation between attenuation loss and VWC. Rather, structural changes occurring within the plant growth cycle appear to have an appreciable polarization-dependent effect on the observed attenuation changes. In addition, the estimated normalized volume backscattering power NVP (a measure of the relative scattering contribution from the canopy compared to the underlying soil) is associated with wet biomass. However, the contrasting sign of this relation (negative for maize in L- and C-Bands; positive for wheat in C- and <b>X-Bands)</b> indicates again the role of crop structural properties in the Pol-InSAR measurements. For instance, the NVP for maize in L- and C-Bands appears to decrease with increasing biomass due to the increasingly important double bounce ground-stalk scattering contribution as plants become taller and thicker. Overall, these results indicate {{the sensitivity of the}} Pol-InSAR parameters to canopy structure and biomass; this sensitivity is however dependent, amongst others, on crop type and radar frequency. When choosing an appropriate baseline/frequency configuration, the Pol-InSAR attenuation loss and NVP may complement the information of the estimated crop height, especially if the latter shows very little variation over the plant growth cycle (e. g. as for wheat) ...|$|R

40|$|C-, L- and <b>X-bands</b> Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images {{acquired}} from November 2006 to June 2011 were processed with Small BAseline Subset DInSAR (SBAS-DInSAR) technique to investigate {{spatial and temporal}} variations in deformation over Taiyuan basin, China. The annual deformation rate, created by integrating C-, L- and <b>X-bands</b> interferograms, revealed severe subsidence regions in the basin, where the average subsidence exceeded 10. cm/y and the maximum subsidence reached to 24. cm/y. Meanwhile, {{it was found that}} shapes of these subsidence areas were characterized as either subsiding bowls or elongated subsiding belts, implying an intimate connection among groundwater exploration, ground subsidence and faults. Additionally, significant differences in displacement were identified near the faults. This phenomenon could be explained that faults acted as barriers to groundwater flow, impeding the horizontal propagation of fluid-pressure changes and therefore creating groundwater level difference across them. Furthermore, the time series of deformation maps presented inconspicuous nonlinear periodic variations, which might be caused by the seasonal groundwater level fluctuations. In view of the poor water resource and presented features of subsidence over the study area, we deduced that excessive pumping of groundwater was the dominant process driving land subsidence. Our results could provide scientific evidence on a sound management of ground water pumping to mitigate potential damages on infrastructures and environments.
