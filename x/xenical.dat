25|$|Vitamin A {{deficiencies}} generally {{occur as}} a result of fat-soluble vitamins deficiencies. This often comes after intestinal bypass procedures such as jejunoileal bypass (no longer performed) or biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch procedures.

There is also the possibility of a vitamin A deficiency with use of the weight-loss medication orlistat (marketed as <b>Xenical</b> and Alli).|$|E
25|$|Orlistat {{is a drug}} {{designed}} to treat obesity. It is marketed as a prescription drug under the trade name <b>Xenical</b> by Roche in most countries, and is sold over-the-counter as Alli by GlaxoSmithKline in the United Kingdom and the United States. Its primary function is preventing the absorption of fats from the human diet by acting as a lipase inhibitor, thereby reducing caloric intake. It is intended for use {{in conjunction with a}} healthcare provider-supervised reduced-calorie diet.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia and New Zealand, {{orlistat}} is [...] available over-the-counter in 120mg size (84 capsules to the pack). Initially {{available only}} with a prescription, it was reclassified as a [...] "Pharmacist Only Medicine" [...] in October 2003. In 2007 the Committee decided to keep orlistat as a Schedule 3 drug, but withdrew its authorization of direct-to-consumer <b>Xenical</b> advertising, stating this [...] "increased pressure on pharmacists to provide orlistat to consumers...this in turn {{had the potential to}} result in inappropriate patterns of use". <b>Xenical</b> has recently began being advertised direct-to-customers again.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States {{orlistat}} (<b>Xenical)</b> {{is currently}} {{approved by the}} FDA for long-term use. It reduces intestinal fat absorption by inhibiting pancreatic lipase. Rimonabant (Acomplia), a second drug, works via a specific blockade of the endocannabinoid system. It has been developed from the knowledge that cannabis smokers often experience hunger, which {{is often referred to}} as [...] "the munchies". It had been approved in Europe for the treatment of obesity but has not received approval in the United States or Canada due to safety concerns. The European Medicines Agency in October 2008 recommended the suspension of the sale of rimonabant as the risks seem to be greater than the benefits. Sibutramine (Meridia), which acts in the brain to inhibit deactivation of the neurotransmitters, thereby decreasing appetite was withdrawn from the United States and Canadian markets in October 2010 due to cardiovascular concerns.|$|E

50|$|Cetilistat {{is a drug}} {{designed}} to treat obesity. It acts {{in the same way}} as the older drug orlistat (<b>Xenical)</b> by inhibiting pancreatic lipase, an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in the intestine.

50|$|Orlistat (also {{known by}} trade names <b>Xenical</b> and Alli) is a diet pill that works by {{blocking}} the enzymes that digest fat. As a result, some fat cannot be absorbed from the gut and is excreted in the feces {{instead of being}} metabolically digested, sometimes causing oily anal leakage.

50|$|Lipase inhibitors {{belong to}} a drug class that is used as an antiobesity agent. Their mode of action is to inhibit gastric and {{pancreatic}} lipases, enzymes that {{play an important role}} in the digestion of dietary fat. Lipase inhibitors are classified in the ATC-classification system as A08AB (peripherally acting antiobesity products).Numerous compounds have been either isolated from nature, semi-synthesized, or fully-synthesized and then screened for their lipase inhibitory activity but the only lipase inhibitor on the market (October 2016) is orlistat (<b>Xenical,</b> Alli).Lipase inhibitors have also shown anticancer activity, by inhibiting fatty acid synthase.|$|E
50|$|Pancreatic lipase {{inhibitor}} {{was originally}} discovered and isolated from fermented broth of the Streptomyces toxytricini bacterium in 1981 and named lipstatin. It is a selective and potent irreversible inhibitor of human gastric and pancreatic lipases. Tetrahydrolipstatin, more {{commonly known as}} orlistat, is a saturated derivative produced from hydrogen reaction. It was developed in 1983 by Hoffmann-La Roche and is a more simple and stable compound than lipstatin. For that reason orlistat was chosen over lipstatin for development as an anti-obesity drug. It is the only available FDA-approved oral lipase inhibitor and is known on the market as <b>Xenical</b> and Alli.Initially orlistat was developed {{as a treatment for}} dyslipidemia, not as an anti-obesity agent. When researchers found out that it promotes less energy uptake, the focus was switched to obesity.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to to gain insight into the {{different}} understandings and constructions of the weight-loss drug <b>Xenical,</b> including its various symbolic, social and cultural representations as a weight-loss pharmaceutical, for a range of players. Pharmaceuticals play a central role in contemporary life and we need to understand their function as objects with social and cultural meanings. Weight-loss drugs are particularly interesting as their production, dissemination and consumption are linked to cultural discourses surrounding fatness, body size and health, as well as processes such as medicalisation and pharmaceuticalisation. We sought insight into the meanings that the <b>Xenical</b> holds for various â€˜playersâ€™ invested in different stages of its â€˜lifecycleâ€™. A qualitative design was employed using an in-depth, critical analytical approach, focused on the network of relationships or players surrounding the lifecycle of <b>Xenical.</b> There were seven players of interest representing this network, including pharmacists, dietitians, <b>Xenical</b> forum-users, <b>Xenical</b> non-users, the Roche website for <b>Xenical,</b> <b>Xenical</b> advertisements and news articles on, or relating to, <b>Xenical</b> in some way. The pharmacists, dietitians and non-users were all interviewed about issues relating to weight, weight loss, body size, pharmaceuticals and <b>Xenical,</b> and the four other sites of analysis were analysed for how they constructed and positioned <b>Xenical</b> through language or symbolically. The various ways in which these players discursively represented the drug were identified. These encompassed a range of similar and contradictory meanings for <b>Xenical,</b> reflecting the diverse and competing interests that can arise around a medication, both between players and within individual players. Against a background of issues relating to health, weight, weight loss, safety, side effects and efficacy, as well as processes such as medicalisation and pharmaceuticalisation, our analysis also shed light on why this drug has fallen out of favour in recent years. Thus, this research highlights the transient nature of weight-loss drugs, a possible de-pharmaceuticalisation of fat, and the complex existence of pharmaceuticals as they are located within broader contexts of social understanding...|$|E
40|$|This article shows a {{significant}} efficacy and safety data of original drug <b>Xenical</b> in complex treatment of overweight and obesity patients. It is emphasized that this data describe properties of original <b>Xenical,</b> but not generics. The generic drug Orsoten has completely different physicochemical characteristics comparing to <b>Xenical,</b> this differences {{may lead to}} increase in allergic reactions and increase of frequency and intensity of side effects...|$|E
40|$|To {{compare the}} {{pharmaceutical}} quality of <b>Xenical</b> (chemically produced orlistat) with nine generic products, each produced by fermentation processes.; <b>Xenical</b> 120 mg capsules (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) {{were used as}} reference material. Generic products were from India, Malaysia, Argentina, Philippines, Uruguay, and Taiwan. Colour, melting temperature, crystalline form, particle size, capsule fill mass, active pharmaceutical ingredient content, amount of impurities, and dissolution were compared. Standard physical and chemical laboratory tests were those developed by Roche for Xenical.; All nine generic products failed the <b>Xenical</b> specifications in four or more tests, and two generic products failed in seven tests. A failure common to all generic products was the amount of impurities present, mostly due to different by-products, including side-chain homologues not present in <b>Xenical.</b> Some impurities were unidentified. Two generic products tested failed the dissolution test, one product formed a capsule-shaped agglomerate on storage and resulted in poor (>/= 15 %) dissolution. Six generic products were powder formulations.; All tested generic orlistat products were pharmaceutically inferior to <b>Xenical.</b> The high levels of impurities in generic orlistat products are a major safety and tolerability concern...|$|E
40|$|Obesity plays a {{key role}} in {{reproductive}} disorders. <b>Xenical</b> administration results in recovery of menstrual function in 78. 9 % and ovulation in 26. 3 % of patients with obesity. Hormone therapy in patients with obesity should be accompanied with <b>Xenical</b> therapy, which has a favorable impact on further body weight reduction (13. 95 % from baseline) and improvement (or stability) of metabolic parameters...|$|E
