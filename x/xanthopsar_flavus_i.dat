40|$|Properly labeled museum {{specimens}} {{represent a}} principal data source for avian distri-butions. In {{the case of}} rare and threatened species, specimens document past localities and may provide evidence of historical range contractions (Collar et al. 1992), {{which is one of}} the main criteria for assigning threat status (Mace & Stuart 1991). Most reviews of the ranges of such taxa assume correct identification of skins, making it important to report incorrectly labelled museum specimens. Saffron-cowled Blackbird <b>Xanthopsar</b> <b>flavus</b> is currently considered Vulnerable (BirdLife International 2004). Five specimens attributed to this species held in the Instituto Miguel Lillo, Tucumán, Argentina, are misidentified. I personally checked the specimens and their labels on 9 November 2006. Specimen numbers are those of the Lillo collection. Specimen 02931 was collected by J. Esteban on 10 November 1944 at Colonia Dalmacia, prov. Formosa, Argentina, near the río Monte Lindo. It is an immature male Unicoloured Blackbird Agelasticus cyanopus, of the nominate race, with a female-type plumage but black cheeks. This transitional plumage was described by Parkes (1966). Because of its yellow underparts the specimen was wrongly labelled by the collector as Saffron-cowled Blackbird...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The Saffron-cowled Blackbird, <b>Xanthopsar</b> <b>flavus</b> (Gmelin, 1788), is a {{globally}} vulnerable icterid {{endemic to}} grasslands and open areas, and a priority species {{for research and}} conservation programs. This contribution provides information on the population size, habitat, behavior, breeding biology and nest success of X. flavus in two conservation units (CUs) in Viamão, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil: the Environmental Protection Area Banhado Grande, and the Wildlife Refuge Banhado dos Pachecos, classified as an “Important Bird Area”. Searches for X. flavus were carried out mainly in open areas, the type of habitat favored by the species. Outside the breeding season individual behavior was recorded by the ad libitum method; during the breeding season, selected X. flavus pairs were observed following the sequence sampling method. The research areas were visited once a month, totaling approximately 530 hours of observations (September 2014 to June 2016) over 84 days, which included two breeding seasons. The species was observed across all months (not necessarily within the same year) and several X. flavus flocks were encountered, some {{with more than one}} hundred individuals (range = 2 - 137). Additionally, the behavior and feeding aspects, habitat use and breeding information on X. flavus were recorded. Two breeding colonies were found, and eleven nests were monitored. The estimated nesting success was 10 % in Colony 1, but zero in Colony 2, where all eggs and nestlings were predated. Saffron-cowled Blackbirds were recorded in mixed flocks, mostly with Pseudoleistes guirahuro (Vieillot, 1819), P. virescens (Vieillot, 1819) and Xolmis dominicanus (Vieillot, 1823), the last also a globally endangered species. The collected information highlights the importance of CUs for the maintenance of X. flavus populations in the region. Maintenance of proper areas for feeding and breeding is necessary and urgent. Information from current research is being employed in the management plan of the Wildlife Refuge Banhado dos Pachecos in which X. flavus is one of the conservation target-species...|$|R
40|$|Twelve methylenedioxy-containing {{compounds}} including piperine and 10 piperine-like synthetic compounds {{were assessed}} {{to determine their}} antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic activities against Aspergillus flavus ATCC 22546 {{in terms of their}} structure-activity relationships. Piperonal and 1, 3 -benzodioxole had inhibitory effects against A. flavus mycelial growth and aflatoxin B 1 production up to a concentration of 1000 &# 65533;&# 65533;g/mL. Ten piperine-like synthetic compounds were synthesized that differed in terms of the carbon length in the hydrocarbon backbone and the presence of the methylenedioxy moiety. In particular, 1 -(2 -methylpiperidin- 1 -yl) - 3 -phenylprop- 2 -en- 1 -one had potent antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic effects against A. flavus up to a concentration of 1 &# 65533;&# 65533;g/mL. This synthetic compound was remarkable because the positive control thiabendazole had no inhibitory effect at this concentration. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that five genes involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis pathways were down-regulated in A. <b>flavus,</b> <b>i.</b> e., aflD, aflK, aflQ, aflR, and aflS, therefore, the synthetic compound inhibited aflatoxin production by down-regulating these genes. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerlandope...|$|R
40|$|Microbial lipids {{can be used}} as a {{feedstock}} for biodiesel production, and use of biowastes as {{the substrate}} for microbial lipid production can reduce its production cost. The aims of this research include: (i) isolation and identification of local oleaginous species from Irish soils; (ii) feasibility of oleaginous fungi for microbial lipid production from potato processing wastewater, in addition with nutrient removals from wastewater; and (iii) microbial lipid production using pure carbon sources for comparison. Local oleaginous fungi were isolated from Irish soils with the aim of producing microbial lipids with low cost starch substrates. 30 cultures were oleaginous with glucose as the carbon substrate; the maximum lipid content in biomass (44. 3 %) was observed in the isolate I 16 - 3. When the isolates were grown on starch medium, 19 cultures among 30 cultures were able to accumulate lipids. The maximum lipid content (39 %) was observed in I 16 - 3. The isolate was identified as Aspergillus flavus. This study also explored the amylase secretion capability of isolated cultures and the maximum yield (34 IU/mL) was observed in the isolate I 16 - 3. Identification of isolated fungi with molecular techniques revealed a number of non mucaraceous fungi including Aspergillus sp., Penicillum sp., Tricoderma sp., and Aceremonium sp. along with mucaraceous fungi zygomycetes sp., Mortierella sp. and Umbliopsis sp. These non mucaraceous oleaginous fungi would be of future interest in generation of the second generation biodiesel. Potential use of potato processing wastewater for microbial lipid production was studied under various conditions. Using Aspergillus oryzae, diluting the wastewater by adding 25 % of tap water achieved the maximum lipid yield of 3. 5 g/L. It was observed that phosphate limitation may be the mechanism to stimulate microbial lipid production. At this dilution ratio, total soluble starch was utilized by 99 % and the fungi secreted amylase of 53. 5 IU/mL. Nutrient removal from potato processing wastewater was examined; at this dilution ratio, removals of chemical oxygen demand, total soluble nitrogen, total soluble phosphorus, ammonium nitrogen, orthophosphate and sulphate of 91 %, 98 %, 97 %, 100 %, 100 % and 30 % were achieved. Lipids of A. oryzae contained major fatty acids like palmitic acid (12. 6 %), palmitolic acid (4. 3 %), stearic acid (14. 5 %), oleic acid (22. 5 %), linolenic acid (5. 5 %), and linoleic acid (6. 5 %). When external nutrients were added to raw potato processing wastewater for lipids and gamma - linolenic acid (GLA) production using two oleaginous fungi, Aspergillus <b>flavus</b> <b>I</b> 16 - 3 and Mucor rouxii, the lipid and GLA yields were enhanced; 3. 5 and 4. 2 g/L of lipids, and 100 and 140 mg/L of GLA were produced by Aspergillus <b>flavus</b> <b>I</b> 16 - 3 and Mucor rouxii, respectively. In addition, the wastewater was efficiently treated, when external nutrients were added to raw wastewater, with total soluble chemical oxygen demand removals of 60 % and 90 %, total soluble nitrogen removals of 100 % and 98 %, total soluble phosphorus removals of 92 % and 81 % by Aspergillus oryzae I 16 - 3 and Mucor rouxii, respectively. In the study with pure glucose, starch and cellulose as the carbon substrate, Mucor rouxii was cultured at an initial C/N ratio of 60. The highest lipids yield of 4. 9 g/L was found with glucose as the carbon substrate. The lipid content in biomass for starch was less than for glucose. The maximum lipid yield was increased when the starch concentration was increased to 60 g/L and 5. 8 g/L of lipids was produced. Cellulose supported M. rouxii biomass growth but did not support the lipid production. Significant quantities of a-Amylase (0. 5 and 1. 2 IU/mL) and cellulase (0. 19 IU/mL) were produced by M. rouxii to hydrolyze the complex carbon sources. Microbial lipids comprised oleic, palmitic, stearic, linolenic and GLA fatty acids. On the whole, this research has found non mucaraceous oleaginous fungi for low cost lipid production on starchy wastes. Isolated indigenous fungi have been proven to be efficient in microbial lipid production from potato processing wastewater. Our research also demonstrates the potential use of potato processing wastewater for microbial lipid production with simultaneous wastewater treatment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Tomato fruits {{infected}} by Aspergillus flavus Linn produced proteins with cellulolytic activity. The enzyme was partially purified by Ammonium Sulphate Precipitation, Gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. Three peaks of absorption A, B and C were obtained. Peak B had Cellulase activity with molecular weight of approximately 30, 200 Daltons while Peaks A and C lacked Cellulase activity. Elution of components of Peak B on CM Sephadex C- 25 produced four peaks of absorption designated Ba, Bb, Bc and Bd. Only components of Peaks Bb and Bc possessed Cellulase activity. Purification folds of approximately 80 and 81 {{were obtained for}} components of Peaks Bb and Bc respectively for Cellulase of A. flavus. The apparent Km values for the hydrolysis of carboxymethylcellulose by A. flavus Cellulase fractions, Bb and Bc were approximately 16. 7 and 15. 4 mg/ml respectively. The partially purified enzyme preparations obtained from A. flavus during the deterioration of tomato fruits caused tissue maceration and cellular death. This result can be very useful in splitting and solubilization of pectic substances and pathogenicity.
