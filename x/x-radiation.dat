25|$|X-rays make up <b>X-radiation,</b> {{a form of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×1016 Hz to 3×1019 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, <b>X-radiation</b> is referred to with terms meaning Röntgen radiation, after the German scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it <b>X-radiation</b> to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of X-ray(s) in the English language includes the variants x-ray(s), xray(s), and X ray(s).|$|E

Alterations of its structural properties are commonly associated with different diseases (malignancy, cardiac hypertrophy, etc.). In this work, we studied the effects of <b>X-radiations</b> on cytoskeleton architecture of two cell lines: BALBc/ 3 T 3 and Simian virus 40 -transformed BALBc/ 3 T 3 (SVT 2) cells. In agreement with the current literature, we observed reduced adhesion and increased motility of SVT 2 cells respect to non-transformed BALBc/ 3 T 3. In addition, we showed that two different doses of X-rays (1 and 2 Gy) increased cell-dish adhesiveness and reduced cell proliferation and cell motility of transformed cells, whereas minor effects were measured on the normal counterpart. These results suggested that low doses or fractioning of X-rays may have a normalization effect on the investigated parameters for the transformed cell phenotype. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company...|$|R
25|$|Since 1930 several {{researchers}} (J. Jackson, G. Fanti, T. Trenn, T. Phillips, J.-B. Rinaudo and others) endorsed the flash-like irradiation hypothesis. It was {{suggested that the}} relatively high definition of the image details can be obtained through the energy source (specifically, protonic) acting from inside. The Russian researcher Alexander Belyakov proposed an intense, but short flashlight source, which lasted some hundredths of a second. Some other authors suggest the <b>X-radiation</b> or a burst of directional ultraviolet radiation {{may have played a}} role in the formation of the Shroud image. From the image characteristics, {{several researchers}} have theorized that the radiant source was prevalently vertical.

500|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Second World War was also the dawning of a new [...] "Atomic Age", in which the peacetime potential of nuclear energy began to be explored. Bachelder was among the scientists who opposed the May-Johnson Bill of October 1945, a Congressional bill proposed by the Interim Committee, which would have maintained military control over nuclear research. The bill was defeated in Congress and superseded by the McMahon Atomic Energy Act. In January 1947, the newly formed Atomic Energy Commission approved the declassification of 270 previously secret documents.

The final conclusion is that there is little to be chosen between the three highest-ranking expressions. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R

The main {{objectives of the}} present work are to investigate (I) if any textural changes occur as the wire diameter decreases and (11) if such changes influence the mechanical behaviour of the wire. A wire of about circle divide 1. 5 mm is drawn to about circle divide 0. 15 mm following a standard industrial route and samples were collected from five intermediate drawing passes. Bulk texture measurements using <b>X-radiations</b> were then carried on the transverse sections of the wires and texture characteristics such as volume fraction of textural components and sharpness index were quantified {{with respect to the}} wire diameter. It was observed that the texture in the as-drawn wires remains chiefly the same -fibre as the wire diameter decreases. However, the sharpness of texture reaches a maximum at a certain diameter and decreases with further decrease in the wire diameter. An explanation is offered based on the concept of deformation zone geometry. An attempt was also made to determine if texture weakening has any effect on the mechanical properties of the wire at room temperature. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The Pacific Polymer Federation, PPF, {{was founded}} in 1987 by the Polymer Division of the American Chemical Society, the Society of Polymer Science, Japan and the Polymer Division of the Royal Australian Chemical Institute at signing {{ceremony}} in Tokyo, Japan. Since then other Pacific Basin societies have jointed the Federation, and the Federation is currently comprised of seventeen member societies all drawn from Pacific Basin Nations. The PPF holds biennial conferences, and the eleventh conference, PPC- 11, was held in Cairns, Australia on December 6 – 11, 2009 and co-chaired by Andrew Whittaker and Wayne Cook from Australia. Approximately 1000 delegates attended PPC- 11. A symposium on the Radiation Modification of Polymers formed part of the technical program for PPC- 11 and was organized by Seiichi Tagawa, Osaka University, Japan; Olgun Güven, Hacettepe University, Turkey; and David Hill, The University of Queensland, Australia. The symposium occupied three days of PPC- 11 and the program included oral and poster papers on the radiation chemistry of polymers, with several sessions allocated to the special topic of photolithography that was organized by Idriss Blakey, The University of Queensland, Australia. In addition, one session of the symposium was sponsored by RADTECH Asia and was organized by Seiichi Tagawa. The papers which constitute this special issue have been drawn from papers presented at the Radiation Modification of Polymers symposium. While studies {{of the effects of}} high-energy radiations on polymers continue {{to attract the attention of}} many researchers, the fundamental principles that underlie the interaction of high-energy radiations with polymers are now well established. Thus most of the papers at the symposium were devoted to applications of high-energy radiation in various fields of polymer science, ranging from applications in photolithography to biomedicine. The types of radiations used in the studies reported in the symposium were also very broad, and covered heavy ion and electron beams and short wavelength electromagnetic radiation, including gamma and <b>X-radiations,</b> as well as VUV radiation.
