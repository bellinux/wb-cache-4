The system must gather the relevant information, evaluate trade-offs, and suggest courses of action to the user. For example, consider travel planning.

40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the modern technologies used in software development in general, and in development of process information and process automation systems. As the systems became more complex and the software parts of them larger, old software development technologies based on structural type of programming had more and more difficulties to cope with this complexity. The new technologies emerged in recent ten-fifteen years have tried to solve these problems by focusing on a) reuse of software b) increasing the abstraction level in the development processes. All these technologies are based on objectoriented approach. We can see two clear directions of the development. One direction is in a relation to modeling of software systems. During the establishment of object-oriented languages, different methods for modeling object-oriented systems appeared which eventually resulted in Unified Modeling Language (UML). The second direction is related to the implementation part, i. e. to reuse of software components already implemented. This direction is characterized by component-based approach which includes development of methods and different implementations of component-based models and middlewares (for <b>example</b> <b>COM,.</b> NET, CORBA, JavaBeans, etc.). These trends are continuing. UML is grown up in a general methodology, not only used in object-oriented design, and component-based technologies are gaining ground in new domain...|$|R

Continuous outcomes can be modeled using linear regression; binary outcomes can be modeled using logit, probit, or heteroskedastic probit regression; and count and nonnegative outcomes can be modeled using Poisson regression.
