40|$|In {{this work}} we {{consider}} the communication of information {{in the presence of}} an online adversarial jammer. In the setting under study, a sender wishes to communicate a message to a receiver by transmitting a codeword x = (x 1, [...] ., xn) symbol-by-symbol over a communication channel. The adversarial jammer can view the transmitted <b>symbols</b> <b>xi</b> one at a time, and can change up to a p-fraction of them. However, the decisions of the jammer must be made in an online or causal manner. Namely, for each <b>symbol</b> <b>xi</b> the jammer’s decision on whether to corrupt it or not (and on how to change it) must depend only on xj for j ≤ i. This is in contrast to the “classical ” adversarial jammer which may base its decisions on its complete knowledge of x. More generally, for a delay parameter d ∈ (0, 1), we study the scenario in which the jammer’s decision on the corruption of xi must depend solely on xj for j ≤ i −dn. In this work, we initiate the study of codes for online adversaries, and present a tight characterization of the amount of information one can transmit in both the 0 -delay and, more generally, the d-delay online setting. We show that for 0 -delay adversaries, the achievable rate asymptotically equals that of the classical adversarial model. For positive values of d we show that the achievable rate can be significantly greater than that of the classical model...|$|R

Globalization and {{subsequent}} increase in seaborne trade have necessitated e cient {{planning and management}} of world's anchorage areas. These areas serve as a temporary stay areaforcommercialvesselsforvariousreasonssuchaswaitingforpassageorport, fuelservices, and bad weather conditions. In this study, we present a simulation-based dynamic multi-objective anchorage planning strategy where we incorporate a time dimension by simultaneous modeling vessel arrival and departures. We consider utilization, safety, and fuel consumption performance metrics in a normalized weighted sum scheme as the objective function. We use Monte Carlo simulations to measure the e ect of any particular combination of planning metrics (measured in real time for an incoming vessel) on the objective function (measured in steady state). We resort to the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) method for identifying the linear combination of the planning metrics that optimizes the desired linear combination of the performance metrics. We present computational experiments on a major Istanbul Straight anchorage as well as synthetic anchorages. Our results indicate that our methodology signi cantly outperforms current state-of-the-art anchorage planning algorithms in the literature.

He suggests that proving lower bounds for LDCs over the complex or real field is {{a good starting point}} for approaching one of his conjectures. Our main result is an m(n) = Ω(n 2) lower bound for linear 3 -query LDCs over any, possibly infinite, field. The constant in the Ω(·) depends only on ε and δ.

40|$|In {{this note}} {{we present a}} statistical, non-equilibrium en-velope model that, based on Legendre transforms, char-acterizes source coders and {{transmission}} channels by their capacity-delay-error-tradeoff. The model is proven to have the desirable property of additivity, that allows analyzing coders and channels separately. We present an example for Huffman coding. More {{can be found in}} the report [2]. 1. ADDITIVE ENVELOPE MODEL We use a discrete time model and denote by arrivals A(t) the cumulative number of bits generated by a source in the interval [0, t]. The arrivals have sample path envelope E(t) with overflow profile ε(σ) if for all t ≥ 0 and σ ≥ 0 [1] P[∃τ ≥ 0 : A(t+ τ) −A(τ) > E(t) + σ] ≤ ε(σ). We use the concave Fenchel conjugate, respectively, Legen-dre transform of E(t) defined for any c ≥ 0 as LE(c) = sup t≥ 0 {E(t) − ct} to characterize the source. LE(c) has the interpretation of a delay bound for the source at a channel with constant rate c. For the delay W it holds for all σ ≥ 0 that [2] P[W> (LE(c) + σ) /c] ≤ ε(σ), (1) where ε(σ) is the error probability. We refer to (c, (LE(c) + σ) /c, ε(σ)) as the capacity-delay-error-tradeoff of the source. Given the effective bandwidth of A(t) defined for θ> 0 as α(θ, t) = 1 /(θt) lnMA(θ, t) where MA(θ, t) = E[e θA(t) ] is the moment generating function (MGF) of A(t). We ap-ply Chernoff’s theorem and the union bound to derive an envelope E(t) with Legendre transform [2] LE(c) = sup t≥ 0 {(α(θ, t) + δ − c) t} − ln(θδ) /θ, (2) where θ> 0 and δ ∈ (0, 1 /θ] are free parameters that can be optimized. Similarly, channels can be described by convex Legendre transforms, where the composition of a source and a channel corresponds to an addition of their transforms [2]. 2.

40|$|Hydroxamic acids, {{with the}} two {{bioactive}} representatives aspergillic acid (naturally occurring) and vorinostat (synthetic), are well known for their strong binding ability with many metal ions. This explains their potential to inhibit specific metal-containing enzymes involved in e. g. human immunodeficiency virus and cancer progression. Our group has previously {{been working on the}} design and synthesis of highly functionalized pyrazinones. Therefore, it was of interest to us to combine these two classes of compounds into new compounds resembling integrase inhibitor diketoacid-based structures and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Functionalization of C- 3 of N-hydroxypyrazinones has been thoroughly investigated in this thesis resulting in the successful synthesis of a library containing three series of novel compounds, including 3 -alkyl-/carboxamide-/ureidoalkyl- 1 -hydroxypyrazinones. With the implemention of flow chemistry technology and catalytic transfer hydrogenation, we have succeeded in delivering a reproducible methodology for the selective debenzylation of O-benzyl protected N-hydroxypyrazinones, with a potential for scaling up to gram scale on suitable flow apparatus. Numerous N-hydroxypyrazinones have been synthesized with HIV inhibitory activity in mind. However, in vitro evaluation of anti-HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 replication on human T-lymphocyte cells using an MTT assay showed that none of the synthesized compounds exhibits the inhibitory activity. Some compounds do however show inhibition in an HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase polymerase assay.

40|$|The use {{of large}} core (1 mm) Step Index Plastic Optical Fibers (SI-POF) for last mile and Local Area Network {{applications}} {{is linked to}} finding an economical solution to the limited bandwidth x length product of the medium. This is mainly caused by the intermodal dispersion which occurs in the fiber. An efficient and economical solution would be the integration of an automatic dispersion correction circuit directly with the optical front-end. This circuit has an equivalent function to adaptive line equalizers, which are already applied widely in existing transmission channels, applied to the specific characteristics of POF. To address the economical reality even further, the integration of this circuit and the optical front-end {{should be done in}} a cheap CMOS technology. This introduces additional challenges, both for the implementation of the optical front-end as for the dispersion correction circuit. It are these challenges this PhD seeks to address.

40|$|The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) {{method is}} an {{alternative}} to traditional mesh-based techniques such as the Finite Element Method (FEM). Due to its particle-based Lagrangian nature the method is very attractive to simulate and study complex problems involving large deformations, moving boundaries, free surfaces and multiple phases, which can be challenging for mesh-based approaches. In this thesis we extend the applicability of SPH in three ways: (a) the application and validation of the method for the 3 D computation of cohesive soil, (b) {{the development of a}} dynamic particle refinement procedure, and (c) the parallelization of the method for shared memory computers. The model used for the 3 D computation of soil is based on an elastic-perfectly plastic stress-strain relationship with the Drucker-Prager yield criterion. We apply the artificial stress method to avoid tensile instabilities, a numerical issue that often appears when simulating cohesive soil in SPH. The artificial stress method is extended to the 3 D general stress state. The model is validated by comparing SPH results with simulations obtained with FEM. We present a dynamic particle refinement procedure based on particle splitting. This procedure allows to dynamically increase the resolution of the discretization by replacing a refined particle with new daughter particles. The optimal separation and smoothing distance of the newly introduced particles are determined by taking into account the error introduced by the refinement in the gradient of the kernel, and by reducing possible numerical instabilities. Finally, we develop a parallel implementation of SPH for shared memory computers. The presented approach is based on domain decomposition and space filling curves. This ensures per thread local storage of most frequently accessed data, avoids NUMA-unfriendly memory allocations, reduces data races and allows efficient calculation of symmetric inter-particle forces.

40|$|Bi-directional {{interfacing}} electronics {{with living}} electrogenic cells {{has been used}} widely in neuroscience, mainly as research tool for studying brain mechanisms, the development of neuroprostheses, and medical therapies for several neurological disorders. Challenges for this interfacing include minimizing the interference of extracellular stimulation on the recorded neural signals, increasing the stimulation selectivity, integrating recording and/or stimulation capabilities in closed-loop systems, and fast online data analysis. The main objective of this thesis was to design and implement a system that enables the simultaneous stimulation and recording neural activity in vivo from multiple electrode sites, and that allows ultimately closed-loop operation, namely neural modulation based on activity data. The realized system should be miniaturized (hence microsystem) and be suitable for in vivo rodent experiments. Two different stimulation-recording systems have been implemented in the thesis. The first single-channel prototype explores the stimulation effects on recording capabilities {{in the case of}} planar silicon neural probes. We have been able to define the voltage thresholds for eliciting neural responses experimentally. Additionally, some configurations have revealed minimal interference with stimulation artifacts, allowing the observation of evoked action potentials right after the stimulation period. A novel concept of mixed-signal architecture for removing stimulus-induced electrical artifacts and allowing recordings during the stimulation phase, was further integrated in the prototype. The template subtraction algorithm has been applied in an analog-digital context, i. e. generating the template digitally after the training phase, and subtracting it from the recording signals in the stimulation phase. The topology has successfully been validated in simulations, in in vitro measurements, and, with promising results, in vivo. This system advances the possibilities for exploring brain mechanisms, particularly under multi-electrode stimulations. Optical stimulation, in which (visible) light pulses are delivered to brain tissue to elicit or inhibit neural activity, has recently opened new perspectives in brain research, allowing much higher spatial resolution and selective stimulation. In a second prototype we realized a hybrid neural interface combining optical stimulation with electrical recording capabilities in a closed-loop fashion with fast spike sorting. This system allows acquiring and classifying the data, and subsequently triggering the light pulses online. The fast operation and high data-rate signal processing are essential in improving the precision, selectivity, and effectiveness of stimulation.

40|$|Wanneer een tunnel wordt gegraven in een rotsmassief, ondergaat het omliggende rotsmateriaal een evolutie van spanningstoestanden. Deze evolutie wordt zelden in rekening gebracht bij het voorspellen van het gedrag van het rotsmateriaal. Het doel van deze {{thesis is}} het aantonen van de invloed van de geschiedenis van de spanningstoestanden op het proces van bros breukgedrag in rotsmateriaal. Daarenboven verdiept deze thesis het inzicht van het proces van bros breukgedrag. Aan de hand van laboratoriumproeven en numerieke modelleringen, worden breukmodellen ten gevolge van druk en trekspanningen voorgesteld. Deze thesis beschrijft twee observaties in kalkstenen monsters. (1) De beschadiging, geïnduceerd door een eerdere drukspanning, zorgt ervoor dat een latere belasting in trek, minder bijkomende beschadiging induceert. (2) Daarenboven zorgt de beschadiging, geïnduceerd door een eerdere trekspanning, ervoor dat een latere belasting in druk, meer bijkomende beschadiging induceert.

40|$|Bone tissue {{engineering}} (TE) is a promising alternative {{for the treatment}} of large bone defects. In {{the current state of the}} art scaffolds are seeded with cells and subsequently implanted. Despite some successful studies, bone TE to date still suffers from unpredictable and qualitatively inferior results. Moreover, even when satisfactory and reproducible results are obtained in an ectopic implantation site, this does not necessarily mean good results will be obtained in orthotopic implantation sites. An orthotopic environment imposes additional requirements on the construct as it is an environment that is substantially different from the ectopic site in terms of biological and mechanical requirements (signals coming from the host, host-construct interaction and integration, and mechanical stability). In this project, a mathematical model will be developed that will focus on the biological process taking place after implantation of the TE construct in an orthotopic site, in close collaboration with experimental partners. Special attention will be paid to the signals coming from the host on the one hand (e. g. angiogenesis) and signals coming from the construct itself (cells, biomaterials) on the other hand.

40|$|The {{development}} of plasmonic nanostructures is enabling studies in bio-sensing, light harvesting, photo-catalysis, nanomedicine and so on. The interaction between noble metal nanostructures and analytes in their vicinity determines the molecular absorption, emission, and scattering processes, {{which are the}} key issue for all these applications. However, resolving this interaction is still challenging due to the sub-wavelength size of the plasmonic structures. Therefore, in this thesis, we employ single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to study the emission of probes {{in the vicinity of}} silver nanowires and gold nanorods. Chapter 1 provides an introduction of fluorescence microcopy, plasmonics and plasmon modified fluorescence. The latest literature reports about single-molecule microscopy applied to nanostructures are summarized and presented. The objectives of this thesis are also formulated. Chapter 2 reports on a successful single-molecule microscopy study on densely labelled plasmonic nanostructures. The routine experimental details including data acquisition, analysis and interpretation are described, as they are also used in other chapters. The experimental results show that we can resolve the metallicnbsp;with nanometer resolution and that we can estimate the single-molecule fluorescence enhancement factor. Thisnbsp;also points out that the point spread functions (PSFs) of single molecules in the vicinity of metals can be distorted. Chapter 3 focuses on the visualization of fluorescencenbsp;from molecules attached on the silver nanowire surface. By exciting fluorophores remotely using surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagating along metallic nanowires, the experiments reveal a complex array of single-molecule fluorescence PSFsnbsp;depend not only on the position and orientation of the molecular transition dipole, but also on the nanowire dimensions. The strong size dependence of this effect is reported. This work opens possibilities for fast size-sorting of metallic nanoparticles, and for predicting molecular orientations and binding positions on metallic nanoparticles via far-field optical imaging. Chapter 4 explains the inaccuracies associated with super-resolution reconstruction imaging of metal nanowires. Due to the distortion of PSFs, localization errors are generated when fitting the centroid of fluorescent spot. Moreover, we also find out that the inaccuracies depend onnbsp;position and orientation of the probe molecule's transition dipole, as well as the size of the metal structure. Therefore, correctly extracting the true molecular positionnbsp;only be possible based on the knowledge of the shape and size of the plasmonic structures. These findings have critical impacts for assessing and interpreting single-moleculenbsp;from metallic structures. In Chapter 5, single-molecule super-resolution and defocused microscopy are used to characterize the coupling between emitters and plasmonic optical antennas. The results locate the emission center of the antenna system with sub-diffraction limit resolution, which is far beyondnbsp;resolving power of conventional microscopy. Our findings also indicate that the antenna mode dominates the emission process in coupled systems. This study unravels the role of the antenna mode in the emission process of coupled optical systems, and paves the way for effective optical antenna design. Chapter 6 concludes that novel insights can be obtained bynbsp;single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to probe the plasmonic structures. Examining the emissions from single molecule sets the foundation to the general understanding of the optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures.

This software tool enhances the system selection and component evaluation toa wide extent. Secondly we have tackled the component design and fabrication,with a focus on the detector antenna and circuitry. Regarding the &# 64257;rst part of thework we have developed and optimized a fast and accurate method, based on theHuygens wave propagation principle, that provides us the ability to model a fullsystem with given setup dimensions and spacing. It provides a reconstruction ofthe expected image on the detector. It also provides useful information such aspower level and dynamic range of the received signal. Furthermore the methodis used as a design tool to optimize a lens for a given setup. Towards the secondpart of this research, we have designed and fabricated two types of antennas usingdi&# 64256;erent technologies. Performance of patch antennas fabricated on a multi-chipmodule process on high-resistive silicon was improved using bulk vias reducingthe substrate wave leakage. A low cost thin-&# 64257;lm wideband antenna has also beenfabricated with promising measurement results. The antenna performance has beenmeasured with a novel measurement setup. We have also tackled a 100 GHz lownoise ampli&# 64257;er design, fabricated using a commercial BiCMOS process.

40|$|The area of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, a {{subfield}} of Artificial Intelligence, studies how {{knowledge can}} be represented {{and how it can}} be used for automated reasoning. Several declarative programming paradigms implement this by developing a formal language to symbolically represent knowledge, as well as an associated form of inference to achieve the desired solution. Recently, the Knowledge Base System (KBS) paradigm has been proposed, {{based on the idea that}} knowledge is not inherently linked to a specific reasoning task. Instead, this paradigm proposes to express knowledge in a truly declarative manner. Additionally, to stress reusability of this knowledge, the KBS paradigm allows the knowledge to be combined with one out of a set of possible inferences, each providing a solution to some type of computational task. The initial implementation of this KBS paradigm, also known as the IDP 3 system, provided a suitable laboratory to examine a new type of software engineering. State-of-the-art declarative programming systems such as IDP 3, clasp, WASP, and lp 2 sat work using the ground-and-solve methodology. First, the high-level language is ground into a low-level propositional language. As a second step the grounding is used as input for general-purpose, low-level propositional (generally SAT-like) solvers. This thesis contains a thorough study of the impact of different grounding approaches on the solver behaviour. I. e., if the grounding process that is used is smart and results in a smaller low-level representation, does this impact the search behaviour of the underlying solver? The language supported by the IDP 3 system contains constraints and definitions. For the purpose of this thesis, we split up definitions into two kinds: input* (also called intentional or stratified predicates, or domain atoms) and search definitions. Input* definitions are definitions that depend on concepts that are known beforehand and can be evaluated. One contribution of this thesis is the evaluation of input* definitions using Tabled Prolog. In order to use these techniques, definitions have to be transformed into a format usable by Prolog. The main challenge in this transformation is correctly projecting away the types and rich language constructs, whilst taking into acount Prolog's left-to-right execution mechanism. Search definitions on the other hand cannot be evaluated because they depend on unknown data. This text elaborates how the above translation to Prolog can be re-used: 1) to partially evaluate definitions, deriving as much information as possible, and 2) ground definitions using a Tabled Prolog execution mechanism. We developed a method to guide the solver to focus on relevant parts in the search space. Only the part of the specification that is linked with the current search branch of the problem has to be taken into account. The goal of this technique is to prevent certain decisions from being made once it is possible to prove that they will not influence the outcome of searching in the current search branch. Additionally, this leads us to an improved stopping criterion for SAT(ID) solvers since any state without relevant decisions is considered an end state, instead of only states in which all literals have been decided. An implementation of technique is presented. The implementation uses a incremental approach, adjusting certain data structures based on the changes in the solver state. With this work we intend to increase the usability of the IDP 3 system and elevate it to a "mature" Knowledge Base System.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{invention}} of the first transistor in 1947, the development of microelectronics is characterized by a continuous scaling of the technology. This evolution has brought huge opportunities to both analog and digital integrated circuits. Higher-speed circuits with increased functionality can be fabricated on a smaller area at a lower cost. This scaling however has also generated important side effects: increased variability and time-dependent degradation phenomena, which are important obstacles in the evolution towards more optimized complex systems, whose optimal performance must be guaranteed during their complete lifespan. This thesis focuses on the design of analog integrated circuits in nanoscaled CMOS technologies. To this purpose, an updated Smart-Redundancy design methodology is used, which is required when designing circuits in these CMOS technologies. This methodology allows to reduce the impact of (spatial, environmental and temporal) yield-limiting effects on the performance of (analog) integrated circuits. Using this methodology, a number of circuits are then discussed whose lifetime performance is not guaranteed due to these yield-limiting effects. The design trade-offs and an implementation of a 15 -bit current steering DAC are addressed, as this is a circuit which is performance-limited by the presence of spatial yield-limiting effects. A number of techniques (such as the Reduced Area Current Source Scaling (RACSS) method and the complementary DAC topology) are presented, aimed at improving the linearity performance of such a system. Afterwards, the impact is discussed of deterministic degradation effects present in 45 nm- 90 nm CMOS technology nodes. In the example circuit of the output buffer of a high-voltage xDSL line driver, high voltage levels are required for optimal performance. Hence, degradation is very likely to happen, resulting in a reduced lifetime of this circuit. A reliability analysis is performed and used to realize a failure- resilient self-healing topology. A proof-of-concept silicon implementation, including measurement results, is presented. Finally, stochastic degradation effects are considered, as seen in sub- 45 nm CMOS nodes. Variability-sensitive circuits are impacted most by this temporal yield-limiting effect, as it manifests itself as an increasing variability over the lifespan of the circuit. The impact of this effect is discussed on an example circuit of a 6 -bit current-steering DAC. Using simulations of a lifetime recalibration scheme, the static linearity of this circuit can be preserved over the requested lifetime, hence confirming the Smart- Redundancy concepts presented.

40|$|Nanofiltration is an {{attractive}} technology to treat surface water {{for the production of}} drinking water. However, fouling of the membrane limits the water recovery for this application to about 80 %. As problems with water scarcity are expected to grow worse in the coming decades, it cannot be tolerated that 20 % of the feed water is wasted. Therefore, it is necessary to develop technologies that make the discharge of retentate superfluous. The general concept {{of this study is to}} remove specific pollutants so that the concentrate can be returned to the feed side of the membrane without increased membrane fouling. In this way, a closed cycle with a recovery of almost 100 % may be obtained. The main membrane foulants are the natural organic matter (NOM) and sparingly soluble salts present in the retentate. The NOM in the retentate is decomposed by ozone oxidation and the salts by electrodialysis.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} applicability of Model Predictive Control (MPC) {{for the purpose of}} set-point control and flood control of river systems. The first part of this work discusses the modelling aspects of river systems. The dynamics of a single reach can be described with the well known hydrodynamic equations of de Saint-Venant. Combining these hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for every reach, together with the nonlinear equations modelling the hydraulic structures and the boundary conditions related to junctions, mathematical models can be constructed {{for a wide range of}} river systems. However, these models are typically too complex to be used directly in the design of a controller. A new type of approximate model is proposed in this dissertation. A significant reduction in computational complexity with respect to using the full hydrodynamic model while still achieving accurate results can be obtained by approximating the dynamics of every reach with a linear model in combination with the nonlinear gate equations. Model reduction techniques can be used to further decrease the computational complexity. The main part of this dissertation focuses on the design of the predictive controllers. The key ingredient is to work with the gate discharges as optimization variables instead of the gate openings. A linear approximate model is sufficiently accurate in this configuration and the resulting optimization problem is a Quadratic Programming problem (QP). It is explained how this controller can be used for set-point control and flood control at the same time and how it can recover the buffer capacity of the reservoirs in an efficient way. Attention is also paid to minimize the computation time needed to solve this QP at every time step by decreasing the number of optimization variables and the number of inequality constraints. The use of a Kalman filter as state estimator is also discussed. All closed loop simulations are performed with the full hydrodynamic models. Besides some academic test examples, a mathematical model of the Demer based on real field data is used to test the performance of the proposed control scheme. It is discussed how the controller can deal with the irregular bed slope and the irregular cross sectional profiles of the river system without having to rely on nonlinear advanced control techniques. The performance of the predictive controller is tested for the historical rainfall data of the Demer for the flood event of 2002 on the full hydrodynamic model and compared with the control performance of the current controller installed. The proposed predictive control scheme reduces significantly the number and the magnitude of floods, leads to a better set-point tracking and recovers the buffer capacity in a faster way than the current controller.

40|$|Titanium {{has ever}} since its {{discovery}} been {{looked upon as}} a very promising material. It not only combines excellent mechanical properties (high strength, high failure strain) with an extremely good corrosion resistance, {{but it is also}} a biocompatible material. It has although always kept its stamp of a promising material. The fact that titanium and most of its alloys consist respectively completely or mainly of aphase with a hexagonal crystal structure, has not helped in improving this status. The inherent anisotropy and the associated significantly different behavior from the better known cubic materials like steel or aluminum have left room for a so far mainly unused possibility for material tuning. Indeed, whereas for another hexagonal metal like magnesium, research has made great progress in understanding and controlling the intricate relations between for example the more conventional slip systems andthe activation of twinning on a micro-scale level, and the stress-strain and failure behavior on the macroscopic level, the research on the influence of the microstructural texture on the macroscopic properties has,especially in the case of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy, mostly been limited to the influence of heat treatments and their associated microstructural morphologies. The purpose of this work is to shed some more light on the active microscopic deformation mechanisms and their effect on the mechanical properties. The research has been limited to the workhorse of titanium materials, namely the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy and only considersdeformation at room temperature. Different mechanical tests were used to determine the mechanical response of the investigated Ti- 6 Al- 4 V material. The examined strain rate range corresponded to the quasi-static and the lower dynamic regime, where the high dynamic regime would correspondto shock wave loadings. The microstructural texture was however not varied, limiting it to a specific case, being a given equiaxed microstructure typical for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. However, as part of this work was to investigate the influence of the crystallographic texture on the deformation behaviour, the influence of the initial texture was taken into account by varying the loading directions and conditions. The crystallographic texture evolution was measured both before and after deformation in order to try to understand the underlying fundamental mechanisms. This experimental knowledge was then put to use to fit a crystal plasticity model to mimic these mechanisms. After assessing the validity of the numerical framework in the specific crystal plasticity model being used in the framework of this research project, the results of the model were finally compared both on a qualitative and quantitative level with the experimental results in order to assess its accuracy and predictive capabilities.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of three-dimensional (3 D) device architectures like Fin FETs and nanowire-based transistors {{as well as}} novel materials is inevit able in order to sustain scaling and continuous performance improvement in future technology nodes. However, the controlled doping of 3 D structu res represents still a major challenge, also since adequate metrology to ols for 2 D and preferably 3 D active dopant profiling in confined volumes with high spatial resolution is lagging behind. The objective of this thesis work was therefore to establish a character ization technique capable of mapping the distribution of active dopants in confined volumes such as nanowire-based transistors. Given the string ent requirements such as high spatial resolution and sensitivity arising from the properties inherent to confined nanoscale structures, we chose scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) and extended its capabi lities to facilitate 2 D and 3 D quantitative carrier profiling in future 3 D device structures. Applying our methodology to nanowire-based tunnel-field-effect transisto rs (TFET) enabled us to study and model dopant incorporation, diffusion and activation kinetics in confined nanoscale volumes in detail. Thereby the latter mechanisms could be revealed as significantly different from their counterparts in blanket structures. The substantially increased s urface-to-volume ratio of 3 D structures {{has been identified as}} the main cause for the observed deviations. Moreover, the impact of the detected size-dependent dopant profiles on the actual device characteristics was demonstrated experimentally and by device simulations. In order to extend SSRM towards quantitative carrier profiling in aggres sively scaled structures, we furthermore developed a novel electrical AF M mode, termed fast Fourier transform-SSRM (FFT-SSRM). This technique ai ms at decoupling the actual spreading resistance from parasitic series r esistances. For this purpose the force applied to the scanning probe is modulated, leading to a modulation of the contact size and therefore of the spreading resistance, whereas parasitic series resistances (e. g. the bulk resistance of the structure) remain constant. Hence, information o n the spreading resistance and therefore the carrier concentration can b e extracted using lock-in technique, even in situations where the measur ed resistance is dominated by series resistance terms. For the 3 D electrical characterization of carbon nanotube (CNT) -based in terconnects we established a dedicated slice-and-view approach. Thereby not only the data acquisition, but also successive material removal is a chieved by means of the scanning probe. From the obtained 3 D resistance maps, the resistivity of individual CNTs as well as the contact resistan ce between CNT and bottom electrode can be quantitatively determined. Th e latter are considered important parameters for the fabrication and int egration of CNTs in future integrated circuits. Our results demonstrate the enormous potential of 3 D analysis using SSRM for gaining fundamental insights into the electrical properties of nano scale confined structures. This constitutes an essential milestone on th e roadmap towards future nanoelectronic devices.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of silicon solar cells such that the cost/watt could be reduced to a competitive level. In this thesis, three aspects of the front-side of crystalline silicon solar cells have been investigated. Advanced texturing, emitter formation and passivation are detailed in chapters 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Below, each chapter is summarized. In chapter 2, a new technique has been developed that textures the frontside while polishing the rear-side. The technique involves the application of an acrylic adhesive micro-masking layer to a rough, as-cut wafer. Upon removal, remnants of the adhesive layer adhere only to the peaks of the as-cut wafer. The wafer is then subject to a 4 minute 12. 5 wt% heated NaOH etch, where the front-side of the wafer is textured and the rearside of the wafer is polished. The developed technique can lead to savings by: decreasing cycle time (4 min vs. 20 min conventional texturing time), saving consumables (one chemical solution vs. two) and reducing the amount of silicon loss (15 &# 956;m vs. 25 &# 956;m from texturing both sides and then polishing the rear). Equivalent solar cell efficiencies have been achieved when comparing the developed technique to conventional random pyramid textured and in-line polished wafers. Chapter 3 focuses on a novel emitter formation process that has been developed. The process involves the combination of ion implantation, passivation and annealing in a firing furnace. The developed process may enable ion implant technology to have a lower cycle time than conventional diffusion as the anneal is done in a firing furnace (within 90 seconds). Cell results show that implantation-induced damage can be annealed to an extent to reach open circuit voltages above 640 mV. Along with emitter formation, intentional and unintentional emitter alterations have also been investigated. wo processes that cause unintentional emitter etch back have been investigated, the rear emitter removal process as well as surface cleaning processes. Processes that alter the emitter profile necessitate an increase in sheet resistance monitoring. To reduce recombination, the phosphorus profile was altered. While this improved current and open circuit voltage, the use of aggressive screen printing paste shunted shallow junctions and significantly decreased the fill factor. The need for improved contact formation was evident for higher sheet resistance emitters developed in chapter 3, which has been done in chapter 4. In chapter 4, passivation and contacting of emitters developed in chapter 3 were improved with the introduction of thermal oxidation. Thermal oxide has been shown to improve i-PERC solar cell efficiency by 0. 6 - 1. 0 % absolute. There are clear differences between improvements made on the front-side and the rear-side due to thermal oxide, the individual contributions of which are detailed in chapter 4. It has been shown that the gain in efficiency is largely attributed to the front-side. Careful selection of the emitter {{must be taken into account}} when attempting to enhance performance by oxidation. The recombination reduction is caused by the additional phosphorus drive-in and has been assessed separately from passivation enhancement achieved by the silicon oxide. Besides the expected improvement in open circuit voltage (passivation), the fill factor has also shown to improve. The improvement in fill factor is due to a significant (one order of magnitude) reduction in contact resistance in high sheet resistance (> 85 &# 8486;/&# 9633;) emitters. This has been accredited to a large peak of phosphorus in the thermal oxide, which has been confirmed by SIMS and XPS measurements. Contact characterization by means of SEM, EDX, and C-AFM show that the large phosphorus content in the silicon oxide may improve crystallite formation or may form AgPx as detected by EDX. Phosphosilicate glass was used as an alternate method to introduce phosphorus in the passivation layer. Although PSG is not adequate for passivation, it has been shown to be able to enable a contact resistance below 3 mWcm² on a 95 &# 8486;/&# 9633; emitter, which demonstrates the potential of phosphorus incorporation in passivation layers. The reliability and stability of the contacts has been assessed. Extended versions of the IEC 61215 s damp heat and thermal cycling tests have been performed. Phosphorus rich silicon oxide passivated i-PERC cells are shown to be as reliable as conventional screen printed cells. abstract iii samenvatting v acknowledgments vii list of abberviations and <b>symbols</b> <b>xi</b> 1 introduction 1 1. 1 The Problem (Global Warming)............... 1 1. 2 A Solution (PV)....................... 6 1. 3 Thesis Motivation (c-Si PV)................. 8 2 advanced texturing 13 2. 1 Theory............................. 13 2. 1. 1 Motivation...................... 13 2. 1. 2 Pyramid Textured Front-Side and Polished Rear-Side 18 2. 1. 3 Texturing Chemistry................. 21 2. 1. 4 Spectrophotometer Reflectance Measurements... 22 2. 2 State of the Art In Industry................. 23 2. 2. 1 Texturing....................... 25 2. 2. 2 Polishing....................... 26 2. 3 Contribution......................... 27 2. 3. 1 Optimizing random pyramid texturing....... 27 2. 3. 2 Fingerprints...................... 31 2. 3. 3 Texturing and Polishing in One Solution...... 33 2. 4 Conclusion.......................... 43 3 advanced electron collector formation 45 3. 1 “Emitter” vs. “Collector”.................. 45 3. 2 Diffusion Theory....................... 47 3. 2. 1 Diffusivity and Fick’s Laws of Diffusion...... 48 3. 2. 2 Phosphorus Diffusion Using POCl 3........ 52 3. 2. 3 Phosphorus Implantation.............. 54 3. 3 State of the Art In Industry................. 58 3. 3. 1 POCl 3 In Industry.................. 58 3. 3. 2 Industrial Implantation Processes.......... 59 3. 4 Contribution......................... 61 3. 4. 1 Non Intentional Emitter Etch Back......... 61 3. 4. 2 Intentional Emitter Etch Back........... 65 3. 4. 3 POCl 3 Process Parameters............. 69 3. 4. 4 Diffusion Uniformity Improvements......... 72 3. 4. 5 Novel Implantation Process............. 76 3. 5 Conclusion.......................... 88 4 advanced passivation + contact formation 91 4. 1 Theory............................ 91 4. 1. 1 Recombination Basics................ 91 4. 1. 2 The Silicon Surface.................. 95 4. 1. 3 Measuring J 0 n+ by QSSPC............. 97 4. 1. 4 Contact Resistance................. 98 4. 1. 5 Transfer Length Method............... 100 4. 2 State of the Art In Industry................. 102 4. 2. 1 PECVD Silicon Nitride............... 102 4. 2. 2 Contacting Using Screen-Printed Silver...... 104 4. 3 Contribution (Oxidation Enhanced i-PERC)....... 107 4. 3. 1 Initial J 0 n+ and Lifetime Investigation....... 107 4. 3. 2 Varying Oxidation Time.............. 111 4. 3. 3 Pre-Oxidation POCl 3 Re-Optimization...... 117 4. 3. 4 Impact of Oxidation Temperature......... 122 4. 3. 5 Oxidation vs. N 2 anneal............... 127 4. 3. 6 Individual Front/Rear Thermal Oxide Enhancement 132 4. 3. 7 Altering Phosphorus Content in Thermal Oxide. 138 4. 3. 8 Ag Screen Printed Contact Characterization.... 147 4. 3. 9 Contact Stability and Reliability.......... 152 4. 4 Conclusion.......................... 157 5 summary and outlook 159 5. 1 Summary........................... 159 5. 2 Loss Analysis......................... 161 5. 3 Outlook............................ 165 5. 4 Last word........................... 167 appendix (confirmed cell efficiencies) 169 publications 171 bibliography 175 nrpages: 216 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Directed self {{assembly}} (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) {{has been}} considered a promising technology for nano-patterning. Since it {{was included in the}} 2009 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), efforts have been invested to explore the potential of this technique to reach the 16 nm half-pitch node and below. BCP can micro-phase separate and self-assemble into ordered structures with spatial periodicity and dimensions of about 5 - 50 nm. Some of the morphologies that have been observed in the bulk, and that are of specific interest for the lithographic industry, include lamellae, cylinders, and spheres. Additionally, {{it has been shown that}} BCP can be utilized to repair defects and improve line edge roughness and line width roughness present in the photo-resist pattern after the lithographic process. More recently, frequency multiplication of pre-patterns defined by conventional optical lithography has been demonstrated. Chemo-epitaxy, which consists on the generation of alternating stripes of well defined dimensions and composition to control the orientation of the BCP, has been applied for this purpose and has proved to be an effective method to obtain thermodynamically equilibrated, defect-free structures over large areas (several mm 2). Nonetheless, before this technology can be utilized for industrial applications, the defect performance of the self-assembly process must be investigated. Currently, reports of DSA on entire 300 mm wafers have focused only on defect counts. However, they lack the relation to material and processing parameters that reflect the changes in total free energy of the system and, therefore, to the probability of defect formation due to the assembly process. This detailed study requires the infrastructure of a process line, which is available at imec and conveys the following advantages: 1) use of entire wafers for in-line analysis, 2) clean room facilities and automated tools, and 3) absence of manual sample handling that may induce contamination. With this environment, controlled optimization of the process and, therefore, exploration of the origin of assembly defects, becomes possible. During the last year, the implementation of the chemo-epitaxy approach, developed by Liu and Nealey, on 300 mm wafers, was accomplished. High degree of perfection over a large number of conditions was achieved for two BCP systems with periodicities of 25 nm and 28 nm. This experimental set-up was further utilized to obtain the first insight into defect generation. Specifically, programmed defects were used to verify the healing capabilities of BCP to defects coming directly from the resist pre-patterns. Three types of defects in different sizes were used, and generated diverse responses from the BCP. With this study, it was shown that BCP can rectify minor photo-resist imperfections. In a latter phase, these programmed defects will be used to verify the capture rate achieved with the metrology set up (optical inspection). Finally, the BCP formulation through different batches was observed to impact defect formation and a detailed study of this variable has been proposed. During the rest of the present PhD project, the base DSA process that has been implemented at imec will be used to investigate additional parameters related to the substrate properties, materials, and process conditions. The use of metrology tools will provide statistical data of defect formation that may be related to the quality of the chemical patterns and the assembled domains, while the above-mentioned parameters are varied in a controlled manner. Ultimately, the goal is to establish the best conditions for defect minimization/annihilation. The projects that have been defined to date include:a) Analysis of the effect of boundary conditions in the formation of defects: Substrate geometry. The first step is to use the implemented method and vary the processing conditions that are directly related to the dimensions of the chemical pattern. Alternating stripes with chemical contrast comprise the chemically nano-patterned substrates. By controlling the exposure and etching steps, the total pitch and the width of the stripes can be finely tuned and the role of the geometric properties of the chemical pattern in defect formation can be assessed. b) Analysis of the effect of boundary conditions in the formation of defects: Substrate chemistry. The composition of the chemical patterns will determine the interaction conditions (difference in surface energy) of the BCP with the substrate. Additionally, for different multiplication factors, a specific composition of the substrate is required to minimize defect formation. Therefore, optimizing the chemistries for the two regions of the chemical pattern is a priority to establish the best conditions for the current DSA flow. Metrology set-up. The size of features used in this project (14 nm half-pitch) represents a challenge not only from the production side, but also the metrology has to be certified for this new application. In order to ensure that all defects present in the sample are captured, the capabilities of the current optical defect inspection, will be evaluated. The use of controls, such as programmed defects, will be useful for this purpose.

40|$|This thesis explores some {{open issues}} {{with respect to}} Statistical Process Monitoring (SPM) {{in order to improve}} its {{understanding}} and to contribute to the acceptance of SPM techniques in industry. The focus of the research is on batch processes, which require close process monitoring due to the high added value of batch products and the impossibility to measure the product quality during the process. More specifically, the following topics are covered: (i) the influence of measurement noise on batch-end quality prediction, (ii) discrimination between critical and non-critical process disturbances and (iii) the impact of process variability on SPM. A flexible simulation package RAYMOND is developed to allow the introduction of process variability in the simulated processes. Based on simulation data from an industrial fermentation process, several case studies are presented to analyze SPM techniques for batch process monitoring. Despite the influence of measurement noise on several aspects of batch-end quality prediction, Multi-way Partial Least Squares (MPLS) predictions are shown to outperform offline quality measurements, even at high noise levels. The impact of noise on the bias and variance of the MPLS predictor is analyzed and several criteria for model order selection are compared {{on the basis of the}} results. An adjusted Wold's R criterion is shown to be slightly preferable. Furthermore, the applicability to batch-end quality prediction of a well-known equation from spectroscopy for estimation of the MPLS prediction variance is critically evaluated. The variance estimator is shown to underestimate the prediction variance when more than one latent variable is included in the model. Next, a multi-model fault discrimination methodology is presented to distinguish critical from non-critical process disturbances. The method combines an MPLS model using all possible model inputs with a model only incorporating the variables that impact the batch-end product quality, selected via a crossvalidation procedure. While the first model detects both critical and non-critical process disturbances, the second model only raises an alarm when the fault influences the quality of the final product. Successful fault discrimination is also obtained using Multi-way Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). Finally, the impact of process variability on SPM is illustrated for both fault detection and batch-end quality prediction. For the selected case study, the presence of process variability results in improved detection of process disturbances and slight deterioration of quality predictions. The use of a process simulator that includes process variability is advised for the development, validation and comparison of SPM techniques.

This reduction of the device area will lead to cell planarization where the control gate no longer wraps the interpoly dielectric, causing an important loss of gate capacitance and an increment of the parasitic capacitance with neighboring cells. These problems may be solved by thinning down the interpoly dielectric, yielding to less parasitic coupling and larger gate capacity. However, {{in the near future}} it will not be possible to further thin down the dielectrics without compromising the retention of the memory devices, due to the exponential increase of the leakage currents when decreasing the thickness of the dielectrics. A solution to this problem can be to replace the actual dielectrics by high-k materials that will allow using physically thicker layers without diminishing the capacitances. However, normally the high-k materials present much larger densities of electrically active defects than the current SiO 2 -based dielectrics. These defects affect the retention, the threshold voltage stability, the endurance of the devices, etc. A deep understanding {{of the impact of the}} defects on the memory characteristics, their properties (density, location, charge) and their causes is thus crucial. This work presents a study of two high-k materials that could be used to replace the interpoly dielectric: Al 2 O 3 and HfAlO. First the impact of the fabrication conditions (thermal budget, PDA ambient, material precursor, composition) on the performance of floating gate devices is stated using standard figures of merit of the non-volatile memories, such as program and erase characteristics, retention and endurance. Physical analysis, simulations and other characterization techniques, such as the Stress I-V method, are presented as well, in order to obtain a more complete picture and relate the performance of the memories to the characteristics of the defects present in the layers. It is then concluded that, in order to further understand the impact of the defects on the memory characteristics, more elaborated defect-characterization techniques are needed. An evolved charge pumping technique, a new trap spectroscopy based on charging and sensing and the photo-depopulation technique are discussed in order to illustrate the state of the art in defect characterization. However, all these techniques present several problems such as very limited scanning range, or the need for complex structures in order to maximize its output. The author proposes a recently developed technique, together with a new physics model, to cope with the limitations of the other techniques and to help to further characterize the defects present in the high-k dielectrics. Using this new method, called two-pulse CV or 2 -PCV method, it is possible to obtain a more complete defect map than with the other techniques, since a wider area is scanned (in terms of distance in the dielectric as well as in energy range) using simple large area capacitors. The defect maps obtained from different crystalline-Al 2 O 3 layers show remarkable differences when the fabrication processes are modified. However, two sets of defects are always present: a uniform distribution of traps around 2 eV below the conduction band of the material, and deeper interfacial traps between the SiO 2 and the Al 2 O 3, around ~ 3 - 4 eV below the conduction band of the high-k material. The uniform defect distribution is attributed to the grain boundaries of the crystalline materials, rather than to oxygen or aluminum vacancies or impurities, in contrast with what is suggested in several publications. The deep interfacial defects, which are observed here for the first time, are attributed to impurities or intermixing of the Al 2 O 3 at the interface with the SiO 2 layer. These deep defects help to interpret several phenomena observed in the literature, which could not be easily explained so far. The study of the HfAlO reveals that the material is more affected than Al 2 O 3 by the fabrication processes, mainly the thermal budget, and by the composition of the material itself. The thermal budget can lead to total cell failure due to the large amount of defects created at the SiO 2 and gate interfaces, as revealed by the physical analysis, simulations and trap maps obtained with the 2 -PCV method. The conclusion is therefore that the newly proposed defect-characterization method (formed by the measurement mechanism and the physics model) is a strong tool in order to extract reliable information about the defects in dielectric layers and in order to make predictions about the material performance in memory devices.

40|$|The {{dissolved}} {{organic matter}} (DOM) is the term used for organic components of natural origin present in the soil solution. It is a complex mixture of molecules, generally dominated by humic substances. The DOM is a small fraction (< 1 %) of the soil organic matter (SOM), however DOM {{is supposed to be}} the most mobile and probably the most reactive fraction. Consequently, it plays an important role in the biogeochemistry of the elements it contains (C, N, P, S,) and the transport of heavy metals and organic pollutants with a high affinity for organic matter. Since biodegradation is mediated through the aqueous phase, DOM {{is supposed to be the}} most bioavailable organic matter pool. Understanding of organic matter cycling and of DOM-facilitated transport of solutes in mineral soils requires information about the origin and dynamics of DOM. The main goal of this research is to unravel the source and the dynamics of DOM in agricultural soils. No standard method exists to sample soil solution. Therefore dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and quality in soil is operationally defined. Effluents of undisturbed soil columns of an agricultural Luvisol contained significantly less DOC than corresponding soil centrifugates (10 versus 20 mg C l- 1). In contrast, inorganic solute concentrations did not vary between both sampling methods. The difference in DOC concentrations between both sampling methods did not depend on the water flow rate in the columns. Furthermore, the DOM in the centrifugates was less aromatic than the DOM in the leachates. All this suggests that the larger DOC concentration in centrifugates is unrelated to DOC concentration gradients in the pore matrix but that it is likely released from a fraction of the microbial biomass that is disrupted during centrifugation. Spectroscopic properties of DOM in the samples corroborate this suggestion. Hence, DOM in effluents of undisturbed soil columns is likely most representative of in situ soil DOM. The effect of varying soil properties and pre-treatments on the quantity and quality of DOC in the centrifuged soil solutions was investigated in an explorative study of 87 European agricultural soils. Soil solution DOC concentrations ranged between 12 and 104 mg C l- 1 (10 th - 90 th percentile), median 33 mg C l- 1. In freshly sampled agricultural soils, DOC was only weakly explained by soil properties whereas correlations were somewhat stronger in soils that had been equilibrated by incubation or cold storage before analysis. Overall, DOC concentrations weakly increased with increasing % soil organic carbon and decreased with increasing pH. The storage conditions affected DOC concentration and composition: rewetting dry soils released DOM with a low aromaticity that probably originated from decaying biomass rather than from humified organic matter. The source and dynamics of DOM in an agricultural soil after plant residue amendment were studied in a batch experiment. It revealed that residue applicationreleased a pulse of hydrophilic DOC that temporarily (< 3 days) dominated the soil DOM pool and the degradable organic matter. However, beyond that pulse the majority of DOM was derived from soil organic matter. The isotope signature of DOC differed from the isotope signature of microbial biomass C and respired C. This casts doubt that DOC measured in the soil solution represents the major bioavailable soil C pool. The source, dynamics and transport of DOM were subsequently studied in column experiments. First of all, the mechanisms of DOM release were investigated by leaching undisturbed soil columns and applying stop flows. Secondly, the sorption and mineralisation of DOM were examined by adding a 13 C labelled DOM pulse to the columns. The release of DOM during leaching was controlled by two different processes. The baseline concentration of DOC in soil solutions was buffered and was independent of the water flow rate. An additional amount of DOC can be released by desorption, diffusion from micro- to macropores or lysis of microbial cells. These processes are kinetically controlled and the additional DOC concentration hence depends on the water fluxes. In agreement with the batch experiments, largest DOC concentrations were found at flow initiation after soil drying. This low aromaticity DOM mainly originated from decaying biomass. A plant derived DOM solution was very quickly and almost completely mineralised during transport through the soil. The results of the laboratory experiments were linked with those of a field trial, to interpret monitoring data of DOM leaching in an arable field subjected to 4 different land management treatments, i. e. conventional tillage, reduced tillage, waste water irrigation and manure application. Leachates were collected at 45 cm depth by passive capillary wick samplers. Over 95 % of leachates collected during three successive years contained between 4 and 20 mg DOC l- 1 and on average 32 kg DOC ha- 1 y- 1 was leached. The most consistent findings of the laboratory experiments were also observed in the field. The export of DOC (kg DOC ha- 1 y- 1) was mainly determined by the water flux, while no correlation was found between the water flow and DOC concentrations. At high water velocities, soil solutions contained small DOC concentrations, while DOC concentrations in soil solutions flowing at low water velocities varied largely. A baseline DOC concentration independent of water flow rates was observed. The largest DOC concentrations however, were inversely proportional to the mean water velocity between succeeding samplings. This indicates that the release of additional DOM is kinetically controlled. Higher concentrations were mostly found in the first leachates collected after a dry period and those solutions mainly contained DOM with a low aromaticity. The effect of environmental conditions and land management practices on DOC concentration or its spectroscopic properties was rather small. A model consisting of twotypes of DOM in aseven pool concept (labile and stable SOM, labile and stable DOM, microbial biomass, plant residues and CO 2) summarised the most important findings and captured the general patterns in DOM dynamics rather well. Degradation reactions between the pools were described with first order kinetic reactions and the dynamic equilibrium between DOM and SOM pools was determined by a soil:solution distribution coefficient. The transport of DOM was described by the convection dispersion equation. It was found that soil solutions always contained a constant concentration of relatively stable, not easily degradable organic matter. The concentration of labile DOC was variable and depended on the water velocity, flow interruptions and the presence of plant residues. It can be concluded that soil solution DOM mainly originates from rather stable, more humified soil organic matter. This baseline DOM concentration is highly buffered and may depend on physicochemical soil properties. Flow interruptions or amending the soil with plant residues releases additional DOM. This extra DOM is very labile and quickly mineralised by the microbial biomass. Consequently, it will probably not reach deeper soil layers.

40|$|The {{fact that}} {{production}} of pome fruits is both season and location dependent calls for preservation methods {{to maintain the}} quality of the produce after harvest. The principal method to preserve pome fruit is postharvest storage in cool rooms under Controlled Atmosphere (CA) or Ultra Low Oxygen (ULO) conditions. These methods are based on empirical trials to determine optimum storage conditions for a specific cultivar in terms of temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration and relative humidity. Improved understanding of the underlying fruit physiology in relation to the gas and water exchange processes during storage will assist in improving postharvest quality and reducing the occurrence of storage disorders. Both experimental and modeling approaches have been followed to investigate the relationship between the gas concentration, gas diffusion, respiration and physiological disorders in apple and pear. Experimental approaches are, however, costly, tiresome and time consuming. Moreover, it is difficult to investigate the time course of the physiological disorders experimentally {{because of the lack of}} non-destructive techniques to measure the internal gas concentration in the fruit. Alternatively, mathematical models can be used to study gas and water exchange. They are usually based on the continuum hypothesis where the fruit is considered as a material with transport properties that are independent of the spatial scale. However, unlike the traditional engineering materials fruit tissue has a complex fine structure. The cellular architecture is believed to determine to a large extent the biophysical processes in the fruit. The continuum hypothesis does not hold in this case and a multiscale approach is required in which the model parameters of the model that operates at the macroscale  the scale of interest  are obtained from simulations with a microscale model that incorporates the actual microstructure of the fruit. For the latter, microscale geometric models of the fruit are required. Pome fruit tissue microscale geometry generators exist today but are based on digitized 2 D or 3 D images of the cellular architecture. Therefore, although these algorithms generate representative geometries of the tissues, they require experimental input in terms of microscopic images. These approaches need complex image acquisition procedures and expensive infrastructures such as synchrotron radiation sources. Also, they do not allow to parameterize the microscale geometry to, for example, investigate the effect of cell size or shape on the transport properties in a systematic way. The main objective of this dissertation was to develop virtual microscale fruit tissue generators (algorithms) that generate statistically and spatially equivalent virtual tissue microstructures resolving the cell symplast, cell wall and intercellular air spaces in both 2 D and 3 D and interface them to finite element and/or finite volume codes. To achieve this, we have developed virtual tissue generators that are based on cell growth modeling bytaking into account cell biomechanics. The generators are initiated from a random Voronoi tessellation and growth biomechanics is applied to the tessellation which results in a virtual tissue that has equivalent geometrical properties as that of real tissues obtained from microscopic or synchrotron microtomography images. In a further extension we have also developed a cell division algorithm which is based on cell biomechanics and that is capable of mimicking both symmetric cell division and asymmetric cell division with different degree of anisotropic growth. The cell division algorithm can be used instead of the Voronoi tessellation as an input for the expansive growth models. Initial tessellations obtained from the cell division algorithm will have more realistic representation of the cells than the Voronoi tessellations. The geometric models can be used to carry out in silico simulations to determine transport properties to be used in multiscale framework of gas and moisture exchange studies in pome fruits. This approach helps to include more geometrical details and fewer assumptions than the classical continuum modeling approach, while requiring less computer time compared to solving governing model equations at the resolution of the microscale.

40|$|The {{interest}} in using natural fibres in composite materials has greatly {{increased over the}} past decades thanks to their good mechanical properties in combination with environment-friendly characteristics. In this research, Vietnamese coir fibres are studied and modified for use in composite materials. To be efficiently used in composite materials, the microstructure and the mechanical properties of coir fibres are first characterised. Secondly, the surface of natural fibres has a complex morphology with chemical heterogeneity and relatively high roughness, which strongly influences the fibre-matrix interfacial adhesion. Therefore, {{it is important to}} acquire a systematic understanding of the fibre-matrix interfacial interactions in composites. Lastly, unidirectional (UD) composites of coir fibre in both thermoplastic and thermoset matrices are examined to evaluate the possible value of coir fibre for composites. The microstructure of technical coir fibres is examined using SEM and SEM-CT. The results show that technical coir fibres comprise plenty of elementary fibres and a lacuna at the centre. The elementary fibre is built up by two main cell walls which consist of bundles of microfibrils aligned in a high angle to the fibre axis. Coir fibre appears to have high porosity at 22 to 30 %. The mechanical properties of coir fibre are determined in tensile tests including single fibre tensile testing with optical strain mapping and single fibre tensile testing using different test lengths. The results of both methods indicate that coir fibres are not very strong and stiff, but have high strain to failure. An integrated physical-chemical-micromechanical approach is implemented to investigate the fibre-matrix interfacial compatibility and adhesion of the coir fibre composites. In this study, the interface between untreated and alkali treated coir fibres and various thermoplastics is characterised. The differences of fibre surface chemistry and properties of the matrices in terms of surface energy and potential chemical reactions are considered. Wetting measurements of the fibres and the matrices are carried out to obtain their static equilibrium contact angles in various liquids, and these are used to estimate the surface energies comprising of different components. The work of adhesion is calculated for each composite system, accordingly. Also, fibre surface chemistry is examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to have more information about functional groups at the fibre surface, which assists in {{a deeper understanding of the}} interactions at the composite interfaces. To determine the quality of the composite interfaces, single fibre pull-out tests and transverse three point bending tests are performed on UD composites to measure interfacial shear strength and interfacial strength (mode I) respectively. The results suggest that the higher interfacial adhesion of coir fibres with polyvinylidene fluoride compared with polypropylene can be attributed to higher fibre-matrix physico-chemical interaction corresponding with the work of adhesion. Whilst the improvement of interfacial adhesion for coir fibres with maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene compared with polypropylene can probably be attributed to a chemical adhesion mechanism. In addition to the specific results for coir fibre composites, the integrated physical-chemical-micromechanical approach to investigate and improve fibre-matrix interface has been developed. This knowledge can be applied to study the interface of other natural fibre composite systems. Mechanical properties of UD coir fibre composites with both thermoplastic and thermoset matrices are assessed by tensile tests in fibre direction, flexural tests and unnotched Izod impact tests. In agreement with the interface evaluation, higher flexural strength and stiffness are found in the alkali treated fibre composites, probably thanks to the better interfacial adhesion. The impact strength of coir polypropylene composite is not significantly different from that of neat polymer, while the coir fibres can improve the toughness of epoxy by minimum a factor of three, when the impact strength is considered as toughness indicator. An initial study on coir-bamboo fibre hybrid composites is carried out to investigate the hybrid effect of tough coir fibre and brittle bamboo fibre in composites. With a low bamboo fibre fraction, a hybrid effect with an increase of composite strain to failure is obtained, which can be attributed to the high strain to failure of the coir fibres. Meanwhile, the bamboo fibres provide high stiffness and strength to the composites. The results show a potential for coir-bamboo hybrid composites, which justifies further study on this topic.
