50|$|Latanoprost (<b>Xalatan),</b> a prostaglandin, may {{significantly}} reduce IOP (intraocular pressure) {{in patients with}} glaucoma associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome. Latanoprost is commercially formulated as an aqueous solution in a concentration of 0.005% preserved with 0.02% benzalkonium chloride (BAC). The recommended dosage of latanoprost is one drop daily in the evening, which permits better diurnal IOP control than does morning instillation. Its effect is independent of race, gender or age, and it has few to no side effects. Contraindications include a history of CME, epiretinal membrane formation, vitreous loss during cataract surgery, history of macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion, history of anterior uveitis, and diabetes mellitus. It is also wise to advise patients that unilateral treatment can result in heterochromia or hypertrichosis that may become cosmetically objectionable.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and tolerability of <b>Xalatan</b> &#x 00 AE; with generic latanoprost (Latoprost) {{in subjects with}} primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OH). Materials and Methods: This was a single-center, randomized, open label, crossover, two period comparative study. At the baseline visit, subjects were randomized to two groups. Group A received <b>Xalatan</b> &#x 00 AE; for weeks 1 - 12 followed by Latoprost for weeks 13 - 24. Group B received Latoprost for weeks 1 - 12 followed by <b>Xalatan</b> &#x 00 AE; for weeks 13 - 24. Results: 30 subjects were recruited, 12 in Group A and 18 in Group B. In subjects administered <b>Xalatan</b> &#x 00 AE;, intraocular pressure (IOP) showed a greater decrease (P &# 60; 0. 001) from 23. 64 &#x 00 B 1; 3. 13 mmHg at baseline to 14. 29 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 61 mmHg at week 12 (fall of 9. 35 &#x 00 B 1; 3. 55 mmHg, 38. 66 &#x 0025; &#x 00 B 1; 10. 29) than that seen in the Latoprost group (22. 74 &#x 00 B 1; 2. 47 mmHg to 16. 98 &#x 00 B 1; 2. 49 mmHg, fall of 5. 76 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 41 mmHg; 25. 42 &#x 0025; &#x 00 B 1; 5. 98). In period 2 when subjects were crossed over to <b>Xalatan</b> &#x 00 AE; from Latoprost, there was a further fall from 16. 98 &#x 00 B 1; 2. 49 mmHg to 16. 09 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 49 at week 24 (fall of 0. 89 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 59 mmHg; 4. 3 &#x 0025; &#x 00 B 1; 8. 76).

Our {{aim is to}} evaluate the {{toxicity of}} antiglaucoma medications to CECs using an in vitro toxicity assay. Methods: Primary cultures of human (H) CECs derived from eye bank specimens were established. Following exposure of HCECs to test solutions for 10, 30, or 60 minutes, or 48 hours, we measured cell viability using a WST- 1 assay. Test solutions were diluted in culture media and included 0. 5 % Timoptol&reg;, preservative-free 0. 5 % timolol maleate, 1 % Trusopt&reg;, preservative-free 1 % dorzolamide, Travatan&reg;, Travatan Z&reg;, Xalatan&reg;, and benzalkonium chloride (BAK). To assess cell viability, {{the value of the}} test culture well after treatment was expressed as a percentage of that of the control well. Toxicity of each solution was compared using the cell viability score (CVS). Results: After exposure to 10 -fold dilutions of test solutions for 48 hours, HCEC viabilities were 48. 5 % for 0. 5 % Timoptol, 80. 9 % for preservative-free 0. 5 % timolol maleate, 47. 0 % for 1 % Trusopt, 71. 7 % for preservative-free 1 % dorzolamide, 55. 5 % for Travatan, 88. 5 % for Travatan Z, and 52. 5 % for <b>Xalatan.</b> Exposure to test solutions diluted 100 -fold or more resulted in HCEC viabilities &gt; 80 %, with the exception of preservative-free 1 % dorzolamide, which resulted in a viability of 72. 0 % at a dilution of 100 -fold. Based on CVS, the order of cell viability was Travatan Z&nbsp;&ge; preservative-free timolol maleate = preservative-free dorzolamide &gt; 0. 5 % Timoptol = 1 % Trusopt &gt; Travatan&nbsp;&ge; <b>Xalatan.</b> Assessment of the combined effect of drug and BAK revealed that latanoprost reduced the toxicity of BAK. Conclusion: Antiglaucoma eye drops produced HCEC toxicity that appeared to depend on the presence of BAK.

Conclusion Bimatoprost 0. 03 % had the lowest monthly and annual costs and the greatest cost effectiveness for lowering IOP compared with latanoprost 0. 005 % and travoprost 0. 004 %. </p...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To compare {{efficacy}} (intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction) {{and safety}} of preservative-free latanoprost (T 2345) to benzalkonium chloride (BAK) -preserved latanoprost (BPL; <b>Xalatan)</b> in ocular hypertension (OHT) or primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. METHODS: Prospective, international, multicentre, randomised, investigator-masked, parallel-group trial. After a wash-out period, POAG or OHT patients, previously managed by BPL monotherapy, randomly received T 2345 or BPL (one drop into the affected eye(s)) once daily from D 0 to D 84. Change in IOP was measured at 09 : 00 (± 1 h) from D 0 to D 84 in the worse eye. RESULTS: Mean IOP reduction (D 0 -D 84) was - 8. 6 ± 2. 6 mm Hg (- 36 %) on T 2345 and - 9. 0 ± 2. 4 mm Hg (- 38 %) on BPL, confirming non-inferiority of T 2345 to BPL. Non-inferiority of T 2345 was observed from D 15. The most frequent ocular adverse event, drug intolerance, was reported in 1 (0. 5 %) patient on T 2345 versus 4 (2. 1 %) patients on BPL. Moderate to severe conjunctival hyperaemia was less frequent on T 2345 than on BPL at D 42 (20. 2 % vs 30. 6 %; p= 0. 003) and D 84 (21. 4 % vs 29. 1 %; p= 0. 02). Upon instillation, the global subjective ocular symptom score was significantly lower on T 2345 than BPL on D 42 (0. 15 vs 0. 41; p= 0. 001) and D 84 (0. 18 vs 0. 46; p= 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Preservative-free latanoprost has the same efficacy as BPL, with improved local tolerance. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Assessment of the {{effectiveness}} of low-frequency magnetic therapy on the dynamics of intraocular pressure in the treatment of primary and uncompensated medical means of open-angle glaucoma. Patients and Methods. 46 patients with uncompensated open-angle glaucoma. The first group: 24 patients (42 eyes) with open-angle glaucoma (I, II, III stages during 2 – 13 years). The second group: 22 patients (22 eyes) with newly diagnosed elevated intraocular pressure in one eye. The age of patients ranged from 43 to 59 years. Treatment included antiglaucoma hypotensive eye drops and TRANS-orbital magnetic stimulation on the domestic device “Polus- 2 ”. Results. Intraocular pressure before treatment ranged from 25 to 32 mm Hg. (average of 28. 9 ± 1. 4 mm Hg.) in the first group. After magnetic stimulation IOP decreased within 2 – 5 days in all patients to 18 to 21 mm Hg (average of 17. 9 ± 1. 1 mm Hg), reaching values “pressure goal. ” Second group: in the primary treatment in patients IOP was 28 – 39 mm Hg (average of 32. 6 ± 1. 8 mm Hg) on one of the eyes. IOP decreased to 16 – 21 mm Hg in the period from 3 to 9 days in all patients of study group after daily magnetic stimulation and instillation of <b>xalatan</b> and timolol. In the control subgroup of patients with uncompensated openangle glaucoma lowering of the IOP to “pressure goal,” noted only in 7 patients (70, 0 %) 11 – 14 days after instillation of anti-hypertensive glaucoma eye drops only. Conclusion. Low-frequency TRANS-orbital magnetic stimulation in enhanced hypotensive effect antiglaucomatous eye drops and makes it easier to achieve compensation of IOP to values “pressure goals” in patients with uncompensated open-angle glaucoma. The marked dependence of the efficiency of reduction of IOP from biotropic parameters of the magnetic field. The pulsed mode with a higher amplitude value of the magnetic induction has a more pronounced effect and makes it easier to achieve the reduction of IOP...|$|E
