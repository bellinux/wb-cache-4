40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in two parts. In the first part, two assumptions presented in Janet Helms' White Racial Identity (WRI) development model (1990) were tested. First, Helms theorized that one's stage of WRI development is positively related to increased cognitive complexity achievement and suggests that later stages require greater complexity. A second assumption of Helms' theory was that continued interracial contact is essential for advancement in WRI stage development. Part one of this study examined the relationship of cognitive complexity and interracial contact (both formal and informal) to WRI, and the relationship between cognitive complexity and interracial contact as they relate to WRI. Part two of this study consisted of a factor analysis of Helms' WRI measure followed by a second set of analyses examining the relationship between the new obtained factors with contact and cognitive complexity. This analysis allowed a comparison to be made between Helms' 5 WRI stages and the obtained factor solution from the factor analysis. It also allowed a comparison {{of the relationship between the}} stages and cognitive complexity and contact and the obtained factor solution and these same variables. Three hundred and sixty eight White undergraduates completed Helms' White Racial Identity Attitude Scale, a 4 x 6 Repertory Grid, measuring cognitive complexity in social settings, and an interracial contact measure, including a measure of both formal and informal types of contact. Results of part one of the analyses indicated that neither cognitive complexity nor cognitive complexity <b>x</b> <b>contact</b> were significantly related to WRI scores. However, contact was significantly related to WRI scores. WRI stage two was positively related and WRI stage four was negatively related to scores on formal contact. Stage 4 was negatively related and stages 2 and 3 were positively related to scores on informal contact. The results of part two indicated again that neither cognitive complexity nor cognitive complexity <b>x</b> <b>contact</b> were significantly related to the obtained WRI factors. However, contact once again was significant. The factor analysis produced a 5 factor solution that while similar in theme and number to the 5 stages, nonetheless indicated a different relationship with contact scores than the stages did. Factor 3 (representing stage 4) was positively related and factor 4 (representing stages 2 and 3) was negatively related to formal contact scores. However, factor 3 (representing stage 4) was positively related and factor 4 (representing stages 2 and 3) were negatively related to scores on informal contact. There were discrepancies across the two parts of the study as to the stages and direction of the relationships between interracial contact (formal and informal) and WRI scores. Some of these results were in opposite directions than either the theory or study expected. These discrepancies are dealt with in chapter 5.

Transmission line method devices with and without the contact TiO 2 interfacial layer on the same MoS 2 flake demonstrate reduced (24 <b>x)</b> <b>contact</b> resistance (RC) {{in the presence of}} TiO 2. The insertion of TiO 2 at the source-drain contact interface results in significant improvement in the on-current and field effect mobility (up to 10 x). The reduction in RC and FB has been explained through interfacial doping of MoS 2 and validated by first-principles calculations, which indicate metallic behavior of the TiO 2 -MoS 2 interface. Consistent with DFT results of interfacial doping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data also exhibit a 0. 5 eV shift toward higher binding energies for Mo 3 d and S 2 p peaks in the presence of TiO 2, indicating Fermi level movement toward the conduction band (n-type doping). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) further corroborates the interfacial doping model, as MoS 2 flakes capped with ultrathin TiO 2 exhibit a reduction of 0. 3 eV in the effective work function. Finally, a systematic comparison of the impact of selective doping with the TiO 2 layer under the source-drain metal relative to that on top of the MoS 2 channel shows a larger benefit for transistor performance from the reduction in source-drain contact resistance...|$|E

40|$|Drinking water {{disinfection}} techniques without the dosage of chemicals {{are regarded as}} more advantageous in terms of costs and practical use. Here we investigated the efficacy of electrochemical disinfection for inactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores – a model microorganism of highly resistant pathogens. The effect of electrochemical disinfection with TinO 2 n− 1 ceramic electrodes which generate active chlorine from chloride in situ, was compared to the traditional chlorination in which active chlorine was produced from addition of sodium hypochlorite. Research was performed in a batch scale with a synthetic buffered drinking water containing 35. 5 mg/l of chloride ions. Spore viability was analysed with both cultivation and cell potential for dividing (direct viable count method). The results showed that at the similar residual disinfectant concentrations <b>x</b> <b>contact</b> time (CT value) electrochemical disinfection was {{more than three times}} more effective to neutralize both cultivable and able to divide B. subtilis spores than traditional chlorination. Like in chlorination, electrochemical disinfection showed to be water-pH dependent and the lowest CT value of 112 mg/l min− 1 (2 -log removal) was obtained at pH 6. The lowest efficiency for both techniques was observed at pH 8. In conclusion, electrochemical disinfection is a viable in situ method even at low level of chlorides in drinking water and appears to be more effective than simple chlorination with the addition of the active chlorine species when highly resistant microbial forms are analysed, however, to apply the technology on a wide scale additional studies on potential formation of disinfection by-products must be performed. ...|$|E

Gilts (n= 120) from the R-LS line of the gene pool herd at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln were, within litter, assigned randomly to two frequencies of BE (1 x versus 2 x per day) and two types of BE (PBE versus FBE) plus one additional treatment where gilts were maintained in continuous fence-line contact with boars (CFBE). Treatments were initiated when gilts in each replicate reached 160 days of age. Duration of BE for 1 x and 2 x BE was 10 minutes per exposure. Two sets of three White Line boars (10 months of age at start) were used to stimulate the gilts. Gilts were maintained in groups of eight per pen and {{were taken to the}} boar room for stimulation. Physical boar exposure induced a more rapid and more synchronous first estrous response than FBE. The average interval to first estrus after initial BE was shorter (20. 2 versus 29. 7 days, P 3 ̆c. 01) and age at puberty occurred 8. 8 days earlier (P 3 ̆c. 02) in PBE than FBE gilts. Interval to first estrus tended to be shorter in gilts receiving 2 x versus 1 <b>x</b> <b>contact</b> with boars (21. 5 versus 28. 4 days, P 3 ̆c. 08). Puberty also tended to occur earlier in gilts receiving 2 x versus 1 x BE (182. 8 versus 191. 1 days, P 3 ̆c. 06). Interval to estrus and age at puberty in gilts subjected to CFBE did not differ from the other FBE treatments but were increased compared to gilts receiving PBE. Physical BE is required to achieve maximal pubertal response to boar exposure. Added frequency of BE (2 x versus 1 x per day) tended to decrease pubertal age overall, but it appears the greatest effect of increasing the frequency of boar exposure occurs when gilts are being stimulated with FBE...|$|E

These isostructural compounds crystallize in the monoclinic space group C 2 /c with, at 150 K, a = 17. 0515 (7) Å, b = 5. 5560 (2) Å, c = 10. 4254 (5) Å, β = 115. 400 (2) °, and V = 892. 21 (7) Å 3 for X = Cl and a = 17. 3457 (8) Å, b = 5. 6766 (3) Å, c = 10. 6979 (5) Å, β = 115. 593 (2) °, and V = 950. 01 (8) Å 3 for X = Br. Their crystal structure is characterized by one-dimensional chains of Cu 2 + ions linked through bidentate pyzO ligands. These chains are joined together through OH···O hydrogen bonds between the water ligands and pyzO oxygen atoms and Cu-X⋯X-Cu contacts. Bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements at ambient pressure show a broad maximum at 7 (Cl) and 28 K (Br) that is indicative of short-range magnetic correlations. The dominant spin exchange is the Cu-X···X-Cu supersuperexchange because the magnetic orbital of the Cu 2 + ion is contained in the CuX 2 (H 2 O) 2 plane and the X··· <b>X</b> <b>contact</b> distances are short. The magnetic data were fitted to a Heisenberg 1 D uniform antiferromagnetic chain model with J 1 D/k B = - 11. 1 (1) (Cl) and - 45. 9 (1) K (Br). Magnetization saturates at fields of 16. 1 (3) (Cl) and 66. 7 (5) T (Br), from which J 1 D is determined to be - 11. 5 (2) (Cl) and - 46. 4 (5) K (Br). For the Br analog the pressure dependence of the magnetic susceptibility indicates a gradual increase in the magnitude of J 1 D/k B up to - 51. 2 K at 0. 84 GPa, suggesting a shortening of the Br···Br contact distance under pressure. At higher pressure X-ray powder diffraction data indicates a structural phase transition at ∼ 3. 5 GPa. Muon-spin relaxation measurements indicate that CuCl 2 (pyzO) (H 2 O) 2 is magnetically ordered with T N = 1. 06 (1) K, while the signature for long-range magnetic order in CuBr 2 (pyzO) (H 2 O) 2 was much less definitive down to 0. 26 K.

The decrease o f ball speed during the sim ulated m atches tended to be greater with high-than with low-stiffness string (P-. 06). H ence, playing tennis with high-stiffness string prom otes forearm m uscle fatigue developm ent, w hich could partly contribute to the groundstroke ball speed decrem ent during the game. Keywords: sport engineering, electrom yography, gripping force, im pact, racquet C om posite m aterials have allowed racquet engineers to design tennis racquet fram es by considering the physics o f the sw ing, w ithout being lim ited by the structural lim itations o f wood. C on­ sequently, m odern racquets are generally stiffer, lighter, and have a low er sw ing w eight (ie, m om ent o f inertia) than old wood racquets. 1 These structural modifications have therefore prom oted a change in playing style from one based on the correct execution o f the tech­ nique to one characterized by power and spin. 2 Indeed, although sw ing speed does not significantly vary as a function o f racquet m ass, it is significantly increased when sw ing w eight decreases. 1 Thus, modern racquets allow the players to swing the racquet faster. 3 This contributes to the faster pace o f m odern tennis, together with the im proved fitness o f tennis players, and larger racquet heads that allow players {{to hit the ball}} faster, w hile still m aintaining a good ball co n tro l. 1 M oreover, despite being lighter, com posite fram es are stiffer than traditional frames. A s a result, stiff fram es allow a reduction o f the ball energy consum ed in bending the racquet, thereby im proving hitting power. 4 T he com bination o f the increased fram e stiffness and sw ing speed has led to increased im pact forces, 2 w hich have to be resisted for by the action o f the upper lim b m uscles. In that context, em pha­ sis has been put on the contribution o f the string properties to the reduction o f im pact forces. 2 Indeed, the m ain purpose o f the string is to absorb the kinetic energy from the relative ball-racquet velocity, Jean Bernard Fabre is with CNRS, ISM UMR 7287, Aix-Marseille Univer­ sity, Marseille, France, and with the Research Department, ESP-Consulting, Aix-en-Provence, France.

For a sam e m om entum variation (ie, mass x speed variation o f the ball-racquet system), if the friction betw een the ball and the stringbed during the collision is neglected, the im pulse o f the ball in the stringbed (ie, im pact force <b>x</b> <b>contact</b> time) does not change, w hatever the string properties. However, it is generally accepted that a string with a low stiffness bends m ore than one w ith high stiffness during the collision, thereby increasing the contact tim e and thus lim iting the im pact forces transm itted from the racquet to the player. 5 The impact forces destabilize the racquet, w hich m ainly tend to recoil, thereby generating a high torque at the wrist joint. This phenom enon is also influenced by the location o f ball im pacts: 3 the racquet rotation within the hand is increased for off-center im pacts (below or above the longitudinal axis o f the racquet, for exam ple). 6 Therefore, a high gripping force is required to prevent excessive rotation o f the racquet at im pact. 6 - 9 However, it is widely accepted that the repetition ot high force gripping contractions generates m uscle fatigue, w hich reduces maximal gripping force. 10 The use o f high-stiffness string, w hich translates into increased im pact forces, could thus result in the increase o f the required gripping strength, thereby prom oting fatigue developm ent. T he tension o f the string may also affect the intensity o f im pacts. Low ering tension would have the sam e effect that low-stiffness string; that is, the slightly longer contact time would translate into a higher outgoing ball speed, as long as the deform ation o f the string is perpendicular to the string plane, and a low er im pact force. However, when the strings begin to m ove w ithin the string plane, rubbing against each other, som e elastic energy is lost. 3 M oreover, playing with a low string tension also translates into reduced control o f the ball. 3 Thus it does not seem recom m endable to play with a low string tension. In that context, players may be prone to choose high-stiffness string, w hich allow s a better control o f the ball trajectory.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{invention}} of the transistor, aggressive channel length scaling has been pursued to achieve higher performance and greater packing density. In order to preserve gate control at short channel lengths, the transistor channel has evolved from bulk to low dimensional substrates, such as 2 D thin films and 1 D nanowires. For scaling to continue, it is vital that we understand the processing and physics of low dimensional materials. Chapter 2 focuses on quasi- 2 D ultrathin body InAsSb-on-insulator n-FETs. III-V materials offer high mobilities for excellent on-state currents, and by using a thin film platform we could potentially obtain good off-state characteristics. Previously we have demonstrated high performance InAs-on-insulator n-FETs. In this study we implement InAsSb transistors on SiO 2 and achieve a ~ 2 x enhancement in effective mobility over analogous InAs devices. Top-gated devices are demonstrated with an I ON /I OFF of 10 2 - 10 3 and an intrinsic conductance of ~ 0. 56 mS/μm. 1 D InAs nanowire (NW) n-FETs are explored in chapter 3. In particular, the nanowire transistors are used to study ballistic transport, the theoretical current density upper limit. We experimentally observe ~ 60 nm channel length devices reaching ~ 80 % of the ballistic limit. Length dependent studies on the same nanowire are used to extract a mean free path of ~ 150 nm for the 1 st and 2 nd electron subbands. We find the mean free path to be independent of temperature, suggesting that surface roughness scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism. Chapter 4 explores 2 D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) thin films. TMDC thin films offer the physical limit of scaling, and ohmic contacts to its conduction and valence bands are required for it to realize low power complementary logic. Previous studies show that elemental metal energy levels are pinned near the conduction band of TMDCs and do not offer effective hole injection. To address this we explore a high work function transition metal oxide, substoichiometric molybdenum trioxide (MoO x, x 2 and WSe 2. MoS 2 diodes and p-FETs are demonstrated with MoO <b>x</b> <b>contacts.</b> WSe 2 p-FETs with MoO <b>x</b> <b>contacts</b> show a ~ 10 x on-current improvement over devices with Pd contacts. In chapter 5 we present heterojunction diodes formed by thin films of InAs and WSe 2. In traditional epitaxial heterojunctions, the number of possible material combinations are limited by lattice constraints. In this study we overcome this restraint by transferring one layer upon another to form a heterojunction. Specifically, InAs/WSe 2 heterojunction diodes are fabricated and measured. A forward/reverse current ratio > 10 6, reverse bias current - 12 μm 2, and ideality factor of 1. 1 are observed...|$|R

40|$|We study {{constructions of}} contact forms on closed manifolds. A notion of strong {{symplectic}} fold structure is defined and we prove {{that there is}} a contact form on M X provided that M admits such a structure and <b>X</b> is <b>contact.</b> This result is extended to fibrations satisfying certain natural conditions. Some examples and applications are given. Comment: 23 pages, 3 figures. It is a new and rewritten version of previously submitted article. Some errors were corrected and some proofs were simplified.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to study the k-almost Ricci soliton and k-almost {{gradient}} Ricci soliton on contact metric manifold. First, we prove that if a compact K-contact metric is a k-almost gradient Ricci soliton then it is isometric to a unit sphere S 2 n+ 1. Next, we extend this result on a compact k-almost Ricci soliton when the flow vector field <b>X</b> is <b>contact.</b> Finally, we study some special types of k-almost Ricci soliton where the potential vector field X is point wise collinear with the Reeb vector field ξ of the contact metric structure...|$|R
3000|$|... 1 For simplicity, the {{diffusion}} process assumes that a node participates in spreading information in one window of time, and then never tries to spread it again. This assumption {{is shared by}} independent cascade models (Goldenberg et al. 2001 a,b). While the results are starkest under this assumption, they continue to hold under a weaker assumption. Even if a node is presented {{with the opportunity to}} share information with a randomly chosen set of <b>x</b> of her <b>contacts</b> in one timestep, and then with an independently drawn set of <b>x</b> of her <b>contacts</b> in the next timestep, and so on over time, the comparisons below will still hold. This modification would dramatically speed {{the diffusion}} process, but the comparison between networks with weak ties present and those with weak ties absent would still hold: constrained opportunities admit the possibility that weak ties will impede the process.|$|R
50|$|Simplifying, ANDNA {{works as}} follows: {{to resolve a}} {{symbolic}} name the host applies a function Hash on behalf. The Hash function returns an address that the host contacts asking for the resolution generated by the hash. The contacted node receives a request, searches in its ANDNA database for the address associated with the name {{and returns to the}} applicant host. Recording is in a similar way. For example, let's suppose that the node X should record the address FreakNet.andna, X calculates the hash name and obtains the address 11.22.33.44 associated with node Y. The node <b>X</b> <b>contacts</b> Y requiring registration for 11.22.33.44 hash as its own. Y stores the request in its database and any request for resolution of 11.22.33.44 hash, will answer with the X address.The protocol is obviously more complex as the system provides a public/private key to authenticate the hosts and prevent unauthorized changes to ANDNA database. Furthermore, the protocol provides redundancy database to make the protocol resistant to any failures and also provides for the migration of the database if the network topology changes. The protocol does not provide for the possibility of revoking a symbolic name, this after a certain period of inactivity (currently 3 days) is simply deleted from the database. The protocol also prevents a single host to record an excessive number of symbolic names (at present 256 names) in order to prevent spammers to store a high number of terms commonly used or to perform actions of cybersquatting.|$|R

The Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) flight operations team at the NASA/Goddard Spacecraft Flight Center developed in-house scripts and procedures to automate monitoring of critical spacecraft functions. The initial staffing profile of 16 x 7 was reduced first to 8 x 5 and then to 'lights out'. Operations functions became an offline review of system performance and the generation of future science plans for subsequent upload to the spacecraft.

While Cage is initially against his joining, Professor <b>X</b> telepathically <b>contacts</b> Luke and asks him to reconsider, believing he has a chance at redemption despite what he previously told Cain.
