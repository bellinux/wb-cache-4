All regular Grand Livina models have 1.5-liter motor, while buyers of the 7-seater <b>X-Gear</b> could choose the 1.5 or 1.8-liter MR18DE. The 1.5-liter HR15DE now employs dual {{injectors}} & dual {{variable valve timing}} control (VTC) matched to 5 speed manual or automatic Xtronic CVT. The 1.8-liter engine retained the 6 speed manual or regular 4 speed automatic. Full body kits are only installed on the Highway Star. In March 2014, Nissan Indonesia decided to end the production of Grand Livina <b>X-Gear</b> with 1.8-liter motor, citing lack of demand as its reason.|$|E
