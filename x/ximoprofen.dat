40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>ximoprofen</b> {{were studied}} in young and elderly subjects after single and repeated doses up to 30 mg. In healthy elderly subjects (30 mg dose), a mean peak plasma drug concentration of 1. 78 micrograms ml- 1 +/- 0. 83 s. d. {{occurred at a}} mean time of 1. 95 h +/- 1. 40 s. d. and, thereafter, concentrations declined monoexponentially with a mean half-life of 3. 8 h +/- 1. 4 s. d. Comparison of these data with those from younger healthy subjects showed that peak drug concentrations, areas under the curve and half-lives were about two-fold greater in the elderly, these differences probably reflecting a lower systemic drug clearance. Similar results were obtained on comparing data from young healthy subjects and elderly rheumatic patients receiving single and repeated doses of <b>ximoprofen</b> (15 mg twice daily). In patients, the half-life of <b>ximoprofen</b> was 2. 5 h +/- 0. 7 s. d. Within either group, pharmacokinetic parameters after single or repeated doses were similar: <b>ximoprofen</b> did not accumulate in the plasma of the young or elderly...|$|E
40|$|The four {{stereoisomers}} of {{the parent}} keto acid of the oximino drug <b>ximoprofen</b> have been prepared in high enantiomeric purity. The stereochemistry in the propionic acid chain was established by the combination of Sharpless epoxidation followed by stereoselective hydrogenolysis of the benzylic carbon-oxygen bond with inversion of configuration. The stereochemistry of the centre in the cyclohexanone ring was controlled by the stereoselective conjugate addition of the arylpropanoic acid moiety to the enantiomers of (5 -(trimethylsilyl) - 2 -cyclohexenone with subsequent removal of the trimethylsilyl group. The pharmacological activity {{of each of the}} four isomers of the keto acid parent of <b>ximoprofen</b> were assessed by their in vitro inhibition of human platelet cyclo-oxygenase. As expected, the (S) configuration of the propionic acid chain was essential for activity but it was also found that the stereochemistry in the cyclohexanone moiety was important. Attempts to separate the (E) and (Z) isomers of the oxime derivative from one of the stereoisomers were unsuccessful. David P. G. Hamon, Peter J. Hayball, Ralph A. Massy-Westropp, Josephine L.
