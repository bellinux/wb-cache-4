5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created by}} Rembrandt in 1637. It was not given an official title. The current one is the most recent, widely accepted one. Prior and alternate names include Portrait of a Slav Prince, Portrait d'un Turc, and Man in Russian Costume. Its authenticity was supported by {{an analysis of the}} panel's wood, which showed that it was cut from a tree felled around 1635 that was also used in the painter's River Landscape with Ruins (1650). The painting underwent restoration in 1985 and has been <b>X-rayed.</b>|$|E

Upon check-in, all three men were selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) for further screening of their checked baggage. As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Thomas Edison began {{investigating}} materials for ability to fluoresce when <b>X-rayed,</b> {{and by the}} turn of the century he had invented a fluoroscope with sufficient image intensity to be commercialized. Edison had quickly discovered that calcium tungstate screens produced brighter images. Edison, however, abandoned his researches in 1903 because of the health hazards that accompanied use of these early devices. Clarence Dally, a glass blower of lab equipment and tubes at Edisonâ€™s laboratory was repeatedly exposed, suffering radiation poisoning, later succumbing to an aggressive cancer. Edison himself damaged an eye in testing these early fluoroscopes.|$|E
25|$|British {{military}} helicopters {{flew over}} the crash site, pointing out large pieces of wreckage to the search parties. Private helicopters, equipped with thermographic cameras, were drafted in to survey the heavily wooded areas surrounding Lockerbie.

High-resolution photographs from spy satellites were also provided by the United States Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Every item picked up was tagged, placed in a clear plastic bag, labelled and taken to the gymnasium of a local school, where everything was <b>X-rayed</b> and checked for explosive residue with a gas chromatograph, after which the information was entered into the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System.|$|E
500|$|Editing on {{location}} led to additional complications in post-production. The production {{was unwilling to}} risk sending undeveloped film through high-security airports where the cans could be opened, <b>X-rayed,</b> or damaged. Accordingly, film was hand-carried on a flight by a production assistant from Amman to London. After the Super 16mm film was transferred to DVcam at a lab in London, the video dailies were transported by plane back to the Middle East to be imported into the editing system. The whole journey would take anywhere from three days to a week and was described by Innis as the [...] "modern-day equivalent of shipping via donkey cart". The low production budget {{and the lack of}} a developed film infrastructure in the area hampered the process, according to Innis. [...] "We were working with grainy Super 16mm film, editing in standard definition. We tried doing FTP downloads, but at the time the facilities in Jordan simply couldn't handle it." [...] The producer Tony Mark later negotiated the use of a local radio station late at night to receive low-grade QuickTime clips over the Internet so the crew would not be shooting blindly.|$|E
50|$|<b>X-ray</b> optics is {{the branch}} of optics that manipulates <b>X-rays</b> instead of visible light.

Visible light is easily redirected using lenses and mirrors, but because the refractive index of all materials is very close to 1 for <b>X-rays,</b> they instead tend to initially penetrate and eventually get absorbed in most materials without changing direction much.|$|R

500|$|In 1930, Warren {{became an}} Associate Professor of Medicine. That year he {{published}} [...] "A Roentgenologic Study of the Breast". X-ray imaging {{of the breast}} had first been investigated by Albert Salomon at the University of Berlin in 1913. He produced images of over 3,000 mastectomy specimens, and observed different forms and stages of cancer. He was even able to detect an undiagnosed cancer in a breast that had been removed because of a large cyst. However, Salomon apparently did not appreciate the life saving potential of his observations. Warren used radiology to track changes in breast tissue {{as a result of}} pregnancy and mastitis. He developed a stereoscopic technique, using patients rather than specimens and adapting general purpose X-ray equipment to his needs. His method involved having the patient lie on her side with one arm raised while being <b>X-rayed.</b> In 119 women who subsequently underwent surgery, he correctly found breast cancer in 54 out of 58 cases. This represented a leap forward, as it made diagnosis of breast cancer possible without surgery. It also sparked intense interest in the technique around the world. Today mammography saves thousands of lives.|$|E
500|$|After the Dubai World Cup, California Chrome {{was shipped}} to Rae Guest's Newmarket stables in England {{to prepare for}} Royal Ascot week in June. The {{decision}} to go to England was made by Perry Martin, against the wishes of both Coburn and Sherman. Martin explained, [...] "I was trying {{to think in terms of}} what's best for the horse. It was my decision to send him to Newmarket. It's a beautiful place, with trees and pastures for gallops...It's good for his mind. I know Art didn't take the decision well. But he'll be okay." [...] The horse's exercise rider in England, Robbie Mills, who was acquainted with the Shermans and advised them to stable the horse with Guest, stated that California Chrome was making a good transition from the flat dirt tracks of the United States to the undulating turf gallops of England. The horse was pointed to the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot, with European jockey William Buick, who rode Prince Bishop in Dubai, tapped to ride. The day before the race, the horse was scratched because of a bruised hoof that was draining pus. Guest stated, [...] "He's been <b>X-rayed</b> and there's no damage." [...] Martin wanted to run him in Chicago's Arlington Million in August, and the requirements of quarantine upon his return to the United States combined with the setback to his training foreclosed any other UK start. [...] Upon California Chrome's return to the US in early July, a veterinary radiograph revealed that he had bruising on his cannon bones that would require at least three months to heal, effectively ending his four-year-old season. The veterinarians at Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Kentucky explained, [...] "California Chrome's x-rays showed all of his joints to be remarkably clean. He has the early signs of bruising to the bottom of the cannon bones...The return rate for horses with this problem is very high...we found that recovery rate was 95% after giving time in the paddock to heal." ...|$|E
