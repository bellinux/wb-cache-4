25|$|Decreased {{intestinal}} motility {{can also be}} the result of drugs such as Amitraz, which is used to kill ticks and mites. <b>Xylazine,</b> detomidine, and butorphanol also reduce motility, but will not cause colic if appropriately administered.|$|E
25|$|A common regimen {{for general}} {{anesthesia}} {{for the house}} mouse is ketamine (in the dose of 100mg per kg body weight) plus <b>xylazine</b> (in the dose of 5–10mg per kg), injected by the intraperitoneal route. It has a duration of effect of about 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Imipramine {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of depression, such as depression associated with agitation or anxiety. It is similar in efficacy to the antidepressant drug moclobemide. It has also been used to treat nocturnal enuresis because of its ability to shorten the time of delta wave stage sleep, where wetting occurs. In veterinary medicine, imipramine is used with <b>xylazine</b> to induce pharmacologic ejaculation in stallions.|$|E
25|$|The {{intensity}} of medical management {{is dependent on}} the severity of the colic, its cause, and the financial capabilities of the owner. At the most basic level, analgesia and sedation is administered to the horse. The most commonly used analgesics for colic pain in horses are NSAIDs, such as flunixin meglumine, although opioids such as butorphanol may be used if the pain is more severe. Butrophanol is often given with alpha-2 agonists such as <b>xylazine</b> and detomidine to prolong the analgesic effects of the opioid. Early colic signs may be masked with the use of NSAIDs, so some practitioners prefer to examine the horse before they are given by the owner.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{anesthetic}} agents used {{in human}} medicine {{are used in}} veterinary medicine. [...] Alpha-2 receptor agonist drugs such as <b>xylazine,</b> romifidine, detomidine, and medetomidine, are used frequently in veterinary species (particularly large animal), but are rarely used in people. [...] Guaifenesin {{is used as a}} muscle relaxant prior to anesthesia induction in some animals. [...] Propofol is commonly used in small animal anesthesia, however it is rarely used in large animals due to the cost. 'Propoclear' is also commonly used in smaller branches of small animal surgery as it has a longer shelf life once opened than propofol whilst essentially having the same properties. [...] Butorphanol is rarely used in people but is commonly used in all species. [...] Ketamine, used in children for anesthesia, is used extensively in many species to induce anesthesia or cause heavy sedation. [...] Expensive agents, such as etomidate and desflurane are rarely used outside of university hospitals. [...] Different species have different responses to drugs. [...] For example, horses may experience mania with morphine whereas dogs typically become sedated. [...] Rabbits and guinea pigs are well sedated with midazolam, which can occasionally excite dogs and cats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xylazine</b> {{users are}} more likely to be male, under the age of 30, living in a rural area, and injecting versus inhaling <b>xylazine.</b> <b>Xylazine</b> has similar {{behavioral}} consequences as heroin, thus it is commonly used as an adulterant. <b>Xylazine</b> is also frequently found in speedball. The combination of heroin and <b>xylazine</b> produces a stronger high than administration of heroin alone. Concomitant use of <b>xylazine</b> with speedball may potentiate or prolong the effects of these drugs, which can lead to adverse consequences.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Xylazine</b> is metabolized by liver {{cytochrome}} P450 enzymes. When {{it reaches}} the liver, <b>xylazine</b> is metabolized and proceeds to the kidneys to be excreted as urine. Around 70% of a dose is excreted by urine. Thus, urine {{can be used in}} detecting <b>xylazine</b> administration because it contains many metabolites, which are the main targets and products in urine. Within a few hours, <b>xylazine</b> decreases to undetectable levels. Other factors can also significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of <b>xylazine,</b> including sex, nutrition, environmental conditions, and prior diseases.|$|E
50|$|Carruthers et al. in 1979 {{reported}} {{the first case}} of <b>xylazine</b> toxicity in a 34-year-old male, who self-medicated for insomnia with injection of 1 g of <b>xylazine.</b> Intentional intoxication from ingesting, inhaling, or injecting <b>xylazine</b> has been reported. The intravenous route {{is the most common}} route of administration for those who abuse heroin or <b>xylazine</b> recreationally. In Puerto Rico, <b>xylazine</b> has increased in popularity. Its use was associated with a high number of inmate deaths at the Guerrero Correctional Institution in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico from 2002 through 2008.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xylazine</b> {{is often}} used as a sedative, muscle relaxant, and analgesic. It is {{frequently}} used {{in the treatment of}} tetanus. <b>Xylazine</b> is very similar to drugs such as phenothiazine, tricyclic antidepressants, and clonidine. As an anesthetic, it is typically used in conjunction with ketamine. <b>Xylazine</b> appears to reduce sensitivity to insulin and glucose uptake in humans. Yohimbine has been used to decrease glucose levels to a healthy level. In clinical settings, Yohimbine can reverse the adverse effects of <b>xylazine</b> if administered intravenously at a dosage of 0.5 mL / 20 pounds shortly after <b>xylazine</b> administration.|$|E
50|$|The known {{doses of}} <b>xylazine</b> that produce {{toxicity}} and fatality in humans vary from 40 to 2400 mg. Small doses may produce toxicity and larger doses may be survived with medical assistance. Non-fatal blood or plasma concentration ranges from 0.03 to 4.6 mg/L. In fatalities, the blood concentration of <b>xylazine</b> ranges from trace to 16 mg/L. It is {{reported that there}} is no defined safe or fatal concentration of <b>xylazine</b> because of the significant overlap between the non-fatal and postmortem blood concentrations of <b>xylazine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} side effects in humans {{associated}} with <b>xylazine</b> administration include bradycardia, respiratory depression, hypotension, transient hypertension secondary to vagus nerve stimulation, and other changes in cardiac output. <b>Xylazine</b> significantly decreases heart rate in {{animals that are}} not premedicated with medications that have anticholinergic effects. The decrease in heart rate directly impacts aortic flow. Bradycardia caused by <b>xylazine</b> administration is effectively prevented by administration of atropine or glycopyrrolate. Arrhythmias associated with <b>xylazine</b> includes other symptoms such as sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, A-V dissociation, and sinus arrhythmia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xylazine</b> is {{a potent}} α2 {{adrenergic}} agonist. When <b>xylazine</b> and other α2 adrenergic receptor agonists are administered, they distribute throughout the body within 30 to 40 minutes. Due to xylazine’s highly lipophilic nature, <b>xylazine</b> directly stimulates central α2 receptors as well as peripheral α-adrenoceptors {{in a variety of}} tissues. As an agonist, <b>xylazine</b> leads to a decrease in neurotransmission of norepinephrine and dopamine in the central nervous system. It does so by mimicking norepinephrine in binding to presynaptic surface autoreceptors, which leads to feedback inhibition of norepinephrine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xylazine</b> {{overdose}} {{is usually}} fatal in humans. Because {{it is used}} as a drug adulterant, the symptoms caused by the drugs accompanying <b>xylazine</b> administration vary between individuals.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has found}} that <b>xylazine</b> {{significantly}} increases Km and does not affect Vmax. <b>Xylazine</b> {{also serves as a}} transport inhibitor by suppressing norepinephrine transport function through competitive inhibition of substrate transport. This likely occurs by direct interaction on an area that overlaps with the antidepressant binding site. For example, <b>xylazine</b> and clonidine suppress uptake of MIBG, a norepinephrine analog, in neuroblastoma cells. <b>Xylazine</b> has varying affinities for cholinergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, α1 adrenergic, H2 - histaminergic and opiate receptors. Its chemical structure closely resembles the phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and clonidine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xylazine</b> was {{discovered}} as an antihypertensive agent in 1962 by Farbenfabriken Bayer in Leverkusen, Germany. Results from early human clinical studies confirmed that <b>xylazine</b> has several {{central nervous system}} depressant effects. <b>Xylazine</b> administration is used for sedation, anesthesia, muscle relaxation, and analgesia. It causes a significant reduction in blood pressure and heart rate in healthy volunteers. Due to hazardous side effects, including hypotension and bradycardia, <b>xylazine</b> was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use. As a result, xylazine's mechanism of action in humans remains unknown.|$|E

50|$|<b>Xylazine</b> was {{approved}} by the FDA for veterinary use and is now used as an animal tranquilizer. In the United States, <b>xylazine</b> was only approved by the FDA for veterinary use as a sedative, analgesic, and muscle relaxant in dogs, cats, horses, elk, fallow deer, mule deer, sika deer, and white-tailed deer. The sedative and analgesic effects of <b>xylazine</b> are related to central nervous system depression. Xylazine’s muscle relaxant effect inhibits the transmission of neural impulses in the central nervous system.|$|E
5000|$|In {{scientific}} research, <b>xylazine</b> is {{a component}} of the most common anesthetic, ketamine-xylazine, which is used in rats, mice, hamster, and guinea pigs. The accounts of the actions and uses of <b>xylazine</b> in animals were reported as early as the late 1960s and early 1970s. Since the early 2000s, <b>xylazine</b> has become popular as a drug of abuse in the United States and Puerto Rico. Xylazine’s street name in Puerto Rico is Anestesia de Caballo, which roughly translates to “horse anesthetic." [...] The reasons that may explain why this drug has become increasingly popular are still unknown. Further research is needed to gain more information on the distribution of <b>xylazine</b> in the body, physical symptoms, potential treatments, and predictive factors for chronic usage.|$|E
50|$|Xylazine’s {{action can}} be seen usually 15 to 30 minutes after {{administration}} and the sedative effect may continue for 1-2 hours and last up to 4 hours. Once <b>xylazine</b> gains access to the vascular system, it is distributed within the blood, allowing <b>xylazine</b> to perfuse target organs including the heart, lungs, liver, and kidney. In nonfatal cases, the blood plasma concentrations range from 0.03 to 4.6 mg/L. <b>Xylazine</b> diffuses extensively and penetrates the blood brain barrier, as expected due to the uncharged, lipophilic nature of the compound.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xylazine</b> is an {{analogue}} of clonidine and an agonist at the α2 {{class of}} adrenergic receptor. It {{is used for}} sedation, anesthesia, muscle relaxation, and analgesia in animals such as horses, cattle and other non-human mammals. Veterinarians also use <b>xylazine</b> as an emetic, especially in cats.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{specific}} antidote to treat humans that overdose on <b>xylazine.</b> Hemodialysis has been suggested {{as a form of}} treatment, but is usually unfavorable due to the large volume of distribution of <b>xylazine.</b> In addition, due to lack of research in humans, there are no standardized screenings to determine if an overdose has occurred. The detection of <b>xylazine</b> in biological fluids in humans involves various screening methods, such as urine screenings, thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), Remedi HS Bio-Rad Laboratories, and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).|$|E

50|$|Multiple {{drugs have}} been used as {{supportive}} therapeutic intervention such as lidocaine, naloxone, thiamine, lorazepam, vecuronium, etomidate, propofol, tolazoline, yohimbine, atropine, naloxone, orciprenaline, metoclopramide, ranitidine, metoprolol, enoxaparin, flucloxacillin, insulin, and irrigation of both eyes with saline. Effects of <b>xylazine</b> are also reversed by the analeptics 4-aminopyridine, doxapram, and caffeine, which are physiological antagonists to central nervous system depressants. Combining yohimbine and 4-aminopyridine in an effort to antagonize <b>xylazine</b> is superior as compared to the administration of either of these drugs individually due to reduction of recovery time. Research initiatives may be necessary in order to standardize treatment and determine effective measures for identifying chronic <b>xylazine</b> usage and intoxication.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xylazine</b> is absorbed, metabolized, and {{eliminated}} rapidly. <b>Xylazine</b> can be inhaled or administered intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or orally either by itself or {{in conjunction with}} other anesthetics, such as ketamine, barbiturates, chloral hydrate, and halothane in order to provide reliable anesthesia effects. The most common route of administration is injection. The drug is used as a veterinary anesthetic and the recommended dose varies between species.|$|E

50|$|If it is {{administered}} intramuscularly, the recommended dose is 0.25 - 4 mg per pound in animals. If <b>xylazine</b> {{is administered}} intravenously, the recommended dose is 0.5 mg per pound in animals. As a veterinary anesthetic, <b>xylazine</b> is typically only administered once for intended effect before or during surgical procedures. When {{used as a}} drug of abuse in humans, the frequency of dosage is dependent on social or economic factors as well as each user’s subjective response to xylazine’s addictive properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xylazine</b> {{administration}} {{can lead to}} diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Other possible side effects that can occur are areflexia, asthenia, ataxia, blurred vision, disorientation, dizziness, drowsiness, dysarthria, dysmetria, fainting, hyporeflexia, slurred speech, somnolence, staggering, coma, apnea, shallow breathing, sleepiness, premature ventricular contraction, tachycardia, miosis, and dry mouth. Rarely, hypotonia, dry mouth, urinary incontinence and nonspecific electrocardiographic ST segment changes occur. It {{has been reported that}} the duration of symptoms after human overdose is 8 to 72 hours. Further research is necessary to categorize the side effects that occur when <b>xylazine</b> is used in conjunction with heroin and cocaine.|$|E
50|$|Decreased {{intestinal}} motility {{can also be}} the result of drugs such as Amitraz, which is used to kill ticks and mites. <b>Xylazine,</b> detomidine, and butorphanol also reduce motility, but will not cause colic if appropriately administered.|$|E
50|$|Pilocarpine {{is given}} in {{moderate}} doses (about 2 mg) to induce emesis in cats that have ingested foreign plants, foods, or drugs. One feline trial determined it was effective, even though the usual choice of emetic is <b>xylazine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Anesthetic {{recoveries}} in {{horses that}} have received ketamine following a detomidine premedication are often violent with the horse having multiple failures to stand resulting in trauma to itself. <b>Xylazine</b> is a superior premedication with ketamine resulting in safer recoveries.|$|E
50|$|In {{veterinary}} anesthesia, <b>xylazine</b> {{is often}} used in combination with ketamine. It is sold under many brand names worldwide, most notably the Bayer brand name Rompun. It is also marketed as Anased, Sedazine, and Chanazine. The drug interactions vary with different animals.|$|E
50|$|A common regimen {{for general}} {{anesthesia}} {{for the house}} mouse is ketamine (in the dose of 100 mg per kg body weight) plus <b>xylazine</b> (in the dose of 5-10 mg per kg), injected by the intraperitoneal route. It has a duration of effect of about 30 minutes.|$|E
50|$|In {{veterinary}} anesthesia, butorphanol (trade name: Torbugesic) {{is widely}} used as a sedative and analgesic in dogs, cats and horses. For sedation, it may be combined with tranquilizers such as alpha-2 agonists (medetomidine), benzodiazepines, or acepromazine in dogs, cats and exotic animals. It is frequently combined with <b>xylazine</b> or detomidine in horses.|$|E
50|$|In dogs, sheep, {{horses and}} cattle, the half life is very short at only 1.21 to 5.97 minutes. Complete {{elimination}} of the half lives {{can take up to}} 23.11 minutes in sheep and up to 49.51 minutes in horses. In young rats, the half life is an hour. <b>Xylazine</b> has a large volume of distribution (Vd). The Vd is 1.9-2.5 for horse, cattle, sheep, and dog. Though the peak plasma concentrations are reached in 12-14 minutes in all species, the bioavailability varies between species. The half life depends on the age of the animal, as age is related to prolonged duration of anesthesia and recovery time. Toxicity occurs with repeated administration, given that the metabolic clearance of the drug is usually calculated as 7 to 9 times the half-life, which is 4 to 5 days for the clearance of <b>xylazine.</b>|$|E
