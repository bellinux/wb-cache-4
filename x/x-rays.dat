5|$|Wilhelm Röntgen {{discovered}} <b>X-rays</b> in 1895, just as {{the studies}} of crystal symmetry were being concluded. Physicists were initially uncertain {{of the nature of}} <b>X-rays,</b> but soon suspected (correctly) that they were waves of electromagnetic radiation, in other words, another form of light. At that time, the wave model of light—specifically, the Maxwell theory of electromagnetic radiation—was well accepted among scientists, and experiments by Charles Glover Barkla showed that <b>X-rays</b> exhibited phenomena associated with electromagnetic waves, including transverse polarization and spectral lines akin to those observed in the visible wavelengths. Single-slit experiments in the laboratory of Arnold Sommerfeld suggested that <b>X-rays</b> had a wavelength of about 1 angstrom. However, <b>X-rays</b> are composed of photons, and thus are not only waves of electromagnetic radiation but also exhibit particle-like properties. Albert Einstein introduced the photon concept in 1905, but it was not broadly accepted until 1922, when Arthur Compton confirmed it by the scattering of <b>X-rays</b> from electrons. Therefore, these particle-like properties of <b>X-rays,</b> such as their ionization of gases, caused William Henry Bragg to argue in 1907 that <b>X-rays</b> were not electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, Bragg's view was not broadly accepted and the observation of X-ray diffraction by Max von Laue in 1912 confirmed for most scientists that <b>X-rays</b> were a form of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
5|$|Apparently, by late 1968, no <b>X-rays</b> {{had been}} {{detected}} from the Andromeda Galaxy. A balloon flight on October 20, 1970, set an upper limit for detectable hard <b>X-rays</b> from the Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for <b>X-rays,</b> {{the oldest and}} {{still one of the}} most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy <b>X-rays</b> typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted <b>X-rays</b> have much lower energies (~100eV) than <b>X-rays</b> from most studied materials.|$|E

This is achieved by focusing the divergent beam from the <b>X-ray</b> source onto the sample using one out {{of a range of}} focusing optical components. This is also useful for scanning probe {{techniques such}} as scanning transmission <b>X-ray</b> microscopy and scanning <b>x-ray</b> fluorescence imaging.|$|R

5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} (HD) is {{a common}} genetic disease that affects Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It is not present at birth but develops with age.

5|$|The high-altitude explosions {{that had}} caused so much concern for Nike Zeus due to {{blackout}} had been further studied in the early 1960s {{and led to a}} new possibility for missile defense.

5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission.
