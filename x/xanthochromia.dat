50|$|Froin's {{syndrome}} - {{coexistence of}} <b>xanthochromia,</b> high protein level and marked coagulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It {{is caused by}} meningeal irritation (e.g. during spinal meningitis) and CSF flow blockage by tumour mass or abscess. Stagnation of the CSF within the thecal sac facilitates exudation from the tumour itself and activation of coagulation factors. Clinical test formerly used for evaluation of spinal stenosis was Queckenstedt's maneuver. Nowadays, an magnetic resonance imaging is applied.

50|$|The first {{official}} published {{description of the}} disease {{was made by the}} Bulgarian nephrologist Dr.Yoto Tanchev (1917 - 2000) and his team in 1956 in the Bulgarian Journal Savremenna Medizina, a priority generally acknowledged by the international nephrological community. Their study was based on a wide screening of inhabitants of the villages around the town of Vratsa, Bulgaria. Their contribution to the understanding of this unusual endemic disease of the kidneys was their description of symptoms which were not typical of common chronic nephritis, i.e., incidence only in adults (no children affected), absence of high blood pressure, <b>xanthochromia</b> of palms and soles (Tanchev's sign), early hypochromic anemia, absence of proteinuria, and slow progression of kidney failure.|$|E
50|$|Early {{detection}} of superficial siderosis is usually via MRI. The iron deposition that {{is characteristic of}} superficial siderosis shows up as a hypointense band in affected tissues, with a characteristic rim of intensity appearing on the cerebellum; a hyperintense rim is rarely seen. Taking samples of cerebrospinal fluid may also reveal siderosis through <b>xanthochromia,</b> elevated presence of red blood cells, high iron and ferritin concentrations, and elevated levels of the proteins Tau, beta amyloid (Aβ42), neurofilament light protein (NFL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), but the CSF is sometimes normal.

50|$|Many {{laboratories}} rely on {{only the}} color of the cerebrospinal fluid to determine {{the presence or absence of}} <b>xanthochromia.</b> However, recent guidelines suggest that spectrophotometry should be performed. Spectrophotometry relies on the different transmittance, or conversely, absorbance, of light by different substances or materials, including solutes. Bilirubin absorbs light at wavelengths between 450-460 nm. Spectrophotometry can also detect the presence of oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, which absorb light at 410-418 nm and 403-410 nm, respectively, and also may indicate that bleeding has occurred; to identify substances in cerebrospinal fluid that absorb light at other wavelengths but are not due to bleeding, such as carotenoids; and to detect very small amounts of yellow color saturation (about 0.62%) which may may be missed by visual inspection, especially when the cerebrospinal fluid has been examined under incandescent lighting or a tungsten desk lamp (corresponding to International Commission on Illumination standard illuminant A).|$|E

The CSF findings were therefore reviewed of 111 patients with a proven SAH. All patients had <b>xanthochromia</b> of the CSF.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesOver {{the last}} decade, {{computed}} tomography scanners have gained resolution {{and have become}} the standard of care {{in the investigation of}} neurologically intact patients suffering from acute headache. The added value of the combined assessment of red blood cells count, visual and spectrophotometric <b>xanthochromia,</b> to detect ruptured aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (ASAH) following a negative head computed tomography (NHCT) was studied. MethodsThe population consisted of all patients who had cerebrospinal fluid tested for spectrophotometric <b>xanthochromia</b> between 2003 and 2009 identified through the clinical-laboratory database and who met all the inclusion criteria: > 14 years old, had an initial Glasgow Coma Score of 15, a non-traumatic acute headache with a suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage recorded in the initial ED differential diagnosis and an initial negative head CT scan. ResultsA total of 706 patients were included. LP identified 5 ASAH (prevalence: 0. 7 %). In these patients, LP parameters were as follows: high red blood cell count (from 1310 to 63, 000 × 106 /L), positive visual <b>xanthochromia</b> in 4 out of 5 ASAH, and positive spectrophotometric <b>xanthochromia</b> in 5 out of 5 ASAH. All ASAH patients were neurologically intact after intervention. No deaths or missed ASAH were reported. Angiographies were performed on 127 patients (19. 5 %) of which 47 (34. 1 %) had positive <b>xanthochromia</b> (visual or spectrophotometric). ConclusionsConsidering the low prevalence of ASAH following an NHCT, intense resources were utilized to identify all 5 ASAH. Lumbar puncture analyses combining red blood cell count, visual and spectrophotometric <b>xanthochromia</b> identified all ASAH, allowing intervention and a positive clinical outcome. Our data support 1) that LP identifies the presence of a ruptured ASAH after an NHCT and 2) ` that a guide to define a subpopulation of patients who would benefit from a lumbar puncture after an NHCT would be desirable...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the sensitivity, specificity, and {{negative and positive}} predictive values of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <b>xanthochromia</b> for detection of ruptured cerebral aneurysms in patients with thunderclap headache (sudden and severe headache with maximal intensity at onset). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified patients who presented to our emergency department with symptoms of thunderclap headache between January 1, 1998, and January 1, 2008. Those with normal results on computed tomography (CT) of the head were selected {{for inclusion in the}} study. All consenting adult patients had undergone a lumbar puncture procedure for CSF analysis. <b>Xanthochromia</b> was assessed by visual inspection. All patients with a normal CT result were further evaluated by conventional 4 -vessel catheter angiography. If no aneurysms were detected in the initial study, the procedure was performed again within 7 to 14 days. All patients were followed up clinically for a mean period of approximately 29 months. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were identified (mean +/- SD age, 44. 7 +/- 15. 8 years; 53 men). Cerebrospinal fluid <b>xanthochromia</b> was present in 18 patients (12 %), 13 (72 %) of whom were ultimately diagnosed as having aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. A single patient who tested negative for <b>xanthochromia</b> and had a normal CT result was subsequently found to have a ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of CSF <b>xanthochromia</b> for detection of cerebral aneurysms were 93 %, 95 %, 72 %, and 99 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although not perfect, visual inspection of CSF in patients with a history suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage remains a highly valuable and simple test to detect a recently ruptured aneurysm...|$|E
40|$|Although {{bilirubin}} {{has been}} identified in the cerebrospinal fluid of jaundiced patients, the concentration gradient between serum and spinal fluid has not been accurately determined because of the technical difficulties involved in the measurement of minute quantities of bilirubin (1 - 6).

40|$|Background and Aim: In {{patients}} {{suspected of}} having a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), a normal CT should be followed by lumbar puncture (LP) to detect <b>xanthochromia.</b> We studied the practice of performing a LP following a normal CT in patients with a clinical suspicion of SAH in a District General Hospital.

Methods: This was a prospective study aiming to improve the patient’s care by implementing the best practice. We initially recorded CT and LP results of patients with suspected SAH (phase 1) and presented the results to the referring clinicians. After a period of time, data was re-collected to study any change in practice (phase 2). Results: In phase 1, 36 of 61 patients (59. 0 %) with a normal CT had a subsequent LP compared to 67 / 104 (64. 4 %) {{in the second phase}} (p= 0. 51). In the first phase, <b>xanthochromia</b> was detected in 1 of 36 patients (2. 8 %) who had a LP following a normal CT, compared to 1 of 67 patients (1. 5 %) in the second phase (p= 1. 0). Conclusion: Approximately a third of patients with symptoms of SAH in both study periods did not undergo LP following a normal CT scan.
