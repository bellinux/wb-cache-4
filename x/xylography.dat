25|$|Traditionally, {{there have}} been two main {{printing}} techniques in Asia: woodblock printing (<b>xylography)</b> and moveable type printing. In the woodblock technique, ink is applied to letters carved upon a wooden board, which is then pressed onto paper. With moveable type, the board is assembled using different lettertypes, according to the page being printed. Wooden printing was used in the East from the 8th century onwards, and moveable metal type came into use during the 12th century.|$|E
25|$|Woodblock {{printing}} (diaoban yinshua 雕版印刷), {{known as}} <b>xylography</b> today, {{was the first}} method of printing applied to a paper medium. It became widely used throughout East Asia both as a method for printing on textiles and later, {{under the influence of}} Buddhism, on paper. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to about 220. Ukiyo-e is the best known type of Japanese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique on paper are covered by the term woodcut (see below), except for the block-books produced mainly in the fifteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1040, {{the first}} known movable type system was created in China by Bi Sheng out of porcelain. Bi Sheng used clay type, which broke easily, but Wang Zhen by 1298 had carved a more durable type from wood. He also {{developed}} a complex system of revolving tables and number-association with written Chinese characters that made typesetting and printing more efficient. Still, the main method in use there remained woodblock printing (<b>xylography),</b> which [...] "proved to be cheaper and more efficient for printing Chinese, with its thousands of characters".|$|E
50|$|Rusconi’s “Vitruvius” {{was only}} printed {{after his death}} in 1590 by the son of his former editor Giolito. Although the latter {{recognised}} the value of Giovan Antonio’s <b>xylographies</b> he considered his translation and annotations as outdated, and thus a strange “Vitruvius without Vitruvius“ was published: Just about 160 of originally 300 woodcuts were compiled with extracts from Fra Giocondo’s and Cesariano’s translations of Vitruvius’ treatise. For many of Rusconi’s illustrations containing references to textual explanations, it is particularly regrettable that his translation has hence been lost.|$|R
40|$|The Padua-trained {{medical doctor}} Hartmann Schedel (1440 – 1514) of Nuremberg is today {{perhaps best known}} for his Liber Chronicarum, printed in Latin and German (Weltchronik) in 1493 with an ambitious {{programme}} of <b>xylographies.</b> Thanks to his well-spent study years in Padua (1463 – 1466), he also {{played an important role in}} the dissemination of Italian humanism north of the Alps, as witnessed, for example, by his important collection of inscriptions and Humanist texts. His rich library, consisting of manuscripts, both autographs and written by others, and printed books, was bought from his family by H. J. Fugger of Augsburg (1531 – 1598) in 1552. Fugger’s library was passed to the Bavarian Court Library in 1571 and is now housed at the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich. This article details one of the autograph manuscripts, the clm 490, containing medical texts. It gives direct access to Hartmann at work on his library, carefully writing out the contents in his all’antica hand, numbering the folios, providing a list of contents, presenting authors in short biographies and, last but not least, scrupulously dating and often localizing the sections copied...|$|R
2500|$|Recent {{commentaries on}} {{printing}} in China using contemporary European observers with first hand knowledge complicate the traditional narrative. T. H. Barrett {{points out that}} only Europeans who had never seen Chinese woodblock printing in action tended to dismiss it, perhaps due to the almost instantaneous arrival of both <b>xylography</b> and movable type in Europe. The early Jesuit missionaries of late 16th century China, for instance, had a similar distaste for wood based printing for very different reasons. These Jesuits found that [...] "the cheapness and omnipresence of printing in China made the prevailing wood-based technology extremely disturbing, even dangerous." [...] Two hundred years later the Englishman John Barrow, {{by way of the}} Macartney mission to Qing China, also remarked with some amazement that the printing industry was [...] "as free as in England, and the profession of printing open to everyone." [...] The commercial success and profitability of woodblock printing was attested to by one British observer {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century, who noted that even before the arrival of western printing methods, the price of books and printed materials in China had already reached an astoundingly low price compared to what could be found in his home country. Of this, he said: ...|$|E
