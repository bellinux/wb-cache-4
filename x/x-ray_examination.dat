25|$|Some medical {{systems have}} a {{practice}} of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly. In fact, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against routine pre-operative chest x-rays for patients who have an unremarkable medical history and presented with a physical exam which did not indicate a chest x-ray. Routine <b>x-ray</b> <b>examination</b> {{is more likely to}} result in problems like misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or other negative outcomes than it is to result in a benefit to the patient. Likewise, other tests including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis should not be done unless the results of these tests can help evaluate surgical risk.|$|E
25|$|CAD {{is used in}} {{screening}} mammography (<b>X-ray</b> <b>examination</b> of {{the female}} breast). Screening mammography {{is used for the}} early detection of breast cancer. CAD systems are often utilized to help classify a tumor as malignant or benign. CAD is especially established in US and the Netherlands and is used in addition to human evaluation, usually by a radiologist. The first CAD system for mammography was developed in a research project at the University of Chicago. Today it is commercially offered by iCAD and Hologic. There are currently some non-commercial projects being developed, such as Ashita Project, a gradient-based screening software by Alan Hshieh, as well. However, while achieving high sensitivities, CAD systems tend to have very low specificity and the benefits of using CAD remain uncertain. Some studies suggest a positive impact on mammography screening programs, but others show no improvement. A 2008 systematic review on computer-aided detection in screening mammography concluded that CAD does not {{have a significant effect on}} cancer detection rate, but does undesirably increase recall rate (i.e. the rate of false positives). However, it noted considerable heterogeneity in the impact on recall rate across studies.|$|E
2500|$|The first genuine {{success in}} immunizing against {{tuberculosis}} was developed from attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis by Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin in 1906. It was called [...] "BCG" [...] (Bacille Calmette-Guérin). The BCG vaccine {{was first used}} on humans in 1921 in France, {{but it was not}} until after World War II that BCG received widespread acceptance in Great Britain, and Germany. In the early days of the British National Health Service <b>X-ray</b> <b>examination</b> for TB increased dramatically but rates of vaccination were initially very low. In 1953 it was agreed that secondary school pupils should be vaccinated, but by the end of 1954 only 250,000 people had been vaccinated. By 1956 this had risen to 600,000, about half being school children.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnosis is very difficult, {{and usually}} one of exclusion. SMA {{syndrome}} is thus considered only after patients have undergone an extensive evaluation of their gastrointestinal tract including upper endoscopy, and evaluation for various malabsorptive, ulcerative and inflammatory instestinal conditions {{with a higher}} diagnostic frequency. Diagnosis may follow <b>x-ray</b> <b>examination</b> revealing duodenal dilation followed by abrupt constriction proximal to the overlying SMA, {{as well as a}} delay in transit of four to six hours through the gastroduodenal region. [...] Standard diagnostic exams include abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with oral and IV contrast, upper gastrointestinal series (UGI), and, for equivocal cases, hypotonic duodenography. [...] In addition, vascular imaging studies such as ultrasound and contrast angiography may be used to indicate increased bloodflow velocity through the SMA or a narrowed SMA angle.|$|E
2500|$|Osteosarcomas tend {{to occur}} at the sites of bone growth, presumably because {{proliferation}} makes osteoblastic cells in this region prone to acquire mutations {{that could lead to}} transformation of cells (the RB gene and p53 gene are commonly involved). Due to this tendency, high incidence of osteosarcoma is seen in some large dog breeds (St. Bernards and Great Danes). The tumor may be localized {{at the end of the}} long bone (commonly in the metaphysis). Most often it affects the proximal end of tibia or humerus, or distal end of femur. Osteosarcoma tends to affect regions around the knee in 60% of cases, 15% around the hip, 10% at the shoulder, and 8% in the jaw. The tumor is solid, hard, irregular ("fir-tree," [...] "moth-eaten", or [...] "sun-burst" [...] appearance on <b>X-ray</b> <b>examination)</b> due to the tumor spicules of calcified bone radiating in right angles. These right angles form what is known as a Codman triangle, which is characteristic but not diagnostic of osteosarcoma. Surrounding tissues are infiltrated.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more recent}} case {{came to light}} in 2007 with [...] Bass' {{agreement}} to exhume {{the body of the}} late J.P. Richardson, Jr, more famously known as [...] "The Big Bopper". He was one of the three musicians that {{died in a plane crash}} in February 1959. His son, Jay Richardson, had never met his father and, knowing the strange controversies surrounding the plane crash, decided to contact Bass to see if he could gather any answers. Questions lingered as to whether or not Buddy Holly's gun found at the scene of the crash had been fired earlier or if Richardson had managed to survive the initial crash and simply died trying to get away. After exhumation of the body, Bass examined it using a portable X-ray system. After <b>X-ray</b> <b>examination,</b> Bass was able to come to a fairly certain conclusion: Richardson died immediately upon impact. He showed Jay Richardson the numerous breaks and fractures throughout his father's body, including his chest, skull, pelvis, and legs which inhibited ambulatory motion. All of the rumors and debates surrounding Richardson's death could finally be put to rest, and it was due largely in part to [...] Bass and his extensive knowledge of forensic anthropology.|$|E

40|$|This study explores {{whether the}} {{introduction}} of selectively trained radiographers reporting Accident and Emergency (A&E) <b>X-ray</b> <b>examinations</b> of the appendicular skeleton affected the availability of reports for A&E and General Practitioner (GP) examinations at a typical district general hospital. This was achieved by analysing monthly data on A&E and GP examinations for 1993 - 1997 using structural time-series models. Parameters to capture stochastic seasonal effects and stochastic time trends {{were included in the}} models. The main outcome measures were changes in the number, proportion and timeliness of A&E and GP examinations reported. Radiographer reporting <b>X-ray</b> <b>examinations</b> requested by A&E was associated with a 12 % (p= 0. 050) {{increase in the number of}} A&E examinations reported and a 37 % (p= 0. 001) decrease in the time taken to report on these examinations. Radiographer reporting of A&E <b>X-ray</b> <b>examinations</b> was also associated with a 14 % (p= 0. 067) decrease in the time taken for GP examinations to be reported. That is, radiographer reporting A&E <b>X-ray</b> <b>examinations</b> allowed an increase in the time available to radiologists to report on examinations requested by GPs. An increase in the proportion of GP examinations reported by radiologists was associated with longer reporting times for A&E examinations.

40|$|Most {{information}} concerning possible cancer risks attributable to lifetime exposure to diagnostic x-rays comes from {{studies in which}} x-ray history was ascertained by interview or questionnaire, but {{little is known about}} the accuracy of such information. The authors assessed agreement between medical x-ray histories obtained through interview and by review of medical records from thyroid cancer case-control studies conducted in Sweden (1985 – 1992; 123 cases and 123 controls) and from members of a prepaid health plan in the United States (1986 – 1991; 50 cases and 50 controls). In both studies, substantial disagreement was found between the numbers of <b>x-ray</b> <b>examinations</b> reported in the interview and in the medical records. There was an indication of relatively poorer reporting among controls, particularly for certain types of <b>x-ray</b> <b>examinations</b> and for large numbers of such examinations.
