5|$|Because of the <b>xenon</b> atom's large, {{flexible}} outer electron shell, the NMR spectrum {{changes in}} response to surrounding conditions {{and can be used}} to monitor the surrounding chemical circumstances. For instance, <b>xenon</b> dissolved in water, <b>xenon</b> dissolved in hydrophobic solvent, and <b>xenon</b> associated with certain proteins can be distinguished by NMR.|$|E
5|$|When <b>xenon</b> atoms are in {{the ground}} energy state, they repel each other and will not form a bond. When <b>xenon</b> atoms becomes energized, however, they can form an excimer (excited dimer) until the {{electrons}} return to the ground state. This entity is formed because the <b>xenon</b> atom tends to complete the outermost electronic shell by adding an electron from a neighboring <b>xenon</b> atom. The typical lifetime of a <b>xenon</b> excimer is 1–5ns, and the decay releases photons with wavelengths of about 150 and 173nm. <b>Xenon</b> can also form excimers with other elements, such as the halogens bromine, chlorine, and fluorine.|$|E
5|$|Within the Solar System, the nucleon {{fraction}} of <b>xenon</b> is , for {{an abundance of}} approximately one part in 630thousand of the total mass. <b>Xenon</b> is relatively rare in the Sun's atmosphere, on Earth, and in asteroids and comets. The abundance of <b>xenon</b> in the atmosphere of planet Jupiter is unusually high, about 2.6 {{times that of the}} Sun. This abundance remains unexplained, but may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of planetesimals—small, subplanetary bodies—before the heating of the presolar disk. (Otherwise, <b>xenon</b> would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices.) The problem of the low terrestrial <b>xenon</b> may be explained by covalent bonding of <b>xenon</b> to oxygen within quartz, reducing the outgassing of <b>xenon</b> into the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|<b>Xenon</b> {{can also}} form endohedral {{fullerene}} compounds, where a <b>xenon</b> atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule. The <b>xenon</b> atom {{trapped in the}} fullerene can be observed by 129Xe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Through the sensitive chemical shift of the <b>xenon</b> atom to its environment, chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed. These observations are not without caveat, however, because the <b>xenon</b> atom has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene.|$|E
5|$|<b>Xenon</b> induces robust cardioprotection and neuroprotection {{through a}} variety of mechanisms. Through its {{influence}} on Ca2+, K+, KATP\HIF, and NMDA antagonism, <b>xenon</b> is neuroprotective when administered before, during and after ischemic insults. <b>Xenon</b> is a high affinity antagonist at the NMDA receptor glycine site. <b>Xenon</b> is cardioprotective in ischemia-reperfusion conditions by inducing pharmacologic non-ischemic preconditioning. <b>Xenon</b> is cardioprotective by activating PKC-epsilon and downstream p38-MAPK. <b>Xenon</b> mimics neuronal ischemic preconditioning by activating ATP sensitive potassium channels. <b>Xenon</b> allosterically reduces ATP mediated channel activation inhibition independently of the sulfonylurea receptor1 subunit, increasing KATP open-channel time and frequency.|$|E
5|$|After Neil Bartlett's {{discovery}} in 1962 that <b>xenon</b> can form chemical compounds, {{a large number}} of <b>xenon</b> compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known <b>xenon</b> compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen. The chemistry of <b>xenon</b> in each oxidation state is analogous to that of the neighboring element iodine in the immediately lower oxidation state.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>xenon</b> has {{potential}} {{for use in}} computed tomography (CT) to assess regional ventilation, its anesthetic properties limit its fraction in the breathing gas to 35%. A breathing mixture of 30% <b>xenon</b> and 30% krypton is comparable in effectiveness for CT to a 40% <b>xenon</b> fraction, while avoiding the unwanted effects of a high partial pressure of <b>xenon</b> gas.|$|E
5|$|An unusual ion {{containing}} <b>xenon</b> is the tetraxenonogold(II) cation, , {{which contains}} Xe–Au bonds. This ion {{occurs in the}} compound , and is remarkable in having direct chemical bonds between two notoriously unreactive atoms, <b>xenon</b> and gold, with <b>xenon</b> acting as a transition metal ligand.|$|E
5|$|Because {{they are}} {{strongly}} oxidative, many oxygen-xenon compounds are toxic; {{they are also}} explosive (highly exothermic), breaking down to elemental <b>xenon</b> and diatomic oxygen (O2) with much stronger chemical bonds than the <b>xenon</b> compounds.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, the perxenate {{compounds}} {{are used}} as oxidizing agents in analytical chemistry. <b>Xenon</b> difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon, particularly {{in the production of}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil can be produced by reacting <b>xenon</b> difluoride with uracil. <b>Xenon</b> is also used in protein crystallography. Applied at pressures from 0.5 to 5MPa (5 to 50atm) to a protein crystal, <b>xenon</b> atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities, often creating a high-quality, isomorphous, heavy-atom derivative {{that can be used for}} solving the phase problem.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, M. Räsänen and co-workers, {{scientists}} at the University of Helsinki in Finland, announced the preparation of <b>xenon</b> dihydride (HXeH), and later <b>xenon</b> hydride-hydroxide (HXeOH), hydroxenoacetylene (HXeCCH), and other Xe-containing molecules. In 2008, Khriachtchev et al. reported the preparation of HXeOXeH by the photolysis of water within a cryogenic <b>xenon</b> matrix. Deuterated molecules, HXeOD and DXeOH, have also been produced.|$|E
5|$|Liquid <b>xenon</b> {{is used in}} calorimeters {{to measure}} gamma rays, and as a {{detector}} of hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. When a WIMP collides with a <b>xenon</b> nucleus, theory predicts it will impart enough energy to cause ionization and scintillation. Liquid <b>xenon</b> is useful for these experiments because its density makes dark matter interaction more likely and it permits a quiet detector through self-shielding.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{compounds}} have found use in chemical synthesis as oxidizing agents; , in particular, is commercially available {{and can be}} used as a fluorinating agent.. 44. Effect of Geometry and Heteroatom on the Regioselectivity of Fluorine Introduction into an Aromatic Ring |author1=Zupan, Marko |author2=Iskra, Jernej |author3=Stavber, Stojan |journal=J. Org. Chem |year=1998 |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=878–880 |doi=10.1021/jo971496e |pmid=11672087}} As of 2007, about five hundred compounds of <b>xenon</b> bonded to other elements have been identified, including organoxenon compounds (containing <b>xenon</b> bonded to carbon), and <b>xenon</b> bonded to nitrogen, chlorine, gold, mercury, and <b>xenon</b> itself. Compounds of <b>xenon</b> bound to boron, hydrogen, bromine, iodine, beryllium, sulphur, titanium, copper, and silver have also been observed but only at low temperatures in noble gas matrices, or in supersonic noble gas jets.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in <b>xenon</b> gas (169m/s) is less than that in air because the average {{velocity}} of the heavy <b>xenon</b> atoms is {{less than that of}} nitrogen and oxygen molecules in air. Hence, <b>xenon</b> vibrates more slowly in the vocal cords when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones, an effect opposite to the high-toned voice produced in helium. Like helium, <b>xenon</b> does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen, and it is both a simple asphyxiant and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide; consequently, and because <b>xenon</b> is expensive, many universities have prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. The gas sulfur hexafluoride is similar to <b>xenon</b> in molecular weight (146 versus 131), less expensive, and though an asphyxiant, not toxic or anesthetic; it is often substituted in these demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|To prevent decomposition, the <b>xenon</b> tetroxide thus formed {{is quickly}} cooled {{to form a}} pale-yellow solid. It explodes above −35.9°C into <b>xenon</b> and oxygen gas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Xenon</b> {{chloride}} and <b>xenon</b> fluoride {{have also}} been used in excimer (or, more accurately, exciplex) lasers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Xenon</b> has {{atomic number}} 54; that is, its nucleus {{contains}} 54 protons. At standard temperature and pressure, pure <b>xenon</b> gas has a density of 5.761kg/m3, about 4.5 times {{the density of}} the Earth's atmosphere at sea level, 1.217kg/m3. As a liquid, <b>xenon</b> has a density of up to 3.100g/mL, with the density maximum occurring at the triple point. Liquid <b>xenon</b> has a high polarizability due to its large atomic volume, and thus is an excellent solvent. It can dissolve hydrocarbons, biological molecules, and even water. Under the same conditions, the density of solid <b>xenon,</b> 3.640g/cm3, is greater than the average density of granite, 2.75g/cm3. Under gigapascals of pressure, <b>xenon</b> forms a metallic phase.|$|E
5|$|<b>Xenon</b> {{has been}} used as a general anesthetic. Although it is expensive, {{anesthesia}} machines that can deliver <b>xenon</b> are expected to appear on the European market because advances in recovery and recycling of <b>xenon</b> have made it economically viable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Xenon</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolXe and atomic number54. It is a colorless, dense, odorless noble gas {{found in the}} Earth's atmosphere in trace amounts. Although generally unreactive, <b>xenon</b> can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of <b>xenon</b> hexafluoroplatinate, the first noble gas compound to be synthesized.|$|E
5|$|<b>Xenon</b> is {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product of}} the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen. After this separation, generally performed by fractional distillation in a double-column plant, the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and <b>xenon.</b> By additional fractional distillation, the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by absorption onto silica gel or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and <b>xenon</b> by further distillation. Worldwide production of <b>xenon</b> in 1998 was estimated at 5,000–7,000m3. Because of its scarcity, <b>xenon</b> is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10€/L for <b>xenon,</b> 1€/L for krypton, and 0.20€/L for neon, while the much more plentiful argon costs less than a cent per liter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Xenon</b> {{is used in}} {{light-emitting}} devices called <b>xenon</b> flash lamps, used in photographic {{flashes and}} stroboscopic lamps; to excite the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light; and, occasionally, in bactericidal lamps. The first solid-state laser, invented in 1960, was pumped by a <b>xenon</b> flash lamp, and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by <b>xenon</b> flash lamps.|$|E
5|$|Dense gases such as <b>xenon</b> and {{sulfur hexafluoride}} can be breathed safely when mixed {{with at least}} 20% oxygen. <b>Xenon</b> at 80% {{concentration}} along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia (and {{has been used for}} this, as discussed above). Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} lungs. There is, however, a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in a container, and a person who enters an area filled with an odorless, colorless gas, may be asphyxiated without warning. <b>Xenon</b> is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of <b>xenon</b> is kept in an unventilated space.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} at Bell Laboratories discovered laser action in <b>xenon,</b> and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium. The first excimer laser used a <b>xenon</b> dimer (Xe2) energized by a beam of electrons to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of 176 nm.|$|E
5|$|In a {{gas-filled}} tube, <b>xenon</b> emits a blue or lavenderish glow when {{excited by}} electrical discharge. <b>Xenon</b> emits {{a band of}} emission lines that span the visual spectrum, but the most intense lines occur {{in the region of}} blue light, producing the coloration.|$|E
5|$|In theory, radon is more {{reactive}} than <b>xenon,</b> {{and therefore}} should form chemical bonds {{more easily than}} <b>xenon</b> does. However, due to the high radioactivity and short half-life of radon isotopes, only a few fluorides and oxides of radon have been formed in practice.|$|E
5|$|Inhaling a xenon/oxygen mixture {{activates}} {{production of}} the transcription factor HIF-1-alpha, which may lead to increased production of erythropoietin. The latter hormone is known to increase red blood cell production and athletic performance. Reportedly, doping with <b>xenon</b> inhalation {{has been used in}} Russia since 2004 and perhaps earlier. On August 31, 2014, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) added <b>xenon</b> (and argon) to the list of prohibited substances and methods, although no reliable doping tests for these gases have yet been developed. In addition, effects of <b>xenon</b> on erythropoietin production in humans have not been demonstrated, so far.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{results from}} {{breathing}} gases under elevated pressure, {{and may be}} classified by the principal gas involved. The noble gases, except helium and probably neon, as well as nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen cause a decrement in mental function, but their effect on psychomotor function (processes affecting the coordination of sensory or cognitive processes and motor activity) varies widely. The effects of carbon dioxide consistently result in a diminution of mental and psychomotor function. The noble gases argon, krypton, and <b>xenon</b> are more narcotic than nitrogen at a given pressure, and <b>xenon</b> has so much anesthetic activity {{that it is a}} usable anesthetic at 80% concentration and normal atmospheric pressure. <b>Xenon</b> has historically been too expensive to be used very much in practice, but it has been successfully used for surgical operations, and <b>xenon</b> anesthesia systems are still being proposed and designed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>xenon</b> {{chloride}} {{excimer laser}} has certain dermatological uses.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the lower}} mass noble gases, the normal stellar {{nucleosynthesis}} process inside a star does not form <b>xenon.</b> Elements more massive than iron-56 consume energy through fusion, and {{the synthesis of}} <b>xenon</b> represents no energy gain for a star. Instead, <b>xenon</b> is formed during supernova explosions, in classical nova explosions, by the slow neutron capture process (s-process) in red giant stars that have exhausted their core hydrogen and entered the asymptotic giant branch, and from radioactive decay, for example by beta decay of extinct iodine-129 and spontaneous fission of thorium, uranium, and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Xenon</b> has {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than N2O as an anesthetic. Thus, {{it can be}} used with oxygen in concentrations that have a lower risk of hypoxia. Unlike nitrous oxide (N2O), <b>xenon</b> is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as environmentally friendly. Though recycled in modern systems, <b>xenon</b> vented to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.|$|E
5|$|<b>Xenon</b> is the {{preferred}} propellant for ion propulsion of spacecraft because it has low ionization potential per atomic weight and can be stored as a liquid at near room temperature (under high pressure), yet easily evaporated to feed the engine. <b>Xenon</b> is inert, environmentally friendly, and less corrosive to an ion engine than other fuels such as mercury or caesium. <b>Xenon</b> was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s. It was later employed as a propellant for JPL's Deep Space 1 probe, Europe's SMART-1 spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines on NASA's Dawn Spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|<b>Xenon</b> upregulates hypoxia {{inducible}} factor 1 alpha (HIF1a).|$|E
5|$|Although <b>xenon</b> is {{rare and}} {{relatively}} expensive to extract from the Earth's atmosphere, {{it has a}} number of applications.|$|E
5|$|Hyperpolarized <b>xenon</b> {{can be used}} {{by surface}} chemists. Normally, it is {{difficult}} to characterize surfaces with NMR because signals from a surface are overwhelmed by signals from the atomic nuclei in the bulk of the sample, which are much more numerous than surface nuclei. However, nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be selectively polarized by transferring spin polarization to them from hyperpolarized <b>xenon</b> gas. This makes the surface signals strong enough to measure and distinguish from bulk signals.|$|E
5|$|Neon, argon, krypton, and <b>xenon</b> are {{obtained}} from air using {{the methods of}} liquefaction of gases, to convert elements to a liquid state, and fractional distillation, to separate mixtures into component parts. Helium is typically produced by separating it from natural gas, and radon is isolated from the radioactive decay of radium compounds. The prices of the noble gases are influenced by their natural abundance, with argon being the cheapest and <b>xenon</b> the most expensive. As an example, the adjacent table lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas.|$|E
5|$|Noble gases, having {{complete}} electron shells, defied reaction {{with other}} elements until 1962 when Neil Bartlett reported synthesis of <b>xenon</b> hexafluoroplatinate; <b>xenon</b> difluoride, tetrafluoride, hexafluoride, and multiple oxyfluorides have been isolated since then. Among other noble gases, krypton forms a difluoride, and radon and fluorine generate a solid suspected to be radon difluoride. Binary fluorides of lighter noble gases are exceptionally unstable: argon and hydrogen fluoride combine under extreme conditions to give argon fluorohydride. Helium and neon have no long-lived fluorides, and no neon fluoride {{has ever been}} observed; helium fluorohydride has been detected for milliseconds at high pressures and low temperatures.|$|E
