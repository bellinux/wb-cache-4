40|$|This essay briefly {{discusses}} {{the early history}} of Tibetan printing by comparing some facets of this subject with the European phenomenon. Printing started to be a means of dissemination of texts in Tibet and Europe at roughly the same time. Recent research indicates that although printing in Tibet {{does not seem to have}} had the kind of socially transformative effects highlighted in Elisabeth Eisenstein’s study, it did have some important consequences and also similarities with the European printing history. This article also presents a Marie Sklodowska Curie project on Tibetan xylographs entitled Tibetan Book Evolution and Technology (TiBET), which was carried out at the University of Cambridge (Mongolia and Inner Asia Studies Unit) from 2013 to 2015. This paper focuses in particular on one of the aspects of the above-mentioned project, that is to say, the craftsmen who worked on sixteenth century xylographs and their importance for the identification of Tibetan prints. These artists were allowed to sign their work, a peculiarity that was typical of the earliest stage of printing and is extremely relevant for locating the printing house where a certain <b>xylograph</b> was produced. By comparing the different signatures and patterns of carving, writing or drawing, we might learn to distinguish the diverse style of each artist. This would help us in identifying those who worked on xylographs that lack signatures and do not mention them in colophons. From these prints we can also extract information about the craftsmen and the printing projects with which they were associated...|$|E
40|$|Translator横浜In Book 7 two {{key events}} take place: the {{encounter}} between Hektor and Aias, and {{the gathering of}} the dead. Although Book 7 clearly is not as well-engineered, moving and pivotal as Book 6, the bright velocities of the rhythm and the supple tones of the melody, which seem to alternately squeeze and {{let go of the}} language which robustly and chromatically fills out the beadlike arrays of its hexametric structure, tell us it’s Homer. The Iliad generates more wonder each time one comes into contact with the magic of its poetry, for one becomes lost among the perpetually evolving and tangible beauties of its musical whirlpools and oscillating rhythms, its chiseled curves and balletic twirls. Adventuring through the ‘clang tinkle boomhammer’ of James Joyce’s tour de force, Ulysses, one comes across the phrase, ‘a chemistry of stars’. One may perceive an ‘amino charm’ and ‘harmonic structure’ in Richard Powers’ musical novel, The Gold Bug Variations, where DNA, a Bach fugue and love intervolve. In one of Emily Dickinson’s poems, we hear and see the dynamic and precious lines, ‘The prism never held the hues, it only heard them play’. What do all of the above quotes have in common? All could, in fact, be applied to the poetry of Homer, for Homer’s universe is both mysteriously remote, yet intensely intimate, bright and strident, yet tender and crepuscular, melodic and fluid, yet sudden and syncopated. One might receive an impression or notice an effect of this type in a <b>xylograph</b> of Ando Hiroshige from his series, Meishi Edo Hyakkei (A Hundred Famous Views of Edo). In ‘Asakusagawa Shubi-no matsu Ommayagashi’, we see the distant dots of stars and a proximate boat with closed green cane blinds. Between the seeming calm of river and sky twists a dragon-shaped pine tree, one unbroken (unlike previous ones) by hurricanes. The crisp cusp of the Moon is barely visible. Did a similar slice of outer space arc over the plain of Troy more than three thousand years ago, that evening when Ajax was given the sword on which he would ultimately fall...|$|E
40|$|U Senju je koncem 15. st. utemeljena tiskara i u njoj je od 1494. do 1508. godine glagoljskim slovima tiskano sedam knjiga, od kojih su se očuvali rijetki originalni primjerci. Prvi je iz tiska izašao Misal 7. kolovoza 1494. godine, od kojega su očuvana tri originalna nepotpuna primjerka i jedan {{fragment}} (dvolist). Malo je poznato kad su i kako otkrivani Senjski misal i njegovi originalni primjerci. Autorica smatra da spomenuta činjenica zaslužuje pozornost i da je jubilej Senjanina akademika Milana Moguša prilika da se ona istraži. To više što je zalaganjem M. Moguša Akademija 1994. godine objavila faksimilni pretisak Misala i njime obilježila 500. obljetnicu izlaska iz tiska. In 1849, Ivan Berčić of Zadar {{made the}} first step towards {{the discovery of the}} first trace of the glagolitic Missal of Senj of 1494 in the village of Ugljan on the island of Ugljan in the vicinity of Zadar. There he found one half of one leaf of the book. In 1854, in another village on the island of Ugljan, he discovered two more leaves of the Missal, while in 1863, his former student, Srećko Bakija, “in whom, the moment I set my eyes on him, I saw the so-much-desired missal” (Berčić), brought him an incomplete copy (notched at the beginning and at the end) from the village of Pakoštane. He wrote a very detailed description of this copy and concluded that it had been printed in Senj in 1507. Twenty-four years after Berčić’s death, a copy of the Missal, complete with detailed colophon, emerged in Ludwig Rosenthal’s second- hand bookshop in Munich; in the book, its publication date was recorded: 1494. Miseca avgusta 7. ovi misali biše početi i svršeni v Senji… (in 1494, on the 7 th day of the month of August, this missal was commenced and finished in Senj…). The copy was bought for the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest at an auction held on 1 May 1895, despite Vatroslav Jagić’s endeavours for it to be bought for the University Library in Zagreb. During the auction, the price grew too quickly, so that Zagreb could not compete. Hence, {{at the beginning of his}} extensive description of the Missal, Hungarian Slavist Oszkár Ásbóth emphasised that the book was “of exceptional value” and that considerable material sacrifice accompanied its acquisition. In 1982, conventual friar Josip Vlahović discovered one rather incomplete copy in the library of the conventual Franciscan friars in the town of Cres on the island of Cres. In 1984, Andrej Kruming discovered a fragment of the Missal of Senj (leaves 131 – 133) in Odessa (the State Scientific Library of Odessa, sign. 1 - 8814.). This fragment is of importance, since it is the (only) preserved canonical crucifix in <b>xylograph.</b> The facts related to the discovery of the Glagolitic Missal of Senj of 1494 and the state of preservation of the rare original copies thereof present arguments in favour of the importance of publishing a facsimile reprint. Regarding the publishing itself, Milan Moguš, Fellow of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, who was born in Senj, played an essential role in the reprinting of the missal...|$|E

50|$|In August 1950, Nebesky-Wojkowitz {{set off for}} Kalimpong and did {{not return}} to Europe until February 1953 (nos. 16, 18). His long stay there gave him access to many texts on {{protector}} deities and allowed him to benefit from the council of Tibetan scholars who sought refuge during the Chinese incursion. One can find a vivid description of events at that time in a book he intended for non-specialists (no. 20). Nebesky-Wojkowitz published the results of his research in several articles, and especially in his most important work, Oracles and Demons of Tibet: The Cult and Iconography of the Tibetan Protective Deities (no. 22). This voluminous 666-page book is widely considered a foundational study of Tibetan popular religion and deity cults, making it an indispensable compendium for all those who deal with protector deities. Nebesky-Wojkowitz also made several excursions among the Lepcha of Sikkim (nos. 7, 10, 14, 15). In 1954 he spent five months in Leiden identifying the collection of Lepcha manuscripts at the National Museum of Ethnology, where he had already made a list of the titles of Tibetan <b>xylographs</b> and manuscripts during a seven-month stay in 1953.|$|R
50|$|Lamotte's {{translation}} {{is based on}} the Tibetan version of Bkah-gyur, located in the Otani Kanjur Catalogue, Kyoto, No. 843. and the book also catalogs variations and additions in the Chinese version of Xuanzang's (Hsüan-tsang) text as found in the Taishō Tripiṭaka. The passages of the direct translations of the Tibetan text are in normal large print characters while the Chinese-origin text is in smaller print text. The most important variations in the Chinese text are located in the right-hand columns while those of less importance are written in small characters and interspersed in the translation of the Tibetan text. In this text Lamotte places Sanskrit original words, derived from the original sources, in italics and within brackets after the French translations of those terms. These terms originate from direct quotations of fragments quoted in the Śikṣāsamuccaya of Śāntideva. Photocopies of Tibetan <b>xylographs</b> of the work are interspersed between the early chapters of the book. Lamotte stated that because others were unable to rebuild the original Sanskrit text, he did not attempt to rebuild the original Sanskrit text.

50|$|According to Ulrich von Schroeder for the {{identification}} of Mahasiddhas inscribed with Tibetan names {{it is necessary to}} reconstruct the Indian names. This is a very difficult task because the Tibetans are very inconsistent with the transcription or translation of Indian personal names and therefore many different spellings do exist. When comparing the different Tibetan texts on mahasiddhas, we can see that the transcription or translation of the names of the Indian masters into the Tibetan language was inconsistent and confused. The most unsettling example is an illustrated Tibetan block print from Mongolia about the mahasiddhas, where the spellings in the text vary greatly from the captions of the <b>xylographs.</b> To quote a few examples: Kankaripa Skt. is named Kam ka li/Kangga la pa; Goraksa Skt.: Go ra kha/Gau raksi; Tilopa Skt.: Ti la blo ba/Ti lla pa; Dukhandi Skt.: Dha khan dhi pa/Dwa kanti; Dhobipa Skt.: Tom bhi pa/Dhu pi ra; Dengipa (CSP 31): Deng gi pa / Tinggi pa; Dhokaripa Skt.: Dho ka ra / Dhe ki ri pa; Carbaripa (Carpati) Skt.: Tsa ba ri pa/Tsa rwa ti pa; Sakara Skt.: Phu rtsas ga’/Ka ra pa; Putalipa Skt.: Pu ta la/Bu ta li, etc. In the same illustrated Tibetan text we find another inconsistency: the alternate use of transcription and translation. Examples are Nagarjuna Skt.: Na ga’i dzu na/Klu sgrub; Aryadeva (Karnaripa) Skt.: Ka na ri pa/’Phags pa lha; and Ghantapa Skt.: Ghanda pa/rDo rje dril bu pa, to name a few.|$|R

In Ernesto Cardinal’s epic poem, Cosmic Canticle (tr. by John Lyons), the poet asks the question, ‘Do we know the universe’s metabolism?’ If {{it is possible to}} FEEL the metabolism of the universe, I say letting the poetry of Homer flow through one’s spirit may provide the opportunity, for the music of the Iliad is quantic like the twilight flashes of fireflies, and its rhythms push and pull and twist throughout its beautiful adamantine structure like the colored planets in their invisible orbits. Taking a look at one of Ando Hiroshige’s ukiyoe <b>xylographs</b> (floating world woodblock prints) from One Hundred Views of Edo, ‘View from the Massaki Shrine of the Uchigawa Sekiya-no sato Village and the Suijin-no mori Shrine’, one can also feel a potent and expansive rhythm, a supreme invisible flow. A kind of fragile sadness subsumes the scene, punctuated by the male and female twin peaks of Tsukubayama, with the crepuscular light washing over the blue mountain and the green grove girded by the disintegrating red paste-like horizon. Yet, unlike Andromakhe and Hektor, we know the eastern and western peaks will be together forever...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with one chapter of the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinayavastu namely Poṣadhasthāpanavastu. There are four different sections of this thesis: the diplomatic edition of Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya Poṣadhasthāpanavastu, the Tibetan comparative edition, a translation, and an analysis {{in comparison with the}} Pāli Khandhaka. The diplomatic Edition of MSVP is made based on the Gilgit manuscript dated around seventh to tenth century CE. There are three different <b>xylographs</b> compared of Tibetan poṣadhasthāpanavastu, i. e., Derge, Lhasa and sTog. The comparison between MSVP and Pākh. Kd made clear that there are some significant differences in the two parts that I have inspected in detail. Regarding the uddāna, I found the reason why they put two uddāna in MSVP. The uddāna used by Mūlasarvāstivādin are very different from that of Pāli tradition. It might well be that Mūlasarvāstivādin uddāna served as a reference to the unabridged text, enabling the readers to find that sūtra, in contrast to the Pāli tradition that uses uddāna for the sake of reciting and memorizing. As for the grounds of suspension, I found that both traditions base their grounds of accusation with the āpatti prescribed in the vinaya and the vipatti. These vinaya rules are also connected and can be grouped into those vipattis too. However, there are two vipattis that need to take into account differently that is to say, śīlavipatti and dṛṣṭivipatti. Practically, only śīlavipatti seems to be the core grounds of suspension; nonetheless, it is not likely we will have the suspension of uposatha/poṣadha nowadays...|$|R
