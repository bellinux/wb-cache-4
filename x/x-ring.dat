25|$|The <b>X-ring</b> {{chain is}} a {{specialized}} type of sealed roller chain used to transfer mechanical power. Like the O-ring chain {{it is used}} in high performance motorcycles. It uses <b>X-ring</b> seal to keep lubricant(usually grease) in place.|$|E
25|$|The <b>X-ring</b> {{chain is}} {{developed}} from O-ring chain {{which in turn}} is developed from non O-ring chain. While the regular O-ring chain has high durability, it also has more friction(compared to other types of roller chain) due to distortion of the O-ring due to pressure from the inner and outer chain plates. This results in loss of power in the transmission. Therefore, <b>X-ring</b> chain was developed by replacing O-ring seal with <b>X-ring</b> seal which increased durability and greatly reduced friction.|$|E
25|$|Like the O-ring chain it has {{sealing rings}} which keep the {{contaminant}} (dirt) out, and lubricant {{in between the}} pins and bushings. However, unlike O-ring chain, it has X shaped seal which does not increase surface area (which is {{in contact with the}} chain plates) when under pressure. Therefore the friction in <b>X-ring</b> chain does not increase much when pressure is applied by the chain plates.|$|E
30|$|We {{consider}} a classification problem for Darboux-integrable hyperbolic semidiscrete equations. In particular, we obtain a complete description {{for a special}} class of equations admitting four-dimensional characteristic <b>x-rings</b> and two-dimensional characteristic n-rings. For all described equations, the corresponding x- and n-integrals are constructed.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the structure and properties of right subdirectly irreducible rings which are either local or self-injective. The rings in the latter class form a special case of the so-called right PF rings. By em-ploying the notion of Feller's <b>X-rings,</b> it is proved that right PF <b>X-rings</b> are finite direct sums of full matrix rings over self-injective right subdirectly irreducible rings. Thus, whether or not right PF <b>X-rings</b> are left PF depends on the answer to the same question for the more elementary case of self-injective right subdirectly irreducible rings. For a discussion of artinian and noetherian RSI rings, see [2 j. 1 * Notation and preliminaries * All rings considered have an identity and all modules are unitary. A module MR is JS-subdirectly irreducible if the intersection of all nonzero submodules of M is nonzero, which will then be called the heart of MR. A ring R is RSI (right subdirectly irreducible) if RB is jβ-subdirectly irreducible. The heart H of a RSI ring R is a two sided ideal. These and some of the following definitions and observations are given in [2] and we rewrite them for completeness. We will always use the following notation is connection with a RSI ring R. H = heart, N — Hι = {x e R:xH = 0 }, D = Horn * (HB, HB), R = injective hull of RR, K = Hoiϊijj (R, R) and L = {f e K: ker / Φ 0 }. In addition, for a local ring R, J will always denote the unique maximal right ideal. A ring R will be termed self-injective if RR is injective. We state the following theorem showing the relationship betwee...|$|R
2500|$|Since <b>X-ring</b> {{chains are}} self lubricating(Internally) and have low friction, {{they are more}} durable and require less {{maintenance}}. However still, maintenance [...] is required - especially {{on the outside of}} the X-rings, as they are very sensitive to damage. Special care must be taken in cleaning as they have complex construction and rubber rings can be damaged by solvent.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to those awarded to students, there is one Honorary <b>X-Ring</b> awarded annually. The <b>X-Ring</b> Eligibility Policy states that this recipient must not already hold an <b>X-Ring,</b> and must demonstrate outstanding contribution to the Xaverian community and be exemplary of the Xaverian motto: [...] "Quaecumque sunt vera" [...] (Whatsoever things are true).|$|E
5000|$|Oland Stadium is {{the home}} field of the St. Francis Xavier University X-Men. Located in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, it {{is known for its}} great crowds and golden <b>X-Ring</b> track. The golden track and X at mid-field is a symbol of the great <b>X-Ring</b> {{tradition}} at StFX. The [...] "Smile you're at X" [...] hill is one of the unique features of watching a game at Oland Stadium.|$|E
50|$|St. Francis Xavier University ceremonially {{awards to}} {{students}} a distinctive <b>X-Ring.</b> The ring is awarded on December 3 (Saint Francis Xavier's feast day) {{of each year}} before the students' graduation. On average, more than 95% of the graduating class opt for the ring.|$|E
50|$|St. Francis Xavier University {{is located}} in Antigonish. St. Francis Xavier has 4,267 {{full-time}} students and 500 part-time students. It was named as the best undergraduate university in Canada by Maclean's magazine for five consecutive years (2002-2006). St. Francis Xavier is also well known for the <b>X-Ring</b> and the Coady International Institute.|$|E
50|$|The <b>X-Ring</b> is {{presented}} to students in a ceremony during the afternoon, which only recipients may attend. Traditionally, this ceremony {{was held in the}} University Chapel; however, since 2006 it has been hosted in Charles V. Keating Millennium Centre. There is typically a live video link of the ceremony available for family and friends to watch from across the world or from a large screen set up in the Oland Centre on campus.|$|E
50|$|For sealings, {{there are}} {{variations}} in cross-section design other than circular. The shape can have different profiles, an x-shaped profile, commonly called the <b>X-ring,</b> Q-ring, {{or by the}} trademarked name Quad Ring. When squeezed upon installation, they seal with 4 contact surfaces—2 small contact surfaces {{on the top and}} bottom. This contrasts with the standard O-ring's comparatively larger single contact surfaces top and bottom. X-rings are most commonly used in reciprocating applications, where they provide reduced running and breakout friction and reduced risk of spiraling when compared to O-rings.|$|E
30|$|In {{the next}} lemma, we give {{conditions}} for equation (20) {{to have a}} four-dimensional characteristic <b>x-ring.</b>|$|E
30|$|For the {{characteristic}} <b>x-ring,</b> {{we have to}} consider two cases: f_t_xt_x= 0, that is, f is a linear function of t_x, and f_t_xt_x 0, that is, f is a nonlinear function of t_x.|$|E
30|$|Let us {{formulate}} {{necessary and}} sufficient conditions so that equation (3) has a characteristic <b>x-ring</b> of dimension {{four and a}} characteristic n-ring of dimension two. First, we consider the n-ring. The following theorem was proved in [12].|$|E
30|$|We {{consider}} semidiscrete hyperbolic equations that admit nontrivial x- and n-integrals, so-called Darboux-integrable equations [18]. It was proved in [9] that a semidiscrete hyperbolic {{equation is}} Darboux integrable if {{and only if}} its characteristic x- and n-rings are finite-dimensional. Description of all equations with characteristic x- and n-rings of finite dimensions is a very difficult classification problem. The majority of known Darboux-integrable semidiscrete equations possess x- and n-rings of dimensions not exceeding five (see [14, 16, 19]). Necessary and sufficient conditions for a characteristic <b>x-ring</b> to be four-dimensional were obtained in [20] (also see [21] for a characterization of five-dimensional characteristic x-rings). In [12] the conditions for a two-dimensional characteristic n-ring were obtained. We use these conditions to explicitly derive integrable equations with four-dimensional characteristic x-rings and two-dimensional characteristic n-rings.|$|E
