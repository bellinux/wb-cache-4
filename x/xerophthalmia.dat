25|$|The {{salivary glands}} and tear glands have a {{radiation}} tolerance of about 30Gy in 2Gy fractions, a dose which is exceeded by most radical {{head and neck}} cancer treatments. Dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (<b>xerophthalmia)</b> can become irritating long-term problems and severely reduce the patient's quality of life. Similarly, sweat glands in treated skin (such as the armpit) tend to stop working, and the naturally moist vaginal mucosa is often dry following pelvic irradiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} {{that led to}} golden rice was conducted {{with the goal of}} helping children who suffer from vitamin A deficiency (VAD). In 2005, 190 million children and 19 million pregnant women, in 122 countries, were estimated to be affected by VAD. VAD is responsible for 1–2 million deaths, 500,000 cases of irreversible blindness and millions of cases of <b>xerophthalmia</b> annually. Children and pregnant women are at highest risk. Vitamin A is supplemented orally and by injection in areas where the diet is deficient in vitamin A.|$|E
25|$|Retinol, {{also known}} as Vitamin A1, is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary {{supplement}}. As a supplement {{it is used to}} treat and prevent vitamin A deficiency, especially that which is resulting in <b>xerophthalmia.</b> In areas where deficiency is common a single large dose is recommended to those at high risk {{a couple of times a}} year. It is also used to prevent further issues in those who have measles. It is used by mouth or injection into a muscle.|$|E
25|$|Xerostomia may {{be caused}} by {{autoimmune}} damage to the salivary glands. Sjögren's syndrome is one such disease, and it causes other symptoms, including <b>xerophthalmia</b> (dry eyes), dry vagina, fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain). Females are more likely to suffer from autoimmune disease, and 90% of people with Sjögren's syndrome are women. Primary Sjögren's syndrome is the combination of dry eyes and xerostomia. Secondary Sjögren's syndrome is identical to primary form but {{with the addition of a}} combination of other connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Henrik Sjögren (1899–1986), an {{ophthalmologist}} in Jönköping, Sweden, {{observed a}} patient with low secretions from the lacrimal and salivary glands. Sjögren introduced the term keratoconjunctivitis sicca for the symptom of dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis). In 1933, he published his doctoral thesis, describing 19 females, {{most of whom were}} postmenopausal and had arthritis, showing clinical and pathological manifestations of the syndrome. Sjögren clarifies that keratoconjunctivitis sicca, resulting from water deficiency, had no relation to <b>xerophthalmia,</b> resulting from vitamin A deficiency. Sjögren's thesis was not well received as the Board of Examiners criticized some clinical aspects.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A {{deprived}} rats {{can be kept}} in good {{general health}} with supplementation of retinoic acid. This reverses the growth-stunting effects of vitamin A deficiency, as well as early stages of <b>xerophthalmia.</b> However, such rats show infertility (in both male and females) and continued degeneration of the retina, showing that these functions require retinal or retinol, which are interconvertible but which cannot be recovered from the oxidized retinoic acid. The requirement of retinol to rescue reproduction in vitamin A deficient rats is now known {{to be due to}} a requirement for local synthesis of retinoic acid from retinol in testis and embryos.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{function}} of retinal as a visual chromophore, {{one of the earliest}} and specific manifestations of vitamin A deficiency is impaired vision, particularly in reduced light – night blindness. Persistent deficiency gives rise to a series of changes, the most devastating of which occur in the eyes. Some other ocular changes are referred to as <b>xerophthalmia.</b> First there is dryness of the conjunctiva (xerosis) as the normal lacrimal and mucus-secreting epithelium is replaced by a keratinized epithelium. This is followed by the build-up of keratin debris in small opaque plaques (Bitot's spots) and, eventually, erosion of the roughened corneal surface with softening and destruction of the cornea (keratomalacia) and leading to total blindness. Other changes include impaired immunity (increased risk of ear infections, urinary tract infections, Meningococcal disease), hyperkeratosis (white lumps at hair follicles), keratosis pilaris and squamous metaplasia of the epithelium lining the upper respiratory passages and urinary bladder to a keratinized epithelium. In relation to dentistry, a deficiency in vitamin A may lead to enamel hypoplasia.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hyposalivation is based predominantly on the clinical signs and symptoms. There is little correlation between symptoms and objective tests of salivary flow, such as sialometry. This test {{is simple and}} noninvasive, and involves measurement of all the saliva a patient can produce during a certain time, achieved by dribbling into a container. Sialometery can yield measures of stimulated salivary flow or unstimulated salivary flow. Stimulated salivary flow rate is calculated using a stimulant such as 10% citric acid dropped onto the tongue, and collection of all the saliva that flows {{from one of the}} parotid papillae over five or ten minutes. Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate more closely correlates with symptoms of xerostomia than stimulated salivary flow rate. Sialography involves introduction of radio-opaque dye such as iodine into the duct of a salivary gland. It may show blockage of a duct due to a calculus. Salivary scintiscanning using technetium is rarely used. Other medical imaging that may be involved in the investigation include chest x-ray (to exclude sarcoidosis), ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (to exclude Sjögren's syndrome or neoplasia). A minor salivary gland biopsy, usually taken from the lip, may be carried out if there is a suspicion of organic disease of the salivary glands. Blood tests and urinalysis may be involved to exclude a number of possible causes. To investigate <b>xerophthalmia,</b> the Schirmer test of lacrimal flow may be indicated. Slit-lamp examination may also be carried out.|$|E

50|$|<b>Xerophthalmia</b> usually {{implies a}} {{destructive}} dryness of the conjunctival epithelium due to dietary vitamin A deficiency — a rare condition in developed countries, but still causing much damage in developing countries. Other forms of dry eye {{are associated with}} aging, poor lid closure, scarring from a previous injury, or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome, and these can all cause chronic conjunctivitis. Radioiodine therapy can also induce <b>xerophthalmia,</b> often transiently, although in some patients late onset or persistent <b>xerophthalmia</b> has been observed.|$|E

50|$|Malnutrition {{can cause}} various effects by {{deficiency}} {{of one or}} more nutrients. For example, vitamin A deficiency causes symptoms such as <b>xerophthalmia</b> (dry eyes) and night blindness.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with poor}} diet {{there is a}} large amount of {{infection}} and disease present in many developing communities. Infection is very draining on vitamin A reserves and this vitamin A deficit leaves the individual more susceptible to infection (Combs, 1991); increased documentation of <b>xerophthalmia</b> has been seen after an outbreak of measles and the varying stages of <b>xerophthalmia</b> become a good reference point for the extent of deficiency (with mortality increasing with severity of the eye disease). In a longitudinal study of preschool Indonesian children it was found that susceptibility to disease increased nine times when severe VAD was present (Dole 2009).|$|E

50|$|<b>Xerophthalmia</b> {{caused by}} a severe vitamin A {{deficiency}} is described by pathologic dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea. The conjunctiva becomes dry, thick and wrinkled.

50|$|Vitamin A {{deficiency}} (VAD) or hypovitaminosis A {{is a lack}} {{of vitamin}} A in blood and tissues. It is common in poorer countries but rarely seen in more developed countries. Nyctalopia (night blindness) {{is one of the first}} signs of VAD. <b>Xerophthalmia,</b> keratomalacia, and complete blindness can also occur since Vitamin A has a major role in phototransduction.|$|E
5000|$|In 1942, she {{accompanied}} Ida Mann to Oxford as her assistant, and in 1947 she succeeded her, as Margaret Ogilvie {{reader in}} ophthalmology, at Somerville College, Oxford, {{and head of}} the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology. [...] One of her main concerns was deficiencies of vitamin A causing <b>xerophthalmia</b> and leading to blindness in the Third World.|$|E
50|$|The {{damage to}} the cornea in vitamin A {{associated}} <b>xerophthalmia</b> {{is quite different from}} {{damage to the}} retina {{at the back of the}} globe, a type of damage which can also be due to lack of vitamin A, but which is caused by lack of other forms of vitamin A which work in the visual system. <b>Xerophthalmia</b> from hypovitaminosis A is specifically due to lack of the hormone-like vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid, since (along with certain growth-stunting effects) the condition can be reversed in vitamin A deficient rats by retinoic acid supplementation (however the retinal damage continues). Since retinoic acid cannot be reduced to retinal or retinol, these effects on the cornea must be specific to retinoic acid. This is in keeping with retinoic acid's known requirement for good health in epithelial cells, such as those in the cornea. The term is from Greek Ξηροφθαλμία = ξηρός, dry and οφθαλμός, eye.|$|E
50|$|Night {{blindness}} {{caused by}} VAD {{has been associated}} with the loss of goblet cells in the conjunctiva, a membrane covering the outer surface of the eye. Goblet cells are responsible for secretion of mucus, and their absence results in <b>xerophthalmia,</b> a condition where the eyes fail to produce tears. Dead epithelial and microbial cells accumulate on the conjunctiva and form debris that can lead to infection and possibly blindness.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Xerophthalmia</b> usually affects {{children}} under {{nine years old}} and [...] "accounts for 20,000-100,000 new cases of childhood blindness {{each year in the}} developing countries." [...] The disease is largely found in developing countries like many of those in Africa and Southern Asia. The condition is not congenital and develops {{over the course of a}} few months as the lacrimal glands fail to produce tears. Other conditions involved in the progression already stated include the appearance of Bitot's spots, which are clumps of keratin debris that build up inside the conjunctiva and night blindness, which precedes corneal ulceration and total blindness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{common cause}} of {{blindness}} in developing countries is VAD. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 13.8 million children to have some degree of visual loss related to VAD. Night blindness and its worsened condition, <b>xerophthalmia,</b> are markers of VAD, as it {{can also lead to}} impaired immune function, cancer, and birth defects. Collections of keratin in the conjunctiva, known as Bitot's spots, are also seen. Imtiaz's sign is the earliest ocular sign of VAD. Conjunctival epithelial defects occur around lateral aspect of the limbus in subclinical stage of VAD. These conjunctival epithelial defects are not even visible on a biomicroscope, but they take up black stain and become readily visible after instillation of kajal (surma); this is called [...] "Imtiaz's sign".|$|E
50|$|The {{major cause}} is {{roughage}} which include few animal sources of pre-formed vitamin A. In addition to dietary problems, {{there are other}} causes of VAD. Iron deficiency can affect vitamin A uptake. Excess alcohol consumption can deplete vitamin A, and a stressed liver may be more susceptible to vitamin A toxicity. People who consume large amounts of alcohol should seek medical advice before taking vitamin A supplements. In general, people should also seek medical advice before taking vitamin A supplements {{if they have any}} condition associated with fat malabsorption such as pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, tropical sprue and biliary obstruction. Other causes of Vitamin A deficiency are inadequate intake, fat malabsorption, or liver disorders. Deficiency impairs immunity and hematopoiesis and causes rashes and typical ocular effects (e.g., <b>xerophthalmia,</b> night blindness).|$|E
