40|$|The present paper {{reports on}} the {{structural}} change and rheological behavior of mixtures of macromolecular suspensions (guar and <b>xanthan</b> <b>gums)</b> in crossflow microfiltration processing. Mixtures in suspension of guar and <b>xanthan</b> <b>gums</b> at low concentrations (1, 000 ppm) and different proportions were processed by microfiltration with membrane of nominal pore size of 0. 4 mu m. The rheological behavior of the mixtures was investigated in rotational viscometers at two different temperatures, 25 and 40 C, {{at the beginning and}} at the end of each experiment. The shear stress (t) in function of the shear rate (gamma) was fitted and analyzed with the power-law model. All the mixtures showed flow behavior index values (n) lower than 1, characterizing non-Newtonian fluids (pseudoplastic). The samples of both mixtures and permeates were also analyzed by absorbency spectroscopy in infrared radiation. The absorbency analysis showed that there is good synergism between <b>xanthan</b> and guar <b>gums</b> without structure modifications or gel formation in the concentration process by microfiltration.

The protein component of the rye material appears to {{have no effect on}} the capacity of the complex to enhance loaf volume because deproteinization does not result in a loss of the complex's activity. Ferulic acid residues of the water-soluble pentosans of rye or wheat were not involved in the interactions leading to larger loaf volumes because removal of these moieties or the addition of an excess of ferulic acid in the baking formula did not impair the role of the rye protein-pentosan material in gluten-starch systems. The action of the nonstarch polysaccharides probably is related to an increase in dough viscosity because similar baking results were found when oat beta-glucan, corn bran hemicellulose, or <b>xanthan</b> <b>gums</b> were used. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|Commercial {{tomato ketchup}} has an additive, usually <b>xanthan</b> <b>gum,</b> {{which gives the}} {{condiment}} a pseudoplastic or [...] "shear thinning" [...] property - more commonly known as thixotropic. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added—usually 0.5%—which can {{make it difficult to}} pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup it will lower the viscosity enabling the sauce to flow. A common method to getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. A technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.|$|E

40|$|Six {{commercial}} food thickeners, {{based on}} starch, and guar and <b>xanthan</b> <b>gums,</b> were investigated for their moisture absorption properties. The thickeners {{were exposed to}} 100 % relative humidity as well as soaked in water for selected time periods. The gum-based thickeners dissolved in water to yield 100 % water solubility index. The water absorption index of the starch-based thickeners ranged from 14. 7 to 18. 0 g/g dry solids of thickener. The starch-based thickeners sorbed less moisture than the gum-based ones, with the xanthan gum-based thickeners having the highest sorptive ability on mass basis. The Peleg model was the most suitable (r(2) = 0. 966 - 0. 997) of the sorption models investigated to describe the sorption data. The diffusion rate constant of the thickeners ranged from 8. 7 to 13. 5 day%(- 1), while the equilibrium moisture content was between 35. 7 and 46. 8 %.

50|$|In foods, <b>xanthan</b> <b>gum</b> {{is common}} in salad {{dressings}} and sauces. It helps to prevent oil separation by stabilizing the emulsion, {{although it is not}} an emulsifier. <b>Xanthan</b> <b>gum</b> also helps suspend solid particles, such as spices. In frozen foods and beverages, <b>xanthan</b> <b>gum</b> helps create the pleasant texture in many ice creams. Toothpaste often contains <b>xanthan</b> <b>gum,</b> where it serves as a binder to keep the product uniform. <b>Xanthan</b> <b>gum</b> also helps thicken commercial egg substitutes made from egg whites, to replace the fat and emulsifiers found in yolks. It is also a preferred method of thickening liquids for those with swallowing disorders, since it does not change the color or flavor of foods or beverages at typical use levels. In gluten-free baking <b>xanthan</b> <b>gum</b> is used to give the dough or batter the stickiness that would otherwise be achieved with gluten.

50|$|The {{greater the}} ratio of <b>xanthan</b> <b>gum</b> added to a liquid, the thicker the liquid will become. An {{emulsion}} can be formed with as little as 0.1% (by weight).

40|$|Lactic acid {{fermentation}} {{during the}} production of skim milk and whole fat set-style yogurt was continuously monitored by measuring pH. The modified Gompertz model was successfully applied to describe the pH decline and viscosity development during the fermentation process. The viscosity and incubation time data were also fitted to linear models against ln(pH). The investigation of the yogurt quality improvement practices included 2 different heat treatments (80 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 10 min), 3 milk protein fortifying agents (skim milk powder, whey powder, and milk protein concentrate) added at 2. 0 %, and 4 hydrocolloids (κ-carrageenan, <b>xanthan,</b> guar <b>gum,</b> and pectin) added at 0. 01 % to whole fat and skim yogurts. Heat treatment significantly affected viscosity and acetaldehyde development without influencing incubation time and acidity. The addition of whey powder shortened the incubation time but had a detrimental effect on consistency, firmness, and overall acceptance of yogurts. On the other hand, addition of skim milk powder improved the textural quality and decreased the vulnerability of yogurts to syneresis. Anionic stabilizers (κ-carrageenan and pectin) had a poor effect on the texture and palatability of yogurts. However, neutral <b>gums</b> (<b>xanthan</b> and guar <b>gum)</b> improved texture and prevented the wheying-off defect. Skim milk yogurts exhibited longer incubation times and higher viscosities, whereas they were rated higher during sensory evaluation than whole fat yogurts. © American Dairy Science Association, 2007...|$|R

Methods and Results The best conditions for immobilization were obtained at 80 °C with gellan and <b>xanthan</b> <b>gums.</b> After 5 -week incubation, beads showed a good resistance to all tested conditions except those simultaneously including high temperature (100 °C), low NaCl (< 0 ∙ 5 mol l− 1) and extreme pH (4 / 8). To confirm the method efficiency, batch cultures with immobilized Thermosipho sp. strain AT 1272 and Thermococcus kodakarensis strain KOD 1 showed an absence of detrimental effect on cell viability and a good growth within and outside the beads.

Considerations of thickener choice on other nutrients are discussed, including potential for toxicity of nutrient loads with specific thickeners. No one thickener is appropriate for all patients, but the characteristics of the various thickeners need to be understood.
