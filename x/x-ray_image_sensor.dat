40|$|For its ease manufacturing, {{flexible}} geometry, {{and cheap}} manufacturing cost, the gas electron multiplier (GEM) detector {{can be used}} as an <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensor.</b> For this purpose, we acquired relative detection efficiencies and suggested a method to increase the detection efficiency in order to study the possibility of GEM detector as an <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensor.</b> The GEM detector system is composed of GEM foils, the instrument system, the gas system, and the negative power supply. The instrument system consists of the A 225 charge sensitive preamp, A 206 discriminator, and MCA 8000 D multichannel analyzer. For the gas system, Argon gas was mixed with CO 2 to the ratio of 8 : 2, and for the negative 2, 000 volts, the 3106 D power supply was used. The CsI-coated GEM foil was used to increase the detection efficiency. Fe- 55 was used as an x-ray source and the relative efficiency was acquired by using the ratio of GEM detector to the CdTe detector. The total count method and the energy spectrum method were used to calculate the relative efficiency. The relative detection efficiency of GEM detector for Fe- 55 by using total count method was 32 % and by using energy spectrum method, the relative efficiencies were 5, 43, 33, 37, 35, and 36 % respectively according to the energy spectrum of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 KeV. In conclusion, we found that the detection efficiency of the two layered GEM detector is insufficient for the <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensor,</b> so we suggested a CsI coated GEM foil to increase the efficiency rate and the result value was increased to 41 %...|$|E

40|$|Conventional film based X-ray imaging {{systems are}} being {{replaced}} by their digital equivalents. Different approaches are being followed by considering direct or indirect conversion, with the later technique dominating. The typical, indirect conversion, X-ray panel detector uses a phosphor for X-ray conversion coupled to a large area array of amorphous silicon based optical sensors {{and a couple of}} switching thin film transistors (TFT). The pixel information can then be readout by switching the correspondent line and column transistors, routing the signal to an external amplifier. In this work we follow an alternative approach, where the electrical switching performed by the TFT is replaced by optical scanning using a low power laser beam and a sensing/switching PINPIN structure, thus resulting in a simpler device. The optically active device is a PINPIN array, sharing both front and back electrical contacts, deposited over a glass substrate. During X-ray exposure, each sensing side photodiode collects photons generated by the scintillator screen (560 nm), charging its internal capacitance. Subsequently a laser beam (445 nm) scans the switching diodes (back side) retrieving the stored charge in a sequential way, reconstructing the image. In this paper we present recent work on the optoelectronic characterization of the PINPIN structure to be incorporated in the <b>X-ray</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensor.</b> The results from the optoelectronic characterization of the device and the dependence on scanning beam parameters are presented and discussed. Preliminary results of line scans are also presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} ten to fifteen {{years there has been}} much {{research}} in using amorphous and polycrystalline semiconductors as x-ray photoconductors in various <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> applications, most notably in flat panel x-ray imagers (FPXIs). We first outline the essential requirements for an ideal large area photoconductor for use in a FPXI, and discuss how some of the current amorphous and polycrystalline semiconductors fulfill these requirements. At present, only stabilized amorphous selenium (doped and alloyed a-Se) has been commercialized, and FPXIs based on a-Se are particularly suitable for mammography, operating at the ideal limit of high detective quantum efficiency (DQE). Further, these FPXIs can also be used in real-time, and have already been used in such applications as tomosynthesis. We discuss some of the important attributes of amorphous and polycrystalline x-ray photoconductors such as their large area deposition ability, charge collection efficiency, x-ray sensitivity, DQE, modulation transfer function (MTF) and the importance of the dark current. We show the importance of charge trapping in limiting not only the sensitivity but also the resolution of these detectors. Limitations on the maximum acceptable dark current and the corresponding charge collection efficiency jointly impose a practical constraint that many photoconductors fail to satisfy. We discuss the case of a-Se in which the dark current was brought down by three orders of magnitude by the use of special blocking layers to satisfy the dark current constraint. There are also a number of polycrystalline photoconductors, HgI 2 and PbO being good examples, that show potential for commercialization {{in the same way that}} multilayer stabilized a-Se x-ray photoconductors were developed for commercial applications. We highlight the unique nature of avalanche multiplication in a-Se and how it has led to the development of the commercial HARP video-tube. An all solid state version of the HARP has been recently demonstrated with excellent avalanche gains; the latter is expected to lead to a number of novel imaging device applications that would be quantum noise limited. While passive pixel sensors use one TFT (thin film transistor) as a switch at the pixel, active pixel sensors (APSs) have two or more transistors and provide gain at the pixel level. The advantages of APS based x-ray imagers are also discussed with examples...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{flat panel}} X-ray imagers are {{currently}} using a-Si and poly-Si thin-film-transistors (TFTs). a-Si TFT permits {{the use of}} large area substrates, however, due to the amorphous nature, the carrier mobility is very low (< 1 cm 2 /Vs). Poly-Si TFT improves the mobility (~ 150 cm 2 /Vs) but due to random grain boundaries, the defect density is still high and device performance is limited. CMOS-based active imagers have higher mobility, thus they offer higher readout speed and enable smaller pixels thanks to the smaller transistor size. Yet {{the size of the}} c-Si substrates is limited by the silicon wafer size which is 300 mm. In order to meet the size requirements of the large area X-ray imaging applications, such as mammography and chest radiography, several CMOS sensors need to be tiled. This method increases the cost and introduces more process complexity. This thesis proposes an indirect <b>X-ray</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> that employs monolithically integrated lateral PIN photodiode and readout circuits with the in-pixel ADC fabricated inside the 2 D-location-controlled SG-Si islands. The ?-Czochralski technique is used to control the position of the single grains by pulsed laser crystallization. The active areas of the devices are located inside these grains avoiding the dangling bonds at the grain boundaries. Therefore, SG technology enables high carrier mobility (?e= 600 cm 2 /Vs, ?h= 200 cm 2 /Vs) while achieving large detector area without increasing the cost by eliminating the tiling process. Proposed indirect <b>X-ray</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> is designed to be integrated with a CsI(TI) scintillator which has the emission peak at 550 nm. 250 nm-thick SG-lateral PIN photodiodes were investigated by Jaber et al. However, the absorption peak of those photodiodes was at 310 nm and the quantum efficiency was 16 % at 550 nm. In order to increase the quantum efficiency at 550 nm, depth of the depletion region had to be increased. Thus, deep-depletion photodiodes are investigated numerically and experimentally. The first 117 crystallization of the thick silicon layer is analyzed according to the process parameters; pulse wavelength, pulse duration and substrate temperature. An excimer laser (308 nm) and a green laser (515 nm) are used in transient heat transfer simulations to study the effect of the wavelength on pulsed laser crystallization. The effect of the pulse duration is also simulated by the same model. Then, only the green laser is used in the crystallization experiments of 1 ?m thick silicon layer in order to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} effects of the pulse duration. These experiments are performed using pulse durations of 300 ns and 1200 ns. 14 ?m single grains are obtained and it is shown that the surface ablation threshold increases as the pulse duration increases. Due to its longer wavelength and longer pulse duration, the green laser is an attractive alternative to the excimer laser for pulsed laser crystallization of the thick silicon layers. The last thick silicon crystallization experiments are performed to analyze the tensile stress introduced during the crystallization. Substrate temperature and pulse duration are varied to decrease the stress. Finally, at 450 °C substrate temperature and with 250 ns laser pulse duration, 8 ?m crack-free grains are obtained in 850 nm-thick silicon layer. In order to increase the depth of the depletion region, the doping profile is investigated, as well. Dopant density and energy are increased, and the photodiodes are annealed with laser fluence of 500 mJ/cm 2 and 2000 mJ /cm 2. The samples are compared according to their light on/off ratio, dark current, quantum efficiency and SNR. It is shown that, the devices annealed with 2000 mJ/cm 2 laser fluence has higher white light on/off ratio and SNR than the devices annealed with 500 mJ/cm 2. It is also shown that, higher annealing energy density enables lower dark current by removing the implantation induced defects in the silicon layer. The quantum efficiency of the deep-depletion photodiodes is found to be 66 % at 550 nm which is four times higher than the thin silicon photodiodes reported by Jaber et al. A 3 T-APS structure is used in the SG-pixel design and a parallel plate capacitor is added to the pixel in order to store the sampled column signal before the in-pixel ADC. Since the parallel plates are fabricated using the gate and the contact materials; the capacitor does not add any process complexity. The capacitance of the sampling capacitor is measured in the order of 10 fF at 100 Hz, which is consistent with the simulation results. The readout circuit and the ADC are designed to work with 3. 3 V input voltage. During the exposure, by enabling the charging TFT, the capacitor is charged and the sampled column signal is sent to the TIQ-based flash ADC, and the binary output is generated. Then the capacitor is discharged by enabling the discharging TFT. The threshold of the ADC is set to 1. 6 V. ADCs are designed using two different NMOS and PMOS dimensions (gate width and gate length) taking into account that the threshold voltage of the TFTs may change due to the fabrication variations and result in 118 ADC threshold shift. The test structures of the pixel photodiode are measured under white light illumination and the on/off ratio is found to be 7. 6 x 102 at - 2. 9 V. Another important parameter is the photodiode capacitance which defines the response time. The capacitance of the test photodiode is found to be on the order of 10 - 14 F at the reversed bias. The single grain technology is also applicable to flexible X-ray image sensors. The preliminary research is conducted to fabricate SG-lateral PIN photodiodes on silicon wafers and transfer to the flexible target substrates. Different than the standard SG processing, the thermal budget in the processing is limited. Therefore, 250 nm-thick silicon is deposited by DC magnetron sputtering technique at 100 °C instead of LPCVD Si. Two different sets of donor substrates are prepared. The first set has a 10 ?m polyimide layer on a silicon wafer and released by O 2 plasma using an etch mask. The second set has 300 nm-thick nickel layer under the polyimide and the device layer is released using a water assisted releasing technique without an additional mask. It is reported that, after the release, white light on/off ratio of the photodiodes fabricated on the first and second set of substrates are decreased 27 % and 4 %, respectively. This proves that the water assisted releasing technique introduces less stress and it is more convenient for large area flexible electronics. This method also eliminates the release mask. In this dissertation, it is shown that the SG technology has advantages, such as large area and low temperature processing and enables development of deep-depletion photodiodes and their monolithic integration with the readout electronics for cost efficient, rigid and flexible X-ray image sensors.

A value of 5. 7 line pairs per mm (lp/mm) was found for the latter, with a modulation of 10 % at the Nyquist frequency (N-y). A comparison is also given of the performance of these devices with state-of-the-art scintillator on silicon CCD dental X-ray sensors. In a bid to improve detector performance, thick layers of high quality GaAs have recently been grown by low pressure vapour phase epitaxy (LP-VPE). Hall measurements on initial samples gave free carrier concentration of 1 - 8 x 10 (11) cm(- 3). From the C-V dependence of a reverse-biased Schottky diode this material, however, a space charge density of 2 x 10 (13) cm(- 3) was measured. The observed temperature and frequency dependency of the capacitance is characteristic of the presence of deep levels and so the material is believed to have a small degree of compensation due to these levels.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{significant improvements}} of noise performance in synchronous CMOS <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> and in asynchronous energy-sensitive singlephoton X-ray imaging systems. A {{detailed analysis of}} synchronous CMOS low-noise <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> using conventional architectures reveals room for potential noise performance improvements, namely noise in switched-capacitor column-parallel amplifiers as well as imperfections in the low-pass filtering properties provided by such switched-capacitor amplifiers. A novel low-noise CMOS <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> topology with pixel-level open-loop voltage amplification alleviates the identified issues to a large extent. An <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> based on this concept has been designed and fabricated. Characterization shows that the <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> achieves a readout noise equivalent charge below 0. 9 electrons and an overall noise floor as low as 1. 4 electrons including photodiode leakage shot noise at an exposure time of 1 / 60 s. Performance parameters that are potentially compromised due {{to the use of}} open-loop amplification, such as linearity and photoresponse non-uniformity, are shown to be absolutely competitive with conventional <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> thanks to an advantageous feedback configuration for the sense node reset. Implementations of the presented topology are simple and elegant circuits requiring generally less silicon area in the periphery of the pixel field and less power consumption than conventional architectures. A second novel low-noise CMOS <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> topology combining conventional pixel-level source-followers with column-level open-loop degenerate common-source amplifiers is proposed. This architecture provides an attractive combination of very low sense node capacitance, flawless low-pass filtering of noise from the pixel-level electronics by the use of column-level open-loop amplification, and advantageous noise performance of open-loop degenerate common-source amplifiers in comparison to OTA based switched-capacitor amplifiers. Theory, circuit simulation, and measurement of implemented test circuits indicate that <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> based on this advantageous topology can potentially outperform the noise performance not only of conventional <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> architectures but even of the presented topology using pixel-level voltage amplification. Analysis of charge-sensitive amplifiers (CSA), as used in conventional asynchronous single particle and high-energy photon detectors, explains the need for a sensing device with low capacitance in order to achieve good noise performance at reasonable power consumption. For instance, photogates or buried photodiodes in combination with a scintillator layer are sensing devices for X-rays with a very low capacitance. A novel charge pulse detecting circuit using a source-follower buffer plus a band-pass filter instead of a CSA with a band-pass filter is presented in this thesis. In the case of low sensing device capacitance, comparison of this circuit vs. CSAs shows that the trade-off between noise and power consumption is systematically advantageous in favor of the presented buffered charge pulse detecting circuit. A test structure implementation of a buffered charge pulse detecting circuit in conjunction with a lateral drift field photogate has achieved an equivalent noise charge of 12 electrons. This excellent noise performance will allow X-ray single-photon imaging with very low detection threshold and excellent energy resolution. This work contributes to further progress in cutting-edge noise performance of asynchronous single-photon <b>X-ray</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> and of synchronous lowlight CMOS <b>image</b> <b>sensors.</b> Thanks to their extremely low thermal noise, the presented novel topologies of synchronous CMOS <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> will experience an immediate further improvement of noise performance in case of future progress in process technology either leading to reduced dark current of buried photodiodes or to a lower flicker noise power spectral density...|$|R

50|$|Flat panel {{detectors}} are a {{class of}} solid-state x-ray digital radiography devices similar in principle to the <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> used in digital photography and video. They are used in both projectional radiography and {{as an alternative to}} <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> intensifiers (IIs) in fluoroscopy equipment.|$|R
40|$|Direct {{conversion}} {{flat panel}} <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> based on using a photoconductor with an active matrix array provide excellent <b>images.</b> These <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> {{are suitable for}} replacing the present day x-ray film/screen cassette to capture an <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> electronically, and hence enable a clinical transition to digital radiography. The performance of these sensors depends critically on the selection and design of the photoconductor. This work quantitatively studies the combined effects of the detector geometry (pixel size and detector thickness), operating conditions (x-ray energy and applied electric field) and charge transport properties (e. g., carrier trapping and recombination) of the photoconductor on the detector performance by developing appropriate detector models. In this thesis, the models for calculating the x-ray sensitivity, resolution {{in terms of the}} modulation transfer function (MTF), detective quantum efficiency (DQE), and ghosting of <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> detectors have been developed. The modeling works are based on the physics of the individual phenomena and the systematic solution of the fundamental physical equations in the photoconductor layer: (1) semiconductor continuity equation (2) Poisson’s equation (3) trapping rate equations. The general approach of this work is to develop models in normalized coordinates to describe the results of different photoconductive <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> detectors. These models are applied to a-Se, polycrystalline HgI_ 2 and polycrystalline CdZnTe photoconductive detectors for diagnostic medical x-ray imaging applications (e,g., mammography, chest radiography and fluoroscopy). The models show a very good agreement with the experimental results. The research presented in this thesis shows that the imaging performances (e. g., sensitivity, MTF, DQE and ghosting) can be improved by insuring that the carrier with higher mobility-lifetime product is drifted towards the pixel electrodes. The carrier schubwegs have to be several times greater, and the absorption depth has to be at least two times smaller than the photoconductor thickness for achieving sufficient sensitivity. Having smaller pixels is advantageous in terms of higher sensitivity by ensuring that the carrier with the higher mobility-lifetime product is drifted towards the pixel electrodes. A model for calculating zero spatial frequency detective quantum efficiency, DQE (0), has been developed by including incomplete charge collection and x-ray interaction depth dependent conversion gain. The DQE(0) analyses of a-Se detectors for fluoroscopic applications show that there is an optimum photoconductor thickness, which maximizes the DQE(0) under a constant voltage operation. The application of DQE(0) model to different potential photoconductive detectors for fluoroscopic applications show that, in addition to high quantum efficiency, both high conversion gain and high charge collection efficiency are required to improve the DQE performance of an <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> detector. An analytical expression of MTF due to distributed carrier trapping in the bulk of the photoconductor has been derived using the trapped charge distribution across the photoconductor. Trapping of the carriers that move towards the pixel electrodes degrades the MTF performance, whereas trapping of the other type of carriers improves the sharpness of the <b>x-ray</b> <b>image.</b> The large signal model calculations in this thesis show an upper limit of small signal models of <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> detectors. The bimolecular recombination between drifting carriers plays practically no role on charge collection in a-Se detectors up to the total carrier generation rate q 0 of 10 ^ 18 EHPs/m^ 2 -s. The bimolecular recombination has practically no effect on charge collection in a-Se detectors for diagnostic medical x-ray imaging applications. A model for examining the sensitivity fluctuation mechanisms in a-Se detectors has been developed. The comparison of the model with the experimental data reveals that the recombination between trapped and the oppositely charged drifting carriers, electric field dependent charge carrier generation and x-ray induced new deep trap centers are mainly responsible for the sensitivity fluctuation in biased a-Se x-ray detectors. The modeling works in this thesis identify the important factors that limit the detector performance, which can ultimately lead to the reduction of patient exposure/dose consistent with better diagnosis for different diagnostic medical x-ray imaging modalities. The quantitative analyses presented in this thesis show that the detector structure is just as important to the overall performance of the detector as the material properties of the photoconductor itself...|$|R

Robert Street's {{research}} interests are in large-area electronic materials and devices, including amorphous silicon (a-Si), flat panel <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensors,</b> and more recently, printed organic semiconductors, flexible electronics, nanowire devices, and solar cells. He is exploring: printing technologies that could replace the photolithographic techniques traditionally {{used to create}} thin-film transistors; and solution-based organic materials to create large-area transistor and sensor arrays. His previous work on digital x-ray imaging has been commercialized through PARC spin-off dPix, the world's leading source for high-resolution a-Si sensor arrays that provide the foundation for medical, industrial, military, and security X-ray imaging. dPix was acquired by Trixell (a Siemens Medical/ Phillips Medical/ Thomson-CSF joint venture), Planar Systems, and Varian Medical in 1999. He holds 53 patents and has been honored with the American Physical Society David Adler Award and The American Institute of Physics prize for Industrial Applications of Physics. He has published more than 350 papers and articles and has served as Associate Editor of both the Journal of Materials Research and Solid State Science and Technology.

Dr. Robert Street holds a Ph. D. and B. S. in physics, both from Cambridge University in England. He joined PARC in 1976. Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells have a complex physical structure made up of nanoscale domains of donors and acceptors, each of which is a disordered material. Understanding the electronic properties has proved controversial, with several competing models of transport and recombination. The talk will focus on the role of localized electronic states introduced by the disorder or by impurities. Disorder introduces exponential band tails and deep traps in the electronic structure and experiments show that these {{play a central role in}} the electronic transport and recombination mechanisms. Trap creation induced by irradiation is also shown to cause degradation of some solar cells...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) x-ray luggage- {{screening system}} has been proposed to reduce the fatigue experienced by human inspectors and increase their ability to detect weapons and other contraband. The system and variants thereof could supplant thousands of xray scanners now in use at hundreds of airports in the United States and other countries. The device would be applicable to any security checkpoint application where current two-dimensional scanners are in use. A conventional x-ray luggage scanner generates a single two-dimensional (2 D) image that conveys no depth information. Therefore, a human inspector must scrutinize the image {{in an effort to}} understand ambiguous-appearing objects as they pass by at high speed on a conveyor belt. Such a high level of concentration can induce fatigue, causing the inspector to reduce concentration and vigilance. In addition, {{because of the lack of}} depth information, contraband objects could be made more difficult to detect by positioning them near other objects so as to create <b>x-ray</b> <b>images</b> that confuse inspectors. The proposed system would make it unnecessary for a human inspector to interpret 2 D images, which show objects at different depths as superimposed. Instead, the system would take advantage of the natural human ability to infer 3 D information from stereographic or stereoscopic images. The inspector would be able to perceive two objects at different depths, in a more nearly natural manner, as distinct 3 D objects lying at different depths. Hence, the inspector could recognize objects with greater accuracy and less effort. The major components of the proposed system would be similar to those of x-ray luggage scanners now in use. As in a conventional x-ray scanner, there would be an x-ray source. Unlike in a conventional scanner, there would be two <b>x-ray</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensors,</b> denoted the left and right sensors, located at positions along the conveyor that are upstream and downstream, respectively (see figure). X-ray illumination may be provided by a single source or by two sources. The position of the conveyor would be detected to provide a means of matching the appropriate left- and right-eye images of an item under inspection. The appropriate right- and left-eye images of an item would be displayed simultaneously to the right and left eyes, respectively, of the human inspector, using commercially available stereo display screens. The human operator could adjust viewing parameters for maximum viewing comfort. The stereographic images thus generated would differ from true stereoscopic images by small distortions that are characteristic of radiographic images in general, but these distortions would not diminish the value of the images for identifying distinct objects at different depths...|$|R

Oil debris sensor is a popular measurement device used to collect oil condition data.

However, the signal measured through the oil debris sensor is severely tainted by various noises, e. g., the background noise present as well as the interferences caused by the vibrations of the structure where the sensor is mounted.

40|$|Lead-free reflow {{soldering}} techniques applying AuSn {{as well as}} SnAg electroplated bumps were chosen {{for the evaluation of}} the flip-chip-bonding process for X-ray pixel detectors. Both solders can be used in pick-and-place processes with a subsequent batch reflow suitable for high-volume production. AuSn solder was selected because of its fluxless bondability, good wettability, and self-alignment process capability, and SnAg solder was chosen for its more ductile behavior and lower yield stress compared to AuSn. GaAs test chips with daisy chain and four-point Kelvin probe structures together with appropriate Si test substrates were designed, manufactured, and bumped. Test chips with 55 and 170 mu m pitch and different chip sizes (maximum 16. 3 down to 4 mm square) were used. AuSn bumps were deposited by electroplating (first Au and a thin Sn layer on top). Thick Au bonding pads were formed on substrate side in case of AuSn bumps. Two under-bump metallizations (UBMs) were used for the SnAg samples: Cu and Ni. Finite element (FE) simulation was performed comparing AuSn and SnAg interconnections and different chip sizes. A local model was designed for bump interconnection and a global octant model for the assembly process. Very high values were calculated for the peel stress using AuSn bumps. SnAg bumps, on the other hand, showed 3 - 5 times reduction in peel stress depending on the chip size. A flip-chip-bonding process setup was carried out for both solder types (AuSn as well as SnAg), with an analysis of the samples by electrical measurements, cross-sectioning, and scanning electron microscopy. Due to the different coefficients of the thermal expansion of GaAs and Si, no stable bonding process was obtained for the AuSn modules as already predicted by the FE simulation. With increasing chip size, failures like pad lift or cracking of the GaAs bulk material were observed. In comparison, the SnAg samples showed good bonding results. This technology was then selected to assemble test modules for thermal cycling between - 55 and + 125 degrees C comparing Cu and Ni as UBM. The modules were qualified by electrical monitoring as well as cross sectioning. More than 200 cycles were reached by the 55 -mu m pitch 16. 3 -mm square bonded GaAs chips and about 400 by the smallest 4 -mm square chips, although no underfilling was used. The dominant failure mode was fracture within the solder. Based on experimental and simulation results, functional 256 x 256 GaAs pixel detectors with a chip size of 14 mm x 14 mm were assembled on Si readout chips using SnAg bumps on a Cu UBM. Finally, these <b>X-ray</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> were wire-bonded to a printed circuit board and successfully tested, showing an yield (at the pixel level) of about 98 %...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Arthroplasty, the {{implantation}} of prostheses into joints, is {{a surgical}} procedure that is affecting {{a larger and}} larger number of patients over time. As a result, it is increasingly important to develop imaging techniques to noninvasively examine joints with prostheses after surgery, both statically and dynamically in 3 -D. The static problem is considered here, with the aim to create a 3 -D shape model of the bone {{as well as the}} prosthesis using a set of 2 -D X-rays from various viewpoints. The most important challenge to be addressed is the lack of texture, the most common feature to recover shape from multiple views. In order to overcome this limitation, we reformulate the problem using a novel multiview segmentation approach where an active contours 3 -D surface evolution with level-set implementation is used to recover the shape of bones and prostheses in postoperative joints. The recovered shape may then be used to track 3 -D motions in dynamic X-ray sequences to obtain kinematic information.
