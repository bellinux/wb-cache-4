40|$|Electron excited {{continuous}} and characteristic <b>x</b> <b>radiations</b> of pure elements were investigated employing an electron probe micro analyzer with an energy dispersive detection system. The measurements {{were performed on}} 23 elements and acceleration voltages from 5 kV to 30 kV. Continuous spectra are described by a modified Kramers cross section. For absorption correction of {{continuous and}} characteristic spectra in the target Love and Scott’s concept of a constant depth distribution function of x-ray generation is employed. Thus, {{it is possible to}} describe the <b>x</b> <b>radiations</b> of an x-ray tube with arbitrarily chosen target by a set of three fundamental parameters. These parameters are const and <b>x</b> for continuous <b>radiation</b> and Constjkl for characteristic radiations.

40|$|A 0. 5 -cmn {{diameter}} X-ray beam of {{a specified}} quality, {{directed at the}} mandibular molar region of adult male albino rats, was shown to destroy osteocytes in increasing amounts according to the radiation quantity used. The interval between exposure and the time rats were killed for examination appeared irrelevant. Osteocytic death {{seemed to be a}} function of exposure time. <b>X</b> <b>radiation</b> in sufficient quantity has long been known to produce bone necrosis. " Clinical signs, usually in the form of osteo-radionecrosis, can result either almost im-mediately or after an extended asympto-matic period. From a clinical standpoint, it would be advantageous if, after therapy of contiguous soft tissue, the X-radiation effects on bone could be mimimized or normal bone growth could be temporarily stimulated to reduce the unfavorable osseous changes. Before considering the methods that might reduce the effects of <b>X</b> <b>radiation</b> on mature normal bone, it is necessary to better under-stand the destructive effects of various X-radiation qualities and quantities on specific, limited areas of adult bone. The current experiments, and experiments in progress, were undertaken to establish a base line for osteocytic alterations that result from local X-radiation exposure. Thus far, the quantity of <b>X</b> <b>radiation</b> and the time between ex-posure animal sacrifice have been varied and the X-radiation quality has been kept con-stant.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} suggesting that loss cone driven cyclotron maser emission by upgoing electrons, closely analogous to auroral kilometric radiation (AKR), {{may be the}} mechanism behind the observed Z mode radiation. With this hypothesis, {{the lack of a}} strong correlation between the Z mode radiation and AKR is not surprising; the ray paths for the X mode and the Z mode are markedly different, with the former directed upward and the latter downward. In addition, it is expected that the generation of the Z mode will be favored only in regions where the ratio of the plasma frequency to the electron cyclotron frequency is greater than or approximately equal to 0. 3, that is, where the <b>X</b> mode <b>radiation</b> is suppressed. If the fraction of the radiation generated that crosses the cyclotron layer is large, then the argument in favor of the loss cone driven cyclotron maser as the source of the observed Z mode radiation is a strong one.
