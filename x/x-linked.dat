5|$|McLeod {{syndrome}} is an <b>X-linked</b> recessive disorder caused by mutations in the XK gene encoding the Kx blood type antigen, {{one of the}} Kell antigens.|$|E
5|$|McLeod {{syndrome}} is very rare. There are approximately 150 cases of McLeod syndrome worldwide. Because of its <b>X-linked</b> mode of inheritance, {{it is much}} more prevalent in males.|$|E
5|$|Some immune deficiencies, such as <b>X-linked</b> {{agammaglobulinemia}} and hypogammaglobulinemia, {{result in}} partial or {{complete lack of}} antibodies. These diseases are often treated by inducing a short term form of immunity called passive immunity. Passive immunity is achieved through the transfer of ready-made antibodies {{in the form of}} human or animal serum, pooled immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies, into the affected individual.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an <b>X-linked</b> recessive manner. When a female carries a mutated gene {{on one of her}} two copies of the X chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but will not herself have the associated disease. However, a son who inherits the mutation will have the disease; this is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One <b>X-linked</b> disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} and recessive forms of Retinitis Pigmentosa affect {{both male and}} female populations equally; however, the less frequent <b>X-linked</b> form of the disease affects male recipients of the <b>X-linked</b> mutation, while females usually remain unaffected carriers of the RP trait. The <b>X-linked</b> forms of the disease are considered severe, and typically lead to complete blindness during later stages. In rare occasions, a dominant form of the <b>X-linked</b> gene mutation will affect both males and females equally.|$|E
25|$|RP can be {{inherited}} in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or <b>X-linked</b> manner. <b>X-linked</b> RP can {{be either}} recessive, affecting primarily only males, or dominant, affecting both males and females, although males are usually more mildly affected. Some digenic (controlled by two genes) and mitochondrial forms have also been described.|$|E
25|$|<b>X-linked</b> inheritance, but {{phenotype}} {{is similar}} to that of type II.|$|E
25|$|Alport's {{syndrome}} {{is associated with}} RP and an abnormal glomerular-basement membrane leading nephrotic syndrome and inherited as <b>X-linked</b> dominant.|$|E
25|$|<b>X-linked</b> endothelial corneal {{dystrophy}} {{is an extremely}} rare disease of cornea associated with Xq25 region. Lisch epithelial {{corneal dystrophy}} is associated with Xp22.3.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to chronic and/or recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases including arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, scleroderma and {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus are also seen in <b>X-linked</b> agammaglobulinemia (XLA).|$|E
25|$|Ocular {{albinism}} type 1 (OA1), {{also called}} Nettleship–Falls syndrome, {{is the most}} common type of ocular albinism, with a prevalence rate of 1:50,000. It is an inheritable classical Mendelian type <b>X-linked</b> recessive disorder wherein the retinal pigment epithelium lacks pigment while hair and skin appear normal. Since it is usually an <b>X-linked</b> disorder, it occurs mostly in males, while females are carriers unless they are homozygous. About 60 missense and nonsense mutations, insertions, and deletions have been identified in Oa1. Mutations in OA1 have been linked to defective glycosylation and thus improper intracellular transportation.|$|E
25|$|The {{hereditary}} ataxias are {{categorized by}} mode of inheritance and causative gene or chromosomal locus. The hereditary ataxias can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or <b>X-linked</b> manner.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{families}} at risk for <b>X-linked</b> diseases, patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with <b>X-linked</b> diseases {{who are in the}} process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of <b>X-linked</b> Mendelian recessive diseases. Such <b>X-linked</b> Mendelian diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and hemophilia A and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the recessive allele. Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a dominant gene for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one's phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of having the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of <b>X-linked</b> Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the risk ratio in either sex, or the options for disease treatment.|$|E
25|$|A {{complement}} to specific gene testing for monogenic disorders, {{which can be}} very useful for genetic diseases whose presentation {{is linked to the}} sex, such as, for example, <b>X-linked</b> diseases.|$|E
25|$|The somatic, or <b>X-linked</b> {{inheritance}} {{patterns of}} RP are currently {{identified with the}} mutations of six genes, the most common occurring at specific loci in the RPGR and RP2 genes.|$|E
25|$|The {{identification}} of fetal sex {{for women who}} are carriers of <b>X-linked</b> diseases is advantageous for the family. <b>X-linked</b> diseases occur at a rate of 5 in 10,000 live births. The most commonly published sex-linked diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia. Ultrasonography is unreliable during the first trimester of pregnancy, as the genitalia are not fully developed. Other methods for sex determination before the use of cffDNA are invasive and performed at 11 weeks of gestation. There is a small risk of miscarriage. The main method is to target the SRY gene on the Y chromosome and DYS14 sequence.|$|E
25|$|The nuclear envelopathy {{with the}} highest {{frequency}} in human populations is Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy caused by an <b>X-linked</b> mutation in the EMD gene coding for emerin and affecting an estimated 1 in 100,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Peroxisomal {{disorders}} are {{a class of}} medical conditions that typically affect the human nervous system {{as well as many}} other organ systems. Two common examples are <b>X-linked</b> adrenoleukodystrophy and peroxisome biogenesis disorders.|$|E
25|$|The world’s first PGD was {{performed}} by Handyside, Kontogianni and Winston at the Hammersmith Hospital in London. Female embryos were selectively transferred in five couples at risk of <b>X-linked</b> disease, resulting in two twins and one singleton pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of CNM include severe hypotonia, hypoxia-requiring {{breathing}} assistance, and scaphocephaly. Among centronuclear myopathies, the <b>X-linked</b> myotubular myopathy form typically presents at birth, {{and is thus}} {{considered a}} congenital myopathy. However, some centronuclear myopathies may present later in life.|$|E
25|$|Other {{species that}} do not follow the {{previously}} discussed conventions of XX females and XY males must find alternative ways to equalize <b>X-linked</b> gene expression among differing sexes. For example, in Caenorhabditis elegans (or C. elegans), sex {{is determined by the}} ratio of X chromosomes relative to autosomes; worms with two X chromosomes (XX worms) develop as hermaphrodites, whereas those with only one X chromosome (XO worms) develop as males. This system of sex determination is unique, because there is no male specific chromosome, {{as is the case in}} XX/XY sex determination systems. However, as is the case with the previously discussed mechanisms of dosage compensation, failure to express <b>X-linked</b> genes appropriately can still be lethal.|$|E
25|$|Type III - no {{detectable}} abnormality in C1INH, {{occurs in}} an <b>X-linked</b> dominant fashion and therefore mainly affects women; {{it can be}} exacerbated by pregnancy and use of hormonal contraception (exact frequency uncertain). It has been linked with mutations in the factor XII gene.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} dosage {{compensation}} actually originated from {{an understanding of}} organisms in which males upregulated <b>X-linked</b> genes two-fold, and was much later extended {{to account for the}} observation of the once mysterious Barr bodies. As early as 1932, H.J. Muller carried out a set of experiments which allowed him to track the expression of eye color in flies, which is an <b>X-linked</b> gene. Muller introduced a mutant gene that caused loss of pigmentation in fly eyes, and subsequently noted that males with only one copy of the mutant gene had similar pigmentation to females with two copies of the mutant gene. This led Muller to coin the phrase “dosage compensation” to describe the observed phenomenon of gene expression equalization.|$|E
25|$|Various other diseases, invoked as {{possible}} explanations to his early demise, included Marfan syndrome, Wilson-Turner <b>X-linked</b> mental retardation syndrome, Fröhlich syndrome (adiposogenital dystrophy), Klinefelter syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, aromatase excess syndrome {{in conjunction with}} sagittal craniosynostosis syndrome, Antley–Bixler syndrome or one of its variants, and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|In March {{researchers}} {{announced the}} successful use of gene therapy to treat two adult patients for <b>X-linked</b> chronic granulomatous disease, a disease which affects myeloid cells and damages the immune system. The {{study is the}} first to show that gene therapy can treat the myeloid system.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{suggests}} the female high tendency to get autoimmunity {{is due to}} an imbalanced X chromosome inactivation. The X-inactivation skew theory, proposed by Princeton University's Jeff Stewart, has recently been confirmed experimentally in scleroderma and autoimmune thyroiditis. Other complex <b>X-linked</b> genetic susceptibility mechanisms are proposed and under investigation.|$|E
25|$|ALD {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in ABCD1, located at Xq28 and demonstrates <b>X-linked</b> recessive inheritance. The gene ABCD1 encodes a peroxisomal membrane transporter {{which is responsible for}} transporting very long chain fatty acid substrate into the peroxisomes for degradation. Mutations in this gene that interfere with this process cause this syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{of their}} {{ambiguous}} evolutionary history, platypuses have been empirically determined to follow an XY sex-determination system, with females possessing five pairs of X chromosomes as the homogametic sex, and males possessing five X and five Y chromosomes as the heterogametic sex. Because the entire genome of the platypus {{has yet to}} be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes), there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular <b>X-linked</b> genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some <b>X-linked</b> genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles. This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all <b>X-linked</b> genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes.|$|E
25|$|FOXP2 {{interacts with}} a {{regulatory}} gene CTBP1. It also downregulates CNTNAP2 gene, {{a member of}} the neurexin family found in neurons. The target gene is associated with common forms of language impairment. It regulates the repeat-containing protein <b>X-linked</b> 2 (SRPX2), which is an epilepsy and language-associated gene in humans, and sound-controlling gene in mice.|$|E
25|$|While observing {{large family}} trees with many {{individuals}} having ataxia, Lazzarini noticed that many family members also had restless legs syndrome. Lazzarini is {{published in the}} fields of <b>X-linked</b> intellectual disability and other neurologic disorders such as restless legs syndrome, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and prion diseases. She has been a contributor as well to the literature on genetic counseling.|$|E
25|$|Compounding on Lyon’s discoveries, in 1962 Ernest Beutler used female {{fibroblast}} cell lineages {{grown in}} culture {{to demonstrate the}} heritability of lyonization or random X-inactivation. By analyzing the differential expression of two existing, viable alleles for the <b>X-linked</b> enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene, Beutler observed that the inactivation of the gene was heritable across passaged generations of the cells.|$|E
25|$|The non-acute porphyrias are <b>X-linked</b> {{dominant}} protoporphyria (XLDPP), congenital {{erythropoietic porphyria}} (CEP), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). None of these are associated with acute attacks; their primary manifestation is with skin disease. For this reason, these four porphyrias—along with two acute porphyrias, VP and HCP, that may also involve skin manifestations—are sometimes called cutaneous porphyrias.|$|E
25|$|Becker muscular {{dystrophy}} is an <b>X-linked</b> recessive inherited disorder characterized by slowly progressive muscle {{weakness of the}} legs and pelvis. It {{is a type of}} dystrophinopathy. This is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which encodes the protein dystrophin. Becker {{muscular dystrophy}} is related to Duchenne muscular dystrophy in that both result from a mutation in the dystrophin gene.|$|E
25|$|Ornithine transcarbamylase {{deficiency}} {{also known}} as OTC deficiency {{is the most common}} urea cycle disorder in humans. Ornithine transcarbamylase, the defective enzyme in this disorder is the final enzyme in the proximal portion of the urea cycle, responsible for converting carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine into citrulline. OTC deficiency is inherited in an <b>X-linked</b> recessive manner, meaning males are more commonly affected than females.|$|E
25|$|Transgene use {{in humans}} is {{currently}} fraught with issues. Transformation of genes into human cells {{has not been}} perfected yet. The most famous example of this involved certain patients developing T-cell leukemia after being treated for <b>X-linked</b> severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID). This was attributed to the close proximity of the inserted gene to the LMO2 promoter, which controls the transcription of the LMO2 proto-oncogene.|$|E
