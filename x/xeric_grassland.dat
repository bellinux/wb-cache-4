40|$|A {{simplification}} from {{species to}} functional groups using {{the concept of}} clonality is particularly attractive for predictive modelling of vegetation processes and preparing guidelines for nature conservation. This important functional trait based on a modular structure including resource-acquiring units (ramets, feeding sites) and spacers, has been studied in three plant communities (<b>xeric</b> <b>grassland,</b> mesic grassland, and beech forest) under different levels of environmental stress (related to soil moisture and fertility) in the Montagna di Torricchio Nature Reserve near Camerino, Central Apennines, Italy. The study sought to reveal patterns of clonal growth modes (CGMs) in the three plant community types, and to test a series of hypotheses {{on the importance of}} selected CGMs along the stress gradient. Clonality was shown to have different importance in the grassland communities, due to differences in the importance of various CGMs (representing syndromes of clonal traits). Below-ground positioning of CGOs, shorter spacers, higher multiplication potential, permanent physical connection between ramets, large bud bank, and increased importance of bud protection were frequently found in water-stressed xeric grasslands, suggesting the adaptive value of these clonal traits. The major differences between grassland communities were due to the dominant CGMs: turf graminoids (with an effective way of protecting growth meristems in dense tussocks) dominated xeric grasslands, whereas rhizomatous graminoids (typical of competitive resource-rich habitats) dominated mesic grasslands. The beech forest had fewer clonal species (67 %) and lower CGM diversity. Based on the assumption that different environments promote different selection pressures, the tests revealed the following results: (1) Plants with clonal organs below ground have significantly higher cover values in stressed habitats. (2) Species with short spacers are more frequent in less favourable environments, and their importance is almost ten times higher in the <b>xeric</b> <b>grassland</b> than in the forest (71 % to 7. 6 %). (3) The number of species able to produce numerous ramets is highest in the most stressed habitat. (4) The number of species with a potential for longlasting connection between ramets increases towards stressed environments. In contrast to our expectations, the mesic grasslands (occupying the central position along the studied stress gradient) have the highest number of species with storage organs. (6) In stressed habitats, species with forms of bud protection were the most frequent...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Patterns {{of plant}} {{functional}} traits related to clonality (clonal growth modes: CGM) in plant communities were studied and hypotheses {{on the importance of}} the selected traits in plant communities supported by soils differing in moisture and nutrient status were tested.

40|$|International audienceThe last glacial-interglacial {{transition}} encompassed rapid climate oscillations {{that affected}} both hemispheres. At low latitudes, {{the pattern of}} oscillations is not well established. To address this issue, pollen analysis was performed at Cienega San Marcial, a monsoon-influenced site located on the southeastern edge of the Sonoran Desert at the limit of the tropical thornscrub. The pollen record covers the Late Wisconsinan glacial termination II, from 15650 to 13400 cal. a BP, including GS- 2 and the Lateglacial interstadial, and a recent historical period (AD c. 1919 to 2004). We applied the modern analogue technique, in which pollen taxa are assigned to plant functional types (PFTs), to reconstruct the past climates. At the end of GS- 2, a Juniperus-Pinus woodland is indicative of annual temperatures 10 +/- 2 degrees C colder than present and higher annual precipitation dominated by winter rains. The onset of the Lateglacial interstadial occurs at c. 15500 cal. a BP, resulting in a lower sedimentation rate {{and the spread of}} a <b>xeric</b> <b>grassland.</b> This period is associated with an increase in summer insolation. A weak signal of summer monsoon intensification is dated to 14825 cal. a BP but is associated with colder winter temperatures. A wider spread of tropical taxa occurs after 13800 cal. a BP, along with the loss of Juniperus, suggesting a temperature increase of approximately 3 degrees C. In spite of the earlier Lateglacial warming, the transition from glacial to interstadial conditions seems to be related to North Atlantic atmospheric variations. We conclude that during the last glacial-interglacial transition, the Sonoran Desert at 28. 5 degrees latitude was sensitive to climate variations originating in northern latitudes. The recent historical sequence displays summer-dominant precipitation and additional drivers of climate change, including anthropogenic factors and El Nino, thus showing a stronger Pacific circulation influence in the subrecent period...|$|E
40|$|In desert grasslands of {{the southwestern}} United States, Prosopis velutina (mesquite), an N-fixing legume, has proliferated from {{historic}} drainage locations into more <b>xeric</b> <b>grassland</b> plains. This expansion is forming a more heterogenous soil nutrient topography in grasslands, N-pools are becoming localized under mesquite canopies, yet the rate {{and extent of}} this sequestration remains relatively unknown. Repeated prescribed burning {{has been used to}} control Prosopis distribution, but effects of fires on grassland soil nutrient distribution and aboveground plant biomass are also largely unknown. I examined recent research concerning P. velutina natural history, emphasizing characteristics that contribute to range expansion. I also evaluated Prosopis management practices [...] -which include herbicide treatment, prescribed burning, grazing reduction, and mechanical removal [...] -and management goals [...] -which involve complete removal, no removal, and limited removal. Of these, limited removal is the most beneficial, using an herbicide application followed by periodic prescribed burning. In 1997 I established a study area at Fort Huachuca Military Reservation in southeastern Arizona, selecting two adjacent sites with similar soil composition and topography but different fire histories. I examined spatial and seasonal changes in composition and distribution of available soil N and litterfall. My results indicated these were more spatially and temporally heterogenous on sites with low fire frequency and high P. velutina stand development. In 1998 I selected nine sites at Fort Huachuca on two upland surfaces located < 1 km apart, with similar soil physical characteristics and fire frequencies ranging from 0 to 5 fires/decade. I evaluated relationships between fire frequency, soil nutrient status (pH, available P, organic C, total N, and available N), and aboveground plant biomass, including that of the non-native Eragrostis lehmanniana (Lehmann lovegrass). Soil pH and ammonium significantly decreased with increased fire frequency on one surface, and available P significantly decreased with increased fire frequency on the other surface. Available P and pH were significantly different between the 2 surfaces, but aboveground biomass was similar. Soil nutrient status and biomass were not related, suggesting plant-available soil nutrients may not control plant distribution or recovery following fire. E. lehmanniana biomass was negatively correlated with native grass and forb biomass, and tended to increase with increasing fire frequency. Surface litter and E. lehmanniana biomass were correlated, and may increase fire frequency, an important consideration when implementing grassland fire management practices...|$|E
40|$|Present {{paper is}} focused on two topics. First topic {{is focused on}} {{evaluation}} of mollusc assemblages of {{northern part of the}} Devínska Kobyla hill (Malé Karpaty Mts.). The second topic was evaluation of all published data on molluscs of this area. The research was conducted during vegetation period of the year 1978. From 9 types of biotopes altogether 47 quantitative samples were sampled. The assemblages were evaluated on the base of constancy and dominance of the species. Altogether 7913 mollusc specimens were obtained from the samples. Composition and status of the forest mollusc assemblages in northern part of the Devínska Kobyla was shown to be determined by the substratum, age of forest stand and the degree of the biotopes disturbance. The species richest assemblage was detected within old grown forest (biotope 7) and calcareous substratum. The species poorest were assemblages found within clear-cut and young stand (biotopes 5, 8). Species rich community was found also in old growth forest with quartzite substratum, however a number of steppe species is absent within this biotope. The molluscan communities of open habitats were observed only {{in the northern part of}} the Devínska Kobyla foothill area. They occur mainly within xeric degraded grassland biotopes (vacant pastures, deforested fields). Within other non-limestone substratum biotopes only species poor coenoses composed of single or e few of species occurred (biotopes 2 and 6). The exception was the natural <b>xeric</b> <b>grassland</b> biotopes, which were typical biotopes for rich community of steppe molluscs (biotope 9). Extremely rich were limestone rocks, which are in addition partially covered by forest. The rich forest land snail community together with a number of xeric species was found here (biotope 3). In second part mollusc species composition of northern and southern part of the Devínska Kobyla massive and the Devínske Hradné Bralo hill are compared. Altogether 65 mollusc species (51 species in north part, 44 species in south part, 37 species in the Devín Castle hill) were found in whole area until nowadays. 10 mollusc species were found only in the southern part of the Devínska Kobyla massive (Bythinella austriaca, Chondrula tridens, Zebrina detrita, Vitrea subrimata, Nesovitrea hammonis, Limax cinereoniger, Limax maximus, Arion fuscus, Pisidium casertanum a P. personatum), 5 species were found only in northern part of the Massive (Platyla polita, Pyramidula pusilla, Vertigo pusilla, Vitrea crystallina, Monachoides vicinus) and 4 species were only found in the Devínske Hradné Bralo hill (Pupilla sterri, Balea perversa, Trichia striolata danubialis, Fruticicola fruticum).

40|$|Species possess {{characteristics}} {{that are considered}} adapted to burning and these allow them to outcompete species and dominate in fire prone environments. It has therefore been proposed that fire might have {{played a critical role}} in the observed expansion of the grasslands, during the late Miocene. The aim of this study was (i) to investigate whether plant response to fire was a result of physiology or (ii) whether it was due to phylogenetic history. This was achieved by doing a pair-wise comparison between Panicoideae (and Panicoideae) and non-Panicoideae (Danthonioideae and Aristidoideae) species. Pre-fire characteristics, that would enhance fire frequency and assist with plant recovery after burning, were compared across phylogenies and photosynthetic type. Post fire plant recovery was then followed in a field and pot comparison which examined the re-growth of the leaf canopy area, leaf mass, above-ground biomass and the cost of this to the below-ground biomass. The pre-fire characteristics showed both a photosynthetic and phylogenetic response. It was found that the species showed a greater canopy death during winter and had a lower moisture content than the species. These characteristics would potentially contribute towards a larger fuel load in the species. However, the comparison of the dead standing biomass at the end of winter and the below-ground biomass, showed a phylogenetic response with the Panicoideae having a proportionally larger dead standing biomass and below-ground biomass than the non-Panicoideae. These results suggest that not only did the Panicoideae have a larger potential fuel load but that they also shunted carbon below-ground, enabling a fast recovery after being burned. The post-fire results were more strongly determined by phylogeny than by photosynthetic type. The Panicoideae recovered faster and more completely than the non-Panicoideae grasses, possibly contributing to their success and expansion under conditions of increased fire frequency. Although recovery of the and Panicoideae were similar, frequently burnt grasslands are dominated by the Panicoideae. Hence, this dominance cannot be explained by differences in their fire responses and may be determined by the post-fire environmental conditions that potentially advantage species possessing the photosynthetic pathway. Panicoideae dominance is limited to mesic environments where fire is the likely driver of grassland expansion while more arid environments are dominated by non-Panicoideae species. Representative species from these non-Panicoid subfamilies showed poor recovery after fire. This suggests that factors other than fire were the likely drivers of these <b>xeric</b> <b>grassland</b> expansions. The ability of these subfamilies, and particularly the species, to cope with drought remains a likely selective mechanism that requires further research. ...|$|E
40|$|Plant species co-existence {{may depend}} upon a complex {{chain of events}} {{involving}} competitive ability, complementarity and facilitation between plants and numerous interactions with herbivores, pathogens, soil features, fauna and micro-organisms. The co-existence of species in herbaceous vegetation is possible {{by the presence of}} factors that limit the expression of the dominance of plants. This limitation may operate through stress or disturbance or by a combination of the two, and its effect is usually to debilitate the potential dominants and to allow plants of smaller stature to regenerate and to co-exist with them. Species co-existence can reflect niche partitioning at several spatial and temporal scales. The functional strategies avoiding the temporal and/or spatial overlapping of the neighbouring individuals are key factors in the niche partitioning inside the plant community, so that species do not exclude each other by competition. Stress and disturbance are the two external factors affecting the vegetation. Their effects on the system change according their intensity. Stress includes factors which restrict the photosynthetic activity. In fact, plant biomass production in vegetation is subjected to a variety of environmental constraints, the most frequent of which are related to shortages and excesses in the supply of solar energy, water, and mineral nutrients. Disturbance includes mechanisms which limit the plant biomass by causing its partial or total destruction (grazing, mowing, forest cutting, soil erosion, and fire). Vegetation composition and species distribution may be influenced by negative processes (competition) and positive interactions (facilitation). Competition shows a maximal intensity in habitats with high productivity and low disturbance, while this phenomenon disappears under conditions of low productivity or intense disturbance. In order to obtain a more complete assessment of the role of these factors upon species density it is necessary to consider the rather different circumstances which arise when the intensities of stress and/or disturbance become severe. In harsh habitats plants are subjected to extreme stress or disturbance conditions, thus seedling establishment is promoted under the canopies of established vegetation. In this positive interaction, known as facilitation, some plants benefit from closely associated neighbours. The intensities of stress and/or disturbance experienced by herbaceous vegetation are sufficient, not only to eliminate potential dominants but also to produce local environments which are inhospitable to all, except a few specialised plants. Facilitation occurs widely but is more frequently documented in unproductive habitats and dominates under harsh conditions. Stress and disturbance involve functional responses by plants; thus, the analysis of plant functional traits (biological characteristics of plants responding to the dominant processes in an ecosystem) is a useful tool for the understanding of plant community assemblage. Grazing is a major disturbance which often causes extensive changes in plant richness and composition. However, pasture plants do not undergo herbivory passively, but react to defend themselves against grazers by means avoidance and tolerance strategies that enable them to survive and grow in grazed systems. Grazing avoidance involves mechanisms that reduce the probability and severity of grazing (mechanical and chemical defence or escape strategy), while grazing tolerance consists of mechanisms that promote growth following defoliation. The research aim was to assess how different types and intensity of disturbance affect species and functional composition of sub-Mediterranean and sub-desertic grassland systems, also in relation with environmental stress. Consequently, the specific research goals were to: i) identify changes in species and functional trait composition and in diversity of plant communities, under different disturbance types (grazing vs. mowing; mown vs. unmown meadows; grazed vs. ungrazed pastures; sheep grazing vs. horse grazing); ii) identify coenological and functional responses of grassland to intensity of stress and intensity and timing of disturbance, by analysing the plant functional traits, that are expression of competitive ability, facilitation, co-existence, avoidance and tolerance strategies; iii) identify plant-plant spatial interactions, i. e. whether species have species-specific spatial associations, especially in harsh environments, and understand how disturbance intensity affect species co-occurrence. Two study areas were considered: sub-Mediterranean grasslands of Umbria-Marches Apennine (central Italy) and the sub-desertic rangelands of southern Peruvian Andes (Peru). In the studied sub-Mediterranean grasslands the competition for light and soil resources may be extremely intense among species. In fact, competition plays a key role, especially in dense and more productive grasslands, where the co-existence of plants is mainly linked to the competitive exclusion. For this reason, in these plant communities the species co-existence is driven by a specific pattern of functional plant traits that ensures foliage expansion affording a competitive advantage. Furthermore, clonal growth forms and vegetative propagation modes that imply horizontal space occupation, can be interpreted as a strategy aimed at maximizing the species competitive ability when there is higher exploitation of soil resources, allowing individuals to explore the neighbouring areas and find unexploited soil niches. This helps to avoid competition for soil resources with the dominant species. Accordingly, the plant functional composition also affects the competitive ability in relation to the stress and the disturbance intensity. In terms of biodiversity conservation, the research outputs represent an advance in the understanding of the ecological processes involved at plant community level, as well as at landscape scale. Some plant traits may reflect selection by herbivores, while others are likely to be by-products of selection for other ecological functions. Moreover, several plant traits may have a dual role. The study findings allow to highlight a general scheme, in which the stress intensity filters the pool of traits at landscape scale, while the disturbance intensity leads to the distribution, occurrence and abundance of single traits at plant community level. Stress intensity (drought stress) selects the trait composition of the plant community at a landscape scale. Thus, traits and associated plant species are distributed at landscape scale depending on stress intensity. In <b>xeric</b> <b>grassland,</b> stress tolerance and avoidance strategies by hairs and leaf texture, determining low evapotranspiration and low palatability, are widespread. Therophyte and chamaephyte life forms are fostered. In semimesic condition either avoidance mechanisms (rosette form, chemical substances, spines and prostrate form) or tolerance strategies (re-growth capacity) occur, as well as late flowering and tall species (upright forbs, tall tussock grasses). More productive environments develop numerous functional types and a higher floristic richness. Disturbance intensity (number of herbivores), type (mowing or grazing, and the different livestock type) and timing act as driving forces in promoting or suppressing the plant functional traits expression. The pool of traits is filtered in different ways by the system. High intensity of disturbance favours avoidance strategies (i. e. prostrate form, rosette forbs, hairs) and vegetative reproduction (clonal ability). The intermediate disturbance condition leads to the largest pool of traits that allows maximum floristic richness. The co-existence of species is promoted by the co-existence of avoidance and tolerance strategies, due to the possibility to use the maximum number of spatial (micro-scale) and temporal niches (change in sward structure during the growing season). In low intensity of disturbance and abandonment conditions, tolerance strategies and dominant species are promoted; on the contrary, the low statured (rosette and prostrate form), accidental and subordinate species are disadvantaged. Large herbivores like horses cause the increase of short grasses, sedges, rosette forbs and annuals (growth forms with poor root systems). These plants do not ensure the maintenance of soil on steep slopes. Upright forbs, dominant unpalatable tall grasses (Brachypodium rupestre) and chamaephyte species are promoted by selective defoliation of small herbivores like sheep. Facilitative interactions between palatable and unpalatable species were observed. Grazing in springtime negatively affects the early spring flowering species of mid/tall dimensions and relevant species such as orchids. This is an issue for biodiversity conservation. The research findings highlight the strong importance of plantâ€“plant spatial interactions in the Peruvian dry Puna. In this harsh environment many species need some kind of facilitative interaction with nurses (mainly with tall grasses, shrubs or cushion plants). Tall grasses (mainly Festuca orthophylla) are the most important nurse species because they have the highest number of spatially associated plants. Thus, the management of this species should be viewed as a key factor for dry Puna biodiversity conservation. In fact, as camelids prefer the fresh, regrown leaves of F. orthophylla that resprout after burning throughout the Peruvian dry Puna, there is the widespread practice of burning these plant communities to renew forage for livestock. Subsequent to burning, shelter and regenerative niches are probably few and small for some years. Because of this, species with strong spatial relationship with F. orthophylla could be threatened with local extinction, especially in conditions of overgrazing. The effects of combined overgrazing and fire lead to the decrease of tall species F. orthophylla and to an increase of the dwarf and spiny shrub Tetraglochin cristatum. The reduction of nurse cover value leads to the decrease of facilitative interactions and consequently to a reduction of species richness. Thus, inappropriate land use practices (e. g. excessive grazing and uncontrolled fire) are the fundamental causes of land degradation. The abundance of tall grasses and shrubs counters soil erosion by wind, and reduction of their cover value could lead to increased soil loss. This could contribute to desertification more than climatic change, or contribute to a cumulative process that amplifies the impact of climatic change.

The rapid positive development of the European Dry Grassland Group (EDGG), the organiser of this conference, is mentioned: the inclusion of the EDGG in the Inter-national Association for Vegetation Science (IAVS) as a working group, the establishment of two new subgroups focussing on Mediterranean and South-East European dry grasslands, respectively, and the organisation of the first EDGG research expedition in 2010 belong to the most important events. In the last part of our contribution, we give a short introduction to the six articles of this Special Feature. Two of them deal with phytosociological classification of semi-natural grassland communities, one with veg-etation-environment relationships. Two papers are concerned with conservational topics, one focussing on the population structure of endangered Pulsatilla patens, the other dealing with conservation of <b>xeric</b> <b>grasslands</b> in Transylvania. The last paper examines temporal changes in calcareous grasslands with regard to species diversity...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} and zoogeography of Diptera (Brachycera) of disjunct <b>xeric</b> <b>grasslands</b> {{in the southern}} Yukon were studied. Over 20, 000 flies were collected representing 32 families and 213 species. In terms of abundance, the predacious guild dominated (54 % of total specimens) due mostly to the family Chamaemyiidae which represented 45 % of all specimens. In terms of diversity, the phytophagous and parasitoid guilds were dominant (25. 5 % of total species each). The most diverse families were Agromyzidae (32 species), Chloropidae (31 species), Tachinidae (23 species) and Pipunculidae (20 species). Thirty-four undescribed species were collected and 58 species were recorded {{for the first time}} in the Yukon. Zoogeographic analysis indicates that the Diptera fauna of these grasslands is dominated by widespread Nearctic or Holarctic species, but the fauna also includes southern grassland species with disjunct distributions, and species endemic to Beringia. The presence of endemic and disjunct species suggests that these grasslands were present in Beringia during the Wisconsinan and acted as a refugium for grassland Diptera...|$|R
40|$|Calcareous grasslands are {{biodiversity}} hotspots in Western Europe. In Belgium, {{a number}} of phytosociological surveys have been realized in these habitats, but none covers {{the whole range of}} calcareous grasslands at the regional scale. The aim of this study was (i) to provide a synthesis of the floristic variation of calcareous grasslands of the Calestienne natural region using a uniform methodology; (ii) to relate floristic variation to environmental variables, and (iii) to characterize the specific diversity of the different grassland communities that occur in the study region. Seven different communities were identified with the TWINSPAN method. The originality of the grasslands on calcareous and calcareo-siliceous rocks was statistically confirmed. Significant differences for environmental variables were identified among the seven communities by a MANOVA. Main differences between communities were related to xericity and pH, although a north-south gradient was also identified. More <b>xeric</b> <b>grasslands</b> were located {{in the southern part of}} the study region while northern part was occupied by more mesophilous grasslands. Multiple regressions were used to describe the influence of the environmental conditions on plant species richness. The most mesophilous grasslands appeared to be the most species-rich while soil acidity negatively affected species richness. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The Centaurea jacea {{aggregate}} is a polymorphic polyploid complex whose taxonomic {{treatment is}} still controversial. A numerical taxonomic approach {{was applied to}} 394 individuals of known ploidy level, from 19 populations, based on the main diagnostic characters proposed in earlier revisions. Populations from <b>xeric</b> <b>grasslands</b> were not considered. Principal Component Analysis shows that variation within the complex is continuous. UPGMA Cluster Analysis based on population means supports the recognition of three groups of populations. However, the limits between these groups are blurred to a considerable extent due to extensive within-population polymorphism. It is argued that the Belgian populations of Centaurea jacea occurring in mesic grasslands {{should be treated as}} a single species, with three subspecies. The two extremes of the morphological gradient can be referred to as C. jacea subsp. jacea and C. jacea subsp. nigra, with C. jacea subsp. pratensis occupying an intermediate position. Most populations from Belgium are tetraploid, a diploid chromosome number being found only in populations of C. jacea subsp. nigra from the Ardennes massif. On average, diploids grow at higher altitude and on more acidic soils than tetraploids. Finally, a key to the three subspecies is provided. SCOPUS: ar. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Feral horses (Equus caballus L) occupy 64 000 ha of montane-subalpine tussock {{grassland}} in the south-western Kaimanawa Mountains, an area zoned {{for military}} training. Since 1979, {{the population has}} increased at 16. 7 % per annum, reaching 1102 in 1990. The most extensive habitat, red tussock (Chionochloa rubra) grassland, was variably affected by horses; tussocks in restricted mesic sites were heavily grazed and mostly eliminated, but those in extensive <b>xeric</b> <b>grasslands</b> showed little impact. The mixed hard tussock (Festuca novae-zelandiae) /red tussock grasslands on basin floors and plateaux, which had already been degraded by early European farming, were suffering further depletion from horse grazing. The restricted, high altitude Chionochloa pallens tussock communities were being eliminated rapidly through preferential grazing. Oligotrophic bogs, on the summits and basin floors were largely intact, whereas high nutrient flushes were severely affected by trampling and grazing. Horses appeared to have had little impact upon Nothofagus forest understoreys. Ten plant species, several of which are vulnerable nationally, occur in the North Island only within the wild horse range. The habitats of five of them were damaged by horses. Throughout the wide basins and plateaux of the north, horses compromised floristic, rare plant habitat, and landscape nature conservation values. Their numbers may therefore have to be controlled...|$|R
50|$|Somalia {{has several}} islands and archipelagos on its coast, {{including}} the Bajuni Islands and the Saad ad-Din Archipelago.In the north, a scrub-covered, semi-desert plain referred as the Guban lies {{parallel to the}} Gulf of Aden littoral. With a width of twelve kilometres {{in the west to}} as little as two kilometres in the east, the plain is bisected by watercourses that are essentially beds of dry sand except during the rainy seasons. When the rains arrive, the Guban's low bushes and grass clumps transform into lush vegetation. This coastal strip is part of the Ethiopian <b>xeric</b> <b>grasslands</b> and shrublands ecoregion.Cal Madow is a mountain range in the northeastern part of the country. Extending from several kilometres west of the city of Bosaso to the northwest of Erigavo, it features Somalia's highest peak, Shimbiris, which sits at an elevation of about 2,416 m. The rugged east-west ranges of the Karkaar Mountains also lie to the interior of the Gulf of Aden littoral. In the central regions, the country's northern mountain ranges give way to shallow plateaus and typically dry watercourses that are referred to locally as the Ogo. The Ogo's western plateau, in turn, gradually merges into the Haud, an important grazing area for livestock.|$|R
40|$|Records of spiders of the {{vineyard}} terraces from {{the vicinity of}} the villages Morkůvky and Mutěnice Jesličky (South Moravia, Czech Republic) are published in the presented work. Spiders were collected by pitfall traping during 30 April – 28 October 2011 and by day and night sweeping of herb vegetation in different dates of 2011. In total 2719 individuals were collected, and identified as 139 species of 23 families. Eighteen species listed in the Red List of threatened species in the Czech Republic were recorded. In vineyard terraces in the vicinity of Morkůvky, 12 threatened species (CR – 2 species, EN – 3 species, VU – 7 species) were found altogether. In {{the vineyard}} terraces at Mutěnice, we found 13 threatened spider species (CR – 2 species, EN – 6 species, VU – 5 species). The most significant findings are Alopecosa solitaria (Herman, 1879), Cheiracanthium pennyi O. P. -Cambridge, 1873; Dipoena coracina (C. L. Koch, 1837); Dysdera hungarica Kulczyński, 1897; Eresus kollari Rossi, 1846; Euryopis quinqueguttata Thorell, 1875; Sibianor tantulus (Simon, 1868) and Haplodrassus minor (O. P. -Cambridge, 1879). Besides of these threatened species, we discovered rich spectra of rare spiders related to the well preserved <b>xeric</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Our faunistic results indicate that artificial habitats, such as vineyard terraces, are important refuges for wide spectra of xerothermophilous spiders...|$|R
