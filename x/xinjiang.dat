5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest of the area, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in {{northern}} <b>Xinjiang</b> and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern <b>Xinjiang.</b> A census of <b>Xinjiang</b> under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% Han and 60% Turkic, while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census, however by 2000 the recorded population was 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur. Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's demographic situation {{is similar to that of}} the early Qing period in <b>Xinjiang.</b> In northern <b>Xinjiang,</b> the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they exterminated the Zunghar Oirat Mongols in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the north, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.|$|E
5|$|Between 1947 and September 22, 1949, Peng's forces {{occupied}} Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. His forces repeatedly defeated, {{but were}} not able to destroy, the forces of Hu Zongnan and Ma Bufang, which retreated into Sichuan and were airlifted to Taiwan when the Kuomintang lost the Civil War in December 1949. In October Peng's forces, led directly by Wang Zhen, invaded <b>Xinjiang.</b> Most of Xinjiang's defenders surrendered peacefully, and were incorporated as a new unit in Peng's army, but some ethnic guerrilla bands resisted Chinese control for several years. After the People's Republic of China was declared on October 1, 1949, Peng was appointed Chairman of the Northwest China Military and Administrative Commission and Commander-in-Chief and Political Commissar of <b>Xinjiang,</b> with Wang Zhen as his deputy. This appointment gave Peng responsibility over Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and <b>Xinjiang,</b> an area of over five millionsquare kilometres (1.9million square miles) but under thirty million people. Peng's forces continued their gradual occupation of <b>Xinjiang,</b> which they completed in September 1951.|$|E
5|$|In general, Uyghurs and {{the mostly}} Han {{government}} disagree on which group has greater historical {{claim to the}} <b>Xinjiang</b> region: Uyghurs believe their ancestors were indigenous to the area, whereas government policy considers present-day <b>Xinjiang</b> to have belonged to China since around 200BC. According to PRC policy, Uyghurs are classified as a National Minority rather than an indigenous group—in other words, they {{are considered to be}} no more indigenous to <b>Xinjiang</b> than the Han, and have no special rights to the land under the law. The People's Republic has presided over the migration into <b>Xinjiang</b> of millions of Han, who dominate the region economically and politically.|$|E

An isolated alpine pika population occurs at the northwest Ningxia-Hexi Zoulang-Gansu border, on the Helan Mountains.

5|$|Arab {{countries}} politically supported China in the OIC with especially Saudi Arabia and Egypt helping China squash {{any potential}} anti-Chinese motion by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation on the Uyghurs, Egypt viewed {{its own internal}} sectarian problems like China's and Sudan was also concerned about external interference in its internal problems as well, while Indonesia {{had to deal with}} its own internal Islamists and emphasized that there was no religious conflict but instead ethnic based disturbances in <b>Xinjiang</b> to calm the situation down. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt helped China kill off a statement on the <b>Xinjiang</b> situation in the OIC. There has been no public reaction by the Arab League, Saudi Arabia and Iran on the situation and China has built stronger relations with Iran and Saudi Arabia due to their influence in the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|China has {{installed}} a grassroots network of officials throughout <b>Xinjiang,</b> its predominantly Muslim north-west frontier region, to address social risks and spot {{early signs of}} unrest: Hundreds of cadres have been transferred from southern <b>Xinjiang,</b> the region’s poorest area, into socially unstable neighbourhoods of Ürümqi; a policy has been implemented where if all family members are unemployed, the government arranges for {{one person in the}} household to get a job,; official announcements are calling upon university students to register for those payouts. The areas around slums are being redeveloped to reduce social risks, opening way to new apartment blocks. However, independent observers believe that fundamental inequalities need to be addressed, and the mindset must change for there to be any success; Ilham Tohti warned that the new policy could attract more Han immigration, and further alienate the Uyghur population.|$|E
40|$|Along {{with the}} {{development}} of socialist market economy and the improvement of transportation facilities, the driving effect of transportation industry on economic growth tends to be more significant. The transportation industry is the lifeline of national economic growth and the backbone of material activities and community communication, signalizing the development of national economy. Highly- developed transportation industry has important strategic meanings for a country’s economic prosperity, cultural development, strong defense, and people’s well-off life. Based on the grey system theory and econometrics, this paper analyzes the contributing effect of the transportation industry on <b>Xinjiang’s</b> regional economic growth, and studies the relationship between indexes of <b>Xinjiang’s</b> transportation industry and economic growth, supplying references for researching <b>Xinjiang’s</b> regional economic development. </p...|$|R

5|$|Tensions between Uyghurs and Han have {{resulted}} in waves of protest in recent years. <b>Xinjiang</b> has been the location of several instances of violence and ethnic clashes, such as the Ghulja Incident of 1997, the 2008 Kashgar attack, widespread unrest preceding the Olympic Games in Beijing, as well as numerous minor attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{sheer size}} of the newly conquered lands made it {{difficult}} to govern through the Tang military garrisons. The Tang emperor Gaozong appointed two puppet qaghans to rule over the Western Turks, who were later overthrown in a rebellion that began in 662. The revolt reduced Tang's western extent to Beshbalik, Dzungaria in northern <b>Xinjiang</b> and ended direct Tang control of Central Asia beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The expansion of the Tibetan Empire from the south threatened China's hold on southern <b>Xinjiang.</b> Tibet invaded the Tarim Basin in 670, but Tang forces regained the area in 693 and Kashgar in 728, restoring the Anxi Protectorate and Four Garrisons. The conflict between Tibet and the Tang continued {{for the remainder of the}} Tang Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|<b>Xinjiang</b> {{is a large}} central-Asian region {{within the}} People's Republic of China {{comprising}} numerous minority groups: 45% of its population are Uyghurs, and 40% are Han.

50|$|When Bayingolin {{was first}} {{established}} in 1954, {{it was an}} area with the Mongols comprising 35% of the prefecture's population. However, in 1960, the Chinese government annexed to it a neighbouring Uyghur area, after which the prefecture occupied one-third of <b>Xinjiang's,</b> and the Uyghurs far out-numbered the Mongols. Due to steady immigration, the Han Chinese population has also increased significantly. In 1947, there were reportedly only 1,682 Han Chinese in <b>Xinjiang's</b> Eighth District (roughly corresponding to today's Bayingolin in area), and that increased to over 660,000 in 2004.|$|R

5|$|The Sogdians spoke an Eastern Iranian {{language}} called Sogdian, {{closely related}} to Bactrian, Khwarazmian, and the Khotanese language Saka, widely spoken Eastern Iranian languages of Central Asia in ancient times.
