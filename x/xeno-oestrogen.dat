40|$|SYNOPSIS. Certain {{anthropogenic}} chemicals, {{most notably}} xeno-oestrogens, {{are known to}} have the potential to disrupt vertebrate endocrine systems. For example, induction of the female-specific protein, vitellogenin, in male fish is a well-known effect of exposure to xeno-oestrogens and serves as a biomarker of such ex-posure. There have been few comparable studies of putative biomarkers of endocrine disruption in inver-tebrates. An exception is the upregulation of vitellin-like larval storage protein (LSP) expression in the barnacle cypris larva following exposure to oestrogenic chemicals. The current study aimed to establish whether larvae of the glass prawn, Palaemon elegans, are likewise susceptible to <b>xeno-oestrogen</b> exposure. Using a polyclonal antiserum to P. elegans apolipovitellin, an 86 kDa polypeptide was detected by western blotting in the larval and early postlarval stages of this species. An indirect ELISA applied to the soluble protein fraction of larval homogenates determined that the titre of this putative LSP ranged, depending on larval stage, from 0. 48 – 0. 67 ng mg 21. Exposure of P. elegans larvae to the <b>xeno-oestrogen</b> 4 -n-nonylphenol (4 -NP), at 0. 2 – 20 mg L 21, resulted in a significant, concentration-independent increase in putative LSP levels of 5 – 18 %. Conversely, exposure to the natural oestrogen, 17 b-oestradiol (E 2), at 0. 2 and 20 mg L 21, led to a significant concentration-independent decline (up to 11 %) in LSP levels. Whether the effect of 4 -NP results from endocrine disruption is not known, however, an oestrogen receptor-mediated effect is unlikely. Other than a slight increase in larval mortality when exposed to 4 -NP at 2 mg L 21, neither 4 -NP nor E 2 significantly affected development, growth or survival of P. elegans larvae...|$|E
40|$|Many {{anthropogenic}} chemicals, {{most notably}} xeno-oestrogens, {{are known to}} have the potential to disrupt vertebrate endocrine systems. Induction of the female-specific protein vitellogenin (Vtg) in male fish, for example, is a well-known effect of exposure to xeno-oestrogens and serves as a biomarker of such exposure. There have been few comparable studies of putative biomarkers of endocrine disruption in decapods. The current study aimed to establish if reproduction and development of two decapods, the prawn, Palaemon elegans and the crab, Carcinus maenas, were affected following exposure to known oestrogenic chemicals and whether a biomarker approach, analogous to that for vertebrates, could be adopted. The <b>xeno-oestrogen</b> 4 -n-nonylphenol (4 -NP) was acutely toxic to P. elegans (48 h-LC 5 o, 34. 3 - 96. 1 µg Lˉ¹) and C. maenas larvae (48 h-LC 50, 116 - 507. 3 µg Lˉ¹), with P. elegans among the most sensitive species reported. Other than a small, but significant, increase in the mortality of P. elegans larvae exposed to 4 -NP at 2 µg Lˉ¹, neither 4 -NP nor the natural oestrogen, 17 β-oestradiol (E 2) significantly affected growth, development or survival of P. elegans at environmentally realistic concentrations (< 0. 2 - 20 µg Lˉ¹). Similar results were obtained with C. maenas larvae, but they must be viewed with caution as survival, including that of the controls, was poor. Vitellin-like proteins were identified in the adults and larval stages of both P. elegans and C. maenas using polyclonal antisera to lipovitellin and apolipovitellin. Vtg was female-specific in both species and expression was restricted to females undergoing vitellogenesis. No induction of Vtg was observed in males, from either species, following laboratory exposure to E 2, and 4 -NP. Likewise, no Vtg was detected in the haemolymph of male C. maenas which had been collected from sites known to be contaminated with oestrogenic chemicals. The titres of the vitellin-like proteins in P. elegans larvae, determined using an indirect ELISA, were significantly affected, in a concentration-independent manner, following exposure to both E 2 and 4 - NP. Exposure to 4 -NP, at 0. 2 - 20 µg Lˉ¹, resulted in a 5 - 18 % increase in the levels of vitellin-like proteins. Exposure to E 2, at 0. 2 and 20 µg Lˉ¹ however, reduced levels by up to 11 %. Further development of the ELISA is required to assess comparable effects in C. maenas larvae. Overall, while it remains questionable whether these effects result from endocrine disruption, an oestrogen receptor-mediated effect is unlikely. Increased mortality may have been due to toxic effects and no causal link has been established between the parent/exposure compounds and the induced alterations in protein profiles. This study emphasised the necessity for long term multi-faceted studies to determine the real impacts of pollutants at distinct organisational levels.

40|$|Studies were {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} potential of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) to detect DNA effects (including DNA damage and mutations) in aquatic invertebrates, following their exposure {{to a variety of}} environmental contaminants under laboratory conditions. After rigorous optimisation of the RAPD method, the protocol, which used a high annealing temperature (50 "C for 10 -mer primers), was found to generate good-quality DNA profiles from groups of organisms belonging to the bacterial, plant and animal kingdoms. The RAPD method was initially used to detect benzo(a) pyrene [B(a) P] and copper-induced DNA effects in the water flea Daphnia magna and ultraviolet-mediated DNA effects in the marine alga Palmaria palmata. The results clearly showed that changes occurred in RAPD profiles obtained from the exposed populations when compared to controls. In these studies, the effect of the genotoxins at higher levels of biological organisation (e. g. Darwinian parameters and/or fitness parameters) were also investigated and were compared with genomic DNA template stability (GTS), a qualitative index representing clear changes in panems compared to control RAPD profiles. The results from these experiments revealed that GTS could be more sensitive than growth parameters and showed at least equal or even greater sensitivity than other measures of fitness. Changes in RAPD profiles were believed {{to be the result of}} DNA effects, namely adduct formation, DNA breakage, oxidative damage and mutations and possibly other effects (e. g. variation in gene expression). Nevertheless, the nature and amount of DNA effects could only be speculated because diverse events may induce the same category of changes (i. e. variation in band intensity, appearance of bands, and disappearance of amplicons) in RAPD patterns. Further studies confirmed that RAPD had the potential to qualitatively detect oestrogen and <b>xeno-oestrogen</b> -induced DNA effects in barnacles. Additional experiments emphasised that oxygen radicals and variation in gene expression may induce significant changes in RAPD profiles. To further understand the effects of DNA lesions and mutations on RAPD patterns, individual types of DNA damage were created in vitro. The results clearly indicated that BaP DNA adducts, DNA photoproducts. and DNA breakages had significant effects on RAPD profiles but that diverse types of DNA damage may induce the same category of changes in RAPD patterns which render the interpretation of the results difficult. It was also concluded that mutations could be detected provided they do not arise in a random fashion. Finally, an attempt was made to determine the kinetics of DNA damage and DNA repair and whether changes in patterns obtained from B(a) P exposed Daphnia magna could be transmitted to successive generations. This strategy was developed to distinguish between mutations and DNA damage. The results showed that some bands obtained from the exposed populations were transmitted to the first and/or second generation but not to the third. It was concluded that the transmission of modified genetic material to the offspring was more likely to be the result of large genomic rearrangements and/or base methylation (epigenetic processes) rather than point mutations. In conclusion, the results presented in this research project show the potential of the RAPD assay as a useful method for the qualitative assessment of DNA effects including genotoxicity and changes in gene expression. The main advantage of this technique is that it can be applied to any species without requiring any information about the nucleotide sequence. In the field of ecogenotoxicology, its main advantage lies in its sensitivity and speed to detect a wide range of DNA damage including DNA breakage, DNA adducts, oxidative damage as well as mutations (including point mutations and large rearrangements). On the other hand, RAPD only allows a qualitative assessment of the DNA effects and the nature of the changes occurring in profiles can only be speculated. Finally, a great deal of further experimentation and validation are required in order to assess the applicability of the technique to a variety of other species and pollutants, particularly under field conditions...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{oestrogens}} {{are defined}} as xenobiotics structurally resembling oestrogen, and are divided into two broad categories, <b>xeno-oestrogens</b> and phyto-oestrogens. Environmental oestrogens may contribute importantly to the increased incidence of reproductive disorders in the modern environment. Although the mechanisms by which environmental oestrogens induce their deleterious effects on the reproductive system remain poorly defined, {{it is likely that}} the vascular effects of these compounds play a critical role. In this regard, oestradiol strongly regulates both angiogenesis and vascular remodelling by influencing the growth and function of vascular endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC). Since blood vessels, by undergoing angiogenesis, vascular regression and vascular remodelling, actively participate in the normal functioning of reproductive organs, environmental oestrogens [...] -by mimicking or antagonizing the vascular effects of oestradiol [...] -may induce abnormalities in vascular function and structure leading to reproductive disorders such as pre-eclampsia, endometriosis, impaired follicular development, inefficient implantation, impotence and infertility. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the evidence regarding the vascular effects of <b>xeno-oestrogens</b> and phyto-oestrogens and to discuss the implications for these effects on the reproductive syste...|$|R
40|$|Many {{chemicals}} {{released into}} the environment are believed to disrupt normal endocrine functions in humans and animals. These endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) affect reproductive health and development. A major group of EDCs that could be responsible for reproductive effects are those that mimic natural oestrogens, known as <b>xeno-oestrogens.</b> A number of in vivo and in vitro screening strategies are being developed to identify and classify <b>xeno-oestrogens,</b> {{in order to determine}} whether they pose a health risk to humans and animals. It is also important to be able to apply the assays to environmental samples for monitoring purposes. In South Africa information on the levels of EDCs in water is limited. While establishing the recombinant yeast screen bioassay (RCBA) using the yeast strain Sacchyromyces cerivisiae for oestrogenic activity, problems were experienced with contamination. Four South African laboratory water sources were assessed. From the results {{it was clear that the}} water used in the preparation of the medium for the assay was the source of oestrogenic contamination. Care should be taken to eliminate all possible sources of contamination in the test procedures to eliminate the reporting of false positive results. The fact that South African laboratory and surface waters tested positive for estrogenic activity has far reaching implications regarding reproductive and general health...|$|R
40|$|The {{biology and}} {{physiology}} {{of the male}} as well as female reproductive system is hormonally regulated. Abnormalities in the dynamics of hormone production, metabolism and elimination, {{as well as their}} binding to certain target tissues, has been associated with pathophysiological conditions of the reproductive system. Although oestrogens are known {{to be one of the}} major hormone groups in regulating the reproductive function and the fertilization process, the cellular and biochemical mechanism or mechanism(s) via which oestrogens induce their effects are still not fully defined. Moreover, in a modern environment we are also exposed to a wide battery of environmental agents which are structurally similar to oestrogens, and termed 'senvironmental oestrogens'. Because environmental oestrogens have been shown to mimic some of the effects of oestradiol, it has been postulated that these exogenous chemicals may influence or interfere with the oestrogen-dependent reproductive processes, and may be associated with beneficial as well as deleterious effects on the reproductive system. In this regard, two classes of environmental oestrogens have been widely studied, i. e. phyto-oestrogens (plant-derived dietary oestrogens) and <b>xeno-oestrogens</b> (industrial chemicals, including polychlorinated biphenyls, DDT, TCDD, dioxins, etc.). The main focus of this review is to provide an overview on the cellular and biochemical mechanism(s) by which <b>xeno-oestrogens</b> and phyto-oestrogens influence the oestrogen-dependent reproductive functions and induce their deleterious or protective effects on the reproductive syste...|$|R
40|$|In bovine oviduct cells 17 β-oestradiol can {{induce the}} {{synthesis}} of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a glycoprotein essential for embryo implantation. Therefore substances which are structurally similar to 17 β-oestradiol and possess oestrogenic activity may also modulate LIF synthesis and influence the reproductive process. We used primary cultures of bovine and human oviduct cells (epithelial cells:fibroblasts 1 : 1) to compare the effects of 17 β-oestradiol, phyto-oestrogens (genistein, biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, and equol) and <b>xeno-oestrogens</b> [polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) : trichlorobiphenyl, 4 -hydroxy-trichlorobiphenyl and 4 -hydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl] on LIF synthesis. Immunoreactive LIF-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay {{was used to determine}} the concentration of LIF in the culture medium. Similar to 17 β-oestradiol, genistein (0. 02 - 2 μmol/l) induced LIF synthesis in bovine oviduct cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Equol, biochanin A and daidzein (2 μmol/l), 4 -hydroxy-trichlorobiphenyl and 4 -hydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl (0. 01 - 10 μmol/l) but not formononetin (2 μmol/l) also induced LIF synthesis in bovine cells. Phyto-oestrogens and <b>xeno-oestrogens</b> also induced LIF synthesis in human oviduct cells (P < 0. 05). The stimulatory effects of PCB, phyto-oestrogens and 17 β-oestradiol were blocked by ICI 182, 780 (1 μmol/l). Moreover, 17 β-oestradiol, 4 -hydroxy-trichlorobiphenyl, 4 -hydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl, genistein, tamoxifen and ICI 182, 780 displaced [3 H] 17 β-oestradiol from cytosolic oestrogen receptors in bovine oviduct cells. These results suggest that phyto-oestrogens and PCB mimic the effects of oestradiol in inducing LIF synthesis by bovine and human oviduct cells and that these stimulatory effects are oestrogen receptor-mediated. Environmental oestrogens act as endocrine modulators/disrupters and may induce deleterious effects on the reproductive process by influencing LIF synthesis in a non-cyclic fashion leading to tubal infertilit...|$|R
40|$|Sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus, Pallas) {{were exposed}} {{for seven months}} to ethynyl oestradiol (EE 2) or a sewage {{effluent}} containing known <b>xeno-oestrogens</b> (alkylphenol polyethoxylates). Nominal exposure concentrations were 6 ng l- 1 EE 2, 0. 3 % v/v or 0. 03 % v/v sewage effluent. The fish were bred using within treatment crosses during the final weeks of the exposures. At {{the end of the}} breeding trials expression of hepatic zona radiata protein (Zrp) and vitellogenin (Vtg) mRNA were determined using two newly developed cDNA probes, and were used to indicate oestrogenic exposure. Exposure to 6 ng l- 1 EE 2 induced Zrp and Vtg mRNA expression in male and female sand goby, impaired male maturation and reproductive behaviour, reduced female fecundity, egg fertility and reduced fertile egg production of the exposed population by approximately 95 %. Exposure to sewage effluent (0. 3 % v/v) caused increased mortality, increased female Zrp and Vtg mRNA expression, and reduced population egg production by approximately 45 % compared to 0. 03 % v/v effluen...|$|R
