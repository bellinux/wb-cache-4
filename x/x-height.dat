5|$|Heathrow {{and other}} British {{airports}} used a highly divergent adaptation of Bembo for many years. Designed by Shelley Winters and named BAA Bembo or BAA Sign, {{it was very}} bold with a high <b>x-height.</b>|$|E
5|$|ITC Garamond {{was created}} by Tony Stan in 1975, and follows ITC's house style of unusually high <b>x-height.</b> It was {{initially}} intended {{to serve as a}} display version but has been used for text, in which its tight spacing and high <b>x-height</b> gives it a somewhat hectoring appearance. As a result, it has proven somewhat controversial among designers; it is generally considered poorly proportioned for body text. It remains the corporate font of the California State University system in printed text. As seen below, it was also modified into Apple Garamond which served as Apple's corporate font from 1984 until replacement starting in 2002 with Myriad. Publishers using it included O'Reilly Media and French publisher Actes Sud.|$|E
5|$|A looser {{interpretation}} of the Griffo designs is Iowan Old Style, designed by John Downer and also released by Bitstream. With a larger <b>x-height</b> (taller lower-case letters) than the print-oriented Bembo and influences of signpainting (Downer's former profession), {{it was intended to}} be particularly clear for reading at distance, in displays and in signage. It is a default font in Apple's iBooks application.|$|E

50|$|It is {{a version}} of Sabon {{optimized}} for screen use, designed by Steve Matteson. Changes include increased <b>x-heights,</b> heavier hairline and serifs, wider inter-character spacing, more open counters, adjusted thicks to thins ratio.|$|R
5|$|As {{was normal}} in metal type fonts {{of the period}} from Monotype and other companies, the font was drawn {{differently}} at different sizes by modifying Griffo's original single-size design, a quite large letter at an approximate size of 15 points. The changes made were looser spacing, higher <b>x-height</b> (taller lower-case letters) and a more solid colour of impression at smaller sizes, and a finer, more graceful and tightly spaced design at large sizes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{distinctive}} {{characteristics in}} Garamond's letterforms are an 'e' {{with a small}} eye and the bowl of the 'a' which has a sharp hook upwards at top left. Other general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital letters {{on the model of}} Roman square capitals. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The <b>x-height</b> (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the cap height. The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal and the bottom right of the italic 'h' bends inwards.|$|E
25|$|Road {{signs in}} the United Kingdom are governed by an {{extremely}} complex and detailed set of guidelines. The basic units of measurement used by sign designers are the 'x-height' (the height of the lower case letter 'x') and the 'stroke width' (sw) (4 sw = 1 <b>x-height).</b> The sizes of borders, symbols and arrows and the spacing and layout of the sign face are expressed in sw, {{so that all the}} elements remain in proportion. The <b>x-height</b> of a sign is dictated mainly by the speed of traffic approaching it, hence 300mm x-heights are common on motorways, whereas parking signs are mostly at 15mm or 20mm <b>x-height.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Sample {{image of}} Akzidenz-Grotesk Old Face, {{a version of}} Akzidenz-Grotesk {{intended}} to incorporate more of the original inconsistencies and different <b>x-heights</b> in regular and bold weights, to replicate early versions of the design.|$|R
5000|$|Medium <b>x-heights</b> {{are found}} on fonts {{intended}} for body text, allowing more balance and contrast between upper- and lower-case letters and a brighter page. They then increase again for optical sizes of font designed for small print, such as captions, {{so that they}} can be clearly read printed small.High <b>x-heights</b> were particularly common in designs in the 1960s and 70s, when International Typeface Corporation released variations of older designs with boosted x-heights; notable examples of this trend include Avant Garde Gothic and ITC Garamond. More recently, some typefaces such as Mrs Eaves and Brandon Grotesque have been issued with distinctively low <b>x-heights</b> to try to create a more elegant appearance. While computers allow fonts to be printed at any size, professional font designers such as Adobe issue fonts in a range of optical sizes optimized to be printed at different sizes. As an example of this, Mrs Eaves exists in two versions: an original style intended to give an elegant, bright appearance, and a less distinctive 'XL' design intended for body text.|$|R

25|$|In 1957, three notable {{competitors}} of Akzidenz-Grotesk appeared {{intended to}} compete with its growing popularity: Helvetica from the Haas foundry, with a very high <b>x-height</b> and a strong image with tight letterspacing, Univers from Deberny & Peignot, with a large range of weights and widths, and Folio from Bauer.|$|E
25|$|A more regular {{adaptation}} of Caslon by the British branch of Monotype {{was commissioned by}} the London publishers of The Imprint, a short-lived printing trade periodical that published during 1913. It had a higher <b>x-height</b> and was intended to offer an italic more complementary to the roman. It has remained popular since and has been digitised by Monotype.|$|E
25|$|Several {{other type}} {{designers}} modelled typefaces from this popular typeface. Max Miedinger at the Haas Foundry {{used it as}} a model for the typeface Neue Haas-Grotesk, released in 1957 and renamed Helvetica in 1961. Miedinger sought to refine the typeface making it more even and unified, with a higher <b>x-height</b> and tighter spacing. Two other releases from 1957, Adrian Frutiger's Univers and Bauer and Baum's Folio, take inspiration from Akzidenz-Grotesk.|$|E
25|$|In December 2006, Berthold {{announced}} {{the release of}} Akzidenz-Grotesk Next. Designed by Bernd Möllenstädt and Dieter Hofrichter, this typeface family features readjusted <b>x-heights</b> and weights throughout the family, giving a more consistent design. The family consists of 14 variants with 7 weights in roman and italic, in a single width.|$|R
50|$|Folio is {{considered}} part of the International Typographic Style, with Helvetica and Univers also released at the same time. All three are modeled after Akzidenz-Grotesk. However, Folio more closely follows the original model than the other two, which have larger <b>x-heights.</b> The typeface experienced moderate success in the United States. The typeface family was extended in 1963, adding an Extra Bold weight and a Bold Condensed width.|$|R
25|$|Most {{web pages}} employ {{sans-serif}} type. Hinting information, spatial anti-aliasing, and subpixel rendering technologies have partially mitigated {{the perception of}} serif fonts on screen. Due to the basic constraint of screen resolution (typically 100 pixels per inch or less) the serifs in some fonts {{can be difficult to}} discern on screen. Some serif fonts, such as Georgia, are specially designed for web readability, employing higher <b>x-heights</b> in the letters, as well as sturdier serifs.|$|R
25|$|Standardization of {{the style}} was pioneered by Ibn Muqla (886 940 A.D.) and later {{expanded}} by Abu Hayan at-Tawhidi (died 1009 A.D.) and Muhammad Ibn Abd ar-Rahman (1492 1545 A.D.). Ibn Muqla is highly regarded in Muslim sources on calligraphy as {{the inventor of the}} naskh style, although this seems to be erroneous. However, Ibn Muqla did establish systematic rules and proportions for shaping the letters, which use 'alif as the <b>x-height.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some typefaces are {{specifically}} designed to be printed at small sizes, for example in telephone directories or on newsprint paper. Bell Gothic and Bell Centennial, commissioned for telephone directories, are notable examples of this. Small-print designs often feature a large <b>x-height,</b> and a chunky design. Some fonts used at such sizes may be members of a larger typeface family joining members for normal sizes. For example, the Times New Roman family contains some designs intended for small print use, as do many families with optical sizes such as Minion.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} metal type faces, the metal type of Akzidenz-Grotesk shows {{variation}} between sizes, with adaptation of letter-spacing and proportions to different sizes. In addition, there is variation between weights: Karl Gerstner notes that even comparing one size (20pt), the medium and bold weights have different <b>x-height,</b> cap height and descender length {{to the light}} and regular weights. This is common with nineteenth-century sans-serifs, which were often not designed as {{with the intention of}} forming an extended family that would match together. The differences in proportions between different sizes and weights of Akzidenz-Grotesk has led to a range of contemporary adaptations, reviving or modifying different aspects of the original design.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco is {{currently}} used for user interface across all of Apple's product line, including watchOS, macOS and iOS. It {{was first introduced}} alongside the Apple Watch, where it was used for enhanced legibility and taller <b>x-heights</b> for easy reading on a small display. The design references {{a number of different}} other typefaces, notably FF DIN (used in the UI of the Camera app in iOS 7 and above), Helvetica (used in the UI in iOS 6 and below), Helvetica Neue (used in the UI of iOS 7 and OS X Yosemite), Roboto (Google's new UI typeface), and Univers (used on Apple's early keyboard designs).|$|R
5000|$|Zapf's work {{reached into}} {{a range of}} genres. While Palatino and Optima are warm, organic designs {{inspired}} by Italian Renaissance calligraphy, printing and stonecarving, he also designed a number of serif text fonts, such as Melior, in the more austere, classical style, following {{the work of the}} great German neoclassical printer Justus Erich Walbaum. His sans serif series URW Grotesk was designed for newspaper use and presents a wide range of widths and weights, reminiscent of geometric sans serif fonts like Futura but in a more eccentric style. Several of his more geometric designs, like both of these, make use of superellipses, squarish designs incorporating a slight curve. Opinion on Zapf's later designs has not always been favourable: Maxim Zhukov remembered his contemporary Adrian Frutiger commenting, with reference to URW Grotesk, that Zapf was [...] "not a sans-serif man" [...] at a conference in 1990, and graphic designer Dan Margulis commented on a retrospective that [...] "he participated in the 1980s trend toward faces with very large <b>x-heights</b> and tight letterfits; his major works in that genre, Zapf Book and Zapf International, have deservedly been forgotten... you {{would have to say that}} his historical standing will be based on the first ten years of his professional career." ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{a version}} of Benton Sans font {{designed}} by David Berlow for screen use between 9 to 18 pixels. Changes include exaggerate the glyph features, larger clearances between letter features, reduced stroke contrasts, wider and more open letterforms with increased letter spacing, larger <b>x-heights,</b> shortened ascenders and descenders. Other changes include 1-storey small g, addition of lower right tail in small a, truncation of vertical stem in cedilla, stretched top hook in small f, linked f bar to dotless i in fi ligature (ﬁ), semicircular O in capital OE ligature (Œ), small numeral 1 without bottom bar, 2-storey a in @, diagonal stem and leaned hooks in integral sign (∫), addition of lower left ball serif in small Greek mu and micro signs (μ), addition of lower right tail in small Greek pi (π), downward left hook in square root sign (√), wedged acute and grave diacritical marks, circular dots in commas, quotation marks, exclamation marks, question marks, decimal point, division sign; stretched upper tail in partial differential sign (∂), wedged quotation marks in primes and back quote marks, smaller angle brackets in angle bracket marks, sharper lower tip in single dagger mark, sharper tips in asterisk, elimination of loop in pound currency sign (£), vertical stem in cent currency sign (¢), separation of plus and minus signs in plus-minus sign (±).|$|R
25|$|Akzidenz-Grotesk is {{sometimes}} {{at first glance}} mistaken for the Helvetica or Univers typefaces. The similarities of Helvetica and Akzidenz-Grotesk are apparent, but the subtle differences include the uppercase and lowercase C and the uppercase G, J, R and Q. Aside from the subtle differences in these individual letters, Miedinger's primary change to Akzidenz-Grotesk is Helvetica's higher <b>x-height,</b> {{the distance from the}} baseline to the height of the lowercase letter x, and the consistently horizontal terminals. The general effect is that Helvetica appears more oblong while Akzidenz-Grotesk maintains circular counters and bowls. Both Helvetica and Univers are more regular and have a greater consistency of stroke weight and details, for instance unifying all or most strokes to terminate on horizontals or verticals.|$|E
500|$|Only four {{letters are}} <b>x-height,</b> with neither ascenders nor descenders: [...] ა, თ, ი, ო.|$|E
500|$|For კ (k'ani) and პ (p'ari), {{the crucial}} {{difference}} {{is whether the}} letter is written below or above <b>x-height,</b> and whether it's written top-down or bottom-up.|$|E
40|$|Background A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between letter visual acuity and word acuity at distance and between letter acuity and the minimum word size allowing maximum and fluent reading speeds. Methods Visual acuities were measured at six metres for 120 participants. Letter acuity was assessed with a logMAR layout chart with Sloan letters displayed with Thomson XPert software. A logMAR layout lowercase word chart {{was created in}} PowerPoint using {{the format of the}} MNRead near chart, with the font and colours found on United Kingdom motorway signs. Distance letter and word acuity, maximum reading speed, critical print size (CPS) and minimum print size for fluent reading were calculated. Results Word and letter acuities were significantly correlated (p < 0. 001) and showed a statistically (p = 0. 049) but not clinically significant mean difference of 0. 02 ± 0. 09 logMAR. Bland–Altman analysis showed that agreement between charts varied depending on acuity level with word acuity better than letter acuity at levels closer to the driving standard of + 0. 30 logMAR (6 / 12). Maximum reading speed was achieved from print sizes 1. 5 logMAR lines larger than the letter acuity and fluent reading at 80 words per minute from print sizes 0. 06 logMAR larger than the letter acuity. Conclusion These results allow equivalent lowercase print sizes supporting either functional reading or maximum reading speeds to be calculated based on letter chart acuities at distance. Minimum print sizes allowing either functional or maximum reading speeds are more appropriate than threshold word acuities, where groups of words or short phrases need to be identified, such as when driving. Where a driving vision standard of + 0. 30 logMAR (6 / 12) exists, a person just meeting the driving standard should be able to read fluently words on signage in lowercase <b>x-heights</b> equivalent to between + 0. 29 and + 0. 30 logMAR...|$|R
500|$|Jones also {{developed}} for Linotype Estienne, a delicate revival based on Robert Estienne's fonts of the 1530s discussed above, with very long ascenders and descenders, which was less popular; as of 2017 {{it has not}} been digitised by Linotype. [...] Williamson suggests that in body text it failed to adapt the style of a large letter effectively down to body text size, producing a design with an extremely small <b>x-height.</b>|$|E
500|$|Thus, {{so-called}} {{division between}} classical and folk art is blurred in Ray's representation of Bengali graphemes. The three-tier <b>X-height</b> of Bengali graphemes {{was presented in}} a manner of musical map and the contours, curves in between horizontal and vertical meeting-point, follow the patterns of alpana. It is also noticed that the metamorphosis of graphemes (This might be designated as [...] "Archewriting") as a living object/subject in Ray's positive manipulation of Bengali graphemes.|$|E
500|$|Kis's typefaces {{were in the}} {{tradition}} of Dutch and German printing developed over the previous century that would later be called the [...] "Dutch taste" [...] (goût hollandois), a term originating from the writings of Pierre Simon Fournier in the next century. This developed the influence of French typefounding such as the typefaces engraved by Claude Garamond with a smooth, even structure and 'e' with a level cross-stroke, by increasing the stroke width, boosting the <b>x-height</b> (height of lower-case letters) and reducing the length of the descenders to achieve a noticeably darker colour on the page.|$|E
500|$|Ehrhardt's {{development}} {{took place}} following {{a series of}} breakthroughs in printing technology which had occurred over {{the last fifty years}} without breaking from the use of metal type. Pantograph engraving had allowed punches to be precisely machined from large plan drawings. This gave a cleaner result than historic typefaces whose master punches had been hand-carved out of steel at the exact size of the desired letter. It also allowed rapid development of a large range of sizes with the same consistent style of letter in all of them, although in fact the design was adjusted to produce a clear image at different sizes, for instance by widening the letters and spacing and increasing the <b>x-height.</b> In addition, hand printing had been superseded by the hot metal typesetting systems of the period, of which Monotype's {{was one of the most}} popular (in competition with that of Linotype's). Both allowed metal type to be quickly cast under the control of a keyboard, eliminating the need to manually cast metal type and slot it into place into a printing press. With no need to keep type in stock, just the matrices used as moulds to cast the type, printers could use a wider range of fonts and there was increasing demand for varied typefaces. Artistically, meanwhile, the preference for using mechanical, geometric Didone letterforms introduced in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was being displaced by a revival of interest in [...] "old-style" [...] serif fonts developed before this, a change that has proved to be lasting. At the same time, hot metal typesetting had imposed new restrictions: in Monotype's system (while less restrictive than Linotype's), in order to mechanically count the number of characters that could be fitted on a line, letters could only be certain widths, and care was needed to produce letters that looked harmonious in spite of this.|$|E
2500|$|In the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic (sometimes collectively {{referred}} to as LGC) scripts, one can refer to {{the distance from the}} baseline to the top of regular lowercase glyphs (mean line) as the <b>x-height,</b> and the part of a glyph rising above the <b>x-height</b> as the ascender. [...] The distance from the baseline {{to the top of the}} ascent or a regular uppercase glyphs (cap line) is also known as the cap height. The height of the ascender can have a dramatic effect on the readability and appearance of a font. The ratio between the <b>x-height</b> and the ascent or cap height often serves to characterize typefaces.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the shape}} of the 1 {{character}} has an ascender in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures, the character usually is of <b>x-height,</b> as, for example, in [...]|$|E
2500|$|Garava [...] was {{designed}} for body text with a generous <b>x-height</b> and economical copyfit. It includes [...] (as OpenType Features), and Heavy styles besides the usual four styles (regular, italic, bold, bold italic).|$|E
2500|$|Thuluth is {{developed}} as a display script to decorate particular scriptural objects. Letters have long vertical lines with broad spacing. The name, meaning [...] "third", is {{in reference to the}} <b>x-height,</b> which is one third of the 'alif.|$|E
