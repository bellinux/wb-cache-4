5|$|Methamphetamine users {{sometimes}} experience soreness in {{the joint}} of the jaw and dental attrition (tooth wear), owing to bruxism (grinding of the teeth) caused by the drug. This bruxism can occur continuously. Chronic use of the drug might also cause trismus, the inability to open the jaw. Long-term users often experience <b>xerostomia</b> (dry mouth).|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} of hyposalivation significantly overlaps {{with that of}} <b>xerostomia.</b> A reduction in saliva production to about 50% of the normal unstimulated level will usually result in the sensation of dry mouth. Altered saliva composition may also be responsible for <b>xerostomia.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Xerostomia</b> {{has been}} used as a test to detect lies, which relied on {{emotional}} inhibition of salivary secretions to indicate possible incrimination.|$|E
25|$|Hyposalivation is a {{clinical}} diagnosis {{that is made}} based on the history and examination, but reduced salivary flow rates have been given objective definitions. Salivary gland hypofunction {{has been defined as}} any objectively demonstrable reduction in whole and/or individual gland flow rates. An unstimulated whole saliva flow rate in a normal person is 0.3–0.4 ml per minute, and below 0.1 ml per minute is significantly abnormal. A stimulated saliva flow rate less than 0.5 ml per gland in 5minutes or less than 1 ml per gland in 10minutes is decreased. The term subjective <b>xerostomia</b> is sometimes used to describe the symptom {{in the absence of any}} detectable abnormality or cause. <b>Xerostomia</b> may also result from a change in composition of saliva (from serous to mucous). Salivary gland dysfunction is an umbrella term for the presence of either <b>xerostomia</b> or salivary gland hypofunction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Xerostomia</b> may {{be caused}} by {{autoimmune}} damage to the salivary glands. Sjögren's syndrome is one such disease, and it causes other symptoms, including xerophthalmia (dry eyes), dry vagina, fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain). Females are more likely to suffer from autoimmune disease, and 90% of people with Sjögren's syndrome are women. Primary Sjögren's syndrome is the combination of dry eyes and <b>xerostomia.</b> Secondary Sjögren's syndrome is identical to primary form but {{with the addition of a}} combination of other connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Less common {{side-effects}} include {{red skin}} (erythema), dry skin, damaged fingernails, a dry mouth (<b>xerostomia),</b> water retention, and sexual impotence. Some medications can trigger allergic or pseudoallergic reactions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Xerostomia,</b> {{also known}} as dry mouth and dry mouth syndrome, is dryness in the mouth, which may be {{associated}} with a change in the composition of saliva, or reduced salivary flow, or have no identifiable cause.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} of <b>xerostomia</b> at one year increases by 5% for every 1Gy increase in dose to the parotid gland. Doses above 25–30Gy {{are associated with}} moderate to severe <b>xerostomia.</b> Similar considerations apply to the submandibular gland, but <b>xerostomia</b> is less common if only one parotid gland {{is included in the}} radiated field and the contralateral submandibular gland is spared (less than 39Gy) In the same manner, radiation dose to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, larynx, and cricopharyngeal inlet determine the risk of dysphagia (and hence dependence on gastrostomy tube feeds). The threshold for this toxicity is volume-dependent at 55–60Gy, with moderate to severe impairment of swallowing, including aspiration, stricture and feeding tube dependence above a mean dose of 47Gy, with a recommended dose to the inferior constrictor of less than 41Gy. Dose-toxicity relationships for the superior and middle constrictors are steep, with a 20% increase in the {{probability of}} dysphagia for each 10Gy. Doses above 30Gy to the thyroid are associated with moderate to severe hypothyroidism. Subjective, patient-reported outcomes of quality of life also correlate with radiation dose received.|$|E
25|$|Saliva coats {{the oral}} mucosa, {{mechanically}} protecting it from trauma during eating, swallowing and speaking. In people with little saliva (<b>xerostomia),</b> soreness {{of the mouth}} is very common, and the food (especially dry food) sticks {{to the inside of}} the mouth.|$|E
25|$|Reported toxicities include {{dry mouth}} (<b>xerostomia)</b> from salivary gland damage, 18% (grade 2); {{difficulty}} swallowing (dysphagia) from {{damage to the}} constrictor muscles, larynx and oesophageal sphincter, 15% (grade 2); subclinical aspiration up to 50% (reported incidence of aspiration pneumonia approximately 14%); hypothyroidism 28–38% at three years (may be up to 55% depending on amount of the thyroid gland exposed to over 45Gy radiation; esophageal stenosis 5%; osteonecrosis of the mandible 2.5%; and need for a gastrostomy tube to be placed {{at some point during}} or up to one year after treatment 4% (up to 16% with longer follow up). Concerns have been expressed regarding excessive short and long term toxicity, especially dysphagia and <b>xerostomia,</b> and hence whether standard doses expose patients with better prognoses are being exposed to overtreatment and unnecessary side effects.|$|E
25|$|Preventive dental {{treatment}} {{is also necessary}} (and often overlooked by the patient), as the lack of saliva associated with <b>xerostomia</b> creates an ideal environment for the proliferation of bacteria that cause cavities. Treatments include at-home topical fluoride application to strengthen tooth enamel and frequent teeth cleanings by a dental hygienist. Existing cavities must also be treated, as cavities that extend into the tooth can not be effectively treated through teeth cleaning alone, and are at {{a high risk of}} spreading into the pulp of the tooth, leading to the loss of vitality and need for extraction or root canal therapy. This treatment regimen is the same as that used for all <b>xerostomia</b> patients, such as those undergoing head and neck radiation therapy which often damages the salivary glands, as they are more susceptible to radiation than other body tissues.|$|E
25|$|The {{major risk}} factor for the {{development}} of this condition is wearing an upper complete denture, particularly when it is not removed during sleep and cleaned regularly. Older dentures {{are more likely to be}} involved. Other factors include <b>xerostomia</b> (dry mouth), diabetes or a high carbohydrate diet. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can rarely be an underlying factor.|$|E
25|$|Because {{medications}} {{have been}} linked to approximately 22% to 28% of all cases of dysgeusia, researching a treatment for this particular cause has been important. <b>Xerostomia,</b> or a decrease in saliva flow, can be a side effect of many drugs, which, in turn, can lead to the development of taste disturbances such as dysgeusia. Patients can lessen the effects of <b>xerostomia</b> with breath mints, sugarless gum, or lozenges, or physicians can increase saliva flow with artificial saliva or oral pilocarpine. Artificial saliva mimics the characteristics of natural saliva by lubricating and protecting the mouth but does not provide any digestive or enzymatic benefits. Pilocarpine is a cholinergic drug meaning it has the same effects as the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine has the function of stimulating the salivary glands to actively produce saliva. The increase in saliva flow is effective in improving the movement of tastants to the taste buds.|$|E
25|$|Dental caries (<b>xerostomia</b> related caries) – Without the anticariogenic {{actions of}} saliva, tooth decay {{is a common}} feature and may {{progress}} much more aggressively than it would otherwise ("rampant caries"). It may affect tooth surfaces that are normally spared, e.g., cervical caries and root surface caries. This is often seen in patients who have had radiotherapy involving the major salivary glands, termed radiation-induced caries.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, many patients, {{not realizing}} {{the need for}} dental treatment, do not see a dentist until most of their teeth are beyond the point of restoration. It is not {{uncommon}} for a dentist to see a <b>xerostomia</b> patient with severe, untreatable cavities in almost every tooth. In severe cases, the only viable treatment may be to extract all of the patient's teeth and treat with prosthetics such as dentures or implants.|$|E
25|$|Black hairy tongue (BHT, also termed lingua villosa nigra) {{refers to}} a {{condition}} of the tongue where the filiform papillae elongate with black or brown discoloration, giving a black and hairy appearance. The appearance may be alarming, but it is a harmless condition. Predisposing factors include smoking, <b>xerostomia</b> (dry mouth), soft diet, poor oral hygiene and certain medications. Management is by improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin {{is known}} to cause meibomian gland {{dysfunction}} which causes persistent keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye). It has also been found to cause salivary gland dysfunction in some people, causing <b>xerostomia</b> (dry mouth). Problems with the meibomian and salivary glands are likely due to the non-selective apoptosis of {{the cells of the}} exocrine glands. Decreased night vision has been reported to persist in some patients after discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy.|$|E
25|$|Saliva {{production}} may be pharmacologically {{stimulated by}} sialagogues such as pilocarpine and cevimeline. It {{can also be}} suppressed by so-called antisialagogues such as tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, antihypertensives, and polypharmacy. Cancer treatments including chemotherapy and radiation therapy may impair salivary flow. Radiation therapy may cause permanent hyposalivation due to injury to the oral mucosa containing the salivary glands, resulting in dry mouth or <b>xerostomia,</b> whereas chemotherapy may cause only temporary salivary impairment.|$|E
25|$|The {{salivary glands}} and tear glands have a {{radiation}} tolerance of about 30Gy in 2Gy fractions, a dose which is exceeded by most radical {{head and neck}} cancer treatments. Dry mouth (<b>xerostomia)</b> and dry eyes (xerophthalmia) can become irritating long-term problems and severely reduce the patient's quality of life. Similarly, sweat glands in treated skin (such as the armpit) tend to stop working, and the naturally moist vaginal mucosa is often dry following pelvic irradiation.|$|E
25|$|This symptom is {{very common}} and is often seen as {{a side effect of}} many types of medication. It is more common in older people (mostly because this group tend to take several medications) and in persons who breathe through their mouths (mouthbreathing). Dehydration, {{radiotherapy}} involving the salivary glands, and several diseases can cause hyposalivation or a change in saliva consistency and hence a complaint of <b>xerostomia.</b> Sometimes there is no identifiable cause, and there may be a psychogenic reason for the complaint.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{pathogenesis}} {{is dependent}} upon the cause. Ulcers and erosions can {{be the result of}} a spectrum of conditions including those causing auto-immune epithelial damage, damage because of an immune defect (e.g., HIV, leukemia, infections e.g. herpes viruses) or nutritional disorders (e.g., vitamin deficiencies). Simple mechanisms which predispose the mouth to trauma and ulceration are <b>xerostomia</b> (dry mouth – as saliva usually lubricates the mucous membrane and controls bacterial levels) and epithelial atrophy (thinning, e.g., after radiotherapy), making the lining more fragile and easily breached. Stomatitis is a general term meaning inflammation within the mouth, and often may be associated with ulceration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Xerostomia,</b> {{also known}} as dry mouth syndrome, can {{precipitate}} dysgeusia because normal salivary flow and concentration are necessary for taste. Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve can result in dysgeusia. In addition, damage done to the pons, thalamus, and midbrain, all of which compose the gustatory pathway, can be potential factors. In a case study, 22% of patients who were experiencing a bladder obstruction were also suffering from dysgeusia. Dysgeusia was eliminated in 100% of these patients once the obstruction was removed. Although it is uncertain what the relationship between bladder relief and dysgeusia entails, {{it has been observed}} that the areas responsible for urinary system and taste in the pons and cerebral cortex in the brain are close in proximity.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of {{radiotherapy}} to the mouth, radiation-induced stomatitis may develop, which {{can be associated with}} mucosal erosions and ulceration. If the salivary glands are irradiated, there may also be <b>xerostomia</b> (dry mouth), making the oral mucosa more vulnerable to frictional damage as the lubricating function of saliva is lost, and mucosal atrophy (thinning), which makes a breach of the epithelium more likely. Radiation to the bones of the jaws causes damage to osteocytes and impairs the blood supply. The affected hard tissues become hypovascular (reduced number of blood vessels), hypocellular (reduced number of cells), and hypoxic (low levels of oxygen). Osteoradionecrosis is the term for when such an area of irradiated bone does not heal from this damage. This usually occurs in the mandible, and causes chronic pain and surface ulceration, sometimes resulting in non-healing bone being exposed through a soft tissue defect. Prevention of osteradionecrosis {{is part of the reason}} why all teeth of questionable prognosis are removed before the start of a course of radiotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Gum chewing is {{regarded}} as a helpful way to cure halitosis (bad breath). Chewing gum not only helps to add freshness to breath but can aid in removing food particles and bacteria associated with bad breath from teeth. It does this by stimulating saliva, which essentially washes out the mouth. Chewing sugar-free gum for 20 minutes after a meal helps prevent tooth decay, according to the American Dental Association, because the act of chewing the sugar-free gum produces saliva to wash away bacteria, which protects teeth. Chewing gum after a meal replaces brushing and flossing, if that's not possible, to prevent tooth decay and increase saliva production. Chewing gum can also help with the lack of saliva or <b>xerostomia</b> since it naturally stimulates saliva production. Saliva is made of chemicals, such as organic molecules, inorganic ions and macromolecules. 0.5% of saliva deals with dental health, since tooth enamel is made of calcium phosphate, those inorganic ions in saliva help repair the teeth and keep them in good condition. The pH of saliva is neutral, which having a pH of 7 allows it to remineralize tooth enamel. Falling below a pH of 5.5 (which is acidic) causes the saliva to demineralize the teeth.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hyposalivation is based predominantly on the clinical signs and symptoms. There is little correlation between symptoms and objective tests of salivary flow, such as sialometry. This test {{is simple and}} noninvasive, and involves measurement of all the saliva a patient can produce during a certain time, achieved by dribbling into a container. Sialometery can yield measures of stimulated salivary flow or unstimulated salivary flow. Stimulated salivary flow rate is calculated using a stimulant such as 10% citric acid dropped onto the tongue, and collection of all the saliva that flows {{from one of the}} parotid papillae over five or ten minutes. Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate more closely correlates with symptoms of <b>xerostomia</b> than stimulated salivary flow rate. Sialography involves introduction of radio-opaque dye such as iodine into the duct of a salivary gland. It may show blockage of a duct due to a calculus. Salivary scintiscanning using technetium is rarely used. Other medical imaging that may be involved in the investigation include chest x-ray (to exclude sarcoidosis), ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (to exclude Sjögren's syndrome or neoplasia). A minor salivary gland biopsy, usually taken from the lip, may be carried out if there is a suspicion of organic disease of the salivary glands. Blood tests and urinalysis may be involved to exclude a number of possible causes. To investigate xerophthalmia, the Schirmer test of lacrimal flow may be indicated. Slit-lamp examination may also be carried out.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{sometimes}} the clinical findings do not correlate with the symptoms experienced. E.g., {{a person with}} signs of hyposalivation may not complain of <b>xerostomia.</b> Conversely a person who reports experiencing <b>xerostomia</b> may not show signs of reduced salivary secretions (subjective <b>xerostomia).</b> In the latter scenario, there are often other oral symptoms suggestive of oral dysesthesia ("burning mouth syndrome"). Some symptoms outside the mouth may occur together with <b>xerostomia.</b> These include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Aside from {{physiologic}} {{causes of}} <b>xerostomia,</b> iatrogenic effects of medications {{are the most}} common cause. A medication which is known to cause <b>xerostomia</b> may be termed xerogenic. Over 500 medications produce <b>xerostomia</b> as a side effect (see table). [...] Sixty-three percent of the top 200 most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States are xerogenic. The likelihood of <b>xerostomia</b> increases in relation to the total number of medications taken, whether the individual medications are xerogenic or not. The sensation of dryness usually starts shortly after starting the offending medication or after increasing the dose. Anticholinergic, sympathomimetic, or diuretic drugs are usually responsible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{successful}} {{treatment of}} <b>xerostomia</b> {{is difficult to}} achieve and often unsatisfactory. This involves finding any correctable cause and removing it if possible, {{but in many cases}} {{it is not possible to}} correct the <b>xerostomia</b> itself, and treatment is symptomatic, and also focuses on [...] preventing tooth decay through improving oral hygiene. Where the symptom is caused by hyposalivation secondary to underlying chronic disease, <b>xerostomia</b> can be considered permanent or even progressive. The management of salivary gland dysfunction may involve the use of saliva substitutes and/or saliva stimulants: ...|$|E
2500|$|Saliva {{substitutes}} {{can improve}} <b>xerostomia,</b> but {{tend not to}} improve the other problems associated with salivary gland dysfunction. Parasympathomimitic drugs (saliva stimulants) such as pilocarpine may improve <b>xerostomia</b> symptoms and other problems associated with salivary gland dysfunction, but the evidence for treatment of radiation-induced <b>xerostomia</b> is limited. Both stimulants and substitutes relieve symptoms to some extent. [...] Salivary stimulants are probably only useful in people with some remaining detectable salivary function. A systematic review of the treatment of dry mouth found no strong {{evidence to suggest that}} a specific topical therapy is effective. The review reported limited evidence that oxygenated glycerol triester spray was more effective than electrolyte sprays. Sugar free chewing gum increases saliva production but there is no strong evidence that it improves symptoms. There is a suggestion that intraoral devices and integrated mouthcare systems may be effective in reducing symptoms, but {{there was a lack of}} strong evidence. A systematic review of the management of radiotherapy induced <b>xerostomia</b> with parasympathomimetic drugs found that there was limited evidence to support the use of pilocarpine in the treatment of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction. It was suggested that, barring any contraindications, a trial of the drug be offered in the above group (at a dose of five mg three times per day to minimize side effects). Improvements can take up to twelve weeks. However, pilocarpine is not always successful in improving <b>xerostomia</b> symptoms. The review also concluded that there was little evidence to support the use of other parasympathomimetics in this group.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Xerostomia</b> is a {{very common}} symptom. A {{conservative}} estimate of prevalence is about 20% in the general population, with increased prevalences in females (up to 30%) and the elderly (up to 50%).|$|E
2500|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} regarding excessive {{short and long}} term toxicity, especially dysphagia and <b>xerostomia,</b> and hence whether standard doses expose patients with better prognoses to overtreatment and unnecessary side effects. Current toxicities have been described as [...] "not tolerable", and hence an intense interest in de-escalation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Xerostomia</b> is the {{subjective}} feeling of oral dryness, {{which is often}} (but not always) associated with hypofunction of the salivary glands. The term {{is derived from the}} Greek words ξηρός (xeros) meaning [...] "dry" [...] and στόμα (stoma) meaning [...] "mouth". A drug or substance that increases the rate of salivary flow is termed a sialogogue.|$|E
2500|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{laudanum}} are generally {{the same as}} with morphine, and include euphoria, dysphoria, pruritus, sedation, constipation, reduced tidal volume, respiratory depression, as well as psychological dependence, physical dependence, miosis, and <b>xerostomia.</b> [...] Overdose can result in severe respiratory depression or collapse and death. [...] The ethanol component can also induce adverse effects at higher doses; the side effects {{are the same as}} with alcohol.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{pattern of}} decay is [...] "rampant caries", which signifies {{advanced}} or severe decay on multiple surfaces of many teeth. [...] Rampant caries {{may be seen}} in individuals with <b>xerostomia,</b> poor oral hygiene, stimulant use (due to drug-induced dry mouth), and/or large sugar intake. [...] If rampant caries is a result of previous radiation to the head and neck, it may be described as radiation-induced caries. [...] Problems can also be caused by the self-destruction of roots and whole [...] tooth resorption when new teeth erupt or later from unknown causes.|$|E
2500|$|Salivary {{flow rate}} is {{decreased}} during sleep, which {{may lead to}} a transient sensation of dry mouth upon waking. This disappears with eating or drinking or with oral hygiene. When associated with halitosis, this is sometimes termed [...] "morning breath". Dry mouth is also a common sensation during periods of anxiety, probably owing to enhanced sympathetic drive. Dehydration is known to cause hyposalivation, the result of the body trying to conserve fluid. Physiologic age-related changes in salivary gland tissues {{may lead to a}} modest reduction in salivary output and partially explain the increased prevalence of <b>xerostomia</b> in older people. However, polypharmacy is thought to be the major cause in this group, with no significant decreases in salivary flow rate being likely to occur through aging alone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{low cost}} of SDS, {{its lack of}} impact on taste, its {{potential}} impact on volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs, which contribute to malodorous breath), and its desirable action as a foaming agent {{have led to the}} use of SDS in the formulations of toothpastes. A series of small crossover studies (25-34 patients) have supported the efficacy of SLS in the reduction of VSCs, and its related positive impact on breath malodor, although these studies have been generally noted to reflect technical challenges in the control of study design variables. While primary sources from the group of Irma Rantanen at University of Turku, Finland conclude an impact on dry mouth (<b>xerostomia)</b> from SLS-containing pastes, a 2011 Cochrane review of these studies, and of the more general area, concludes that there [...] "is no strong evidence… that any topical therapy is effective for relieving the symptom of dry mouth." [...] A safety concern has been raised on the basis of several studies regarding the effect of toothpaste SDS on aphthous ulcers, commonly referred to as canker or white sores. A consensus regarding practice (or change in practice) has not appeared {{as a result of the}} studies.|$|E
