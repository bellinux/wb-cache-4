40|$|A {{new series}} of 30 {{miscellaneous}} National Toxicology Program chemicals has been evaluated prospectively for carcinogenicity and overt toxicity by COMPACT (Computer Optimised Molecular Parametric Analysis for Chemical Toxicity. CYP 1 A and CYP 2 E 1). Evaluations were also made by Hazardexpert, and for metal ion redox potentials; and these, together with COMPACT, were compared with results from the Ames test for mutagenicity in Salmonella, the micronucleus test, and 90 -day subchronic rodent pathology. Seven of the 30 chemicals (nitromethane, chloroprene, <b>xylenesulphonic</b> <b>acid,</b> furfuryl alcohol, anthraquinone, emodin, cinnamaldehyde) were positive for potential carcinogenicity in the COMPACT evaluation; <b>xylenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> and furfuryl alcohol were only equivocally positive. Four of the 30 chemicals-scopolamine, D&C Yellow No. 11, citral, cinnamaldehyde-were positive by Hazardexpert; 6 of 30 -D&C Yellow No. 11, 1 -chloro- 2 -propanol, anthraquinone, emodin, sodium nitrite, cinnamaldehyde-were positive in the Ames test; 2 of 30 -phenolphthalein and emodin-were positive in the in vivo cytogenetics test; and 3 of 30 -molybdenum trioxide, gallium arsenide, vanadium pentoxide-were metal compounds with redox potentials of the metal/metal ion indicative of possible carcinogenicity. The overall prediction for carcinogenicity was positive for 12 of 30 chemicals: nitromethane, chloroprene, D&C Yellow No. 11, molybdenum trioxide, 1 -chloro- 2 -propanol, furfuryl alcohol, gallium arsenide, anthraquinone, emodin, sodium nitrite, cinnamaldehyde, vanadium pentoxide). This overall prediction has been {{made on the basis}} of the results of the computer tests and from consideration of the information from bacterial mutagenicity, together with likely lipid solubility and pathways of metabolism and elimination...|$|E
