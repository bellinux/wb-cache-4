High-resolution spectroscopic measurements of the K{alpha} spectra of hydrogenlike Xe{sup 53 +} and heliumlike Xe{sup 52 +} are presented. The electron-impact excitation cross sections have been determined relative to the radiative recombination cross sections. The electron-impact energy was 112 keV which is about 3. 7 times the excitation threshold for the n = 2 {yields} 1 transitions. Although the relative uncertainties of the measured electron-impact excitation cross sections range from about 20 % to 50 %, significant disagreement between the measured and calculated cross section values has been found for one of the heliumlike xenon lines. Overall, the comparison between experiment and theory shows that already for xenon (Z= 54) the Breit interaction plays a significant part in the collisional excitation process. The measured cross sections for the hydrogenlike transitions are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Additionally, the Xe{sup 53 +} Ly-{alpha}{sub 1 } transition energy has been measured utilizing the K{alpha} emission of neutral cesium and barium for calibration.

Successful separation of GaN from GaN/sapphire structures was accomplished using a single 38 ns KrF excimer (248 nm) laser pulse directed through the transparent sapphire substrate. For fluences between 400 - 600 mJ/cm 2, the absorption at the GaN/sapphire interface induces a highly localized, rapid thermal decomposition of the GaN, yielding metallic Ga and N 2 gas.
