25|$|In Pakistan, stamp {{programmes}} are not {{issued in}} advance. Earlier, collectors could almost {{always count on}} stamps being issued {{on at least two}} dates: 23 March and 14 August. However, in recent years, the 23 March issues have become less frequent. The number of stamps issue per year also varies. However, no matter how many issues are released, their total cost rarely exceeds Rs. 300/- (approx USD 5). Besides postage stamps and souvenir sheets, the post office also sells first day covers, leaflets with and without stamps on it and postal stationery. Earlier, the post office did not use any specific numbering system but this changed when they started using a rather simple system on their leaflets: <b>xxxx</b> – y where <b>xxxx</b> is the year and y is the issue number within that year. All major catalogues include Pakistani stamps in them. Two local updated catalogues are available, each of which uses its own system of numbering.|$|E

A female {{with only one}} Xchromosome has Turner syndrome, whereas an additional Xchromosome in a male, resulting in 47 total chromosomes, has Klinefelter Syndrome. Many other sex chromosome combinations are compatible with live birth including XXX, XYY, and <b>XXXX.</b> The ability for mammals to tolerate aneuploidies in the sex chromosomes arises from the ability to inactivate them, which is required in normal females to compensate for having two copies of the chromosome. Not all genes on the Xchromosome are inactivated, which is why there is a phenotypic effect seen in individuals with extra Xchromosomes.|$|E

After initially stating that the Crimean port of Sevastopol could be held {{for a long time}} even if Crimea fell, he changed his mind and, against Hitler's wishes, evacuated the Black Sea port. This retreat occurred too late, and the German/Romanian 17th Army that was holding Crimea suffered severe losses, with many men killed or captured while waiting on the piers to be evacuated. During the late spring of 1944, Schörner managed to stabilize the crumbling front in the south in a series of defensive battles on the Dniester River in Romania.|$|E

In 1840 <b>xxxx,</b> a free black, was persuaded to go with some new acquaintances from Saratoga Springs, New York to Washington, DC, on the promise of work with a circus. There he was drugged, kidnapped and imprisoned east of the Potomac by a slave trader. He was beaten to keep quiet and transported to the Deep South by ship to be sold again as a slave in Louisiana. After 12 years he finally got word to friends and was freed by an attorney representing the New York state government. Because the jurisdictions could not agree on where the crimes took place, his kidnappers were never prosecuted.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} five seasons, the Broncos played their matches at the 32,500 {{capacity}} Lang Park, the ground {{considered to be}} the home of rugby league in Queensland. However, following ongoing conflict with the Queensland Rugby League and Lang Park Trust due to a sponsorship conflict with the QRL having a commercial agreement with Castlemaine <b>XXXX</b> brewery with prominent signs around the ground, while the Broncos were sponsored by rival brewery Powers who were not permitted any permanent signs (the Broncos initially got around this by not using the change rooms at half time during games, instead sitting on the ground with a temporary protective banner surrounding them which just happened to have prominent Powers logos), the team relocated to the 60,000 capacity ANZ Stadium in 1993 (ANZ had been the main stadium of the 1982 Commonwealth Games). The club's home match attendance, which had averaged 19,637 at Lang Park, increased to 43,200 at the new ground in the first season following the club's first premiership title in the previous season. However, despite the team's second premiership in 1993, crowds gradually declined and it was not until 2002 that the club again registered more than the 1996 average attendance of 23,712. ANZ Stadium, as the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre was called at the time due to sponsorship rights, was featured on an episode of The Mole in April 2002.|$|E

2500|$|In day-to-day {{business}} it happens that containers do appear {{which do not}} follow the ISO 6346 identification at all; however, they are fully CSC safety approved containers.

They may have no registered owner code and no category identifier and have no check digit. It is advisable to follow ISO 6346 as the absence of a compliant identification code causes problems for both carriers and container terminals to correctly identify the equipment and properly deliver the cargo, because computer systems require ISO 6346 conformant naming and as such missing prefixes are invented. For example, YYYY at the carrier and <b>XXXX</b> at the terminal causes the equipment to mismatch. Moreover, since ISO 6346 identification has become a requirement in international Customs conventions (Customs Conventions on Containers and Istanbul Convention), many Customs Administrations have begun validating that containers are marked as per the standard.|$|E

2500|$|The mutiny of {{the army}} in Germany that {{resulted}} in the murder Alexander Severus and his dominating mother, Julia Avita Mamaea, and their replacement by Maximinus Thrax might have been expected to set back the career {{of a man who had}} been so closely associated with the Severan Dynasty and with Mammea herself. However, not only did Timesitheus survive, but his career continued to prosper. Under the new regime he became Procurator provinciae Bithyniae Ponti Paphlagoniae tam patrimoni quam rationis privatae ibi vice procuratoris <b>XXXX,</b> item vice proco(n)sulis - i.e. fiscal administrator of the Asiatic Black Sea provinces of Bithynia, Pontus, and Paphlagonia with particular responsibility for managing the Imperial domains, both patrimonial and private. In addition, he was made acting procurator responsible for the collection of the custom duties levied at one-fortieth ad valorem. As in his previous posting in Germania he was also appointed acting proconsul - i.e. governor of these provinces - thus replacing a senatorial appointee (this time of consular status) for whom that office would normally have been reserved). Whatever reservations Maximinus Thrax may have entertained regarding Timesitheus's loyalties, [...] his need for money to finance his German wars obviously did not allow him the luxury of foregoing the financial and administrative expertise the man could bring to his government of the Empire. (At the time - it was before the assaults on this region mounted by barbarians from the lands to the north of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov that were to characterise the middle years of the Third Century - the provinces given over to Timesitheus's care were among the richest in the Roman world). However, it may be indicative of the emperor's reservations that, whereas in Germany Timesitheus had commanded two legions, he now had none, Asia consisting of provinciae inermes - i.e. provinces where there were no Imperial troops permanently in garrison.|$|E
