40|$|It is {{important}} to compare different contrast media used in bone cement according {{to their ability to}} attenuate X-rays and thereby produce image contrast between bone cement and its surroundings in clinical applications. The radiopacity of bone cement is often evaluated by making radiographs of cement in air at an <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>voltage</b> of 40 kV. We have developed a method for ranking contrast media in bone cement simulating the clinical situation, by (1) choosing the same <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>voltage</b> as used in clinical work, and (2) using a water phantom to imitate the effects of the patients' soft tissue on the X-ray photons. In clinical work it is desirable to have low radiation dose, but high image contrast. The voltage chosen is a compromise, because both dose and image contrast decrease with higher voltage. Three contrast media (ZrO 2, BaSO 4, and Iodixanol) have been compared for degree of "image contrast. " Comparing 10 wt % contrast media samples at an <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>voltage</b> of 40 kV, ZrO 2 produced higher image contrast than the other media. However, at 80 kV, using a water phantom, the results were reversed, ZrO 2 produced lower image contrast than both BaSO 4 and Iodixanol. We conclude that evaluations of contrast media should be made with voltages and phantoms imitating the clinical application. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine experimentally any changes in the dielectric constant and conductivity of mica during and after exposure to X-rays. Several high Quality mica condensers were used for test purposes. Measurements of capacitance and conductance of the test condensers were obtained by use of a capacity bridge. These measurements were made before, during, and after exposure of each test condenser to X-rays. Change in capacitance and change in conductance of each test condenser were plotted against time. Experiments were also conducted to determine the change in capacitance and conductance due solely to the increase in temperature of the test condenser during radiation. The net change due to the effects of X-radiation alone was determined by subtracting that change caused by temperature increase from the gross change observed in the radiation tests. Additional measurements were made to determine the effect of variation of <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>voltage</b> and current on the observed changes in capacitance and conductance. The results of these experiments indicate that there is a definite measurable increase in the dielectric constant and the conductivity of mica which Is subjected to X-radiation. Part of this change is due to temperature increase, but a sizable part of the gross change can be attributed to X-ray effects other than heating. After cessation of radiation, both capacitance and conductance were found to decrease at a relatively slow rate toward their original values. lo permanent change in either the dielectric constant or the conductivity resulted from X-radiation of the test condensers.

The mean value (1. 40) is proposed as the optical density of the background optimizing the contrast according to the screen-film system used. In conclusion, the authors suggest to optimize the use of contrast media, trying to obtain radiographs with an optical density approaching the optimal value in any clinical situation. Therefore tables of the settings of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> and generator are required; the tables must take into account the main parameters influencing the settings, such as the source-film distance, the water-equivalent thickness of the patient and the film-screen system used...|$|R
40|$|Scattered {{radiation}} {{is the main}} source of radiation dose to radiation workers when working with x-ray radiography. When radiation from an industrial x-ray machine collides with the walls of an enclosure, some {{radiation is}} back-scattered back within the enclosure. The scattered radiation is due to, mainly, Compton interaction and fluorescence characteristics radiation following photoelectric interactions. The reduction of the backscattered radiation was accomplished by appropriate selection of a material to line the walls on which the primary radiation is incident and by designing a beam catcher that is capable of absorbing significant portion of the scattered radiation. Backscattered radiation from commercially available materials was investigated. These materials include lead, concrete, aluminum and iron. The primary radiation from an x-ray machine was directed normally on the material and the backscattered radiation was measured by using sensitive ionization chamber. Measurements were made at different angles between incident and backscattered radiation and at several <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>voltages</b> ranged from 70 kVp to 110 kVp. It was found that iron produced the least amount of backscattered radiation that was about 50 - 60 % of that of lead. On the other hand concrete and aluminum produced about 35 % of that of lead. The significant reduction of scattered radiation by iron suggests that lead, which is currently used as a primary shield in most installations, should be located on walls from outside the enclosure and the walls should be lined from inside with iron. A beam catcher panel was constructed of perpendicular parallel plates mounted on a planer base of the sam...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{need to use}} {{reduced sample}} sizes, in order to attain {{improved}} spatial resolution in (µ-CT) tests applied in Portland cement composites, makes researchers perform the fractionation of materials to obtain samples with dimensions compatible with {{the capacity of the}} scanning equipment, which might cause alterations in the microstructure under analysis. Therefore, a test specimen (TS) with dimensions compatible with the scanning capacity of a microtomography system that operates with an <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> and <b>voltage</b> ranging from 20 to 100 kV was proposed. Axial compression strength tests were made and their total porosity was assessed by an apparent density and solid fraction density ratio, which were obtained by means of mercury and helium pycnometry and µ-CT technique, respectively. The adoption of that TS has shown to be viable for providing a sample with a higher level of representation...|$|R
