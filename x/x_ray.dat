5|$|IM Normae {{is one of}} {{only ten}} {{recurrent}} novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20times as massive as the Sun. The stellar wind from the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0km. 1E161348-5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-Ray source with a period of 6.67hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma repeater (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether intense laser-produced <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> {{have an increased}} radiation hazard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mammalian cells were exposed to <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> from a laser-produced plasma that produced ultrahigh peak absorbed dose rates, up to a factor of 10 (10) higher than those produced by conventional <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> used in imaging. The cell survival was studied {{as a function of}} the absorbed dose. The survival of mammalian cells exposed to high peak absorbed dose rates with laser-produced <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> was compared with the survival of cells exposed to standard absorbed dose rates with conventional x-ray sources. Comparative survival studies were performed by using a conventional x-ray tube and a cobalt 60 source. The absorbed doses in the irradiation field were measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters. RESULTS: Cell survival following irradiation by filtered, laser-produced <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> with a high dose rate was not markedly different from the survival following irradiation by conventional sources. There was, however, a notable difference between the survival after exposure to filtered, laser-produced <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> and the survival after exposure to unfiltered laser-produced <b>x</b> <b>rays.</b> CONCLUSION: Exposure to filtered, laser-produced <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> with a high dose rate does not lead to increased harm to mammalian cells exposed in vitro compared with the harm from exposure to <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> from conventional sources, which indicates that the use of high-power laser facilities for medical imaging is justifie...|$|R

By using the already focused proton microbeam to generate characteristic <b>x</b> <b>rays,</b> {{it is possible}} to obtain a nearly monochromatic x-ray beam (very low bremsstrahlung yield) and a reasonably small x-ray source (~20 µm diameter), reducing the requirements on the zone plate.|$|R

25|$|The sterile insect {{technique}} (SIT) {{is a form}} of {{pest control}} that uses ionizing radiation (gamma ray or <b>X</b> <b>ray)</b> to sterilize male flies that are mass-produced in special rearing facilities. The sterile males are released systematically from the ground or by air in tsetse-infested areas, where they mate with wild females, which do not produce offspring. As a result, this technique can eventually eradicate populations of wild flies. SIT is among the most environmentally friendly control tactics available, and is usually applied as the final component of an integrated campaign.|$|E
25|$|Doctors treat a {{dislocation}} {{by putting}} {{the head of the}} humerus back into the joint socket (glenoid fossa) of the scapula — a procedure called manipulation and reduction (M). This is usually followed up with an <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> to make sure the reduction did not fracture the surrounding bones. The arm is then immobilized in a sling or a device called a shoulder immobilizer for several days. Usually the doctor recommends resting the shoulder and applying ice {{three or four times a}} day. After pain and swelling have been controlled, the patient enters a rehabilitation program that includes exercises to restore the range of motion of the shoulder and strengthen the muscles to prevent future dislocations. These exercises may progress from simple motion to the use of weights.|$|E

An x-ray spectrometer was designed. It consists of a modified pinhole camera, a transmission grating, a diamond photoconductive detector (PCD) array, and a beryllium filter. The pinhole camera is used as the basic holder for the grating and diodes. The transmission grating separates the <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> into their individual wavelengths. The PCD’s are used to determine the intensity of the diffracted <b>x</b> <b>rays.</b> The x-ray wavelength is calculated from the location of the PCD’s.

Methods: Initial and subsequent films of 13 white children (10 girls) were read blind by a paediatric radiologist {{for the presence}} of joint space narrowing (JSN), erosions, and relative carpal length (RCL). Results: One child had subcutaneous nodules; one (of 11) was rheumatoid factor positive; six were ANA positive. Median age at diagnosis was 10. 7 years (2. 5 to 15. 9).

40|$|For the {{optimization}} of {{the image}} quality of radiographs, {{the effect of the}} blur due to the scattered <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> on the image signal of radiographs has been ignored. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effect of the scattered <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> on the object sharpness of radiographs for tube voltages of 50 to 100 kV. For the purpose, using a phantom of the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) with an aluminum plate of low contrast object, the edge images including the blurs due to the x-ray focal spot, the screen-film system, and the scattered <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> were produced. However, it is considered that the shape of the overall modulation transfer function (MTF) derived from the edge image is not influenced by the scattered <b>x</b> <b>rays.</b> As a result of comparing the overall MTFs with the product of the MTFs of an x-ray focal spot and a screen-film system measured for various tube voltages in this study, we found that the scattered <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> gave different influence on the contrast at each spatial frequency for each tube voltage. To investigate the influence of the scattered <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> on the overall MTF in detail, considering the MTF of the x-ray focal spot, we developed a method for determining the primary and scatter components of the overall MTF, whose components are proportional to the MTFs of the screen-film system and the scattered <b>x</b> <b>rays,</b> respectively. Using the method, it was found that (1) the overall MTF depends on the MTF of scattered <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> as well as the MTFs of the focal spot and screen-film system; and (2) at frequencies near 0 mm 1, the influence of the blur due to the scattered <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> on the object sharpness was greater than that occurred in the intensifying screen and increased with the tube voltage. These results shows that the blur due to the scattered <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> should be considered for the optimization {{of the image}} quality. I...|$|R
40|$|Induction of DNA DSBs by low-LET {{radiations}} reflects clustered damage produced predominantly by low-energy, {{secondary electron}} "track ends". Cell inactivation and induction of DSBs and their rejoining, assayed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, were determined in Chinese hamster V 79 - 4 cells irradiated as a monolayer with characteristic carbon K-shell (CK) (0. 28 keV), aluminum K-shell (AlK) (1. 49 keV), and titanium K-shell (TiK) (4. 55 keV) ultrasoft <b>X</b> <b>rays</b> under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Relative to (60) Co gamma rays, the {{relative biological effectiveness}} (RBE) for cell inactivation at 10 % survival and for induction of DSBs increases as the photon energy of the ultrasoft <b>X</b> <b>rays</b> decreases. The RBE values for cell inactivation and for induction of DSBs by CK ultrasoft <b>X</b> <b>rays</b> are 2. 8 +/- 0. 3 and 2. 7 +/- 0. 3, respectively, and by TiK ultrasoft <b>X</b> <b>rays</b> are 1. 5 +/- 0. 1 and 1. 4 +/- 0. 1, respectively. Oxygen enhancement ratios (OERs) of approximately 2 for cell inactivation and induction of DSBs by ultrasoft <b>X</b> <b>rays</b> are independent of the photon energy. The time scale for rejoining of DNA DSBs is similar for both ultrasoft <b>X</b> <b>rays</b> and 60 Co gamma rays. From the size distribution of small DNA fragments down to 0. 48 kbp, we concluded that DSBs are induced randomly by CK and AlK ultrasoft <b>X</b> <b>rays.</b> Therefore, ultrasoft <b>X</b> <b>rays</b> are more efficient per unit dose than gamma radiation at inducing DNA DSBs, the yield of which increases with decreasing photon energy...|$|R
60|$|The Artesian ray, {{of which}} these two spoke, was an {{invention}} upon which Roland Clewe had been experimenting {{for a long}} time, and which was and had been {{the object of his}} labors and studies while in Europe.

It was used in surgery and in mechanical arts, and in many varieties of scientific operations, but no considerable advance in its line of application had been recognized for a quarter of a century. But Roland Clewe had come to believe in the existence of a photic force, somewhat similar to the cathode ray, but of infinitely greater significance and importance to the searcher after physical truth. Simply described, his discovery was a powerful ray produced by a new combination of electric lights, which would penetrate down into the earth, passing through all substances which it met in its way, and illuminating and disclosing everything through which it passed.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of microbeams is providing {{new insights into}} the actions of radiation at the cell and tissue levels. So far, this has been achieved exclusively through the use of collimated charged particles. One alternative is to use ultrasoft <b>X</b> <b>rays,</b> focused by X-ray diffractive optics.

The zone plate images characteristic K-shell <b>X</b> <b>rays</b> of carbon or aluminum, generated by focusing a beam of 5 - 10 keV electrons onto the appropriate target.
