5|$|The BDI was {{originally}} developed {{to provide a}} quantitative assessment of the intensity of depression. Because {{it is designed to}} reflect the depth of depression, it can monitor changes over time and provide an objective measure for judging improvement and the effectiveness or otherwise of treatment methods. The instrument remains widely used in research; in 1998, it had been used in over 2000 empirical studies. It has been translated into multiple European languages as well as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and <b>Xhosa.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Ndebele {{descended from}} Zulu migrations in the 19th {{century and the}} other tribes with which they intermarried. Up to one million Ndebele may have left the country {{over the last five}} years, mainly for South Africa. Other Bantu ethnic groups make up the third largest with 2 to 5%: these are Venda, Tonga, Shangaan, Kalanga, Sotho, Ndau, Nambya, Tswana, <b>Xhosa</b> and Lozi.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving in}} Southern Africa, Baden-Powell learnt many {{the skills that}} would become {{standard}} scouting skills. Jan Grootboom, a <b>Xhosa</b> from South Africa, was a military scout who Baden-Powell praised for his scouting ability in the Matabele Campaign. Baden-Powell also learnt scouting skills from Frederick Russell Burnham, an American explorer, adventurer, and mercenary, {{who went on to}} become a highly decorated Major and Chief of Scouts under Lord Roberts during the Second Boer War.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela, {{was a local}} {{chief and}} {{councillor}} to the monarch; he {{was appointed to the}} position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate. In 1926, Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that his father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's unreasonable demands. A devotee of the god Qamata, Gadla was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House {{and a member of the}} amaMpemvu clan of the <b>Xhosa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charles Patrick John Coghlan {{was born}} on 24 June 1863 in King William's Town, British Kaffraria (part of the Cape Colony from 1866). He had three elder brothers. His father, James Coghlan, was from Ireland and was a Catholic; he had arrived in South Africa in 1851 as a private in the British Army, having enlisted to escape the Irish Potato Famine. After {{fighting}} in the Eighth <b>Xhosa</b> War of 1850–53 with the 2nd (The Queen's Royal) Regiment of Foot, James was stationed in the Keiskamma mountains; he settled there with his wife Isabella Mary (née Maclaren), who was originally from Dumbartonshire, Scotland. They moved to King William's Town after Coghlan's discharge from {{the military and the}} birth of their first child, a boy also called James. The elder James Coghlan would become a town councillor in King William's Town.|$|E
5|$|In September 1799 Sercey {{dispersed}} {{his remaining}} ships. Brûle-Gueule {{was sent back}} to France on 26 September carrying condemned political prisoners; the corvette was eventually wrecked on the Pointe du Raz with heavy loss of life. Preneuse was ordered to operate against British trade off the coast of Southeast Africa, sailing from Port Louis on 4 August. Lhermitte focused his efforts on the Mozambique Channel and the approaches to the British Cape Colony and on 20 September encountered a squadron anchored in Algoa Bay comprising the 24-gun naval storeship HMS Camel, the 16-gun HMS Rattlesnake (1791) and the schooner Surprise, the former ships lying with their masts and rigging removed. This force was supporting an expeditionary army under General Francis Dundas fighting the Third <b>Xhosa</b> War. Camel was laden with military supplies but neither ship was prepared for battle, with a 30 of Camels sailors and 15 from Rattlesnake trapped on shore by the surf.|$|E
5|$|Makeba {{then moved}} to New York, making her US music debut on 1 November 1959 on The Steve Allen Show in Los Angeles for a {{television}} audience of 60 million. Her New York debut at the Village Vanguard occurred soon after; she sang in <b>Xhosa</b> and Zulu, and performed a Yiddish folk song. Her audience at this concert included Miles Davis and Duke Ellington; her performance received strongly positive reviews from critics. She first came to popular and critical attention in jazz clubs, after which her reputation grew rapidly. Belafonte, who had helped Makeba with her move to the US, handled the logistics for her first performances. When she first moved to the US, Makeba lived in Greenwich Village, along with other musicians and actors. As was common in her profession, she experienced some financial insecurity, {{and worked as a}} babysitter for a period.|$|E
5|$|When Makeba was {{eighteen}} days old, {{her mother was}} arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling umqombothi, a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent {{the first six months}} of her life in jail. As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in Pretoria, an all-black Methodist primary school that she attended for eight years. Her talent for singing earned her praise at school. Makeba was baptised a Protestant, and sang in church choirs, in English, <b>Xhosa,</b> Sotho, and Zulu; she later said that she learned to sing in English before she could speak the language.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Xhosa,</b> Mandela {{was born}} in Mvezo to the Thembu royal family. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became {{involved}} in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for {{his involvement in the}} 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. In 1962, he was arrested for conspiring to overthrow the state and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial.|$|E
5|$|Bantu Stephen Biko {{was born}} on 18 December 1946, at his grandmother's house in Tarkastad, Eastern Cape. The third child of Mzingaye Mathew Biko and Alice 'Mamcete' Biko, he had an older sister, Bukelwa, an older brother, Khaya, and a younger sister, Nobandile. His parents had married in Whittlesea, where his father worked as a police officer. Mzingaye was {{transferred}} to Queenstown, Port Elizabeth, Fort Cox, and finally King William's Town, where he and Alice settled in Ginsberg township. This was a settlement of around 800 families, with every four families sharing a water supply and toilet. Both Bantu African and Coloured people lived in the township, where <b>Xhosa,</b> Afrikaans, and English were all spoken. After resigning from the police force, Mzingaye worked as a clerk in the King William's Town Native Affairs Office, while studying for a law degree by correspondence from the University of South Africa. Alice was employed first in domestic work for local white households, then as a cook at Grey Hospital in King William's Town. According to his sister, it was this observation of his mother's difficult working conditions that resulted in Biko's earliest politicisation.|$|E
5|$|Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and <b>Xhosa</b> parents, Makeba {{was forced}} to find {{employment}} as a child {{after the death of}} her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognised when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government.|$|E
25|$|The {{reality of}} the {{conflicts}} between the Europeans and <b>Xhosa</b> involves a balance of tension. At times, tensions existed between the various Europeans in the Cape region, tensions between Empire administration and colonial governments, and tensions and alliances of the <b>Xhosa</b> tribes. Alliances with Europeans introduced to the <b>Xhosa</b> tribes the use of firearms; even so, the <b>Xhosa</b> lost most of their territory and were incorporated into the British Empire. The <b>Xhosa</b> include some groups that have adopted the <b>Xhosa</b> language and several groups that are now classed as being <b>Xhosa,</b> such as the Mfengu nation, that had an alliance with the Cape Colony.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Xhosa</b> {{people are}} divided into several tribes with related yet {{distinct}} heritages. The main tribes are AmaGcaleka, AmaRharhabe, ImiDange, ImiDushane, and AmaNdlambe. In addition, there are other tribes found near or amongst the <b>Xhosa</b> people such as AbaThembu, AmaBhaca, ], AbakoBhosha and AmaQwathi that are distinct and separate tribes which have adopted the <b>Xhosa</b> language and the <b>Xhosa</b> way of life.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} inflicted {{a string}} of defeats on the <b>Xhosa,</b> such as at Trompetter's Drift on the Fish River, {{and most of the}} <b>Xhosa</b> chiefs surrendered. However, the two primary <b>Xhosa</b> leaders, Maqoma and Tyali, retreated to the fastnesses of the Amatola Mountains.|$|E
25|$|<b>Xhosa</b> marriage, umshato, is {{one that}} is filled with a number of customs and rituals which relate to the upkeep of <b>Xhosa</b> {{traditional}} practices. These rituals have been practiced for decades by the <b>Xhosa</b> people and have been incorporated into modern day <b>Xhosa</b> marriages as well. The purpose of the practices is to bring together two different families and to give guidance to the newly wed couple throughout.|$|E
25|$|The first newspapers, novels, {{and plays}} in <b>Xhosa</b> {{appeared}} in the 19th century, and <b>Xhosa</b> poetry is also gaining renown.|$|E
25|$|The {{event that}} {{actually}} ignited {{the war was}} a trivial dispute over a raid. A Khoi escort was transporting a manacled <b>Xhosa</b> thief to Grahamstown to be tried for stealing an axe, when <b>Xhosa</b> raiders attacked and killed the Khoi escort. The <b>Xhosa</b> refused to surrender the murderer and war broke out in March 1846.|$|E
25|$|On 28 May, a {{force of}} 8,000 <b>Xhosa</b> {{attacked}} the last remaining British garrison, at Fort Peddie, but fell back after a long shootout with British and Fengu troops. The <b>Xhosa</b> army then marched on Grahamstown itself, but was held up when a sizable army of Ndlambe <b>Xhosa</b> were defeated on 7 June 1846 by General Somerset on the Gwangu, {{a few miles from}} Fort Peddie. However the slow-moving British columns, like the <b>Xhosa,</b> were considerably hampered by drought and were becoming desperate.|$|E
25|$|After inflicting {{a string}} of defeats on the Ngqika, Stockenström took a small and select group of his mounted commandos across the Colony's border and rapidly pushed into the {{independent}} <b>Xhosa</b> lands beyond the frontier. They rode deep into the Transkei <b>Xhosa</b> heartland, directly towards the kraal of Sarhili ("Kreli"), the paramount chief of all the <b>Xhosa.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 8th {{frontier}} war was {{the most}} bitter and brutal in the series of <b>Xhosa</b> wars. It lasted over two years and ended in the complete subjugation of the Ciskei <b>Xhosa.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Xhosa</b> {{unity and}} ability to resist colonial {{expansion}} was to be weakened by the famines and political divisions that followed the cattle-killing movement of 1856–1858. Historians now view this movement as a millennialist response both directly to a lung disease spreading among <b>Xhosa</b> cattle at the time, and less directly to the stress to <b>Xhosa</b> society caused by the continuing loss of their territory and autonomy.|$|E
25|$|In the {{framework}} of this new system, the frontier settled and saw nearly a decade of peace. The <b>Xhosa</b> chiefs generally honoured Stockenström's treaty and returned any cattle that their people had raided. On the Cape side, Stockenström, who saw the major problem as being the land management of the colonists, used his influence {{to rein in the}} frontier settlers and prevent any expansion onto <b>Xhosa</b> land. A level of trust also began to develop, and the <b>Xhosa</b> chiefs came to hold Stockenström in exceptionally high regard as a man who, although he had defeated the <b>Xhosa</b> armies on multiple occasions, nonetheless treated them as diplomatic equals.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Xhosa</b> prophet-chief Maqana Nxele (or Makana) emerged at {{this time}} and promised “to turn bullets into water.” Under the command of Mdushane, AmaNdlambe's son, Maqana led a 10,000 <b>Xhosa</b> force attack (22 April 1819) on Grahamstown, which was held by 350 troops. A Khoikhoi group led by Jan Boesak enabled the {{garrison}} to repulse Maqana, who suffered the loss of 1,000 <b>Xhosa.</b> Maqana was eventually captured and imprisoned on Robben Island.|$|E
25|$|Historians now {{view this}} {{movement}} as a millennialist response both directly to a lung disease spreading among <b>Xhosa</b> cattle at the time, and less directly to the stress to <b>Xhosa</b> society caused by the continuing loss of their territory and autonomy.|$|E
25|$|Large {{numbers of}} <b>Xhosa</b> then poured {{across the border}} as the outnumbered {{imperial}} troops fell back, abandoning their outposts. The only successful resistance was from the local Fengu, who heroically defended their villages from the far larger <b>Xhosa</b> forces.|$|E
25|$|In {{the southeastern}} {{part of the}} country, the Boers and the <b>Xhosa</b> clashed along the Great Fish River, and in 1779 the first of nine {{frontier}} wars erupted. For nearly 100 years subsequently, the <b>Xhosa</b> fought the settlers sporadically, first the Boers or Afrikaners and later the British. In the Fourth Frontier War, which lasted from 1811 to 1812, the British forced the <b>Xhosa</b> back across the Great Fish River and established forts along this boundary.|$|E
25|$|In 1818 {{differences}} between two <b>Xhosa</b> leaders, Ndlambe and Ngqika, ended in Ngqika's defeat, but the British continued to recognise Ngqika as the paramount chief. He {{appealed to the}} British for help against Ndlambe, who retaliated in 1819 during the Fifth Frontier War by attacking the British colonial town of Grahamstown. The <b>Xhosa</b> prophet Nxele emerged at this time and led the <b>Xhosa</b> armies in several attacks. He was subsequently captured and imprisoned on Robben Island. After this war the British attempted unsuccessfully to declare the area between the Great Fish and the Keiskamma rivers neutral territory. More fighting took place, until eventually all <b>Xhosa</b> territories were incorporated into the Cape Colony.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} figure {{mentioned}} on this page {{is based upon the}} number of people speaking <b>Xhosa</b> as their home language, which may be greater or less than the total number of people claiming <b>Xhosa</b> descent. In addition, several million people in the Johannesburg-Soweto region speak <b>Xhosa</b> or Zulu as a second or third language. For a majority of these, the two languages become difficult to distinguish (unsurprising given the extreme closeness of their linguistic relationship).|$|E
25|$|Large {{numbers of}} <b>Xhosa</b> were {{displaced}} across the Keiskamma by Governor Harry Smith, and these refugees supplemented the original inhabitants there, causing overpopulation and hardship. Those <b>Xhosa</b> {{who remained in}} the colony were moved to towns and encouraged to adopt European lifestyles.|$|E
25|$|In April 1856 the 16-year-old <b>Xhosa</b> prophetess Nongqawuse {{began to}} declare that she had {{received}} {{a message from the}} <b>Xhosa</b> people's ancestors, promising deliverance from their hardships. She preached that the ancestors would return from the afterlife in huge numbers, drive all Europeans into the sea, and give the <b>Xhosa</b> bounteous gifts of horses, sheep, goats, dogs, fowls, and all manner of clothing and food in great amounts. They would also restore the elderly to youth and would usher in a utopian era of prosperity. However, she declared that the dead ancestors would only enact this on condition that the <b>Xhosa</b> first destroyed all their means of subsistence. They needed to kill all of their cattle and burn all of their crops.|$|E
25|$|Several {{films have}} {{been shot in the}} <b>Xhosa</b> language. U-Carmen eKhayelitsha is a modern remake of Bizet's 1875 opera Carmen. It is shot entirely in <b>Xhosa,</b> and {{combines}} music from the original opera with traditional African music. It takes place in the Cape Town township of Khayelitsha.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} several wars with the <b>Xhosa</b> had already been fought {{by the time that}} the Cape Colony had been ceded to the United Kingdom. The <b>Xhosa</b> that crossed the colonial {{frontier}} had been expelled from the district between the Sundays River and Great Fish River known as the Zuurveld, which became a neutral ground of sorts. For some time before 1811, the <b>Xhosa</b> had taken possession of the neutral ground and attacked the colonists. In order to expel them from the Zuurveld, Colonel John Graham took the area with a mixed-race army in December 1811, and eventually the <b>Xhosa</b> were forced to fall back beyond the Fish River. On the site of Colonel Graham’s headquarters arose a town bearing his name: Graham's Town, subsequently becoming Grahamstown.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope {{expanded}} {{beyond the}} initial settlement and its borders were formally consolidated as the composite Dutch Cape Colony in 1778. At the time, the Dutch had subdued the indigenous Khoisan and San {{peoples in the}} Cape and seized their traditional territories. Dutch military expeditions further east were halted when they encountered the westward expansion of the <b>Xhosa</b> people. Hoping to avoid being drawn into a protracted dispute, the Dutch government and the <b>Xhosa</b> chieftains agreed to formally demarcate their respective areas of control and refrain from trespassing on each other's borders. However, the Dutch proved unable {{to control their own}} independently minded settlers, who disregarded the agreement and crossed into <b>Xhosa</b> territory, sparking one of Southern Africa's longest colonial conflicts: the <b>Xhosa</b> Wars.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Xhosa</b> {{settled on}} {{mountain}} {{slopes of the}} Amatola and the Winterberg Mountains. Many streams drain into great rivers of this <b>Xhosa</b> territory including the Kei and Fish Rivers. Rich soils and plentiful rainfall make the river basins good for farming and grazing making cattle important and the basis of wealth.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{government}} policies {{during the years}} of apartheid can still be seen in the poverty of the <b>Xhosa</b> who still reside in the Eastern Cape. During this time, <b>Xhosa</b> males could only seek employment in the mining industry as so-called migrant labourers. Since the collapse of apartheid, individuals can move freely.|$|E
25|$|Some historians {{argue that}} this early {{absorption}} into the wage economy is the ultimate origin of {{the long history of}} trade union membership and political leadership among <b>Xhosa</b> people. That history manifests itself today in high degrees of <b>Xhosa</b> representation in the leadership of the African National Congress, South Africa's ruling political party.|$|E
