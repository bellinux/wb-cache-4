50|$|Zinc finger (Znf) domains are {{relatively}} small protein motifs that contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not, instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis</b> (African <b>clawed</b> <b>frog),</b> however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein, and/or lipid substrates. Their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and on the linker between fingers, {{as well as on}} the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. Znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. Znf motifs occur in several unrelated protein superfamilies, varying in both sequence and structure. They display considerable versatility in binding modes, even between members of the same class (e.g., some bind DNA, others protein), suggesting that Znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions. For example, Znf-containing proteins function in gene transcription, translation, mRNA trafficking, cytoskeleton organization, epithelial development, cell adhesion, protein folding, chromatin remodeling, and zinc sensing, to name but a few. Zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target.|$|R

It is therefore important to evaluate the impact of the pesticides on environment. Amphibians are good indicator species for environmental health due to not only their highly permeable skin, but also the nature of their reproduction, which makes their entire life cycle very susceptible to environmental contaminants.

40|$|AbstractEarly in the {{development}} of animal embryos, superficial cells of the blastula form a distinct lineage and adopt an epithelial morphology. In different animals, the fate of these primary superficial epithelial (PSE) cells varies, and it is unclear whether pathways governing segregation of blastomeres into the PSE lineage are conserved. Mutations in the gene encoding Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF 6) are associated with syndromic and non-syndromic forms of cleft lip and palate, consistent with a role for Irf 6 in development of oral epithelia, and mouse Irf 6 targeted null mutant embryos display abnormal differentiation of oral epithelia and skin. In Danio rerio (zebrafish) and <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis</b> (African <b>clawed</b> <b>frog)</b> embryos, zygotic irf 6 transcripts are present in many epithelial tissues including the presumptive PSE cells and maternal irf 6 transcripts are present throughout all cells at the blastula stage. Injection of antisense oligonucleotides with ability to disrupt translation of irf 6 transcripts caused little or no effect on development. By contrast, injection of RNA encoding a putative dominant negative Irf 6 caused epiboly arrest, loss of gene expression characteristic of the EVL, and rupture of the embryo at late gastrula stage. The dominant negative Irf 6 disrupted EVL gene expression in a cell autonomous fashion. These results suggest that Irf 6 translated in the oocyte or unfertilized egg suffices for early development. Supporting the importance of maternal Irf 6, we show that depletion of maternal irf 6 transcripts in X. laevis embryos leads to gastrulation defects and rupture of the superficial epithelium. These experiments reveal a conserved role for maternally-encoded Irf 6 in differentiation of a simple epithelium in X. laevis and D. rerio. This epithelium constitutes a novel model tissue in which to explore the Irf 6 regulatory pathway...|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that the endocrine systems of certain fish and wildlife can be affected by chemical contaminants, possibly resulting in developmental and reproductive problems. Perturbations in the hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis, in particular, can be detrimental during early development. Because the rate of amphibian metamorphosis is controlled by circulating thyroid hormones, tad-poles undergoing metamorphosis have been selected as relevant test organisms for evaluating the potential effects of a substance on the HPT axis in vertebrates. An indicative measure of HPT functioning in these assays is the concentration of the thyroid hormone, thyroxine (T 4), in frog plasma. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a validated method to measure T 4 in plasma during amphibian metamorphosis. This study describes a method involving mixed-mode strong cation ex-change solid-phase extraction (SPE) with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography and isotope dilution tandem mass spectrom-etry (UPLC–ID-MS-MS) to quantify total T 4 in a small volume (10 mL) of plasma from <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis</b> (African <b>clawed</b> <b>frog).</b> The SPE pro-cedure, together with MS detection, produced the required selectiv-ity for the analysis of both T 4 and the T 4 internal standard.

40|$|Chemosensation (smell and taste) is {{essential}} for the detection of chemical signals, which enables animals to perform essential biological functions such as to find, recognize and assess food cues, to localize prey and avoid predators, to recognize kin, to identify suitable mates, and analyse food quality. In humans, smell, almost more than any other sense, has the ability to recall up memories, and to change moods. The smell molecules or odors are detected by a specialized set of G protein-coupled receptors called olfactory receptors; these olfactory receptors are expressed in olfactory sensory neurons located in the olfactory epithelium of vertebrates. Unlike tetrapods, which have 2 or more specialized olfactory subsystems, teleost fishes possess a single sensory surface. The aim of my doctoral thesis is to investigate the evolution of chemosensory receptor gene repertoires from the perspective of comparative genomics. I have mainly focused on two evolutionary relevant animal models, Latimeria chalumnae and <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis.</b> Latimeria chalumnae are also called “living fossil” and are considered the oldest living lineage of Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish and tetrapods). <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis</b> (African <b>clawed</b> <b>frog)</b> is of great evolutionary importance as it is embodies the evolutionary transition between aquatic and terrestrial environment. In my thesis I have combined rigorous bioinformatics analysis with a molecular biological approach to characterize chemosensory receptor repertoires. For two of these repertoires that are characteristically different between teleost fish and tetrapods I could show that Latimeria chalumnae exhibits the tetrapod, not the teleost features. Furthermore, I demonstrated Latimeria to possess the largest taste receptor type 2 gene family reported for any species, showed pronounced positive Darwinian selection in this gene family, and identified a possible evolutionary mechanism for generating this large family. In an amphibian species (<b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis),</b> I could show that expression zones for several olfactory receptors are specified independently along two perpendicular axes, the first such demonstration for any species. In this species I revealed a novel bimodal expression pattern for type 2 vomeronasal receptors, with phylogenetically ‘ancient’ receptors being expressed in the main olfactory epithelium like their teleost fish counterparts, whereas ‘modern’ receptors are expressed in the vomeronasal epithelium like their mammalian counterparts. These findings establish <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis,</b> an established olfactory model system for functional analysis as highly suitable to study the transition from aquatic to terrestrial olfaction at the molecular level. ...|$|R

The purpose of this study was to use an isolated population of X. laevis that was introduced to Wales, UK in the past 50  years to investigate how variation at the MHC compares to that at other loci, following a severe population bottleneck. Among 18 individuals, we found nine alleles based on exon 2 sequences of the Class IIb region (which includes the peptide binding region). Individuals carried from one to three of the loci identified from previous laboratory studies. Genetic variation was an order of magnitude higher at the MHC compared with three single-copy nuclear genes, but all loci showed high levels of heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity and there was not an excess of homozygosity or decrease in diversity over time that would suggest extensive inbreeding in the introduced population. Tajima’s D was positive for all loci, which is consistent with a bottleneck. Moreover, comparison with published sequences identified the source of the introduced population as the Western Cape region of South Africa, where most commercial suppliers have obtained their stocks. These factors suggest that despite founding by potentially already inbred individuals, the alien population in Wales has maintained substantial genetic variation at both adaptively important and neutral genes...|$|R

The prevalence of TBT and TPT {{in the environment}} prompted us to test whether they could also affect TH signaling. Both trialkyltins induced the integrated luciferase reporter alone and potentiated TH activation at low doses. Trimethyltin, which is not an RXR agonist, did not. Weturned to a simple, robust, and specific in vivo model system of TH action: metamorphosis of <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis,</b> the African <b>clawed</b> <b>frog.</b> Using a precocious metamorphosis assay, we found that 1 nM TBT and TPT, but not trimethyltin, greatly potentiated the effect of TH treatment on resorption phenotypes of the tail, which is lost at metamorphosis, and in the head, which undergoes extensive remodeling including gill loss. Consistent with these responses, TH-induced caspase- 3 activation in the tail was enhanced by cotreatment with TBT. Induction of a transgenic reporter gene and endogenous collagenase 3 (mmp 13) and fibroblast-activating protein-α (fap) genes were not induced by TBT alone, but TH induction was significantly potentiated by TBT. However, induction of other TH receptor target genes such as TRβ and deiodinase 3 by TH were not affected by TBT cotreatment.

The effect of these dilutions is considered to be due to non-molecular information transfer to the solvent during the process of succussion and dilution. High dilutions are not suitable to pharmacokinetic investigation due to their lack of detectable active ingredient and the lack of analytical methods with sufficient sensitivity; however, laboratory and clinical studies are providing experimental evidence contributing to the pharmacodynamics of high dilution remedies. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of ultra-high dilutions of Thyroxine on the morphogenesis of <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis</b> tadpoles using potencies of 6 C, 30 C and 200 C, to determine if the effect is stimulatory or inhibitory to morphogenesis and whether the various potencies have similar or different effects on morphogenesis. The morphogenesis of <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis,</b> the African <b>clawed</b> <b>frog,</b> is dependent entirely on the thyroid system and the production of thyroxine; they require the initiation and maintenance of high levels of circulating thyroid hormones to make the transition from tadpole to juvenile frog. Exposure of tadpoles to exogenous thyroid hormones can induce precocious morphogenesis, whilst withholding thyroid hormones by surgical ablation of the thyroid gland will prevent any further development until such time that the hormone is replaced. Homeopathy is based on the “Law of Similars” and the idea of “Like cures like”. This implies that a crude substance capable of producing particular symptoms in a healthy individual, in homeopathic dilution, is able to cure these same symptoms expressed as a disease.

Genetic and environmental perturbations of such hormonal control may cause irreversible morphological and physiological impairments and may also predispose individuals to diseases of adulthood, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Endocrine and molecular mechanisms that regulate perinatal development and that underlie the connections between early life events and adult diseases are not well elucidated. Such mechanisms are difficult to study in uterus-enclosed mammalian embryos because of confounding maternal effects. To elucidate mechanisms of developmental endocrinology in the perinatal period, <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis</b> the African <b>clawed</b> <b>frog</b> is a valuable vertebrate model. Frogs and humans have identical hormones which peak at birth and metamorphosis, have conserved hormone receptors and mechanisms of gene regulation, and have comparable roles for hormones in many target organs. Study of molecular and endocrine mechanisms of hormone-dependent development in frogs is advantageous because an extended free-living larval period followed by metamorphosis (1) is independent of maternal endocrine influence, (2) exhibits dramatic yet conserved developmental effects induced by thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones, and (3) begins at a developmental stage with naturally undetectable hormone levels, thereby facilitating endocrine manipulation and interpretation of results. This review highlights the utility of frog metamorphosis to elucidate molecular and endocrine actions, hormone interactions, and endocrine disruption, especially with respect to thyroid hormone. Knowledge from the frog model is expected to provide fundamental insights to aid medical understanding of endocrine disease, stress, and endocrine disruption affecting the perinatal period in humans...|$|R

Only those data contained in reports indicating precise occurrence localities, which were confirmed by our own observations and by at least two independent sources including at least a peer-reviewed publication, were considered as certain. Data in literature that did not meet these criteria were considered doubtful and reported separately as unverified data. The information provided by websites has been excluded as it often contains unfounded and erroneous data. The fauna of Sicilian inland waters host at present 31 confirmed NIS. In addition, the presence of further 11 taxa is dubious. Among the verified data, invertebrate and vertebrate taxa are nearly equally represented, with 15 and 16 taxa, respectively. With 16 species, the phylum Chordata {{is by far the}} most represented, followed by Mollusca (8 species) and Arthropoda (6 species). Most of these species were detected in the last 30 years due to the lack of previous regular studies on Sicilian freshwaters. With few exceptions (e. g., the recent introduction of <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis,</b> the African <b>clawed</b> <b>frog),</b> NIS' effects on native biota have not extensively studied in the island yet. Although the top-down effects caused by introduced vertebrate taxa are known to deeply modify the native structure of the biota, little information is available on the impacts caused by invertebrate taxa, especially the microscopic ones. The presence in Sicily of 11 non-native species of bony fish is probably the most impacting threat to autochthonous fauna through predation, competition and hybridisation. The results shown in the paper highlight the importance and the urgency of more exhaustive investigations on NIS in Sicilian inland waters with special regard to less charismatic taxa whose effects on the native biota have never been evaluated yet...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. (Homoeopathy) Abstract: The use of ultra-high dilutions {{and their}} effect {{has been the}} subject of much debate and {{controversy}} for the practice of homeopathy. The effect of these dilutions is considered to be due to nonmolecular information transfer to the solvent during the process of succussion and dilution. High dilutions are not suitable to pharmacokinetic investigation due to their lack of detectable active ingredient and the lack of analytical methods with sufficient sensitivity; however, laboratory and clinical studies are providing experimental evidence contributing to the pharmacodynamics of high dilution remedies. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of ultra-high dilutions of Thyroxine on the morphogenesis of <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis</b> tadpoles using potencies of 6 C, 30 C and 200 C, to determine if the effect is stimulatory or inhibitory to morphogenesis and whether the various potencies have similar or different effects on morphogenesis. The morphogenesis of <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis,</b> the African <b>clawed</b> <b>frog,</b> is dependent entirely on the thyroid system and the production of thyroxine; they require the initiation and maintenance of high levels of circulating thyroid hormones to make the transition from tadpole to juvenile frog. Exposure of tadpoles to exogenous thyroid hormones can induce precocious morphogenesis, whilst withholding thyroid hormones by surgical ablation of the thyroid gland will prevent any further development until such time that the hormone is replaced. Homeopathy is based on the “Law of Similars” and the idea of “Like cures like”. This implies that a crude substance capable of producing particular symptoms in a healthy individual, in homeopathic dilution, is able to cure these same symptoms expressed as a disease. Using this model, the effect of homeopathically prepared ultra-high dilutions of Thyroxine on the morphogenesis of <b>Xenopus</b> <b>laevis</b> tadpoles was determined. The high levels of naturally circulating thyroid hormones at particular stages of development being analogous to the crude substance causing symptoms, in this case, stimulating tail reduction. Eight-hourly applications of ultra-high dilutions of Thyroxine were administered to the water the tadpoles were housed in from Day 32 of the experiment, while measuring their tail length every three days from Day 32 to Day 48 and daily measurements from Day 48 to Day 58. Tail length measurements were analysed using parametric Univariate Analysis of Variance and non-parametric Friedman and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Mean tail length and peak tail length [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Specifically, MAPK15 {{expression}} is significantly reduced in human lung and breast carcinomas, and MAPK15 down-regulation is correlated with increased cell motility. MAPK15 {{has also been}} found to negatively regulate protein O-glycosylation with acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc), {{a process in which}} a sugar molecule is covalently attached to an oxygen atom on an amino acid residue. Mammalian MAPK15 is a putative regulator of the cellular localization and transcriptional activity of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRa), as well as an inhibitor of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) degradation. PCNA is critical for DNA replication, and is an essential factor in protecting genome stability. MAPK15 has also been shown to regulate ciliogenesis in X. <b>laevis</b> (African <b>clawed</b> <b>frog)</b> embryos by phosphorylating an actin regulator called CapZIP.|$|R
