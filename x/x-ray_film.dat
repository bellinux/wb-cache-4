5|$|Both the mycelia and {{the fruit}} bodies of M.haematopus (both young and mature specimens) are {{reported}} to be bioluminescent. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the dark-adapted eye; in one study, light emission was detectable only after 20hours of exposure to <b>X-ray</b> <b>film.</b> Although the biochemical basis of bioluminescence in M.haematopus has not been scientifically investigated, in general, bioluminescence {{is caused by the}} action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E

Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which were used to measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority.

40|$|The ischiopubic {{index was}} studied in adult pelvic <b>X-ray</b> <b>films</b> of {{subjects}} aged eighteen to seventy years. A total of 120 <b>X-ray</b> <b>films</b> made of 60 males and 60 females {{were collected from}} LUTH, Lagos State. The ischiopubic index was calculated by dividing the pubic length by ischial length and by multiplying by 100. The mean ischiopubic index for males was 101. 05 ± 16. 65 {{and that of the}} females was 115. 99 ± 18. 5. Sex differences of these indices were statistically significant (P< 0. 001) for both sexes. The mean length of the females pubis was significantly longer than that for males (P< 0. 001), and similarly the mean length of ischium in males was significantly longer than that of the females (P< 0. 001). Using <b>X-ray</b> <b>films,</b> sex could be assigned using demarking points to 47 % and 50 % females in Lagos State. In conclusion, this research has provided evidence that the ischiopubic index and the demarking points are reliable in sexing the hip bones of Nigerians (using <b>X-ray</b> <b>films).</b> Thus the ischiopubic index may be of value in forensic and archaeological analyses and in solving medicolegal cases...|$|R

25|$|Barium sulfate is swallowed, which {{because it}} is a radio opaque {{substance}} does not allow the passage of X-rays. As a result, areas coated by barium sulfate will appear white on an <b>X-ray</b> <b>film.</b> The passage of barium through the gastrointestinal tract is observed by a radiologist using a fluoroscope attached to a TV monitor. The radiologist takes a series of individual X-ray images at timed intervals depending on the areas to be studied. Sometimes medication which produces gas in the gastrointestinal tract is administered together with the Barium sulfate. This gas distends the gastrointestinal lumen, providing better imaging conditions and in this case the procedure is called double-contrast imaging.|$|E
25|$|The {{separated}} fragments {{are then}} transferred to a nitrocellulose or nylon filter; this procedure is called a Southern blot. The DNA fragments within the blot are permanently fixed to the filter, and the DNA strands are denatured. Radiolabeled probe molecules are then added that are complementary to sequences in the genome that contain repeat sequences. These repeat sequences tend to vary in length among different individuals and are called variable number tandem repeat sequences or VNTRs. The probe molecules hybridize to DNA fragments containing the repeat sequences and excess probe molecules are washed away. The blot is then exposed to an <b>X-ray</b> <b>film.</b> Fragments of DNA that have bound to the probe molecules appear as fluoresent bands on the film.|$|E

The method has become important in forensic science to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes. The method can also be applied to non-human species, for example in wildlife population genetics studies. Before his methods were commercialised in 1987, his laboratory was the only centre in the world that carried out DNA fingerprinting, and was consequently very busy, receiving inquiries from all over the globe.|$|E
2500|$|Hard tissues such as bone {{require a}} {{relatively}} high energy photon source, and typically a tungsten anode is used with a high voltage (50-150 kVp) on a 3-phase or high-frequency machine to generate bremsstrahlung or braking radiation. [...] Bony tissue and metals are denser than the surrounding tissue, and thus by absorbing more of the X-ray photons they prevent the film from getting exposed as much. [...] Wherever dense tissue absorbs or stops the X-rays, the resulting <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> is unexposed, and appears translucent blue, whereas the black parts of the film represent lower-density tissues such as fat, skin, and internal organs, which could not stop the X-rays. [...] This is usually used to see bony fractures, foreign objects (such as ingested coins), and used for finding bony pathology such as osteoarthritis, infection (osteomyelitis), cancer (osteosarcoma), as well as growth studies (leg length, achondroplasia, scoliosis, etc.).|$|E

40|$|The Impression that {{physicians}} {{have become more}} reluctant to expose pregnant women to x-rays and an apparent decline in early childhood leukemia incidence in Alameda County, California, between 1960 and 1969 prompted curiosity as to whether a decrease in in utero diagnostic x-ray exposure had occurred.

2500|$|Initially, {{diagnosis}} can be difficult, {{especially when}} other severe injuries are present; thus {{the condition is}} commonly diagnosed late. Chest X-ray {{is known to be}} unreliable in diagnosing diaphragmatic rupture; it has low sensitivity and specificity for the injury. [...] Often another injury such as pulmonary contusion masks the injury on the <b>X-ray</b> <b>film.</b> [...] Half the time, initial X-rays are normal; in most of those that are not, hemothorax or pneumothorax is present. However, there are signs detectable on X-ray films that indicate the injury. [...] On an X-ray, the diaphragm may appear higher than normal. [...] Gas bubbles may appear in the chest, and the mediastinum may appear shifted to the side. A nasogastric tube from the stomach may appear on the film in the chest cavity; this sign is pathognomonic for diaphragmatic rupture, but it is rare. [...] A contrast medium that shows up on X-ray can be inserted through the nasogastric tube to make a diagnosis. [...] The X-ray is better able to detect the injury when taken from the back with the patient upright, but this is not usually possible because the patient is usually not stable enough; thus it is usually taken from the front with the patient lying supine. Positive pressure ventilation helps keep the abdominal organs from herniating into the chest cavity, but this also can prevent the injury from being discovered on an X-ray.|$|E

In a cosmic ray experiment, incident particles come from all directions, and passive ECs provide no time-domain information. These complications make the problem unique. The product of mapping is a catalog of cosmic ray cascades in the detector satisfying a set of cut criteria, thus qualifying for further investment of analysis effort.
