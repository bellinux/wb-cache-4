40|$|XBRL {{stands for}} {{extensible}} business reporting language. It is an XML based computer language for reporting business information. Starting December 2008, the United States Security and Exchange Commission (US SEC) has a proposal requiring top 500 public companies to file their financial statements with the SEC {{not only in}} the text format (i. e., in ASCII or HTML) but also in the XBRL format. The file created using XRBL language is called an <b>XBRL</b> <b>instance</b> <b>document.</b> Under this requirement, the filers are not required to obtain a third party assurance on the <b>XBRL</b> <b>instance</b> <b>document.</b> The main reason for not requiring a third party independent assurance of XBRL instance documents is to encourage filers to comply with the SEC requirement without incurring much added costs. In addition, to encourage the filers to comply with this requirement, the SEC is not holding filers legally liable of any errors in the filed XBRL instance documents so long as they look similar to the standard reports when viewed using the SEC viewer. Even though the SEC is not currently requiring a third party assurance of the XBRL instance documents of the SEC filings, it {{is in the best interest}} of the public that these documents b...|$|E
40|$|The revolutionary Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) was {{developed}} to provide financial information users with a standardized method to prepare, publish, and exchange business information. XBRL is being used, being implemented, or being pilot tested {{around the world for}} financial reporting and government e-filings as well as other uses. Although there has been growing awareness about assurance issues related to the use of XBRL, current audit practices and standards fall short of providing the needed guidance for the provision of assurance on XBRL instance documents. In this paper, we report on a mock audit that we conducted on the <b>XBRL</b> <b>instance</b> <b>document</b> of United Technologies Corporation’s October 2005 10 -Q to identify the issues that companies and auditors might encounter if they are requested to provide assurance on XBRL instance documents.

Advanced extraction processes of the information needs to be performed. This thesis evaluates an ontology guided approach for extracting financial information from semi-structured information sources. A financial ontology has been constructed based on an investigation of 50 articles gathered from Intermedium’s agent. Instances with synonyms, the words to extract from the text, and relations between the instances have been defined. The ontology language RDF has been chosen and used as ontology language through the entire thesis. A prototype application has been developed to perform the extraction process. Articles are loaded from XML files; words to extract from the text are found by query the ontology using the query language RDQL; NLP and NLTK are used to do the extraction based on the words found in the ontology; Velocity template is used to get the proper structure in the output files RDF and <b>XBRL</b> <b>instance</b> <b>document.</b> The ontology is providing the application with knowledge in the extraction process. When a synonym is found in one instance, a query for reference to other instances is performed, and synonyms of these instances are searched for in the text.

The result is presented with semantic tagging in RDF syntax. A part of the information extracted is also shown as an example of how the financial standard XBRL can be given.

40|$|The {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} a technological revolution fueled by {{the widespread use of}} the Internet, web technologies, and their applications. Within financial reporting, proponents of extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) argue that XBRL will revolutionize financial reporting since it allows corporate financial information to be aggregated, transmitted, and analyzed quicker and more accurately (Hoffman and Strand 2001; Hannon 2002; Bovee et al. 2005; Willis 2005; Cox 2006). The SEC recently mandated that publicly traded companies furnish financial information in XBRL format (Rummel 2008; SEC 2009 a). Thus, the purpose of this project is to provide researchers with a framework for examining the process financial statement preparers use to create <b>XBRL</b> <b>instance</b> <b>documents.</b> Further, the paper (1) demonstrates how the framework may be used, (2) raises unanswered questions, and (3) suggests avenues for future research...|$|R
40|$|As {{the first}} decade of the new {{millennium}} draws to a close, individual investors will find that a new era in financial analysis is beginning. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now requires corporations to use eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) when submitting their disclosure filings. XBRL has been developed by an international nonprofit consor-tium to meet corporate reporting needs. XBRL documents will be made available to the public as soon as they are filed. XBRL-enabled financial analysis tools will enable investors to perform their financial analysis more quickly and accurately. It is now time to consider the needs of financial information stakeholders who will use the information contained in <b>XBRL</b> <b>instance</b> <b>documents.</b> The SEC is encouraging software developers to create XBRL-enabled tools to meet the needs of individ-ual investors and other financial information stakeholders. This paper proposes an evaluation model for reviewing XBRL-enabled financial analysis tools to be used by individual investors. Four freely available XBRL viewers were examined using the evaluation model. The SEC’s currently available tool was evaluated in detail to better demonstrate the use of the model. To place this evaluation model in its proper context, this paper examines what XBRL is and how it will contribut...|$|R

40|$|As an open {{standard}} for electronic communication {{of business and}} financial data, XBRL {{has the potential of}} improving the efficiency of the business data supply chain. A number of jurisdictions have developed different XBRL taxonomies as their data standards. Semantic heterogeneity exists in these taxonomies, the corresponding instances, and the internal systems that store the original data. Consequently, there are still substantial difficulties in creating and using <b>XBRL</b> <b>instances</b> that involve multiple taxonomies. To fully realize the potential benefits of XBRL, we have to develop technologies to reconcile semantic heterogeneity and enable interoperability of various parts of the supply chain. In this paper, we analyze the XBRL standard and use examples of different taxonomies to illustrate the interoperability challenge. We also propose a technical solution that incorporates schema matching and context mediation techniques to improve the efficiency of the production and consumption of XBRL data.

Generating a good organization-specific document structure is, therefore, important since it can capture a shared understanding among the organizational actors about how certain business processes should be performed. Current tools that generate document type definitions focus on the underlying technology, emphasizing tags created in a single <b>instance</b> <b>document.</b> The tools, thus, fall short of capturing the shared understanding between organizational actors about how a given document type should be represented. We propose a method for inferring organization-specific document structures using multiple <b>instance</b> <b>documents</b> as inputs. The method consists of heuristics that combine individual document definitions, which may have been compiled using standard algorithms. We propose a number of heuristics utilizing artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques.

Using an online tool, the questionnaire survey explored the perceptions and knowledge of Romanian accountants concerning XBRL. The study revealed that the majority of accountants do not have knowledge of XBRL nevertheless they are open to the idea of voluntary implementing XBRL in Romania. Although Romania is a provisional XBRL jurisdiction the research showed that the standard is not used in this country. We found that the Romanian accountants have a preference for an automated process for creation, editing, viewing and validation of <b>XBRL</b> <b>instance</b> files and they consider that the CFO has the main responsibility for the XBRL files reliability. I consider that my study enhances the academic understanding of XBRL by exposing also the perceptions and needs of Romanian accountants regarding the standard.
