5|$|In {{contrast}} to the older AN/MPQ-53 Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar set of the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-2, the Green Pine is an {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) solid state radar. Unlike the advanced AN/TPY-2 <b>X</b> <b>band</b> radar of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, Green Pine operates at L band - in the range 500 MHz to 1,000MHz, or 1,000MHz to 2,000MHz.|$|E
5|$|The F-16A/B was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Westinghouse AN/APG-66 fire-control radar. Its slotted planar array antenna {{was designed to be}} compact to fit into the F-16's relatively small nose. In uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-clutter environment, and in look-down/shoot-down employs a medium PRF for heavy clutter environments. It has four operating frequencies within the <b>X</b> <b>band,</b> and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather. The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added a more powerful signal processing, higher output power, improved reliability and increased range in cluttered or jamming environments. The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory.|$|E
5|$|The antennas at TSS serve {{more than}} thirty {{missions}} and contain both a multi-frequency uplink and L, S and <b>X</b> <b>band</b> downlink.

By {{using a combination of}} SvalSat and TrollSat, customers can download data twice per orbit, twenty-six times per day, with only a forty-minute maximum delay. These are the only two ground stations able to communicate with all orbits of LEO satellites. Tromsø is connected to SvalSat via the Svalbard Undersea Cable System.|$|E

5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's <b>X</b> <b>band</b> (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E

25|$|Originally, the AN/SPY-3 active {{electronically}} scanned array primarily <b>X</b> <b>band</b> radar was to {{be married}} with Lockheed Martin's AN/SPY-4 S band volume search radar. Raytheon's X-band, active-array SPY-3 Multi-Function Radar (MFR) offers superior medium to high altitude performance over other radar bands, and its pencil beams give it an excellent ability to focus in on targets. SPY-3 will be the primary radar used for missile engagements.

25|$|By January 1942, a {{team working}} on the antenna problem had {{developed}} an initial concept consisting of a long rectangular waveguide with small slots cut into the front side. The concept was an early example of what is today {{referred to as a}} slot antenna. Radio signals escaping through a slot would interfere with the signal from other slots, strongly suppressing the signal in certain directions while adding up in others. The result was a tightly focused beam. However, given the frequencies available, in the <b>X</b> <b>band,</b> any antenna wide enough to produce useful resolution proved to also be wide enough to generate very strong side lobes. These ruined the display, not only leaking away signal uselessly, but also causing returns from the sides of the antenna that could not be distinguished from ones in front of it.|$|E

25|$|The first F-100D (54–2121) flew on 24 January 1956, piloted by Daniel Darnell. It entered {{service on}} 29 September 1956 with the 405th Fighter Wing at Langley AFB. The {{aircraft}} suffered from reliability {{problems with the}} constant speed drive which provides constant-frequency current to the electrical systems. In fact, the drive was so unreliable that the USAF required it {{to have its own}} oil system to minimize damage in case of failure. Landing gear and brake parachute malfunctions claimed a number of aircraft, and the refueling probes had a tendency to break away during high speed maneuvers. Numerous post-production fixes created such a diversity of capabilities between individual aircraft that, by 1965, around 700 F-100Ds underwent High Wire modifications to standardize the weapon systems. High Wire modifications took 60 days per aircraft at a cost for the entire project of US $150 million. In 1966, the Combat Skyspot program fitted some F-100Ds with an <b>X</b> <b>band</b> radar transmitter to allow for ground-directed bombing in inclement weather or at night.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{characterisation}} of {{soil surface}} roughness {{is a key}} requirement for the correct analysis of radar backscattering behaviour.
