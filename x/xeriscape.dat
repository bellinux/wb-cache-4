It is considered easy to grow and pest-resistant.

50|$|In some areas, {{terms as}} water-conserving landscapes, drought-tolerant landscaping, and smart scaping are used instead. Plants whose natural {{requirements}} are {{appropriate to the}} local climate are emphasized, and care is taken to avoid losing water to evaporation and run-off. The specific plants used in <b>xeriscaping</b> depend upon the climate. <b>Xeriscaping</b> is different from natural landscaping, because the emphasis in <b>xeriscaping</b> is on selection of plants for water conservation, not necessarily selecting native plants.|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 1991 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 19 - 20, 1991, Athens, Georgia. <b>Xeriscaping,</b> {{pronounced}} "Zera-scaping", {{is a term}} coined in Colorado in 1981 {{to define}} {{the process of making}} a landscape more water-efficient, not only in the design phase, but also through proper installation and water-wise management practices that conserve water. The concept involves seven principles which are collectively called xeriscaping: 1. Proper planning and design; 2. Practical turf areas; 3. Efficient irrigation; 4. Soil improvements; S. Mulching; 6. Appropriate plant selection; and 7. Maintenance to reduce water needs (Wade et al., 1988). All are equally important in improving overall landscape water-use efficiency and water conservation. The merits of the <b>xeriscaping</b> principles in water conservation are reiterated again and again in numerous publications and books on the subject, leaving the reader with little doubt that <b>xeriscaping</b> will save water. However, in addition to the well-documented environmental and aesthetic benefits of <b>xeriscaping,</b> consumers often ask about the economic benefits of <b>xeriscaping.</b> Does <b>xeriscaping</b> save enough money to warrant a substantial capital outlay to retrofit an existing landscape? If consumers can be shown economic benefits from <b>xeriscaping,</b> they {{will be more likely to}} implement changes in their present landscape. In this study, a landscape retrofit model and computer cost estimator program were utilized to project costs and potential economic return on investment from <b>xeriscaping.</b> Sponsored by U. S.

5000|$|In 2002, the {{cemetery}} was using 90 {{million gallons of}} water a year to keep the grass in the area green. Plans for <b>xeriscaping</b> {{the cemetery}} began discussion in 2002. The <b>xeriscaping</b> was opposed by many because it was felt that <b>xeriscaping</b> looked less dignified or respectful, according to the El Paso Times. [...] In 2007, the cemetery was <b>xeriscaped</b> with a budget of $4.2 million dollars to convert the land. William F. Tuerk, director of the National Cemetery Administration oversaw the change. In 2013, the cemetery won the Texas Environmental Excellence Award because it was saving an average of $400,000 a year because of cutting costs for water and grass upkeep. In 2013, around 100 grave began to sink in the cemetery due to heavy rainfall in the area. Eventually, 1,300 graves were damaged, prompting geologists, Diane Doser and Lixin Jin and Representative Joe Moody to investigate the cause of the problem at the cemetery.|$|R
