The requirements for such <b>X-by-Wire</b> applications are highly demanding and complex in nature, and there are numerous possible design and technology options available. As a consequence, in all but the most trivial systems, engineering teams who wish to identify the best solution can only hope to prototype {{a small percentage of the}} possible designs.

The FR is a new communication standard intended {{to be used in}} cars in the near future. It is primarily intended for communication among so-called <b>x-by-wire</b> systems. Many fundamental and advanced features of FR standard, as well as basic kinds of <b>x-by-wire</b> systems, can be demonstrated by this educational system. The largest benefit is in an illustrative presentation of the FR synchronization mechanism (SM) in operation, as well as of its robustness. The SM is probably the most important FR process, and provides synchronization among time bases in a FR network. The educational system allows the disturbance of the time bases by modification of clock frequency. External generators are used for this purpose. The changes in SM behaviour can be observed as a result of time base disturbing. The most interesting observation is to what degree the SM is able to cope with this clock frequency fluctuation.

40|$|FlexRay, {{developed}} by a consortium of over hundred automotive companies, is a real-time in-vehicle communication protocol for automotive networks. It is {{being used as a}} higher-performance, time-triggered, and deterministic serial bus in automobiles for many safety-critical and <b>x-by-wire</b> systems. In <b>x-by-wire</b> systems the hydraulic parts of systems such as steering and braking are replaced with electronics. As <b>x-by-wire</b> systems are safety-critical, they must be fault-tolerant, deterministic, and should have synchronized time base (global time). FlexRay fulfils all these requirements as it is a deterministic and fault-tolerant serial bus system with data rates of 10 Mbps for extremely safety- and time-critical applications. As, FlexRay has become the de-facto standard for high speed safety-critical communications in automotive domain, and timing analysis of FlexRay still continues to generate significant research interest. The FlexRay allows both time-triggered and event-triggered messages. The static (ST) segment allows time-triggered transmission, while dynamic (DYN) segment allows event-triggered transmission. As the DYN segment transmits messages based on their priorities; so the delay suffered by a message depends on the interferences by its higher priority messages. Computing interferences of the higher priority messages is a challenging problem for the DYN segment of FlexRay [32]. So, in order to compute interferences of the higher priority messages one way is to use simulation technique. The SystemC simulator proposed in this thesis is used to model and simulate the behaviour of the DYN segment of the FlexRay protocol. This modelling and simulation is done on system level using the system description language SystemC. The simulator estimates the delay suffered by a message instances because of the interferences of higher priority messages. This estimation of delay is done by taking no-jitter/jitter into consideration. Finally, in both the cases the delay suffered by each and every message instance is plotted. ...|$|E

In addition to other technologies like hydrogen or fuel cell technologies, electric cars with highly effi-cient battery power supply play a fundamental role. Especially electric cars with wheel hub drive offer great flexibility of car design and approve completely new mobility concepts. Our contribution to this trend is the setup of a new electric <b>X-by-wire</b> car, characterized by four synchronously controlled wheel drives and four steering drives, which {{is meant to be}} a development environment for both mechanics respectively electronics and software. As this prototypic construction allows a full vertical rotation of each wheel, new movement abilities result with demanding steering tasks, as far as control itself and safeguarding against failure is concerned.

The first generation types of systems are primarily self-contained solutions and added to the existing system set-up of the tractor. As being an important step towards robotics in agricultural machines, a better integration of this technology into the mechanical, hydraulic and especially the electronic architecture is a major issue. In principle, {{there are two main}} strategies for the integration. One is a concept based on a proprietary, manufacturer specific approach. The other one is to map as many functions as possible into the just state of the art becoming open and standardized ISOBUS. Within this paper, the capabilities of ISOBUS to be used for <b>X-by-Wire</b> applications are discussed from different point of views. In consequence, ISOBUS can only be used to create <b>X-by-Wire</b> applications with mechanical or hydraulic backup. Basic real-time capability with a reaction time of 100 ms seems to be achievable. However, some features of time-triggered protocols like determinism should be integrated by simulation on application layer level.
