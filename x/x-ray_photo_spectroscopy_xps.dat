Unfortunately niobium has very low oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures based on several {{studies that have been}} undertaken to remedy this problem resulting in several complex alloys that have yet to offer performance near that of nickel super alloys. In this study the oxidation behavior of several compositions including a single phase and a two phase alloy containing the NbCr laves phase of the Nb-Cr-W system will be evaluated as well as the system 2 ̆ 7 s response to boron additions. Oxidation samples were subjected to a short term oxidation (STO) treatment of 24 hrs at temperatures ranging from 700 to 1400 °C. A long term cyclic oxidation (LTO) study was also carried out to 168 hrs (one week) in 24 hr intervals at temperatures ranging from 1200 to 1400 °C. Another set of samples were subjected to a heat treatment in an argon inert atmosphere for 24 hrs at 1400 °C.

40|$|Carbon foam {{has many}} {{applications}} {{in the fields of}} thermal management, net-shape composites and electronic cooling due to its porous structure, low density, electrical and thermal conductivities. However it is prone to oxidation at high temperatures in air. Whereas some previous studies have reported oxidation protective coatings on other carbon structures such as graphite parts and fibers, there is very limited work on foam. Moreover, earlier methods have used vapor phase techniques such as Plasma Vapor Deposition (PVD) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). There is no known study involving such coatings using simple scalable liquid phase method. This thesis reports our results on such coatings obtained on carbon foam. Boron Nitride was chosen as the coating material. Several solvents and processes were investigated. Finally a two step process using PVP binder in alcohol-based solution is found to be most effective. Unlike other available methods this technique does not involve toxic precursors or by-products. This method is simple and can be obtained at atmospheric pressure. Different coating combinations using various particle sizes were applied and their surface morphologies were studied using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and FESEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Spectroscopy). It was observed that coating formed using 1 μ BN followed by 0. 7 μ size BN particles has the best performance so far. The surface chemistry of this coating was studied using <b>X-ray</b> <b>Photo</b> <b>Spectroscopy</b> (<b>XPS)</b> and found to be that of pure BN after heat treatment. This coating was tested on several grades of aerospace foams having different porosities and cell sizes. The testing shows that this layer enhances the oxidation resistance of all foams to a certain extent. However it is most effective on the foams that have ridged ligaments compared to those having smooth ligaments. On carbon foams having high surface roughness this layer could suppress oxidation even at 800 C and enhance the survivability by 333 %. This coating approach therefore shows promise as a scalable, environmentally friendly way of inhibiting oxidation in porous carbon structures...|$|E

Detecting the existence of proteins, quantifying concentration, and identifying protein types are therefore important techniques in many fields. Immunoassays are one of the major techniques relied on for protein detection. Immunoassays have been broadly applied in disease diagnosis, pharmaceutical development, food science, and environmental protection. The first part of this dissertation describes studies aimed at developing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene as a large size protein biosensing platform. To utilize graphene as a biosensing platform, techniques to immobilize proteins on graphene are critical. In this dissertation work, carboxyl functional groups (-COOH) were created by graphene functionalization, and the functionalized graphene was characterized using Raman spectroscopy, <b>X-ray</b> <b>photo</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (<b>XPS),</b> and fluorescence microscopy. The approach developed here provides information about protein coupling density and uniformity on large scale graphene (> cm 2). The second and the third parts of the thesis describe the application of a microfluidic technique to two widely used protein detection methods – immunoblotting and dot blotting. The microfluidic systems were designed and fabricated to be easily interfaced with a common type of protein blotting membrane called polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The microfluidic device was specifically applied to the antibody incubation step, which reduces antibody consumption and therefore also significantly reduces the cost of the assay. In microfluidic immunoblotting, an approach to activate the PVDF membrane to increase its protein binding capacity was developed. This was achieved by adding a surfactant Tween- 20 to the antibody solution. The concentration of Tween- 20 was optimized so that only the portion of the membrane within the channel region was activated. The system has been shown to be able to profile inflammatory signaling pathways. In microfluidic dot blotting, the influence of substrate hydrophobicity and protein concentrations on device design constraints were studied. Inflammatory cytokine detection using the developed microfluidic dot blotting system was determined. Altogether these experiments demonstrate that applying microfluidic techniques to protein immunoblotting and dot blotting improves detection efficiency, and reduces cost by utilizing less antibodies...|$|E
40|$|This PhD {{research}} {{contributes to}} the part of advanced materials technology. The machining industry currently faces tremendous pressures {{with the need for}} durable cutting tools suitable for eco-friendly high speed machining operations becoming acute. In this thesis innovative design and synthesis strategies are explored to tailor the properties of nanocomposite coatings. Advanced characterisation techniques are applied to identify the mechanisms that control the mechanical, tribological, and corrosion behaviours of these coatings. Cutting tools protected by these coatings are anticipated to exhibit a unique combination of superior toughness and greater resistance to wear and corrosion, providing significant economic and environmental benefits. The thin ceramic coatings are commonly applied to various kinds of steel cutting and machining tools to enhance their mechanical and tribological properties. The most common ceramic coating is TiN. But the major issues that hamper the application of TiN are high friction co-efficient (typically~ 0. 5), lower hardness, lower thermal stability (~ 5000 C) and lower corrosion resistance. To address some of these problems, TiSiN nanocomposite coatings are developed, which have super-hardness, better thermal stability (~ 10000 C) and better corrosion resistance. But the as-deposited TiSiN coating still has high co-efficient of friction (~ 0. 4) and high residual stress (~ 7 - 9 GPa) which consequently affect the adhesion and toughness of the coating. This project aims to address these problems by (a) the application of carbon implantation to modify the structure and chemistry of the surface layer of the nanocomposite coatings with reduced friction and residual stress; and (b) thermal annealing of the nanocomposite coating to reduce the residual stress with enhanced fracture toughness, better corrosion resistance and more thermal stability. In addition, the role of microstructure, residual stress and defects of these hard coating in corrosive environment will be studied. For this research, a combination of microstructural and mechanical properties characterization, corrosion analysis, tribological test and finite element modelling facilities will be used.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a carbonaceous sorbent prepared from sago waste {{for the removal of}} Pb (II) ions from aqueous solution and industrial effluent was studied as a function of agitation time, adsorbent dosage, particle size and pH. Through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), <b>X-ray</b> <b>Photo</b> electron <b>Spectroscopy</b> (XPS) and Fourier TransformInfra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis, the surface properties of the adsorbent were studied. The experimental isotherm data were analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich Peterson, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich equations. The maximum adsorption capacity (Q 0) was found to be 14. 35 mg g- 1 at an initial pH of 3. 5. The Lagergren rate constant for adsorption was found to be constant for various initial concentrations of Pb(II) ions which implies that adsorption follows first order kinetics. Since the raw material used in the preparation of activated carbon is available abundantly, the resulting carbon is expected to be economically viable...|$|R
30|$|The {{surface of}} PMMA was not rinsed with IPA and DI water prior to contact angle analysis. However, rinsing PMMA {{surfaces}} by IPA and DI water may alter contact angles [28]. Two different liquids {{were used to}} carry out the contact angle measurements: ultra-pure water (MilliQ®) and Ethylene Glycol (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK). Static contact angle were measured (using CAM 2000, KSV Instrument Ltd., Helsinki, Finland) by the sessile-drop method at room temperature (approximately 25 °C). A 5 μl droplet of the liquid was deposited {{on the surface of the}} sample, and immediately after stabilization, an image of the droplet was captured. The profile of the droplet was automatically fitted with the CAM 2000 software using a Young Laplace approach. At least ten readings were performed per sample type and the corresponding average values and standard deviations were recorded. We have studied the surface chemistry and roughness of the unmodified and modified PMMA surfaces by <b>X-ray</b> <b>photo</b> electron <b>spectroscopy</b> (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively.|$|R
40|$|Investigations using {{repetitive}} triangular potential sweeps and <b>X-ray</b> <b>photo</b> electron <b>spectroscopy</b> {{reveal that}} stable, surface-bound peroxotitanium species are produced without illumination on mechanically polished n-type SrTiO_ 3, SrTi_ 3 O 7, BaTiO_ 3, BaTi_ 4 O_ 9 and TiO_ 2 polycrystalline photoelectrodes in alkaline media, under anodic polarization. Formation of peroxotitanium species {{is related to}} the chemical reactivity of the surface regions that incorporate the mechanically-induced crystalline defects, according to the scheme: 2 OH_s^- = (O_ 2 ^ 2 -) _s + 2 H^+ + 2 e^-. Bulk flaws present the mechanically damaged surface region allow a quasi-isoenergetic transfer of electrons from the conduction band at the bulk to empty surface states (peroxo species). At much more anodic potential [V_appl ^>_∼ 0. 45 V (SCE) ], the Fermi level is pushed below the surface states and the electrons are transferred from ss to the CB via bulk flaws, leading to the underpotential evolution of oxygen: (O_ 2 ^ 2 -) _s = O_ 2 + 2 e^-...|$|R
40|$|Boron carbide {{thin films}} of {{different}} thicknesses deposited by ion beam sputtering were studied. The deposited films {{were characterized by}} grazing incidence hard x-ray reflectivity (GIXR), resonant soft x-ray reflectivity (RSXR), <b>x-ray</b> <b>photo</b> electron <b>spectroscopy</b> (XPS), resonant Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RRBS), and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). An in-depth profile of the chemical elements constitute the films is reconstructed based on analysis of reflectivity curves measured {{in the vicinity of}} B K-edge. The composition of films is closely dependent on film thickness. Boron to Carbon (B/C) ratio reaches to ~ 4 as the thickness of deposited films increases. The B/C ratio estimated from RSXR measurements are in agreement with the RRBS measurements. TOF-SIMS data also suggested that decrease in boron content with decrease in film thickness. XPS measurements confirm the presence of little amount of B atoms on the surface of low thickness film. Comment: 29 pages, 9 figures and one tabl...|$|R
