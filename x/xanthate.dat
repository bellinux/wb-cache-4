30|$|A subbituminous coal was {{oxidized}} {{with air}} at 150  °C {{on a fixed}} bed for 4  h and <b>xanthated</b> with carbon disulfide in a basic solution, at 30 or 5 – 10  °C. This <b>xanthated</b> coal was evaluated {{for the removal of}} Hg 2 + and Cd 2 + from 7, 000  mg/L aqueous solutions; metal concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The ion exchange of the <b>xanthated</b> coal was compared against those of the original subbituminous coal, a sulfonated subbituminous coal, activated carbon, commercial activated carbon, and commercial synthetic resin. The commercial synthetic resin showed the highest exchange capacity (concentration factor 98  %) followed by the <b>xanthated</b> coal (concentration factor 96  %). The retention of cadmium on the sulfonated subbituminous coal was lower (exchange capacity 0.56  meq/g) than that of <b>xanthated</b> coals (1.85  ±  0.09  meq/g). Our <b>xanthated</b> coal showed a better Cd 2 + removal (81  % against 15  %) than a non preoxidized 40 -h-xanthated coal, which shows that oxidation of coal increased the amount of oxygenated groups which enhanced xanthation.|$|R
30|$|We {{oxidized}} and <b>xanthated</b> a subbituminous coal from Montelíbano Córdoba (Colombia) {{with carbon}} disulfide in a basic solution, at 30 or 5 – 10  °C at different coal particle sizes. The exchange {{capacity of the}} <b>xanthated</b> coal increased when the particle size decreased. Only a commercial synthetic resin showed a slightly higher exchange capacity than our <b>xanthated</b> coal. In general, Hg 2 + was removed less effectively from the aqueous solutions than Cd 2 +. Oxidation, previous to xanthation, increased metal retention in the coal to values comparable with those of a commercial synthetic resin. In general, the exchange capacities for the exchangers followed this order: Commercial activated carbons < non-treated subbituminous coal < our activated carbon < sulfonated subbituminous coal < our <b>xanthated</b> coal < commercial synthetic resin.|$|R
