2500|$|After sending art samples, McLoughlin found {{stories to}} {{illustrate}} for the Scottish publishing firm D.C. Thomson and Co., Ltd., in 1974. He {{has been working}} for them ever since and contributed to just about all of their adventure titles (all of which are now defunct) including Wizard, Victor, Buddy, Crunch, Bullet, and Scoop. Primarily, however, McLoughlin's work appeared in Wizard. At his height with the company (22 October 1977), five McLoughlin stories graced the pages of two Thomson titles, Wizard and Bullet. Perhaps the best regarded of McLoughlin's strips for Thomson were [...] "Sign of the Shark" [...] featuring <b>x-agent</b> Jake Jeffords, [...] "The Green Lizard" [...] which was a science fiction tale, and [...] "The Shark" [...] featuring the crew of a German E-Boat during World War II. Unfortunately, {{the days of the}} traditional British comic story paper were already numbered by the late-1970s and by 1983, most ceased publication. Denis drew two western features for the 1983 Look and Learn Annual before beginning his monthly stint for Thomson's Commando, a 64-page war comic digest which sees four issues released twice a month (96 issues a year). McLoughlin produced about one issue of Commando a month until his death on 22 April 2002.|$|E
5000|$|<b>X-Agent</b> or XAgent is a malware program {{designed}} to collect and transmit hacked files from iPhones to servers operated by hackers. It employs phishing attacks and the {{program is designed to}} [...] "hop" [...] from device to device. In 2016, CrowdStrike identified an Android variant of the malware for the first time, and claimed that the malware targeted members of the Ukrainian military by distributing an infected version of an app to control D-30 Howitzer artillery. The Ukrainian army denied CrowdStrike's report and stated that losses of Howitzer artillery pieces had [...] "nothing to do with the stated cause".|$|E
50|$|Software that Fancy Bear {{has used}} {{includes}} ADVSTORESHELL, CHOPSTICK, JHUHUGIT, and XTunnel. Fancy Bear utilises {{a number of}} implants, including Foozer, WinIDS, <b>X-Agent,</b> X-Tunnel, Sofacy, and DownRange droppers. Based on compile times, FireEye concluded that Fancy Bear has consistently updated their malware since 2007. To avert detection, Fancy Bear returns to the environment to switch their implants, changes its command and control channels, and modifies its persistent methods. The threat group implements counter-analysis techniques to obfuscate their code. They add junk data to encoded strings, making decoding difficult without the junk removal algorithm. Fancy Bear takes measures to prevent forensic analysis of its hacks, resetting the timestamps on files and periodically clearing the event logs.|$|E
5000|$|Garogan <b>X-Agents</b> - They are a {{squadron}} of Garogas that were highly trained for any situation. They were the last weapons sent to kill Zone Fighter. During the series finale they merge to create the monster, Grotogauros.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2016, Ars Technica IT editor Sean Gallagher {{reviewed}} the publicly available evidence, and wrote that attribution of the DNC hacks to Russian intelligence {{was based on}} clues from attack methods and similarity to other cases, as the hacking was tracked in real time since May 2016 by CrowdStrike's monitoring tools. Cybersecurity analyst Jeffrey Carr stated that CrowdStrike's inferences pointing at the Russian intelligence services were baseless because the incriminated <b>X-Agent</b> tool was freely available for anyone to download. Wordfence and Errata Security noted that the PHP malware referenced in the Joint Analysis Report was an out-of-date version [...] "used by hundreds if not thousands of hackers, mostly associated with Russia, but also {{throughout the rest of}} the world." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to CrowdStrike from 2014 to 2016, the Russian APT Fancy Bear used Android malware {{to target}} the Ukrainian Army's Rocket Forces and Artillery. They {{distributed}} an infected version of an Android app whose original purpose was to control targeting data for the D-30 Howitzer artillery. The app, used by Ukrainian officers, was loaded with the <b>X-Agent</b> spyware and posted online on military forums. CrowdStrike claims the attack was successful, with more than 80% of Ukrainian D-30 Howitzers destroyed, the highest percentage loss of any artillery pieces in the army (a percentage {{that had never been}} previously reported and would mean the loss of nearly the entire arsenal of the biggest artillery piece of the Ukrainian Armed Forces). According to the Ukrainian army this number is incorrect and that losses in artillery weapons [...] "were way below those reported" [...] and that that these losses [...] "have {{nothing to do with the}} stated cause".|$|E

CrowdStrike has since revised this report after the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) disavowed its original report, claiming that the malware hacks resulted in losses of 15-20% rather than their original figure of 80%.|$|E
