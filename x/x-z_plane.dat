The bridging boron site is tetrahedrally coordinated by four boron atoms. Those atoms are another boron atom in the counter bridge site and three equatorial boron atoms of one of three B12 icosahedra. Aluminium atoms are separated by 0.2911nm and are arranged in lines parallel to the x-axis, whereas yttrium atoms are separated by 0.3405nm. Both the Y atoms and B12 icosahedra form zigzags along the x-axis. The bridging boron atoms connect three equatorial boron atoms of three icosahedra and those icosahedra make up a network parallel to the (101) crystal plane (<b>x-z</b> <b>plane</b> in the figure). The bonding distance between the bridging boron and the equatorial boron atoms is 0.1755nm, which is typical for the strong covalent B-B bond (bond length 0.17–0.18nm); thus, the bridging boron atoms strengthen the individual network planes. On the other hand, the large distance between the boron atoms within the bridge (0.2041nm) suggests weaker interaction, and thus the bridging sites contribute little to the bonding between the network planes.|$|E

A mathematically idealized benchmark is derived to test the reliability method in isolation prior to coupling with a deterministic finite element method.

More recently, BEC of atoms with long-range dipolar atomic interaction are used in theoretical and experimental studies. For dipolar atomic interaction, the GP equation is a partial integro-differential equation, requiring complex algorithm for its numerical solution. Here we present numerical algorithms for both stationary and non-stationary solutions of the full three-dimensional (3 D) GP equation for a dipolar BEC, including the contact interaction. We also consider the simplified one- (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) GP equations satisfied by cigar- and disk-shaped dipolar BECs.

The calculation for the round-trip is the same as the traditional calculation for the light pulse in the arm of the Michelson-Morley apparatus which is oriented perpendicular to the direction of motion. The moving observer will infer that the pulse is traveling perpendicular to the <b>x-z</b> <b>plane,</b> since no change in x or z is recorded; the direction of pulse motion is y. A second moving observer located at (x0,y,z0) will receive and return the pulse to (x0,0,z0). As a result of the assumption that the speed of light is c in the moving frame, the moving observers will infer that the distance from (x0,0,z0) to (x0,y,z0) is y = c(tR - t0)/2, where tR is the time the pulse returns to (x0,0,z0), as observed in the moving frame. A preferred frame observer will view the pulse as traveling with a horizontal velocity equal to that of the moving observer, so that the pulse always maintains a value of x = x0 in the moving frame. Thus a preferred frame observer sees the pulse travel a distance in the X direction of V(TY - T0) and a distance in the Y direction of Y leading to a total travel distance of + V2(TY1/2 during each half of the round-trip, where (TY - T0) is the time required for each half of the round-trip, (TY - T0) = + V2(TY1/2/C = Y/C.

By Postulate DJL-I the moving clock will advance by (tR - t0) = (TR - T0)/ = 2Y/C during the round-trip; therefore, moving observers infer that y = c(tR - t0)/2 = C(tR - t0)/2 = Y.
