In a study on the LELIA linac (1 to 2 MeV, 1 kA) to study optical diagnostics, a very strong time-dependent focusing effect near the target was observed. The size of the spot emitting Cerenkov light was found to vary with time during the beam pulse. This observation was confirmed on the last Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) studies with the PIVAIR linac (7. 2 MeV, 4 kA, 80 ns). After analysis of this experimental results, a...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{final year}} of the BeppoSAX mission {{provided}} a much needed clue as {{to the nature of}} <b>X-ray</b> <b>flashes.</b> The detection of afterglow counterparts and their underlying hosts provides strong evidence that <b>X-ray</b> <b>flashes</b> and gamma-ray bursts originate from similar sources in cosmologically distant galaxies. These observations support findings that the prompt emission characteristics of <b>X-ray</b> <b>flashes</b> {{are similar to those of}} traditional gamma-ray bursts. Using wide-band observations from BeppoSAX and BATSE, we present the latest results in our on-going effort to quantify the similarities and differences in prompt emission characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Models of nova outbursts {{suggest that}} an <b>X-ray</b> <b>flash</b> should occur just after {{hydrogen}} ignition. However, this <b>X-ray</b> <b>flash</b> {{has never been}} observationally confirmed. We present four theoretical light curves of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>flash</b> for two very massive white dwarfs (WDs) of 1. 380 and 1. 385 M_sun and for two recurrence periods of 0. 5 and 1 years. The duration of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>flash</b> is shorter for a more massive WD and for a longer recurrence period. The shortest duration of 14 hours (0. 6 days) among the four cases is obtained for the 1. 385 M_sun WD with one year recurrence period. In general, a nova explosion is relatively weak for a very short recurrence period, which results in a rather slow evolution toward the optical peak. This slow timescale and the predictability of very short recurrence period novae {{give us a chance}} to observe <b>X-ray</b> <b>flashes</b> of recurrent novae. In this context, we report the first attempt, using the Swift observatory, to detect an <b>X-ray</b> <b>flash</b> of the recurrent nova M 31 N 2008 - 12 a (0. 5 or 1 year recurrence period), which resulted in the non-detection of X-ray emission during the period of 8 days before the optical detection. We discuss the impact of these observations on nova outburst theory. The <b>X-ray</b> <b>flash</b> {{is one of the last}} frontiers of nova studies and its detection is essentially important to understand the pre-optical-maximum phase.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that outflows of gamma-ray bursts are jetted. Some people also suggest that the jets may have structures like ϵ(θ) ∝θ^-k. We test the possibility of <b>X-ray</b> <b>flashes</b> coming from such jets in this paper. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses have shown that this model can reproduce most observational features for both <b>X-ray</b> <b>flashes</b> and gamma-ray bursts. Using common parameters of gamma-ray bursts, we have done both uniform and nonuniform jets' numerical calculations for their fluxes, spectra and peak energies. It seems that nonuniform jets are more appropriated to these observational properties than uniform ones. We also give a spectrum and flux fit to the most significant <b>X-ray</b> <b>flash,</b> XRF 971019 by our model. We also have shown that in our model the observational ratio of gamma-ray bursts to <b>X-ray</b> <b>flashes</b> is about several. Comment: Latex, 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Armoured {{vehicles}} {{have traditionally}} used steel armour as protection against penetrators such as projectiles and shaped charge jets. The latter produce a thin stretching metal jet, usually of copper, with a tip velocity of about 7 - 8 km/s. In {{order to obtain}} more weight-efficient solutions, there is a search for lighter materials and other protection techniques. In this thesis, ceramic and electromagnetic armours are studied. Ceramic materials are lighter than steel, and their high compressive strength makes them useful as armour materials. Electromagnetic armour consists of two metal plates connected to an electric power supply capable of delivering a strong current pulse. A conductive penetrator passing through both plates is destroyed by {{the effects of the}} resulting current. Tests of the ceramic armour materials alumina and boron carbide were performed with reverse impact technique, which signifies that a target assembly (ceramic confined in a metal cylinder) was launched by a gun towards a projectile placed in front of the gun barrel. By this technique yaw was eliminated, but the geometric scale had to be very small. Therefore, we studied scaling laws for ceramic armour through a series of tests with direct impact technique and projectile diameters from 2 to 10 mm. The small scale has the advantage that <b>flash</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>photography</b> can be used to photograph the projectile inside the ceramic target. The phenomenon of interface defeat or dwell was also demonstrated. It signifies that the ceramic, at least for a short time, can withstand the impact pressure so that the projectile just flows out onto the target surface. A transition velocity, above which dwell does not occur, was determined. Simulations were performed with the continuum-dynamic code Autodyn and by use of a model for the brittle ceramic materials by Johnson and Holmquist. The simulations reasonably well represented the penetration behaviour above the transition velocity. They also did below, if under this condition the ceramic model was forced to remain undamaged. The performance of electromagnetic armour was tested against a shaped charge jet. The jet was registered with shadowgraph <b>flash</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>photography</b> between the plates and after passing through the plates. The current through the jet and the voltage over the plates were also registered. The current caused heating leading to melting and even vaporization. The magnetic Lorentz force compressed the jet radially, and as this effect increases with decreasing jet radius, instability may arise. Explosions in the compressed regions resulted in a fragmented jet with disk-shaped fragments which are less effective penetrators than the elongated fragments obtained in the absence of current. We also performed a theoretical study, in which the penetrator was subjected to small elastic strains only and the current was constant. The magnetic field was determined by FFT, and the stresses due to the Lorentz force were calculated with a semi-analytical method. The velocity skin effect was demonstrated...|$|R
