40|$|This paper {{deals with}} verbal {{predicate}} constructions {{used to express}} 'possession'in Indonesian (both 'formal Indonesian'and 'Colloquial Jakartan Indonesian'). In Moeljadi (2010), I stated that there are eight possessive verbal predicate constructions in Indonesian, i. e. <b>X</b> memiliki <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> mempunyai <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> punya <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> ada <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> ada Y=nya, X ber-Y, X ber-Y-kan Z, and <b>X</b> Y-an (<b>X</b> represents 'possessor', <b>Y</b> represents 'possessee'or 'possessum', and Z represents a complement.). The analysis of how Indonesian encodes one 'possession'concept {{to more than one}} constructions shown above has mainly been based on intuition as a native speaker of Indonesian. The conclusion is that the 'register'and the '(in) alienability'notion play important roles in the encoding process. I previously analyzed this based on intuition in Moeljadi (2010), but this time I conducted interviews in 2010 and 2011 in order to make an objective analysis. The data I got from those interviews were then analyzed using cluster analysis. I conclude that (i) only five constructions, i. e. <b>X</b> memiliki <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> mempunyai <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> punya <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> ada <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> ber-Y, can be regarded as encoding the meaning of 'possession', (ii) one construction, i. e. X ber-Y, has a special characteristic and takes a different kind of possessee, and (iii) whether the possessor is singular, plural, the first, second, or third personal pronoun, the acceptability of the constructions does not change. インドネシア語の所有動詞述語構文について、その使い分けの条件や法則性、傾向(形態論、統語論、意味論の側面) を考察する。Moeljadi(2010) では、インドネシア語に 8 つの所有動詞述語構文(X memiliki <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> mempunyai <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> punya <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> ada <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> ada Y=nya, X ber-Y, X ber-Y-kan Z, and X Y-an) があると述べ、母語話者としての内省で分析し、レジスターと'(in) alienability'が所有を表わす動詞述語の使い分けに重要な役割を担っていると主張した。主に内省で分析したMoeljadi(2010) に対して、筆者は 2010 年及び 2011 年に調査を行い、より客観的に分析を試みた。その調査から得られたデータはクラスター分析で分析した。結論としては、(1) 5 つの構文(X memiliki <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> mempunyai <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> punya <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> ada <b>Y,</b> <b>X</b> ber-Y) だけが所有構文として見做され、(2) X ber-Yは他の 4 つの構文に比べて、違う特性を持っており、違う所有物をとる。最後に、(3) 所有者の人称による構文の違いが現れない。論文 Article...|$|R

A mapping f : <b>X</b> ! <b>Y</b> (<b>X,</b> <b>Y</b> subsets of a metric space) is a wobbling mapping if no point in X is moved too far, formally if sup x 2 X d (x; f(x)) ! 1 : Wobbling mappings occur in many real world situations. Rounding in numerical analysis, image processing, distortion of crystals, but also earthquakes are typical. We call subsets of a metric space "equivalent" if there exists a wobbling bijection between them. In particular uniformly spraed sets are those which a equivalent to a lattice Z n considered as Euclidean space. Th...|$|E

Tsukimoto and Morita [1] have developed a scalar algebraic model for classical logic and an algorithm for extracting the nearest Boolean rule from the units of a neural network. We deal with its implementation in the computer algebra system Derive for Windows and discuss the further development of the algorithm to networks whose variables are not necessarily Booleanly `high' or `low'. In essence a Boolean function can be expressed as a multi-linear function which in turn can be expressed as a logic vector, for example, the Boolean expression <b>x</b> <b>y</b> <b>x</b> <b>y</b> xy = + - in the scalar model, which can be written as xy x y y x + - + - () () 1 1.

40|$|Bilinear {{interpolation}} {{is often}} used to improve image quality after performing spatial transformation operations such as digital zooming or rotation. In the traditional case where the input coordinates appear in a raster-based fashion, the required pixel values can be obtained from the previous calculation, the frame buffer and a single line cache. This paper presents a novel approach to performing real-time bilinear interpolation that is useful in applications such as lens distortion correction where the input coordinates follow a curved path that spans multiple rows. To help retrieve the required pixels in a single clock cycle under imposed data bandwidth constraints a unique caching system has been devised. In the event that constraints make it impossible to obtain the four required pixel values, the approach performs a modified three-point interpolation. An example field programmable gate array implementation of the bilinear interpolation method used in conjunction with a lens distortion correction algorithm has been successfully completed.

40|$|Abstract. The Dirichlet {{problem for}} the {{equation}} y∆W + αWy = −F is studied in the semi-circle x 2 + y 2 0. The restrictions on F are established under which the problem is uniquely solvable in the definite generalized sense. Let K = { (x, y) : (x, y) ∈ R 2, x 2 + y 2 0 }, and let ∂K be the boundary of K. Denote ∆W = Wxx + Wyy and consider the equations y∆W + αWy = −F (<b>x,</b> <b>y),</b> (<b>x,</b> <b>y)</b> ∈ K, (1) y∆W + αWy = 0, (x, y) ∈ K. (2) The classical Dirichlet {{problem for the}}se equations is formulated as follows: Find in the domain K a regular solution u = u(x, y) of the given equation which is continuous in K = K ∪ ∂K and satisfies the boundary condition u(x, y) = f(x, y) for (x, y) ∈ ∂K, where f(x, y) is the known continuous function on ∂K. Bitsadze [1] investigated the existence and uniqueness of {{the solution of the}} Dirichlet problem for equations of more general type than (1), while the solutions of boundary value problems for equations of more general type were studied by Keldysh [2]. In [3] Nikol’sky and Lizorkin considered some boundary value problems for degenerating elliptic equations. Weinstein [4], [5] constructed fundamental solutions for equation (2).

In this article, the same transformation of inversion is applied to a hyperpolar Sierpinski carpet placed in an advantageous position with respect to the hyperpolar circle of inversion. This is done in order to obtain a new fractal which also has the property of universality for all compact one-dimensional curves (i. e., the same property enjoyed by both the Sierpinski carpet and its hyperpolar image). A Sierpinski Carpet in the Cartesian Plane Tangent to the Unit Circle at Point (0, 1) Because the property of universality of a Sierpinski carpet does not depend on the length of its sides, one can, without loss of generality, choose the specific Sierpinski carpet with vertices at the points (1, 1), (1, 3), (- 1, 3), and (- 1, 1). This Sierpinski carpet is tangent to the unit circle x 2 + y 2 = 1 at point (1, 0).

The background currents concept [1 - 3] represents a wide class of vortical geophysical flows models admitting chaotic solutions. We will consider such a two-layer model, which {{give us an}} opportunity to take into consideration stratification of a fluid [3]. Thus, the dimensionless current function we used looks like [2]: () () () 0 lnW t y r aK rψ = − − −. It is known that the regular advection region near an elliptic point in models with singularities always exists for any perturbation, even if it is very big. The estimation of minimal regular advection boundaries may clear a passive particle transport problem in the models [3]. On the other hand, this estimation is useful to the oceanology in part of interpretation of point vortices as a finite-core vortices [1]. The question about why all trajectories are regular {{in the vicinity of the}} singular point, though they all are unstable from linear approach also is opened. A positive Lyapunov exponent is known results in occurrence of chaotic properties of trajectories [3]. It is suggested to estimate the boundaries of the regular behavior of trajectories by using the Lyapunov vector projection to the normal of a trajectory. Let us consider the eigenvector projection of the positive eigenvalue on an unperturbed trajectory normal: () 2 2 () /x yпр u uυ λ υ υ υ = − − +nh.
