50|$|Inosine-5′-monophosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (IMPDH) is a purine biosynthetic {{enzyme that}} catalyzes the {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} (NAD)-dependent oxidation of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to <b>xanthosine</b> monophosphate (XMP), the first committed and rate-limiting step towards the de novo biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides from IMP.

50|$|Knowledge of inosine {{metabolism}} {{has led to}} {{advances in}} immunotherapy in recent decades. Inosine monophosphate is oxidised by the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, yielding <b>xanthosine</b> monophosphate, a key precursor in purine metabolism. Mycophenolate mofetil is an anti-metabolite, anti-proliferative drug that acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. It {{is used in the}} treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including granulomatosis with polyangiitis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which cannot operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMD) inhibition.|$|E
50|$|Adenine and guanine {{are the two}} {{nucleotides}} {{classified as}} purines. In purine synthesis, PRPP is turned into inosine monophosphate, or IMP. Production of IMP from PRPP requires glutamine, glycine, aspartate, and 6 ATP, among other things. IMP is then converted to AMP (adenosine monophosphate) using GTP and aspartate, which is converted into fumarate. While IMP can be directly converted to AMP, synthesis of GMP (guanosine monophosphate) requires an intermediate step, in which NAD+ is used to form the intermediate <b>xanthosine</b> monophosphate, or XMP. XMP is then converted into GMP by using the hydrolysis of 1 ATP and the conversion of glutamine to glutamate. AMP and GMP can then be converted into ATP and GTP, respectively, by kinases that add additional phosphates.|$|E
50|$|Nucleoside phosphoramidites are {{derivatives}} {{of natural}} or synthetic nucleosides. They {{are used to}} synthesize oligonucleotides, relatively short fragments of nucleic acid and their analogs. Nucleoside phosphoramidites were first introduced in 1981 by Beaucage and Caruthers. In order to avoid undesired side reactions, reactive hydroxy and exocyclic amino groups present in natural or synthetic nucleosides are appropriately protected. As long as a nucleoside analog contains at least one hydroxy group, {{the use of the}} appropriate protecting strategy allows one to convert that to the respective phosphoramidite and to incorporate the latter into synthetic nucleic acids. In order to be incorporated {{in the middle of an}} oligonucleotide chain using phosphoramidite strategy, the nucleoside analog have to possess two hydroxy groups or, less often, a hydroxy group and another nucleophilic group (amino or mercapto). Examples include, but are not limited to, alternative nucleotides, LNA, morpholino, nucleosides modified at the 2'-position (OMe, protected NH2, F), nucleosides containing non-canonical bases (hypoxanthine and xanthine contained in natural nucleosides inosine and <b>xanthosine,</b> respectively, tricyclic bases such as G-clamp, etc.) or bases derivatized with a fluorescent group or a linker arm.|$|E
40|$|A {{novel and}} {{convenient}} method for nucleoside triphosphate synthesis {{was applied to}} the preparation of potentially nonhydrolyzable <b>xanthosine</b> triphosphate derivatives. The N-methylimidazolide of <b>xanthosine</b> 52 ̆ 7 -monophosphate reacted rapidly with methylenediphosphonic acid and imidodiphosphonic acid to give <b>xanthosine</b> 52 ̆ 7 -(beta, gamma-methylene) triphosphate and <b>xanthosine</b> 52 ̆ 7 -(beta, gamma-imido) triphosphate, respectively, in good yields. Both compounds inhibited the xanthosine-diphosphate-dependent prenylation of a mutant of Rab 5, Rab 5 D 136 N, the nucleotide specificity of which had been converted from GTP to <b>xanthosine</b> triphosphate. The results indicate that <b>xanthosine</b> 52 ̆ 7 -(beta, gamma-methylene) triphosphate and <b>xanthosine</b> 52 ̆ 7 -(beta, gamma-imido) triphosphate bound to the mutant protein with similar affinities and were not hydrolyzed under the assay conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background Mammary {{stem cells}} are {{critical}} for growth and maintenance of the mammary gland and therefore are of considerable interest for improving productivity and efficiency of dairy animals. <b>Xanthosine</b> treatment has been demonstrated to promote expansion of putative mammary stem cells in vivo, and hepatic and hair follicle stem cells in vitro. In the latter, <b>xanthosine</b> promoted the symmetrical division of hepatic and hair follicle stem cells. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if treating primary cultures of bovine mammary epithelial cells (MEC) with <b>xanthosine</b> increases the stem/progenitor cell population by promoting symmetrical division of mammary stem cells. Results In vitro treatment with <b>xanthosine</b> increased the population of MEC during the exponential phase of cell growth, reducing the doubling time from 86 [*]h in control cultures to 60 [*]h in xanthosine-treated cultures. The bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling index and the proportion of MEC in S-phase both were increased by <b>xanthosine</b> treatment, indicating that increased cell accretion was due to increased cell proliferation. Analysis of daughter-pairs indicated that <b>xanthosine</b> promoted a shift from asymmetric to symmetric cell division. Moreover, the 30 [*]% increase in symmetric cell division was concomitant with an increase in the proportion of MEC that were positive for a putative stem cell marker (FNDC 3 B) and a trend toward increased telomerase activity. These results suggest that <b>xanthosine</b> treatment in vitro can increase cell proliferation, promote symmetric cell division and enhance stem/progenitor cell activity. Conclusions <b>Xanthosine</b> treatment increased the proliferation rate of bovine MEC in vitro. This was likely to be mediated by an increase in the proportion of stem/progenitor cells in the MEC population due to promotion of symmetrical stem cell division by <b>xanthosine.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the LysR-type protein XapR {{has been}} {{subjected}} to a mutational analysis. XapR regulates the expression of <b>xanthosine</b> phosphorylase (XapA), a purine nucleoside phosphorylase in Escherichia coli. In the wild type, full expression of XapA requires both a functional XapR protein and the inducer <b>xanthosine.</b> Here we show that deoxyinosine can also function as an inducer in the wild type, although not to the same extent as <b>xanthosine.</b> We have isolated and characterized in detail the mutants that can be induced by other nucleosides as well as <b>xanthosine.</b> Sequencing of the mutants has revealed that two regions in XapR are important for correct interactions between the inducer and XapR. One region is defined by amino acids 104 and 132, and the other region, containing most of the isolated mutations, is found between amino acids 203 and 210. These regions, when modelled into the three-dimensional structure of CysB from Klebsiella aerogenes, are placed close together and are most probably directly involved in binding the inducer <b>xanthosine...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{coffee and}} tea plants, {{caffeine}} is synthesized from <b>xanthosine</b> via a pathway that has three methylation steps.

40|$|Mammary {{stem cells}} provide {{for growth and}} {{maintenance}} of the mammary gland and are therefore of considerable interest as determinants of productivity and efficiency of dairy animals and as targets of carcinogenesis in humans. <b>Xanthosine</b> treatment was previously shown to promote expansion of hepatic stem cells in vitro. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if in vivo treatment with <b>xanthosine</b> can increase the mammary stem cell population. <b>Xanthosine</b> was infused into the right mammary glands of four female Holstein calves for 5 consecutive days. Immediately after each <b>xanthosine</b> treatment, calves were injected intravenously with 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU). Forty days after the final treatment, calves were euthanized and mammary tissue harvested. BrdU-label retaining epithelial cells (LREC) were detected immunohistochemically and quantified. Retention of BrdU was used as a marker for putative bovine mammary stem cells. Infusion of <b>xanthosine</b> into the bovine mammary gland significantly increased the number of LREC in treated glands compared to contralateral control glands (P < 0. 05). LREC averaged 0. 4 % of epithelial cells in control glands and 0. 8 % in xanthosine-treated glands. The increase in LREC in xanthosine-treated glands was supported by a concomitant increase in telomerase activity (P < 0. 01) and a correlation between LREC and telomerase (P < 0. 05; r(2) = 0. 7). Data indicate that in vivo treatment with <b>xanthosine</b> can be used to increase the number of mammary stem cells. This is the first demonstration of an in vivo treatment to increase the endogenous population of mammary stem cells, with utility for biomedical research and dairy management.

40|$|We have {{characterized}} four {{genes from}} the 52 -min region on the Escherichia coli linkage map. Three of these genes are {{directly involved in}} the metabolism of <b>xanthosine,</b> whereas the function of the fourth gene is unknown. One of the genes (xapA) encodes <b>xanthosine</b> phosphorylase. The second gene, named xapB, encodes a polypeptide that shows strong similarity to the nucleoside transport protein NupG. The genes xapA and xapB are located clockwise of a gene identified as xapR, which encodes a positive regulator belonging to the LysR family and is required for the expression of xapA and xapB. The genes xapA and xapB form an operon, and their expression was strictly dependent on the presence of both the XapR protein and the inducer <b>xanthosine.</b> Expression of the xapR gene is constitutive and not autoregulated, unlike the case for many other LysR family proteins. In minicells, the XapB polypeptide was found primarily in the membrane fraction, indicating that XapB is a transport protein like NupG and is involved in the transport of <b>xanthosine...</b>|$|E
40|$|An inosine-producing {{strain of}} Bacillus subtilis was mutated to {{resistance}} against the antagonist of glutamine, DL-methionine sulfoxide. Among the mutants derived, guanosine producers were observed frequently. The best strain, 14119, produced 9. 6 g of guanosine per liter at a weight yield of 12 % from consumed sugar. Inosine production decreased concomitantly. When resistance was increased further {{by exposure to}} higher doses of DL-methionine sulfoxide, another strain, AG 169, was obtained that did not excrete inosine but produced increased amounts of <b>xanthosine.</b> In these strains, the specific activity of 5 '-nucleotidase was lower and that of inosine 5 '-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase was higher than the parent strain.

40|$|The {{levels of}} {{endogenous}} caffeine and theobromine were much higher in buds and young leaves of Coffea arabica L. cv Kent than in fully developed leaves. Biosynthesis of caffeine from 14 C-labeled adenine, guanine, <b>xanthosine,</b> and theobromine was observed, whereas other studies (H. Ashihara, A. M. Monteiro, T. Moritz, F. M. Gillies, A. Crozier [1996] Planta 198 : 334 - 339) {{have indicated that}} there is no detectable incorporation of label into caffeine when theophylline and xanthine are used as substrates for in vivo feeds with leaves of C. arabica. The capacity for caffeine biosynthesis, especially from guanine and <b>xanthosine,</b> was reduced markedly in both fully developed mature and aged leaves. Data obtained in pulse-chase experiments with young leaves indicate the operation of an AMP -> IMP -> <b>xanthosine</b> 5 [prime]-monophosphate (or GMP -> guanosine) -> <b>xanthosine</b> -> 7 -methylxanthosine -> 7 -methylxanthine -> theobromine -> caffeine pathway. The data obtained provide strong evidence against proposals by G. M. Nazario and C. J.

40|$|A central step in {{nucleoside}} and nucleobase salvage pathways is the hydrolysis of nucleosides {{to their}} respective nucleobases. In plants this is solely accomplished by nucleosidases (EC 3. 2. 2. x). To elucidate the importance of nucleosidases for nucleoside degradation, general metabolism, and plant growth, thorough phenotypic and biochemical analyses were performed using Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA insertion mutants lacking expression of the previously identified genes annotated as uridine ribohydrolases (URH 1 and URH 2). Comprehensive functional analyses of single and double mutants demonstrated that both isoforms are unimportant for seedling establishment and plant growth, while one participates in uridine degradation. Rather unexpectedly, nucleoside and nucleotide profiling and nucleosidase activity screening of soluble crude extracts revealed a deficiency of <b>xanthosine</b> and inosine hydrolysis in the single mutants, with substantial accumulation of <b>xanthosine</b> in one of them. Mixing of the two mutant extracts, and by in vitro activity reconstitution using a mixture of recombinant URH 1 and URH 2 proteins, both restored activity, thus providing biochemical evidence that at least these two isoforms are needed for inosine and <b>xanthosine</b> hydrolysis. This mutant study demonstrates the utility of in vivo systems for the examination of metabolic activities, {{with the discovery of}} the new substrate <b>xanthosine</b> and elucidation of a mechanism for expanding the nucleosidase substrate spectrum...|$|E
40|$|Caffeine is {{synthesized}} from <b>xanthosine</b> through N-methylation and ribose removal steps. In {{the present}} study, {{three types of}} cDNAs encoding N-methyltransferases were isolated from immature fruits of coffee (Coffea arabica) plants, and designated as CaXMT 1, CaMXMT 2, and CaDXMT 1, respectively. The bacterially expressed encoded proteins were characterized for their catalytic properties. CaXMT 1 catalyzed formation of 7 -methylxanthosine from <b>xanthosine</b> with a Km value of 78 μm, CaMXMT 2 catalyzed formation of 3, 7 -dimethylxanthine (theobromine) from 7 -methylxanthine with a Km of 251 μm, and CaDXMT 1 catalyzed formation of 1, 3, 7 -trimethylxanthine (caffeine) from 3, 7 -dimethylxanthine with a Km of 1, 222 μm. The crude extract of Escherichia coli was found to catalyze removal of the ribose moiety from 7 -methylxanthosine, leading {{to the production of}} 7 -methylxanthine. As a consequence, when all three recombinant proteins and E. coli extract were combined, <b>xanthosine</b> was successfully converted into caffeine in vitro. Transcripts for CaDXMT 1 were predominantly found to accumulate in immature fruits, whereas those for CaXMT 1 and CaMXMT 2 were more broadly detected in sites encompassing the leaves, floral buds, and immature fruits. These results suggest that the presently identified three N-methyltransferases participate in caffeine biosynthesis in coffee plants and substantiate the proposed caffeine biosynthetic pathway: <b>xanthosine</b> → 7 -methylxanthosine → 7 -methylxanthine → theobromine → caffeine...|$|E

Moreover, a single amino acid substitution could switch the nucleotide binding-specificity of transposase from GTP to <b>xanthosine</b> triphosphate (XTP). Importantly, this mutant protein could no longer function effectively in transposition in vivo but required addition of exogenous xanthine or <b>xanthosine</b> for reactivation.
