40|$|Despite long-standing {{recognition}} of the importance <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> context in meaning making, criticisms have been levelled at communicative language teaching (CLT) for failing to effectively address this {{at the level of}} classroom practice. In fact, {{it has been argued that}} the way CLT presents content reveals a fundamentally reductionist view of communication. This paper uses examples of dialogues from the New Interchange series to briefly illustrate what can be considered a typical shortcoming of many modern commercial English language textbooks: the neglect of the place <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> context in dialogues and dialogue-related activities. This paper shows two ways in which this neglect is manifested and then suggests some concrete ways that teachers can use the SPEAKING model developed by Hymes (1972) to increase their awareness <b>of</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> context and also develop analytical questions for learners. ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{formation}} <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> knowledge in foreign language teaching. Foreign languages are intended to provide interaction {{in a spirit of}} dialogue between cultures, and humanization <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> relations. In our country, today’s students live in conditions of open society, have a wide range of communication possibilities with representatives of other cultures, therefore the social order causes promotion of forming not only the communicative competence as the main purpose of foreign languages teaching but also acquisition <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> knowledge in all educational institutions of Russia. The aim of the research is to identify the necessity of formation of socio–cultural knowledge in a foreign language teaching. The following methods were used: analysis of the psychological and educational literature of methodologists of our country, analysis and synthesis of personal experience of the authors. Identification <b>of</b> groups <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> knowledge and steps of socialization in the course of training became the result of the research. Particular attention is paid to practical orientation of the development <b>of</b> the <b>sociocultural</b> competence in the process of a foreign language teaching. Materials of the article can be useful to enrich pedagogical knowledge, notably, a deficiency in the pedagogy of our country, {{in the study of the}} practical and theoretical experience <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> knowledge forming in foreign language teaching in educational institutions of our country is made up. New ways of thinking at the possibility of social competence development in the practice of the national education opens up prospects for the scientific substantiation of modern innovative strategies of its development. The results of the research can find application when reading courses on theory and methodology of foreign languages teaching, in the preparation of textbooks for this course, as well as in improving the pedagogical culture of the general public...|$|R
40|$|Sociocultural {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} perspective that allows educational researchers {{to take a}} non-dualistic ontology. It {{is an attempt to}} acknowledge the complexities involved in human activity. However, its pedagogy is struggling to develop because breaking the Cartesian Dualism is indeed a difficult task. In this paper, as an attempt to develop an international perspective <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> theory I reexamined Vygotsky’s notion of (a) mind in society (b) mediated action, and (c) zone of proximal development. Then I introduced the post-Vygotskian development in sociocultural theory in Russia, Finland, and the United States including (a) activity theory, (b) activity systems, (c) distributed cognition, and (d) community of practice.

40|$|We {{examined}} whether internalization <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> body ideals mediated {{the relationship}} between conformity to masculine norms and drive for muscularity, leanness, and thinness {{in a sample of}} males from Sweden, US, UK, and Australia. Over six hundred young men [n = 142 (Sweden); n= 192 (US); n = 141 (UK); n = 160 (Australia) ] completed an online survey that included assessments of masculine role norms, body image, and internalization <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> body ideals. Path analyses confirmed internalization as a mediator between greater conformity to masculine norms and body image measures (drive for thinness, desire for leanness, and desire for muscularity) across the sample. However, significant cross-country differences in the strength of these mediation effects were found. Mediation effects among US, Australian, and Swedish males were comparable, whereas these effects were weaker in the UK sample.

40|$|Sociocultural {{factors are}} {{important}} determinants of merger and acquisition (M&A) outcomes. Despite advances in this field, our understanding <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> factors in M&As remains incomplete.

The present article {{contributes to the}} M&A literature by further clarifying the multifaceted role <b>of</b> these <b>sociocultural</b> factors in M&As. We suggest that sociocultural interfirm linkages (complementary employee skills, trust, collective teaching, and cultural integration) between the merging firms influence the level of knowledge transfer in M&As. Furthermore, we argue that HR flexibility (flexibility in employee skills, flexibility in employee behaviour, and flexibility in HR practices) is vital for the development <b>of</b> the above-mentioned <b>sociocultural</b> interfirm linkages in M&As. Finally, we maintain that organizational cultural differences are important antecedents of HR flexibility in M&As...|$|R

These two communities are contrasted to gain insight into the dynamics of social change in the 21 st century. The study confirmed Sorokin’s assumption that our Western society is in the late sensate phase <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> development. Additionally, this late sensate phase was found to have common characteristics with the postmodern paradigm. Further, results of the residents’ survey confirmed Sippy Downs as an integrated logico-meaningful culture in a postmodern environment. This finding justified the inclusion of this particular population in the current study as a model of a typical postmodern community. Additionally, weak signals indicating the emergence of the next idealistic phase <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> change were detected in both communities, although there was a variance in the nature of these signals. The study also revealed that sustainability thinking appeared to be the bridge to the next idealistic phase <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> development.

The socio-semiotics analysis of urban design and architecture {{in the context of the}} two case studies elicited a plausible pattern <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> change.

A new notion <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> homeostasis is introduced in connection with analyzable phenomena and their mutual relations. Purpose.  Study of {{the relationship between the}} phenomenon of the world view and sociocultural identity as a structural and functional mechanism. Methodology.  Phenomenological and systematic methods with the elements of historical method were employed. Cultural analysis is based on using both axiological and phenomenological approach, and also the elements of semiotic approach. Results.   The dependence of identity on the world view is revealed (or is being revealed?), the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>sociocultural</b> homeostasis is singled out (or is being singled out) in the capacity of the mechanism setting up the correspondence in the contradictory unity   between the world view as a subjective image and concrete reality as an objective part of this contradictory.
