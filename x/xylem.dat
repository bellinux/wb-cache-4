5|$|Cicada nymphs drink sap {{from the}} <b>xylem</b> of various species of trees, {{including}} oak, cypress, willow, ash, and maple. While {{it is common}} folklore that adults do not eat, they actually do drink plant sap utilizing their sucking mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|In {{vascular}} plants, the <b>xylem</b> and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots {{are often}} adapted to store food such as sugars or starch, as in sugar beets and carrots.|$|E
5|$|Digestion {{starts in}} buccal cavity (mouth) as {{partially}} chewed food is {{broken down by}} saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly amylases), strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and <b>xylem</b> and phloem feeders.|$|E
5|$|During this process, fungal spores {{germinate}} in the boreholes, {{a reaction}} {{caused by the}} dryness of the tree, creating an appropriate environment and an entry for air. The fungus breaks down the lignin, causing white rot. It moves towards the vertically aligned <b>xylem.</b> The vertical profile shows reddish and white streaks which run {{in the direction of}} growth.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredient}} in maple syrup is the sap from the <b>xylem</b> of sugar maple or various {{other species of}} maple trees. It consists primarily of sucrose and water, with small amounts of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose from the invert sugar created in the boiling process.|$|E
5|$|During winter, {{asparagine}} is metabolised immediately, {{but other}} nutrients, especially phosphates and glutamine, {{are removed from}} the <b>xylem</b> sap and stored in mature stem, bark and leaf tissues for release back into the <b>xylem</b> just before shoot growth begins in mid summer. This is also {{the time when the}} oldest leaves senesce and die, returning nutrients to the plant at the time when they are needed most. When glutamine eventually reaches the leaves, it is broken down and used to synthesise protein and non-amide amino acids such as aspartate, threonine, serine, glutamate, glycine, alanine and cystine. Together with sucrose and other solutes, these are then circulated in the phloem. The phloem sap of B.prionotes is unusual in having an extremely low ratio of potassium to sodium cations, and very low concentrations of phosphate and amino acids compared to chloride and sulfate anions. The low levels of potassium and phosphate reflect the extremely low availability of these minerals in the soil. The unusually high levels of sodium and chloride—at concentrations usually only seen under saline conditions—may be due to the necessity of maintaining turgor pressure; that is, with so little potassium and phosphate available, and that needed in the building of new tissue, B.prionotes is forced to circulate whatever other ions are available in order to maintain turgor.|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including parenchyma, <b>xylem</b> vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup is a syrup {{usually made}} from the <b>xylem</b> sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, {{although}} {{it can also be}} made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{growth is}} the {{elongation}} of the stems and roots. Secondary growth {{consists of a}} progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium layer creates new phloem and <b>xylem</b> cells. The bark is inelastic. Eventually {{the growth of a}} tree slows down and stops and it gets no taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly created}} <b>xylem</b> is the sapwood. It is {{composed}} of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species, and the surrounding cells are more often dead. Heartwood is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the <b>xylem</b> is cellulose, a polysaccharide, {{and most of the}} remainder is lignin, a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a horizontal core will show concentric circles or lighter or darker wood - tree rings. These rings are the annual growth rings There may also be rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the wood. Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright for many years.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, many plant cells, {{particularly}} those of the parenchyma, do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent {{with the ability to}} give rise to a new individual plant. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the sclerenchyma and <b>xylem</b> which are dead at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodelling, an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the <b>xylem</b> tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E
5|$|Stems mainly {{provide support}} to the leaves and {{reproductive}} structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or {{in the process of}} layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary <b>xylem)</b> and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E
5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{are white}} rot pathogens. They {{disintegrate}} the lignin {{of the host}} wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown-pigmented lignin. The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the <b>xylem.</b> If the wood is crosscut, the red rot is vertically positioned, on which bleached, infested areas contrast with intact wood. Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner—wood wasps—include circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through dryness, common in hanging, falling or tanning needles.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} bark {{is known as}} the phloem and this is involved in the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis {{to other parts of the}} tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for strengthening the tissue. Inside the phloem is a layer of undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer. The cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside and wood cells known as <b>xylem</b> on the inside.|$|E
5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of <b>xylem</b> tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.|$|E
5|$|Most fungi lack an {{efficient}} {{system for the}} long-distance transport of water and nutrients, such as the <b>xylem</b> and phloem in many plants. To overcome this limitation, some fungi, such as Armillaria, form rhizomorphs, which resemble and perform functions similar {{to the roots of}} plants. As eukaryotes, fungi possess a biosynthetic pathway for producing terpenes that uses mevalonic acid and pyrophosphate as chemical building blocks. Plants and some other organisms have an additional terpene biosynthesis pathway in their chloroplasts, a structure fungi and animals do not have. Fungi produce several secondary metabolites that are similar or identical in structure to those made by plants. Many of the plant and fungal enzymes that make these compounds differ from each other in sequence and other characteristics, which indicates separate origins and convergent evolution of these enzymes in the fungi and plants.|$|E
5|$|Mutualism is {{well known}} in a few beetles, such as the ambrosia beetle, which {{partners}} with fungi to digest the wood of dead trees. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's <b>xylem</b> tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery, so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. The beetles cannot eat the wood due to toxins, and uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome the defenses of its host tree in order to provide nutrition for their larvae. Chemically mediated by a bacterially produced polyunsaturated peroxide, this mutualistic relationship between the beetle and the fungus is coevolved.|$|E
25|$|Aphids passively feed on sap of phloem {{vessels in}} plants, {{as do many}} of their fellow members of Hemiptera such as scale insects and cicadas. Once a phloem vessel is punctured, the sap, which is under pressure, is forced into the aphid's food canal. Occasionally, aphids also ingest <b>xylem</b> sap, which is a more dilute diet than phloem sap as the {{concentrations}} of sugars and amino acids are 1% {{of those in the}} phloem. <b>Xylem</b> sap is under negative hydrostatic pressure and requires active sucking, suggesting an important role in aphid physiology. As <b>xylem</b> sap ingestion has been observed following a dehydration period, aphids are thought to consume <b>xylem</b> sap to replenish their water balance; the consumption of the dilute sap of <b>xylem</b> permitting aphids to rehydrate. However, recent data showed aphids consume more <b>xylem</b> sap than expected and they notably do so when they are not dehydrated and when their fecundity decreases. This suggests aphids, and potentially, all the phloem-sap feeding species of the order Hemiptera, consume <b>xylem</b> sap for another reason than replenishing water balance.|$|E
25|$|The {{vascular}} cambium produces new layers of secondary <b>xylem</b> annually. The <b>xylem</b> vessels are dead at maturity but {{are responsible for}} most water transport through the vascular tissue in stems and roots.|$|E
25|$|Siphonosteles can be ectophloic (phloem present only {{external}} to the <b>xylem)</b> or they can be amphiphloic (with phloem both external and internal to the <b>xylem).</b> Among living plants, many ferns and some Asterid flowering plants have an amphiphloic stele.|$|E
25|$|Woody – hard {{textured}} stems with secondary <b>xylem.</b>|$|E
25|$|For Banks, rhyniophytes {{comprised}} simple leafless {{plants with}} terminal sporangia (e.g., Cooksonia, Rhynia) with centrarch xylem; zosterophylls comprised plants with lateral sporangia that split distally (away from their attachment) to release their spores, and had exarch strands of <b>xylem</b> (e.g., Gosslingia). Trimerophytes comprised plants with large clusters of downwards curving terminal sporangia that split along their length to release their spores and had centrarch <b>xylem</b> strands (e.g., Psilophyton).|$|E
25|$|Stable isotope {{analysis}} of <b>xylem</b> {{water can be}} used to follow the movement of water from soil into the plants and therefore provide a record of the depth of water acquisition. An advantage to using <b>xylem</b> water is that in theory, the deuterium content should directly reflect the input water without being affected by leaf transpiration. For example, Dawson and Ehleringer used this approach to determine whether trees that grow next to streams are using the surface waters from that stream. Water from the surface would have the same isotopic composition as the stream, while water from farther below in the ground would be from past precipitation inputs. In this case, younger trees had a <b>xylem</b> water isotopic composition very close to the adjacent stream and likely used surface waters to get established. Older trees had depleted <b>xylem</b> water relative to the stream, reflecting that they source their water from deeper underground. Other stable isotope studies have also determined that plants in redwood forests do not just take up water from their roots but acquire a significant proportion of water via stomatal uptake on leaves.|$|E
25|$|Woody dicots {{and many}} nonwoody dicots have {{secondary}} growth originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium or phellogen. The vascular cambium forms between the <b>xylem</b> and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects {{to form a}} continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce secondary <b>xylem</b> to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary <b>xylem</b> and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally. Those three tissues form the periderm, which replaces the epidermis in function. Areas of loosely packed cells in the periderm that function in gas exchange are called lenticels.|$|E
25|$|After {{landing on}} a {{suitable}} tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel {{in which it}} releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's <b>xylem</b> tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near {{the surface of the}} beetle gallery. The majority of ambrosia beetles colonize <b>xylem</b> (sapwood and/or heartwood) of dying or recently dead trees, but some attack live trees. Species differ in their preference for different parts of trees, different stages of deterioration, and in the shape of their tunnels ("galleries"). However, the majority of ambrosia beetles are not specialized to any taxonomic group of hosts, unlike most phytophagous organisms including the closely related bark beetles.|$|E
25|$|Siphonosteles have {{a region}} of ground tissue called the pith {{internal}} to <b>xylem.</b> The vascular strand comprises a cylinder surrounding the pith. Siphonosteles often have interruptions in the vascular strand where leaves (typically megaphylls) originate (called leaf gaps).|$|E
25|$|The {{causal agent}} of Ring Rot of Potato does not overwinter in the soil. The {{bacteria}} survives inside infected tubers or as dried slime on machinery or containers. For instance, if a knife cuts into an infected tuber, the next 20 tubers that the knife cuts {{have a high}} risk of becoming infected. The bacteria enters the host through wounds and invades the <b>xylem</b> where it multiplies via binary fission. If colonization is successful, the bacteria may plug the <b>xylem</b> vessels. In advanced stages of infection, the bacteria will move out of the vessels and break down the surrounding parenchyma tissue before moving into new vessels. The bacteria may also invade the roots and cause them to deteriorate.|$|E
25|$|During the plant's growth period, usually {{during the}} spring, storage organs {{such as the}} roots are sugar sources, and the plant's many growing areas are sugar sinks. The {{movement}} in phloem is multidirectional, whereas, in <b>xylem</b> cells, it is unidirectional (upward).|$|E
25|$|When the {{infection}} occurs {{in an early}} stage of the tomato plant there may be wilting on leaves because Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis enter the plant by wounds, including root wounds, and if the bacterium gets to the <b>xylem</b> then a systemic infection is likely that may plug the <b>xylem</b> vessels. The wilting may only show {{on one side of the}} leaf and may recover during cooler periods. The entire system of <b>xylem</b> within the plant allows the bacteria to form titers of up to 10^9 bacteria per gram of plant tissue. Wilting may eventually spread to all leaves and these leaves, along with their petioles, may also show distorted, curled growth. One way to diagnose a severe vascular infection is to pinch the stem. If the epidermis and outer layer of the cortex separate from the inner stem then you've got a severe vascular infection. These exposed parts will have a soapy feel. Canker lesions, though rare, may develop on the stem. These cankers are necrotic regions where the epidermis is gone. As the bacteria continues its colonization, the canker will deepen and expand. In terms of fruit development, tomatoes may fail to develop altogether or may look marbled because they are ripening unevenly.|$|E
25|$|While {{movement}} {{of water and}} minerals through the <b>xylem</b> is driven by negative pressures (tension) most of the time, movement through the phloem is driven by positive hydrostatic pressures. This process is termed translocation, and is accomplished by a process called phloem loading and unloading.|$|E
25|$|The {{height of}} S.sempervirens is {{closely tied to}} fog availability; taller trees become less {{frequent}} as fog becomes less frequent. As S.sempervirens’ height increases, transporting water via water potential to the leaves becomes increasingly more difficult due to gravity. Despite the high rainfall that the region receives (up to 100cm), the leaves in the upper canopy are perpetually stressed for water. This water stress is exacerbated by long droughts in the summer. Water stress is believed to cause the morphological changes in the leaves, stimulating reduced leaf length and increased leaf succulence. To supplement their water needs, redwoods utilize frequent summer fog events. Fog water is absorbed through multiple pathways. Leaves directly take in fog from the surrounding air through the epidermal tissue, bypassing the <b>xylem.</b> Coast redwoods also absorb water directly through their bark. The uptake of water through leaves and bark repairs and reduces the severity of <b>xylem</b> embolisms, which occur when cavitations form in the <b>xylem</b> preventing the transport of water and nutrients. Fog may also collect on redwood leaves, drip to the forest floor, and be absorbed by the tree's roots. This fog drip may form 30% of the total water used by a tree in a year.|$|E
25|$|Clavibacter michiganensis infects {{the primary}} host {{in one of}} three ways: wounds, hydathodes, or by {{contaminated}} seed. If the bacteria reach a suitable quorum, the result is a systemic vascular infection. In the first stages of invasion, Clavibacter michiganensis resides as a biotrophic pathogen in the <b>xylem</b> vessels.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} cell wall, {{a thick layer}} formed inside the primary cell wall after the cell is fully grown. It is not found in all cell types. Some cells, such as the conducting cells in <b>xylem,</b> possess a secondary wall containing lignin, which strengthens and waterproofs the wall.|$|E
25|$|Photosynthesis, plant water {{transport}} (<b>xylem)</b> and gas exchange are regulated by stomatal function {{which is important}} in the functioning of plants. Stomatal density and aperture (length of stomata) varies under a number of environmental factors such as atmospheric CO2 concentration, light intensity, air temperature and photoperiod (daytime duration).|$|E
25|$|All {{gymnosperms}} are woody plants. Their stems {{are similar}} in structure to woody dicots except that most gymnosperms produce only tracheids in their <b>xylem,</b> not the vessels found in dicots. Gymnosperm wood also often contains resin ducts. Woody dicots are called hardwoods, e.g. oak, maple and walnut. In contrast, softwoods are gymnosperms, such as pine, spruce and fir.|$|E
