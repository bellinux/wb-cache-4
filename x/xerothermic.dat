50|$|The German herpetologist Robert Mertens found a {{pregnant}} Corsican fire salamander in the Restonica Valley that {{gave birth to}} four offspring without gills and already with the characteristic black and yellow of the adults. At the same time, he found normally developing aquatic larvae with their three characteristic feathery external gills on each side of their heads and camouflage blending into the pond's substrate. The astonishing reproductive ability of vivipary is well known from the fire salamander's northwest Spanish subspecies, S. s. bernardezi (Asturian fire salamander) and the alpine salamander (S. atra) from the central and east Alps. This can be interpreted as a local adaptation to <b>xerothermic</b> climate conditions and lack of ponds and brooks.|$|E

5000|$|About 10,000 YBP {{the water}} levels began to level off. At 7,500 YBP the {{elevation}} was 145 m. It continued to rise, by slowing {{for the next}} 2,000 years.

50|$|Across the Orinoco basin, climates are isothermal, i.e, climates {{with few}} {{temperature}} variations {{throughout the year}} (the difference between the average temperature of the warmer months and the warmer months is only 3°C), as corresponds to the inter-tropical zone. Five major types of climate in the lowlands (up to 800 mm above sea level, according to the considerations of Antonio W. Goldbrunner), which are the jungle climate (Af in the Köppen classification), savanna (Aw in the same climatic classification), the semi-desert and the desert proper. It is disputed {{whether there is a}} monsoon climate (according to the Köppen nomenclature) in the Orinoco basin, which would become the fifth type of climate. In any case, the existence of this climate would be reduced to the Atlantic coast of the Orinoco delta, where the influence of the northern equatorial current (which here is practically a coastal drift) influences to make the rains much more important On the whole coast common to the Guianas and Venezuela, but that diminish abruptly in Venezuela when advancing inland. At higher altitudes four or five thermal, climatic, biotic or ecological floors can be distinguished according to criteria used by different authors and their interest in their field of research. Temperatures have a very limited annual amplitude (about 3°C or less), although their daily amplitude is much higher and around 10°C. Rainfall is high, especially in Venezuelan Guayana, where it reaches very high values (4000 mm or more) in some fairly extensive areas. In Los Llanos, rainfall is much lower (1500 to 2000 mm, with an elevation of this amount towards the foothills of the Andes) and gives rise to the presence of savanna vegetation, with gallery forests next to the rivers, and in the Andean piedmont, tropophile forests, which lose much of their leaves during the dry season. The climate chart of Ciudad Bolívar shows the behavior of rains (blue line) and temperature (red line). The shading in yellow indicates the season or season of drought (deficit of precipitations, according to the <b>xerothermic</b> index of Gaussen). However, Ciudad Bolívar's climate is not representative of the entire Orinoco basin, but is rather an anomaly, in the sense that, because of its location with respect to the prevailing winds (by the action of mountains north-eastern Venezuela and the plateaus of the south-east) and this city being somewhat distant from the sea (the influence of the rainfall of the coastal drift in the Venezuelan Atlantic coasts), the precipitations are quite smaller than they should be.|$|E
40|$|In the Chęciny district, <b>xerothermic</b> grasslands {{developed}} on deforested slopes of limestone hills, truncated folds, and mounds. Their origin is directly connected with agricultural and pastoral farming of man. <b>Xerothermic</b> grassland {{belongs to the}} class Festuco-Brometea, and the alliance Cirsio-Brachypodion. The plant association Thalictro-Salvietum pratensis is the most widespread in this area. The <b>xerothermic</b> grasslands have their own characteristic biota of macromycetes. The following steppe, <b>xerothermic,</b> and thermophilous fungi deserve special attention: Agaricus bernardii, Camarophyllus virgineus, Conocybe sienophylla, Entoloma incanum, Hygrocybe konradii, H. persistens, H. reae, Lepiota alba, and Leucopaxillus lepistoides.

However, very {{little is known about the}} actual levels of isolation of individual <b>xerothermic</b> patches at the inter-regional and local scale. In this study, 16 microsatellite loci were used to investigate genetic diversity, structuring, effective sizes (Ne), and connectivity among populations of the weevil Centricnemus leucogrammus at various geographic scales. Analysis of 22 populations from three geographic regions, differing in the time of origin and the degree of geographic isolation of the populations, showed that the isolated populations from northern Poland showed the least variability, whereas those from central Poland and Ukraine sustained a similar level of microsatellite variability and were moderately connected within regions. Very low effective sizes (Ne[*]=[*] 14 – 44) were estimated, and signatures of bottlenecks were detected in all populations. Effective sizes were generally higher in larger <b>xerothermic</b> patches, which constitute a good quality habitat, and in populations sampled in nature reserves, as opposed to unprotected turfs. Such information is useful for the design of conservation and management plans. As C.

The research was carried out {{in the area of the}} Twardowice Plateau (the Silesian Upland) within 9 areas adjacent to <b>xerothermic</b> grasslands. The investigated flora consisted of 220 vascular plant species with the dominance of native taxa. Plants of <b>xerothermic</b> grasslands and thermophilous edges were the most numerous (32 %). The dominance of Libanotis pyrenaica in 4 of the examined areas should be emphasized. The percentage of meadow species was also considerable (25 %). Anthropophytes comprised 18 % of the flora of fallow lands and archaeophytes prevailed among them (9 %). Solidago canadensis, an invasive species, was the constant component of the investigated fallows and sometimes its coverage was remarkable. 			As a result of the high proportion of <b>xerothermic</b> and thermophilous plants, plants associated with dry soils and soils having an intermediate character between dry and fresh, as well as plants preferring slightly acidic to alkaline soils poor in nitrogen compounds predominated in the investigated fallows.

About 85 % of the <b>xerothermic</b> plant species (126 out of c. 150) known {{to be associated with}} <b>xerothermic</b> habitats were collected and barcoded.

The data on this flora have been derived from the literature and herbarium collections as well as they were collected during field research conducted in 2002 - 2009. Family affiliation, life forms, geographical-historical groups, the degree of synanthropization of species and habitat, categories of threat are discussed in this paper. 107 <b>xerothermic</b> species belonging to 26 families and 70 genera were reported from the area of Lublin.

All extinct species (8) belong to the class Festuco-Brometea. The analysis of the spectrum of life forms indicates that the biggest share in the flora of Lublin was observed in the group of hemicryptophytes (57 species) and phanerophytes (14).
