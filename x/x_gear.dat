[...] According to James Fudge for GameSpy, [...] "The gameplay manages {{to be easy to}} pick up but isn't dumbed down enough to annoy expert fight fans." [...] Guilty <b>Gear</b> <b>Xs</b> limited replay value was heavily criticised; Jay Fitzloff of Game Informer said, [...] "Since it's especially weak in the singles game, consider purchasing Guilty <b>Gear</b> <b>X</b> only if you and a friend want to go at it." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{downside}} to the K band system {{was a lack}} of power in the magnetrons. Being physically much smaller than the X band versions, they were difficult to cool when operated at higher power levels.

[...] According to Fudge, [...] "There's a character of choice for just about everyone." [...] The characters' balance was praised by Tom Bramwell and Knutson. Guilty <b>Gear</b> <b>Xs</b> audio had a lukewarm response; according to Chet and Hwang it was [...] "weak", and Dingo called it [...] "atrocious". Mike and Kasavin found the fight announcer's voice [...] "unintelligible", with Mike also criticizing the game's [...] "oppressive" [...] music. Knutson praised Guilty <b>Gear</b> <b>Xs</b> sound effects and music, and Kasavin considered its music appropriate for [...] "the game's fast-paced action, {{as well as its}} anime theme." ...|$|R

The album received mixed reviews. Don Kotowski of Square Enix Music Online gave it an eight out of ten: [...] "The improved sound quality is a plus, as are the addition of new character themes, but some people may be {{put off by the}} fact that some of the new themes aren't as good as some of the older ones." [...] Another reviewer, GoldfishX, gave it a five, calling it [...] "possibly the most ear-grating, hideous sound I have ever encountered in game music" [...] but not giving it a worse score because [...] "Ishiwatari deserves a ton of credit for putting together such brilliant compositions on such pathetic-sounding hardware." ...|$|R
