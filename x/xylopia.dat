40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the protective effects of Negro pepper (<b>Xylopias</b> aethiopica) and African locust bean (Parkia clappertoniana) against carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) -induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Carbon tetrachloride (0. 5 mL kg - 1 b. wt.) was administered after 21 days of feeding animals with diets containing Negro pepper (X. aethiopica) and African locust bean (P. clappertoniana). Serum alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels 24 h after CCl 4 administration decreased significantly (p≤ 0. 05) in rats pre-treated with X. aethiopica and P. clappertoniana than in CCl 4 -treated rats only. Total serum bilirubin also showed a remarkable decrease in rats pre-treated with X. aethiopica and P. clappertoniana when compared to those administered CCl 4 alone. Lipid peroxidation expressed by malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was significantly decreased (p≤ 0. 05) in rats pre-treated with X. aethiopica and P. clappertoniana than in rats administered CCl 4 alone. Histopathological examinations of rats administered CCl 4 alone revealed severe hepatic damage to the liver. However, rats pre-treated with X. aethiopica and P. clappertoniana showed significant improvements in the architecture of rat liver. These findings suggest that X. aethiopica and P. clappertoniana may be protective against CCl 4 - induced liver damage in rats...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the genus}} Pseudocercospora has a {{worldwide}} distribution, {{it is especially}} diverse in tropical and subtropical countries. Species of this genus {{are associated with a}} wide range of plant species, including several economically relevant hosts. Preliminary studies of cercosporoid fungi from Brazil allocated most taxa to Cercospora, but with the progressive refinement of the taxonomy of cercosporoid fungi, many species were relocated to or described in Pseudocercospora. Initially, species identification relied mostly on morphological features, and thus no cultures were preserved for later phylogenetic comparisons. In this study, a total of 27 Pseudocercospora spp. were collected, cultured, and subjected to a multigene analysis. Four genomic regions (LSU, ITS, tef 1 and actA) were amplified and sequenced. A multigene Bayesian analysis was performed on the combined ITS, actA and tef 1 sequence alignment. Our results based on DNA phylogeny, integrated with ecology, morphology and cultural characteristics revealed a rich diversity of Pseudocercospora species in Brazil. Twelve taxa were newly described, namely P. aeschynomenicola, P. diplusodonii, P. emmotunicola, P. manihotii, P. perae, P. planaltinensis, P. pothomorphes, P. sennae-multijugae, P. solani-pseudocapsicicola, P. vassobiae, P. wulffiae and P. <b>xylopiae.</b> Additionally, eight epitype specimens were designated, three species newly reported, and several new host records linked to known Pseudocercospora spp. Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) and Fundação de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG).
