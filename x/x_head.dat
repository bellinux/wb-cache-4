50|$|Following Dillon's eviction, the HouseGuests {{sought a}} spot in the final three in the Solve for <b>X</b> <b>Head</b> of Household competition. In this competition, HouseGuests watched the monitor that would slowly reveal {{information}} about a specific week in the House, such as the Head of Household, nominees, and Have-Nots. In each round, one piece of information will be crossed off. The HouseGuests must correctly identify the information that was left out. The first HouseGuest to buzz in with the correct answer will receive a point. The HouseGuest with the most points will be the new Head of Household. Demetres was the winner. Nikki Grahame surprised the HouseGuests to dress them up for the Big Brother Canada Awards. The HouseGuests had the opportunity to watch memorable moments from the season. On Day 63, Demetres nominated Karen and Kevin for eviction. On Day 63, the HouseGuests laid it all on the line in The Down Under final Power of Veto competition. In this competition, HouseGuests must place a series of questions in chronological order in the universe above. They must then head to the alternate universe beneath them and place the correct answer corresponding to the questions. The HouseGuest who correctly organizes and completes the questions and answers the fastest will win the Power of Veto. Kevin was the winner. On Day 64, Kevin took himself off the block, and Demetres named Ika as the replacement nominee. On Day 64, Kevin cast the sole vote to evict Ika. She became the eighth member of the jury.|$|E

40|$|Without {{guidance}} cues, cytoskeletal motors would traffic {{components to}} the wrong destination with disastrous consequences for the cell. Recently, we identified a motor protein, myosin X, that identifies bundled actin filaments for transport. These bundles direct myosin X to a unique destination, the tips of cellular filopodia. Because the structural and kinetic features that drive bundle selection are unknown, we employed a domain-swapping approach with the nonselective myosin V to identify the selectivity module of myosin X. We found a surprising role of the myosin X tail region (post-IQ) in supporting long runs on bundles. Moreover, the myosin <b>X</b> <b>head</b> is adapted for initiating processive runs on bundles. We found that the tail is structured and biases {{the orientation of the}} two myosin X heads because a targeted insertion that introduces flexibility in the tail abolishes selectivity.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of speed-modulated grid, head direction, and conjunctive grid <b>x</b> <b>head</b> direction {{cells in the}} medial entorhinal cortex {{has led to the}} hypothesis that path integration, the updating of one's spatial representation based on movement, may be carried out within this region. This hypothesis has been formalized by many computational models, including a class known as attractor network models. While many of these models propose specific mechanisms by which path integration might occur, predictions of these specific mechanisms have not been tested. Here I derive and test a key prediction of one attractor network path integration mechanism. Specifically, I first demonstrate that this mechanism predicts a periodic distribution of conjunctive cell preferred directions in order to minimize drift. Next, I test whether conjunctive cell preferred directions are in fact periodically organized. Results indicate that conjunctive cells are preferentially tuned to increments of 36 °, consistent with drift minimization in this path integration mechanism. By contrast, no periodicity was observed in the preferred directions of either pure grid or pure head direction cells. These results provide the first neural evidence of a nonuniform structure in the directional preferences of any head direction representation found in the brain...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study brain biomechanics between contact and non-contact head impact during vehicle crash tests in head kinematics, global brain injury metrics, and region brain strain. Nine array accelerometer package data from dummy head were extracted from 13 lateral and 14 rigid pole crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Head accelerations, HIC values and their duration were computed. Cumulative strain damage measure 15 % (CSDM), dilatational damage measure (DDM), and relative motion damage measure (RMDM) were studied using SIMon finite element head model (FEHM). Averaged regional brain strains were conducted by grouping brain element in SIMon FEHM into frontal, parietal, occipital, cerebellum, fronix and brain stem region. Head contact occurred in two lateral and six rigid pole tests. Head contact durations were less than one millisecond in rigid pole tests and ranged from 3 - 7 ms in lateral impact tests. The ratio of biomechanical measurements between contact and non-contact cases in lateral tests were: translational acceleration 4 x, rotational acceleration 3. 5 x, HIC 12 x, and CSDM 5 x, regional brain 1. 5 x. The ratios were higher for rigid pole tests: translational acceleration 14 x, rotational acceleration 25. 7 x, HIC 29. 5 x, CSDM 12 x, regional brain strain 1. 5 - 3 <b>x.</b> <b>Head</b> accelerations, HIC values, DDM and RMDM increased with increasing rotational accelerations. They were the lowest in non-head contact rigid pole tests, followed by non-contact lateral impact tests, contact lateral impact tests, and the highest in head contact rigid pole tests. However, CSDM values were higher in lateral tests than rigid pole tests for head contact cases, indicating a higher chance of diffused axonal injury in head contact lateral impact tests. On the other hand, averaged brain strain in cerebellum increased 3 x for contact cases, indicating high probability of injury to this region during this model of impact...|$|E

X-rays induced useful mutations. Some X 2 -mutants which seemed of little use to the breeder, segregated at F 3 to yield further useful mutations. The author drew several conclusions on method. By harvesting only the <b>X</b> 1 <b>head</b> of the main stalk and the <b>X</b> 1 <b>heads</b> of several of the first-formed primary stalks, which mutate independently of each other, the breeder would probably get the largest possible yield of factor mutations.
