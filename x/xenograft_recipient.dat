40|$|Allograft {{shortage}} is {{a formidable}} obstacle in organ transplantation. Xenotransplantation, the interspecies transplantation of cells, tissues, and organs, or ex vivo interspecies exchange between cells, tissues, and organs is a frequently suggested alternative to this allograft shortage. As xenotransplantation steadily improves into a viable allotransplantation alternative, several bioethical considerations coalesce. Such considerations include the Helsinki declaration’s guarantee of patients ’ rights to privacy; political red tape that may select for undermined socioeconomic groups as the first recipients of xenografts; industry incentives in xenotransplantation investments; conflicts of interest when a clinician supervises a patient as a research subject; the psychosocial impact of transplantation on the <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipient,</b> {{and the rights of}} animals.

40|$|Infection {{of human}} cancer xenografts in mice with murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) is a long-standing observation, but the {{likelihood}} of infection in vivo and its biological consequences are poorly understood. We therefore conducted a prospective study in commonly used <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipient</b> strains. From BALB/c nude mice engrafted with MCF 7 human mammary carcinoma cells, we isolated a virus that was virtually identical to Bxv 1, a locus encoding replication-competent xenotropic MLV (XMLV). XMLV was detected in 9 / 17 (53 %) independently isolated explants. XMLV was not found in primary leukemias or in THP 1 leukemia cells grown in Bxv 1 -negative NSG (NOD/SCID/γCnull) mice, although MCF 7 explants harbored replication-defective MLV proviruses. To assess the significance of infection for xenograft behavior in vivo, we examined changes in growth and global transcription in MCF 7 and the highly susceptible Raji Burkitt lymphoma cell line chronically infected with XMLV. Raji cells showed a stronger transcriptional response that included up-regulation of chemokines and effectors of innate antiviral immunity. In conclusion, the risk of de novo XMLV infection of xenografts is high in Bxv 1 positive mice, while infection can have positive or negative effects on xenograft growth potential with significant consequences for interpretation of many xenograft studies...|$|E
40|$|Porcine {{endogenous}} retroviruses (PERV) {{represent a}} major safety concern in pig-to-human xenotransplantation. To date, no PERV infection of a <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipient</b> has been recorded; however, PERVs are transmissible to human cells in vitro. Some recombinants of the A and C PERV subgroups are particularly efficient in infection and replication in human cells. Transcription of PERVs {{has been described}} in most pig cells, but their sequence and insertion polymorphism in the pig genome impede identification of transcriptionally active or silenced proviral copies. Furthermore, {{little is known about}} the epigenetic regulation of PERV transcription. Here, we report on the transcriptional suppression of PERV by DNA methylation in vitro and describe heavy methylation in the majority of PERV 5 ′ long terminal repeats (LTR) in porcine tissues. In contrast, we have detected sparsely methylated or nonmethylated proviruses in the porcine PK 15 cells, which express human cell-tropic PERVs. We also demonstrate the resistance of PERV DNA methylation to inhibitors of methylation and deacetylation. Finally, we show that the high permissiveness of various human cell lines to PERV infection coincides with the inability to efficiently silence the PERV proviruses by 5 ′LTR methylation. In conclusion, we suggest that DNA methylation is involved in PERV regulation, and that only a minor fraction of proviruses are responsible for the PERV RNA expression and porcine cell infectivity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Long‐term {{survival}} after hamster‐to‐rat liver xenotransplantation {{has provided}} the opportunity to study the posttransplantation source of major serum proteins and the functional consequences of several different receptor‐ligand interactions, where {{one or the other}} is a xenogeneic protein. We report here that serum albumin, α‐ 1 ‐antitrypsin, complement component 3, and other acute phase reactants switch from recipient to donor origin during the first week after transplantation while serum immunoglobulins remain largely that of recipient. Despite the disparate source of complement (hamster) and immunoglobulins (rat), these two proteins were able to cooperate effectively to produce lysis of sheep red blood cells. Moreover, rat IgA was successfully processed by hamster hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, being present in the bile of successful liver <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients</b> within one day after transplantation. The ability of these liver <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients</b> to survive long‐term in conventional and viral‐free animal facilities without grossly obvious morbidity or unusual susceptibility to stress, suggests that xenogeneic proteins are able to successfully interact with several different physiologic I systems in the hamster‐to‐rat combination. © 1995 Munksgaar...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Immunological and histopathological {{features}} in pig-to-primate renal xenotransplantation are widely studied. Only limited data {{have been reported}} about clinicopathological findings in primate recipients of life-supporting renal xenografts. In human medicine, proteinuria represents a common complication in kidney transplantation and is associated with impaired graft survival. The detection of low molecular weight proteins of tubular origin is considered an early method for predicting potential graft rejection. In this study, the presence and the significance of quantitative and qualitative proteinuria were evaluated in xenotransplanted non-human primates in which kidney function was supported only by the transplanted organ. METHODS: Eight bilaterally nephrectomized cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were transplanted with a single kidney from α 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase gene-knockout (GTKO) pigs transgenic for human CD 39, CD 55, CD 59, and α 1, 2 -fucosyltransferase. In addition to hematological and biochemical analyses, quantitative and qualitative analysis of proteinuria was evaluated by urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC ratio) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis (SDS-AGE), respectively. RESULTS: The main hematological and biochemical changes recorded after transplantation were a progressive anemia and a severe and progressive decrease in total proteins. In urine samples, the UPC ratio was low before transplantation and increased after transplantation. Similarly, SDS-AGE was negative before transplantation, but bands consistent with mixed (i. e., tubular and glomerular) proteinuria were observed in all samples collected post-transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The study of clinicopathological changes in cynomolgus monkey renal <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients</b> provides a valid help in monitoring the health conditions in the post-transplant period.

40|$|Objectives: Re-activation of porcine {{cytomegalovirus}} (PCMV) in the xenograft {{has been}} reported in pig-to-baboon models of xenotransplantation and is associated with invasive disease and consumptive coagulopathy. If xenotransplantation of porcine organs into human recipients is to proceed, donor organs will have to be free {{from a wide range of}} infectious agents including PCMV. However, it is prudent to characterize the antiviral susceptibility of this virus. We therefore investigated the effect of selected antiviral agents, currently licensed for the treatment of human herpesvirus infections, on PCMV replication. Methods: Antiviral susceptibility was determined using real-time PCR and indirect immunofluorescence measurements in a porcine fallopian tube cell line infected with PCMV. Results: PCMV replication was significantly inhibited by ganciclovir and cidofovir (both EC 50 25 mg/L). Conclusions: These results show that, if it proves necessary, ganciclovir and cidofovir should be considered as first-line drugs to treat PCMV infections in <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{incidence}} of ureteral stenosis in a life-supporting human decay-accelerating factor (hDAF) transgenic pig-to-cynomolgus monkey kidney transplantation model and determine the role of possible immunological events in its pathogenesis. Thirty consecutive bi-nephrectomized cynomolgus monkeys received a kidney from hDAF transgenic pigs with or without a ureteral stent. Four monkeys were euthanized prematurely after transplantation. In the remaining 26 cases, the mean survival was 24 +/- 19 days. Except in one case, there was a close relationship between ureter and kidney in terms of type and severity of rejection. There were six ureteral stenoses; five were repaired by stent positioning and resurgery extended survival for an additional 16 +/- 10 days. The stenotic ureters showed diffuse acute humoral xenograft rejection (AHXR), while all cases with no or only focal signs of ureteral rejection never revealed ureteral obstruction. Use of a ureteral stent extends the survival of a xenografted primate, thereby helping to clarify the immunological events surrounding the onset of AHXR in kidneys in long-term <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Xenograft</b> <b>recipients</b> produce {{large amounts}} of high-affinity anti-Gal IgG in {{response}} to Galα 1 - 3 Galβ 1 - 4 GlcNAc-R (α-gal) epitopes on the graft. In contrast, ABO-mismatched allograft recipients undergo “accommodation,” a state of very weak immune response to ABO antigens. These differences in anti-carbohydrate immune response were studied in α 1, 3 galactosyltransferase knock-out mice. Pig kidney membranes administered to these mice elicited extensive production of anti-Gal IgG, whereas allogeneic kidney membranes expressing α-gal epitopes elicited only a weak anti-Gal IgM response. Anti-Gal IgG response to xenograft membranes depended on helper T cell activation and was inhibited by anti-CD 40 L antibody. These T cells were activated by xenopeptides and not by α-gal epitopes. Moreover, allogeneic cell membranes manipulated to express xenoproteins also induced anti-Gal IgG response. Xenoglycoproteins with α-gal epitopes are processed by anti-Gal B cells. Xenopeptides presented by these cells activate a large repertoire of helper T cells required for the differentiation of anti-Gal B cells into cells secreting anti-Gal IgG. Alloglycoproteins with α- gal epitopes have very few immunogenic peptides and fail to activate helper T cells. Similarly, ineffective helper T-cell activation prevents a strong immune response to blood group antigens in ABO-mismatched allograft recipients, thus enabling the development of accommodation...|$|R
40|$|Ovarian tissue {{xenografting}} may {{be applied}} to increase the population size of rare or endangered animals. However, optimal grafting conditions, such as graft position and recipient hormonal status, are yet to be established. The present study, using common wombat ovarian tissue, showed that development of xenografted ovarian tissue to the antral follicle stage can be achieved irrespective of graft position. However, increased graft recovery rates and follicle survival were evident after grafting under the kidney capsule compared with grafting to subcutaneous sites. No increase in follicle development was observed after placing grafts both under the kidney capsule and subcutaneously in the one recipient compared with grafts placed under the kidney capsule alone or subcutaneously alone. Removal of the recipient's own ovaries {{at the time of}} grafting accelerated graft follicle development, with antral follicles seen by Week 12 aftergrafting compared with by Week 16 in recipients that retained their own ovaries. More oocytes were collected from <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients</b> receiving hormonal stimulation before collection compared with non-stimulated recipients.

40|$|The role of {{preformed}} xenoreactive antibodies in <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients</b> is unknown. Humans and baboons possess {{red cell}} agglutinating activity associated with isohemagglutinins and heteroagglutinins (HA). We examined {{the role of}} HA in two patients who received ABO-identical baboon livers. Human antibaboon HA were assessed by correlating serial titers with studies for rejection. Serial direct antiglobulin testing (DAT) was used to detect baboon antihuman HA, potentially produced by transplanted passenger lymphocytes. Patient 1 survived 70 days. The human antibaboon HA titers remained essentially unchanged from preoperative values. Although hyperacute rejection did not occur, {{and there was only}} mild cellular rejection, liver function was suboptimal. Postreperfusion immunoglobulin and complement deposition and histologic changes suggested complement-mediated injury. DAT testing was negative except for passively acquired anti-A from transfusion. At autopsy there was marked bile stasis, but no rejection. Patient 2 survived 26 days with essentially unchanged HA titers until preterminal. Although there was no hyperacute rejection and only mild humoral rejection (without cellular rejection), suboptimal liver function and bile stasis were again noted. Postreperfusion immunoglobulin and complement deposition again suggested com-plement-mediated injury. DAT testing was negative. At autopsy there was no rejection. Human antibaboon HA {{do not appear to be}} associated with hyperacute or cellular rejection, but their role in the complement-mediated injury, suspected in both cases, cannot be definitively excluded.

The graft bed of recipient Lewis rats was prepared by full-thickness excision. Animals were maintained on GSA 25 mg/kg/day × 50 days, followed by 12. 5 mg/kg 2 × /week. Control animals received an equivalent volume of vehicle. All animals receiving split-thickness grafts and treated with CSA maintained their grafts significantly longer (up to 255 days) than controls. The 2 CSA-treated full-thickness grafts and the 10 vehicle-treated controls showed clinical and microscopic signs of rejection at a mean of 6. 4 days. Histologic examination of successful grafts showed areas of viable epidermis with a negligible inflammatory infiltrate. There was some loss of normal polarity and occasional apoptotic pigmented basal cells. The dermis revealed moderate fibrosis, probably secondary to the surgical procedure. Graft viability was confirmed by autoradiography. Immunohistochemical staining for S- 100 protein revealed morphologic alteration of suprabasilar dendritic (Langerhans-indeterminate) cells, {{as well as their}} existence in xenografts at 12 weeks posttransplantation. Toxicities reflected by weight loss and blood chemistries were felt to be dose-dependent.

40|$|The humoral {{response}} to homograft valves in humans is largely unknown. The anti-human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) antibody production, specificity, and immunoglobulin class were examined sequentially in 73 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. In addition, the long-term production of antibodies was examined in a cross-sectional study of 160 patients at periods varying from 1 to 15 years postoperatively. Human lymphocyte antigen antibodies were produced in 17 of 30 antibioticsterilized homografts (56 %) and in 15 of 15 “homovital” homograft recipients, compared with 6 of the 28 control <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients</b> (21 %) (p < 0. 001). The HLA antibodies were immunoglobulin G in all 15 homovital homografts, in 11 of 17 antibiotic-sterilized homografts, and {{in four of}} the six xenograft cases. Human lymphocyte antigen specificities could be assigned to the antibodies in 21 cases. In 10 of 11 cases in which donor HLA typing data were available, the antibodies detected were directed against donor HLA class I antigens. Of six possible determinants of HLA antibody production, the type of homograft valve implanted (homovital or antibiotic sterilized) correlated with antibody formation. In the crosssectional study, 66 of the 85 homovital homograft recipients tested for HLA antibodies after 1 year were found to have antibodies, compared with 29 of 75 antibioticsterilized homograft recipients (p = 0. 00003). We conclude that homografts appear to stimulate a strong donor HLA-specific antibody response, particularly of the immunoglobulin G class. This is most common in homovital valve recipients. These antibodies can persist for 15 years after operation. The clinical significance of this response requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Xenotransplantation of porcine organs {{carries the}} risk of {{reactivation}} of latent virus in donor and recipient tissues as well as transmission of viruses between species. We have investigated the activation of baboon cytomegalovirus (BCMV) and porcine CMV (PCMV) in a pig-to-primate model of xenotransplantation. Tissues originating {{from a series of}} six swine-to-baboon composite thymokidney xenotransplants were investigated. Four immunosuppressed baboons died (survival range, 7 to 27 days) with the graft in situ. Increases in BCMV DNA copy numbers occurred in three (75 %) of these baboons and was thought to be responsible for pneumonitis and the death of one animal. In two baboons, disseminated intravascular coagulation was successfully treated by graftectomy and discontinuation of immunosuppression. PCMV was upregulated in five of six xenografts (83 %). PCMV infection was associated with ureteric necrosis in one xenograft. Although significantly increased in native tissues, low levels of BCMV and PCMV were also detected in tissues other than that of the native viral host species. The cross-species presence of CMV did not appear to cause clinical or histological signs of invasive disease. Thus, viral infections with clinical disease were restricted to tissues of the native species of each virus. Intensive immune suppression currently required for xenotransplantation results in a significant risk of reactivation of latent infections by BCMV and PCMV. It is not yet known whether viral DNA detected across species lines represents cellular microchimerism, ongoing viral infection, or uptake of free virus. The observation of graft injury by PCMV demonstrates that CMV will be an important pathogen in immunosuppressed <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients.</b> Strategies must be developed to exclude CMV from porcine organ donors...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{the best}} results in life-supporting pig-to-primate renal {{xenotransplantation}} have been obtained in recipients exposed to long-term immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide. As this agent is frequently associated with side-effects, we have explored the potential of a mycophenolate sodium-based maintenance immunosuppression in this model. Human decay-accelerating factor (hDAF) transgenic kidneys were transplanted into splenectomized and bilaterally nephrectomized cynomolgus monkeys immunosuppressed with mycophenolate sodium, cyclosporin A and steroids, and exposed to a brief induction course with cyclophosphamide (up to four doses). After transplantation, the primates were monitored daily for biochemical and haematological evaluations and for the measurements of haemolytic anti-pig antibodies (APA). A detailed histological analysis of each explanted graft was also performed. All the animals showed very poor initial graft function but survived for up to 51 days. In contrast to our previous studies in <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients</b> on long-term immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide, minimal or no circulating xeno-directed antibodies, {{as measured by the}} evaluation of APA titres, were detected in this series although some degree of acute humoral rejection was observed in all the explanted grafts and was the primary cause of graft failure. Furthermore, in addition to areas of humorally mediated graft damage, we have observed for the first time areas with exclusive and prominent infiltration by CD 2 + and CD 8 + mononuclear cells presenting patterns compatible with tubulitis, glomerulitis and arteritis, which we have called acute cellular xenograft rejection (ACXR). In addition, CD 68 + infiltrating macrophages and CD 20 + B-cells were also present. This study demonstrates that a triple maintenance immunosuppression with mycophenolate sodium, cyclosporin A and steroids is a viable alternative to a cyclophosphamide-based immunosuppression to obtain prolonged survival of porcine organs transplanted into primates. However, a more stringent control of antibody forming cells remains essential to further extend the survival of xenografts in this model. In addition, the use of the immunosuppressive regimen reported here in the primate is associated with the occurrence of a new category of cell-mediated xenograft injury (ACXR) whose significance has yet to be clarified...|$|R

The main goal of the present thesis was to evaluate whether tolerogenic DC could be used as cell-based therapy to protect xenografts. We demonstrated that human monocyte-derived DC, generated in the presence of rapamycin (Rapa-DC) or IL- 10 (IL- 10 -DC), could modulate human anti-pig NK cell and CTL responses in vitro. Finally, we investigated the potential of autologous bone marrow-derived DC, differentiated in the presence of IL- 10, to prevent xenograft rejection in a rat-to-mouse islets xenotransplantation model. When co-transplanted with rat islets under the kidney capsule, IL- 10 -DC significantly prolonged islets <b>xenograft</b> survival. <b>Recipients</b> of IL- 10 -DC demonstrated higher infiltration of CD 4 + FoxP 3 + T-cells in islets xenograft...|$|R
40|$|Developmentally {{competent}} oocytes can {{be collected}} from xenografted ovarian tissues; however, optimal xenograft conditions {{need to be}} established for this technique to be of use in assisted reproduction. In the present study, common wombat ovarian tissue was xenografted under the kidney capsule of nude mice to clarify the role of recipient gonadal status and donor tissue age on graft establishment, follicle development and oocyte recovery. Eighty-nine per cent of all grafts were recovered; of these, 78 % contained growing follicles. In female graft recipients, follicle development to the antral stage occurred earlier in ovariectomised recipients compared with intact graft recipients. Similarly, follicle development occurred earlier in recipients of pouch young ovarian tissue grafts when compared with subadult xenografts. Follicle development proceeded to the antral stage in subadult grafts placed under the kidney capsule of male recipient mice, albeit at a slower rate than subadult grafts placed in female recipients. Oocytes were collected from grafts placed in female and male recipients, but no mature oocytes were observed {{at the time of}} collection, nor could these oocytes be matured in vitro. The present study demonstrated that common wombat pouch young tissue <b>xenografted</b> to female <b>recipient</b> mice, and subadult ovarian tissue <b>xenografted</b> to male <b>recipient</b> mice, can develop to the antral stage and can therefore facilitate oocyte collection.

40|$|Xenotransplantation of porcine cells, {{tissues and}} organs may offer a {{solution}} to the severe shortage of suitable allografts. In addition to overcoming immunological rejection and problems with the physiological functionality of the xenograft, a basic requirement for xenotransplantation is to ensure microbiological safety. Porcine endogenous retroviruses that belong to the family of ?-retroviruses of which many members are able to induce leukemias and immunodeficiencies are of particular importance. They are an integrated part of the porcine genome and cannot be eliminated by selective breeding under SPF conditions, as is the case for most other pathogens. Eliminating these viruses may prove difficult {{due to the fact that}} over 50 PERV copies are integrated into the porcine genome at different loci. Although PERVs are able to infect human cells in vitro, PERV transmission has not been observed during infectivity studies or following the first experimental xenotransplantations. However, given the special situation during xenotransplantation, i. e. the presence of porcine cells and organs within an immunosuppressed host over a period of several years, the risk of a PERV transmission cannot be excluded. Against this background, the aim of this dissertation was to contribute to the evaluation of safety as well as to the prevention of virus transmission during xenotransplantation. The demonstration of variable PERV expression in different breeds of pig, in litters of the same race and even in different tissues of individual animals, indicates that selection of pigs with a low and stable level of PERV expression may prove difficult. Additional strategies for preventing PERV transmission were therefore developed. Based on the mechanism of RNA interference, shRNA transgenic pigs demonstrating a drastically (95 %) reduction of PERV expression were generated. Such animals could provide a source of virologically safe xenografts in the future. In addition, as part of this work, vaccine strategies to prevent PERV transmission were addressed. Antibodies able to fully neutralize both PERV and the phylogenetically related koala retrovirus (KoRV) in vitro were induced in two species using an immunogen based of the viral envelope protein. After resolving the negative consequences on xenograft acceptance that potentially might occur, such a vaccine could be used to pre-vaccinate <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients.</b> Finally, this work provides the first evidence of elevated PERV expression in porcine melanomas, again demonstrating the importance of developing appropriate measures to prevent PERV transmission to humans...|$|R

Fifty-four pigs {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups. Seventeen pigs in group 1 served as uninoculated controls, 18 pigs in group 2 were intravenously inoculated with the swine HEV recovered from a pig in the United States, and 19 pigs in group 3 were intravenously inoculated with the US- 2 strain of human HEV recovered from a hepatitis patient in the United States. Two to four pigs from each group were necropsied at 3, 7, 14, 20, 27, or 55 days postinoculation (DPI). Evidence of clinical disease or elevation of liver enzymes or bilirubin was not found in pigs from any of the three groups. Enlarged hepatic and mesenteric lymph nodes were observed in both HEV-inoculated groups. Multifocal lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis was observed in 9 of 17, 15 of 18, and 16 of 19 pigs in groups 1 to 3, respectively. Focal hepatocellular necrosis was observed in 5 of 17, 10 of 18, and 13 of 19 pigs in groups 1 to 3, respectively. Hepatitis lesions were very mild in group 1 pigs, mild to moderate in group 2 pigs, and moderate to severe in group 3 pigs. Hepatic inflammation and hepatocellular necrosis peaked in severity at 20 DPI and were still moderately severe at 55 DPI in the group inoculated with human HEV. Hepatitis lesions were absent or nearly resolved by 55 DPI in the swine-HEV-inoculated pigs. All HEV-inoculated pigs seroconverted to anti-HEV immunoglobulin G. HEV RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR in feces, liver tissue, and bile of pigs in both HEV-inoculated groups from 3 to 27 DPI. Based on evaluation of microscopic lesions, the US- 2 strain of human HEV induced more severe and persistent hepatic lesions in pigs than did swine HEV. Pig livers or cells from the livers of HEV-infected pigs may represent a risk for transmission of HEV from pigs to human <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients.</b> Since HEV was shed in the feces of infected pigs, exposure to feces from infected pigs represents a risk for transmission of HEV, and pigs should be considered a reservoir for HEV...|$|R

Mitral value replacement was performed in 17, aortic valve replacement in 54, and mitral-aortic valve replacement in 13. Operative survivors were reevaluated from July to September 1985. Cumulative duration of follow-up is 167 patient-years (range 0. 5 to 4. 1 years), and follow-up is 99 % complete. The overall late mortality (at 4 years) is 3. 6 % +/- 1. 4 % per patient year, and the actuarial survival rate is 95. 4 % +/- 3 % for aortic valve replacement, 74. 7 % +/- 16. 5 % for mitral valve replacement, and 67. 1 % +/- 20. 7 % for mitral-aortic valve replacement. One patient sustained a thromboembolic event after mitral valve replacement, but no such complications occurred after aortic or mitral-aortic valve replacement. Actuarial freedom from embolism at 4 years is 100 % for aortic and mitral-aortic valve replacement and 93. 3 % +/- 6. 4 % for mitral valve replacement. Reoperation for Hancock pericardial xenograft dysfunction was performed in seven patients (five aortic and two mitral-aortic). In the aortic valve replacement group the causes were endocarditis in one, paravalvular leak in one, and primary tissue failure in three; all survived reoperation. The two patients with mitral-aortic valve replacement required reoperation because of primary tissue failure of both Hancock pericardial xenografts, and one died. All values explanted because of primary tissue failure showed commissural tears causing severe prosthetic regurgitation. Calcium deposits were severe in one and mild but unrelated to the cusp rupture in another. Collagen disarray was seen only {{at the site of}} the tears, whereas the collagen structure was well preserved in the intact parts of the cusps. Four patients with aortic valve replacement and one with mitral valve replacement show evidence of Hancock pericardial xenograft failure and are awaiting reoperation. The actuarial freedom from primary tissue failure at 4 years is 74. 3 % +/- 9. 8 % for aortic and 78. 9 % +/- 13. 2 % for mitral Hancock pericardial xenografts. At medium-term follow-up, the Hancock pericardial xenograft has shown poor durability and an extremely high rate of early mechanical failure, especially in the aortic position. These observations suggest the need for a close follow-up of Hancock pericardial <b>xenograft</b> <b>recipients</b> and possibly elective reoperation in asymptomatic patients with clinical evidence of prosthetic failure. These results have led us to discontinue the clinical use of this pericardial xenograft...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTransplantation of porcine <b>xenografts</b> {{into human}} <b>recipients</b> is a {{realistic}} option {{to overcome the}} growing worldwide shortage of suitable allogeneic organs. However, there remains the risk of infection by porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) that cannot be eliminated like that by other microorganisms by breeding pigs under specified pathogen-free conditions. To reduce the release of PERVs by porcine transplants, a new approach, RNA interference (RNAi), was applied. Here, we show significant reduction of PERV expression by synthetic short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) corresponding to {{different parts of the}} viral genes gag, pol, and env. The most inhibitory sequences were selected and expressed as short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) by a polymerase III vector system leading to persistent suppression of PERV replication. Cells or organs from transgenic pigs producing such shRNAs should increase the safety of xenotransplantation...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As {{clinical}} trials are in progress involving porcine islet cell transplantation, microbial safety remains a key issue. Therefore, {{in the context}} of pig-to-human xenotransplantation, we provide an overview of the recent progress in the studies of relevant viruses including well known problematic viruses, such as herpesviruses and porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) in addition to some emerging issues regarding other pathogens. RECENT FINDINGS: The ability of herpesvirus to infect across species barriers is probably underestimated and requires monitoring and control of both <b>xenograft</b> donors and <b>recipients</b> for latent infection. Exclusion from donors and recipient monitoring for other exogenous pathogens including newly identified Parvovirus- 4 are warranted. The availability of the swine whole genome sequence may help to characterize and select donor animals with less PERV infectivity. Rigorous PERV monitoring in both clinical and preclinical xenotransplantation experiments must be included in clinical protocols. SUMMARY: A wide range of pathogens, both viruses and bacteria, pose potential safety problems in xenotransplantation, highlighting the importance of prescreening of the donor animals, and careful monitoring and follow-up of the patients...|$|R
40|$|Porcine {{endogenous}} retrovirus (PERV), porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV), and porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus (PLHV) are common porcine viruses {{that may be}} activated with immunosuppression for xenotransplantation. Studies of viral replication or transmission are possible due to prolonged survival of <b>xenografts</b> in baboon <b>recipients</b> from human decay-accelerating factor transgenic or α- 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase gene knockout miniature swine. Ten baboons underwent xenotransplantation with transgenic pig organs. Graft survival was 32 to 179 days. Recipient serial samples of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) and plasma were analyzed for PCMV, PERV, and PLHV- 1 nucleic acids and viral replication using quantitative PCR assays. The PBMC contained PERV proviral DNA in 10 animals, PLHV- 1 DNA in 6, and PCMV in 2. PERV RNA was not detected in any PBMC or serum samples. Plasma PLHV- 1 DNA was detected in one animal. Pig cell microchimerism (pig major histocompatibility complex class I and pig mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II sequences) was present in all recipients with detectable PERV or PLHV- 1 (85. 5 %). Productive infection of PERV or PLHV- 1 could not be demonstrated. The PLHV- 1 viral load did not increase in serum over time, despite prolonged graft survival and pig cell microchimerism. There was no association of viral loads with the nature of exogenous immune suppression. In conclusion, PERV provirus and PLHV- 1 DNA were detected in baboons following porcine xenotransplantation. Viral detection appeared to be due to persistent pig cell microchimerism. There was no evidence of productive infection in recipient baboons for up to 6 months of xenograft function...|$|R
40|$|SummaryA novel {{paradigm}} in tumor biology suggests that cancer growth {{is driven by}} stem-like cells within a tumor, called tumor-initiating cells (TICs) or cancer stem cells (CSCs). Here we describe the identification and characterization of such cells from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using the marker CD 133. CD 133 accounts for approximately 1. 3 %– 13. 6 % of the cells in the bulk tumor of human primary HCC samples. When compared with their CD 133 − counterparts, CD 133 + cells not only possess the preferential ability to form undifferentiated tumor spheroids in vitro but also express an enhanced level of stem cell-associated genes, have a greater ability to form tumors when implanted orthotopically in immunodeficient mice, and can be serially passaged into secondary animal <b>recipients.</b> <b>Xenografts</b> resemble the original human tumor and maintain a similar percentage of tumorigenic CD 133 + cells. Quantitative PCR analysis of 41 separate HCC tissue specimens with follow-up data found that CD 133 + tumor cells were frequently detected at low quantities in HCC, and their presence was also associated with worse overall survival and higher recurrence rates. Subsequent differential microRNA expression profiling of CD 133 + and CD 133 − cells from human HCC clinical specimens and cell lines identified an overexpression of miR- 130 b in CD 133 + TICs. Functional studies on miR- 130 b lentiviral-transduced CD 133 − cells demonstrated superior resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, enhanced tumorigenicity in vivo, and a greater potential for self renewal. Conversely, antagonizing miR- 130 b in CD 133 + TICs yielded an opposing effect. The increased miR- 130 b paralleled the reduced TP 53 INP 1, a known miR- 130 b target.

40|$|Liver {{xenotransplantation}} {{could eliminate}} the liver donor shortage, but currently {{it is not}} possible {{because of a lack of}} understanding of liver xenograft rejection. Hyperacute xenograft rejection is initiated by the binding of preformed naturally occurring xenoreactive antibodies (XNA) to the xenograft endothelium. The XNA bind to the xenograft endothelium, leading to complement-mediated endothelial injury. Liver xenotransplantation will be initially offered to patients with severe liver failure as a bridge to a human liver transplantation. The hypothesis tested in this thesis is that hyperacute rejection of liver <b>xenografts</b> placed into <b>recipients</b> with liver failure will be diminished because of the complement deficiency that accompanies liver failure. The experiments described in this thesis detail the development of an in vitro pig-to-human liver xenotransplant model incubating cultured pig hepatic endothelial cells (PHEC) and human serum in culture. We showed that either classical or alternative complement pathways could initiate endothelial injury. Next we developed the dog-to-pig liver xenograft model and characterized the lethal coagulopathy that results from hyperacute rejection. The coagulopathy results from the lack of function of platelets as well as their disappearance from the circulation. We then used the galactosamine induced liver injury model in porcine recipients of canine liver xenografts to demonstrate that hyperacute rejection in the setting of liver failure is diminished. We showed that; tissue injury, coagulopathy and platelet defect, and endothelial injury were diminished. Our experiments suggested that the cause of the decreased injury was the lack of complement in the pigs with galactosamine induced liver injury since the XNA levels were no different than in control animals. Our final experiments evaluated serum from patients with liver failure and compared the injury caused by incubation with PHEC. Serum from the liver failure patients had similar levels of XNA when compared with normal subjects, but had less complement activity, and less C 3 and C 4. Incubation of liver failure serum with PHEC caused much less injury and complement activation than serum from control subjects. The results in this thesis suggest that liver failure will have a significant impact on liver xenograft rejection, helping to diminish hyperacu...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate and expand the use of testis tissue xenografting as means of maintaining the developmental potential of donor testis tissue. The {{objective of}} the first {{study was to investigate}} the effect of donor age on spermatogenesis in canine testis tissue after <b>xenografting</b> into immunodeficient <b>recipient</b> mice. Fragments of testis tissue from 12 dogs of different ages were xenografted under the back skin of mice. Donors were categorized based on testis developmental status at the time of grafting into: less than four months (immature), four to six months (young), and greater than six months of age (adult). The grafts were evaluated at four, six or eight months post-grafting. At four months post-grafting, immature and young groups had higher graft recovery rates (92 ± 5. 8 and 88 ± 4. 4 % versus 69 ± 3. 5 %; P = 0. 001 and P = 0. 001), graft weights (34 ± 8. 1 and 32 ± 11. 0 mg versus 7 ± 2. 6 mg; P = 0. 001 and P = 0. 02), vesicular gland indices (1. 1 ± 0. 20 and 0. 6 ± 0. 18 % versus 0. 1 ± 0. 03 %; P 0. 05). Young donor xenografts had greater seminiferous tubule number and diameter compared to adult donor xenografts (P = 0. 009 and P = 0. 004, respectively) at eight months post-grafting. Elongated spermatids were the most advanced germ cell type present at four and eight months post-grafting in the testis grafts of immature and young age groups. The objective of the second study was to evaluate three different strategies to preserve/cryopreserve immature porcine testis tissue. Immature porcine testes were cooled at 4 °C for 24, 48 or 72 hours, and testis tissue fragments were cryopreserved using programmed slow freezing with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol, or ethylene glycol, or vitrified using DMSO or glycerol at 5, 15 or 30 min exposure time. In vitro cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and in vivo developmental potential was evaluated by xenografting into immunodeficient mice. Compared to fresh tissue, short-term cooling of porcine testis tissue resulted in similar in vitro cell survival rates (93 ± 2. 2 % for fresh versus 95 ± 0. 3, 93 ± 1. 7 and 87 ± 4. 3 % after 24, 48 and 72 hours at 4 °C, respectively; P = 0. 74) and in vivo development, with generation of elongated spermatids and sperm after four months of grafting. Cryopreservation of testis tissue with programmed slow freezing using glycerol and vitrification with DMSO (5 min equilibration) or glycerol (5 or 15 min equilibration) did not compromise the developmental competence of xenografts when compared to fresh tissue (control), characterized by the formation of elongated spermatids and sperm. These findings suggest that canine testis tissue from immature donors and cooling of immature porcine testis tissue to refrigerator temperature for up to 72 hours or cryopreservation with slow controlled freezing or vitrification could be suitable methods to restore male fertility following xenografting...|$|R
