50|$|In 1997, Montague {{received}} {{a grant from}} DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency {{to work with the}} United States Marine Corps in developing the Tactical Electric No Signature (TENS) Mountain bike. The project {{led to the development of}} a new folding bike design that allowed faster folding for Paratrooper exit from military aircraft with the bike. This gave rise to the Paratrooper, Montague's non-electric Military Mountain Bike. The design was later dubbed the <b>X-Frame.</b> In 1999, folding bikes using the <b>X-Frame</b> design were first made available to the civilian population under the Montague name. In 2002, development and marketing of an upscale <b>X-Frame</b> folding mountain bike began in conjunction with General Motors' Hummer product line. Promotional distribution of Montague designed Hummer bicycles took place through GM dealerships.|$|E

50|$|They {{applied the}} full extent of this {{philosophy}} to the Wing Series guitars, which used A-frame bracing instead of the more traditional <b>X-frame</b> bracing of conventional acoustics. Tacoma used a modification of the traditional <b>X-frame</b> bracing on their models with conventional sound holes. They placed two cross-braces {{on the outside of the}} X, which they said improves sound hole stability and rigidity, while leaving the edges more flexible and resonant. Tacoma contoured braces so they were thinner but wider near the edges of the top, and thicker but narrower near the center of the top.|$|E
50|$|Pont Briwet {{stood on}} 21 piers; each pier {{comprised}} {{four or five}} timber piles that were braced with iron <b>X-framed</b> supports. These created a series of frames on which longitudinal beams carried the road and railway; beams under the rail tracks were substantially larger than those under the roadway. Although the bridge was decked with timber planks, the road carriageway was waterproofed with a metalled surface. Iron was used for bolts and bracing bars.|$|R
5000|$|In 1959, a Mexican-American customizer named Ron Aguirre {{developed}} {{a way of}} bypassing the law {{with the use of}} hydraulic Pesco pumps and valves that allowed him to change ride height at the flick of a switch. The following year saw the emergence of the Chevrolet Impala, which featured an X-shaped frame that was perfectly suited for lowering and modification with hydraulics. Between 1960 and 1975, customizers adapted and refined GM <b>X-frames,</b> hydraulics, and airbrushing techniques to create the modern lowrider style.|$|R

50|$|In 1958, the Delray {{became a}} {{distinct}} series of its own, taking {{the place of}} the 150. The Delray was Chevrolet's price-leading, no-frills model, with the more expensive models being the Biscayne, Bel Air and Impala (the last being a sub-model of the Bel Air for 1958). It now had GM's <b>X-frame.</b> It came in a utility coupe, a two-door coupe, a four-door sedan. The Delray's 1958 only four-door or two-door station wagon counterpart was the Chevrolet Yeoman.|$|E

50|$|Some {{items of}} {{campaign}} furniture are instantly recognizable as made to dismantle or fold. Brass caps to {{the tops of}} legs, hinges in unusual places, protruding bolts or <b>X-frame</b> legs all give clues to the functionality of the piece. However, some pieces were designed {{to be up to}} date and fashionable. In such cases, which often looked like ordinary domestic furniture, it is harder to see how it dismantles. Ross and Co. of Dublin were innovators of campaign furniture design and much of their work is obviously Victorian in period. It only becomes apparent that their balloon back chairs dismantle when they are turned upside down and two locking bolts can be seen.|$|E
50|$|In 1957 a tubular <b>X-frame</b> without {{side rails}} was adopted. This {{resulted}} in greater structural rigidity and provided for a lower body without {{a loss of}} usable space. Front end styling was marked by rubber bumper guard tips and dual circular lamps set into the lower bumper section. Side trim was revised and a dual taillight theme was used. Identifying the Series 75 were bright metal moldings, just forward of the rear wheel openings, highlighted by seven horizontal windsplits. At the upper end this fenderbreak trim joined a horizontal molding that ran along a conical flare extending towards both tailamps. The Series 75 came as a limousine or in a nine-passenger sedan configuration, both with auxiliary seats. Power was 300 to 325 hp (224 to 242 kW) for 1957.|$|E

Interiors were selected from leather, Moroccean, or cloth in different colors. Standard tire size was 9.00 in by 14 in. The 394 cuin L, the largest first generation Rocket V8, was used from 1959 until 1964.|$|E
5000|$|The 1934 Series 370D was restyled {{yet again}} {{but this time}} was mounted on a {{completely}} new chassis. The radiator grill slanted rearward with a central bar and five horizontal sections, the windshield sloped even more rearward, headlights were enclosed in new teardrop housings mounted on streamlined supports, the horns joined the radiator cap under the hood, the spare tire was concealed under a new beaver tail deck on most models and the whole car sat approximately 2 in lower. Significant mechanical advancements included dual <b>X-frame</b> chassis construction, [...] "Knee-Action" [...] front coil spring suspension that greatly reduced unsprung weight and Hotchkiss steering. The 1935 Series 370E saw {{the addition of the}} Fisher Turret Top on Fisher bodied cars and an increase in horsepower to 150. Sales over the two years combined totaled only 1098.|$|E
50|$|The 1960 Cadillacs had smoother, more {{restrained}} styling. General changes {{included a}} full-width grille, {{the elimination of}} pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint {{in the application of}} chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. DeVilles were distinguished by special script nameplates on the rear fenders. Four-window and six-window hardtop sedans were offered again. The former featured a one-piece wraparound backlight and flat-top roof, while the latter had a sloping rear window and roofline. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and a two-way power seats. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an <b>X-frame</b> construction. Interiors were done in Chadwick cloth or optional Cambray cloth and leather combinations.|$|E
5000|$|The Riviera was {{redesigned}} for the 1966 model year. It {{retained its}} cruciform <b>X-frame,</b> powertrain, and brakes, but it wore a longer, wider, more curvaceous body that modernized the [...] "sweepspear" [...] inspired beltline {{introduced in the}} previous generation. This generation shared its platform with the Oldsmobile Toronado, and, a year later, with the Cadillac Eldorado. A notable styling point was the absence of vent windows, a feature GM had introduced with a flourish in the 1930s. Headlamps remained concealed, but they now pivoted up above the grille when not in use. Unlike the Toronado and Eldorado, the Riviera retained a conventional rear wheel drive layout. It was now some 200 lb heavier, so acceleration with the unchanged 425 engine was slightly slower. The Gran Sport package remained available as an option. Rear seat belts and AM/FM radio were optional.|$|E
50|$|The 1500 cc four-cylinder Consul {{was first}} {{shown at the}} 1950 London Motor Show. It {{was the start of}} Ford of Britain's {{successful}} attack on the family saloon car market. With stablemate Zephyr, it was the first British Ford with modern unibody construction. The Zephyr Six replaced the larger-engined V-8 Pilot which had only been made in small numbers. The Consul was given the Ford code of EOTA. Most cars were four-door saloons with body design by George Walker of the parent United States Ford Motor Company, but a few estate cars were made by the coachbuilder Abbott. From 1953, a convertible conversion by Carbodies became available. Having lost most of its strength with its roof, the unibody was reinforced by welding in a large <b>X-frame</b> to the floor pan. Unlike the more expensive Zephyr, the hood (convertible top) had to be put up and down manually.|$|E
