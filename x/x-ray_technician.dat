In this study, a group of 40 apparently healthy male <b>x-ray</b> <b>technicians</b> with age ranging from 25 - 50 -years were recruited. They were matched with another group of 40 apparently healthy control subjects in terms of age, sex and ethnic origin. Both groups met with exclusion criteria as per standard. Red blood cells, WBC and platelets count were performed by using a blood cell auto analyser (Beckman coulter counter). Results: The mean value of platelet count was significantly decreased (p< 0. 01) in <b>x-ray</b> <b>technicians</b> when compared to controls. However, no significant difference was observed in RBC and WBC count between the groups. Conclusion: The present study suggests that exposure to x-ray radiation causes decreased platelet count. Further, studies are needed to study the long-term effects of x-ray radiation on blood cell count in <b>x-ray</b> <b>technicians...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1964, the {{association}} {{changed its name}} from the American Society of <b>X-Ray</b> <b>Technicians</b> to the American Society of Radiologic Technologists. The change was spurred because {{more and more of the}} society’s members were nuclear medicine technologists and radiation therapists, so the term “x-ray technician” no longer accurately reflected the membership. In addition, members believed the shift from “technician” to “technologist” placed a stronger emphasis on professionalism and education.

40|$|Despite {{the search}} for {{effective}} and less toxic substitutes, glutaraldehyde (GA) {{remains one of the}} few substances capable of high-level instrument disinfection in modern health care. Workers commonly affected include operating room nurses, radiographers, <b>x-ray</b> <b>technicians</b> and cleaners. Widespread hospital usage combined with its well-known irritant properties, has ensured an increase in occupationally-related illnesses during recent years. Operating room nurses, laboratory workers and <b>x-ray</b> <b>technicians</b> frequently contact GA in both the liquid and vapor form. Workplace exposure is usually dependent on job tasks, ventilation levels and the use of protective equipment. GA is a relatively potent irritant and sensitizer, with a well-documented history of symptoms following occupational exposure. Although mechanisms for GA toxicity have been postulated, research on the toxicological, teratogenic, and carcinogenic potential of this chemical has shown inconsistent results. Reducing workplace exposure to its lowest possible level represents the most important hazard reduction strategy. This may be achieved by keeping GA containers tightly sealed when not in use, maintaining adequate ventilation levels and the rigid adherence to appropriate personal protective equipment. Substitution with automated cold sterilization machines may be another appropriate measure, while banning unnecessary practices such as GA fogging and its use as a surface disinfectant may also be helpful in reducing occupational exposure in the health care environment...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nurses tend to {{wash their}} hands more often than physicians, and among nonhealth care workers, women tend {{to wash their}} hands more often than men. This study {{examined}} the influence of gender on the handwashing rates of health care workers (HCWs). The null hypotheses were {{that there would be}} no intergender difference in (a) handwashing rates in HCWs across professions and (b) within professional groups. Methods: Handwashing by nurses, physicians, wardspersons, <b>x-ray</b> <b>technicians,</b> and physiotherapists after patient contact in a critical care unit (CCU) was determined through covert observation. The gender and profession of the subjects were recorded, but their identity was not. Results: Female CCU staff washed their hands significantly more often than did their male counterparts after patient contact (P =. 0001). When the results were examined for the influence of profession on handwashing, significant intergender differences remained for physicians (P =. 0468) and wardspersons (P =. 0001). There was also a nonsignificant trend (P =. 07) toward higher rates of handwashing among female <b>x-ray</b> <b>technicians.</b> There were no statistically significant intergender differences in handwashing rates among nurses (P =. 7588) and physiotherapists. Conclusions: It appears that gender may influence handwashing rates in HCWs in the CCU, although this difference appears to be modified in particular professional groups. Further research should examine factors that modify handwashing tares within professional groups and in settings other than the CCU...|$|R
50|$|By 1932, {{when the}} {{association}} {{changed its name}} to the American Society of <b>X-Ray</b> <b>Technicians,</b> membership had reached nearly 400.
