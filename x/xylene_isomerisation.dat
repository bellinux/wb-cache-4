The first part of the thesis describes how a novel and facile powder processing approach, using pulsed current processing (PCP) or, as it is commonly called, spark plasma sintering (SPS), has been employed to produce mechanically stable, hierarchically porous bodies from different porous powders. Surfactant-templated mesoporous spheres were PCP-treated to yield meso/macro porous monoliths. The bimodal pore size can be tailored by choice of templating molecules in the aerosol-assisted synthesis process and by the particle size of the spheres. Diatomite powders were used to produce macro/macroporous monoliths. The densification behaviour of this inexpensive and renewable macroporous raw material was evaluated in detail, and an optimum temperature range was identified where the PCP process yields mechanically strong monoliths. Binder-less, hierarchically porous zeolite monoliths were produced from various zeolite powders, e. g. silicalite- 1, ZSM- 5 and zeolite Y. Line-broadening analysis of X-ray powder diffraction data by the Rietveld method and electron microscopy showed that the formation of strong interparticle bonds during the PCP process is associated with a local amorphization reaction that is induced by the high contact stress and temperature. <b>Xylene</b> <b>isomerisation</b> studies showed that binder-less ZSM- 5 monoliths display a high catalytic selectivity. Direct (in-situ) nanoparticle functionalization of surfactant templated mesoporous silica particles has also been demonstrated. Pre-synthesized TiO 2 nanoparticles were dispersed in a precursor solution, containing surfactant and silica source, and processed in an aerosol-generator to produce spherical nanoparticle-functionalized mesoporous particles. ...|$|E
