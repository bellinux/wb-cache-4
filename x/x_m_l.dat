40|$|ABSTRACT: Cultivars {{have to be}} {{evaluated}} under different crop management systems across agro-ecosystems and years using multi-environment trials (MET) before releasing them to the market. Frequently, data collected in METs are arranged according to cultivar (G), manage-ment (<b>M),</b> location, (<b>L)</b> and year (Y) combinations in a four-way G <b>x</b> <b>M</b> <b>x</b> <b>L</b> x Y data table that is highly unbalanced for cultivars across locations and time. Therefore, we present the restricted maximum likelihood method (REML) for linear mixed models (LMM) with a factor analytic var-iance-covariance matrix for assessing cultivar adaptation to crop management systems and environments based on unbalanced datasets. Such a multi-environmental trial system has been in operation in Poland for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{in the form of}} the Post-registration Variety Testing System (PVTS).

Combinations of leucine (0. 5 mM) with either alanine, glutamine, asparagine or proline (2 mM) inhibited proteolysis by 40 - 50 %. Under these conditions, both in the absence and presence of the transaminase inhibitor, aminooxyacetate, a correlation was found between the extent of inhibition of proteolysis and the sum of the total intracellular amounts of aspartate and glutamate.

The billets were extruded through die of 12 mm x 12 mm channel cross-section area, the channel angle was 60 °. Four vegetable based lubricants namely jatropha, neem, castor and cotton seed oils were used. The die was centrally located on the bed of vertical hydraulic testing machine and the billet was inserted into the entrance channel. Lubrication was applied to the billet to decrease its friction and with the channel inner wall. The ram displacement per plunger speed was 1 mm per 1 second respectively. For each lubricant, four samples were extruded through ECAE die to confirm the repeatability of the results and the average values of the extrusion pressure were computed. The results were compared to the sample extruded via conventional lubricants. It was discovered of all the extruded samples, jatropha oil gave the least extrusion pressure of 83 kN, cottonseed oil extruded at 104 kN and castor oil at 151. 4 kN while neem oil require the highest pressure at 220. 9 kN. The chemical based lubricants that serve as the control from the literature gave the extrusion pressure of 81 kN.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experimental}} study is {{the investigation of the}} natural convection of air in a differentially heated cavity, containing an obstacle at the ceiling (lintel). The cavity, 32 cm depth, with a <b>l</b> <b>m</b> <b>x</b> <b>l</b> <b>m</b> vertical cross-section, is heated on one vertical side, and cooled on the opposite wall. A lintel of 5 cm in width and 30 cm in height is fixed to the centre of the ceiling along the centre of the cavity. The temperature difference between the two vertical active walls is controlled at 15 °C in order to reach a weakly turbulent flow pattern characterised by a Rayleigh number nearly 1. 5 x 109. Inside the cavity, local and instantaneous air temperatures were measured with two thermocouples. Furthermore, the 2 D velocity fields in several vertical planes were obtained using a LDV- 2 D device. Laser tomography was also used to visualise specific behaviour of the flow, particularly {{in the vicinity of the}} corners. By analysing the thermal field, the bottom part of the cavity is not affected by the lintel. The stratification parameter is always 0. 37. However, in the top left quarter of the cavity, upstream of the lintel, the stratification is very large, whereas, downstream of the obstacle, it is weaker than without a lintel. Velocity profiles show that the mean flow closely follows the walls, including the lintel, without any apparent separation. This confirms a fundamental property of natural convection flows. Moreover, these velocity profiles highlight the presence of significant recirculating flows, located in the core of the cavity, especially at the bottom and also at the top, on each side of the lintel. These big structures induce 3 D secondary flows. They appear more intense in the case of a cavity provided with a lintel...|$|R

40|$|Backscatter radio - {{the broad}} class of systems that {{communicate}} using scattered electromagnetic waves - {{is the driving}} technology behind many compelling applications such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags and passive sensors. These systems {{can be used in}} many ways including article tracking, position location, passive temperature sensors, passive data storage, and in many other systems which require information exchange between an interrogator and a small, low-cost transponder with little-to-no transponder power consumption. Although backscatter radio is maturing, such systems have limited communication range and reliability caused, in part, by multipath fading. The research presented in this dissertation investigates how multipath fading can be reduced using multiple antennas at the interrogator transmitter, interrogator receiver, and on the transponder, or RF tag. First, two link budgets for backscatter radio are presented and fading effects demonstrated through a realistic, 915 MHz, RFID-portal example. Each term in the link budget is explained and used to illuminate the propagation and high-frequency effects that influence RF tag operation. Second, analytic envelope distributions for the <b>M</b> <b>x</b> <b>L</b> x N, dyadic backscatter channel - the general channel in which a backscatter system with <b>M</b> transmitter, <b>L</b> RF tag, and N receiver antennas operates - are derived. The distributions show that multipath fading can be reduced using multiple-antenna RF tags and by using separate transmitter and receiver antenna arrays at the interrogator. These results are verified by fading measurements of the <b>M</b> <b>x</b> <b>L</b> x N, dyadic backscatter channel at 5. 8 GHz - the center of the 5725 - 5850 MHz unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band that offers reduced antenna size, increased antenna gain, and, in some cases, reduced object attachment losses compared to the commonly used 902 - 928 MHz ISM band. Measurements were taken with a custom backscatter testbed and details of its design are provided. In the end, this dissertation presents both theory and measurements that demonstrate multipath fading reductions for backscatter-radio systems that use multiple antennas. Ph. D.

Downstream surge chambers of size 165 <b>m</b> (<b>L)</b> <b>x</b> 13 <b>m</b> (W) <b>x</b> 46 <b>m</b> (H) for Dri limb and 110 <b>m</b> (<b>L)</b> <b>x</b> 13 <b>m</b> (W) <b>x</b> 46 <b>m</b> (H) for Tangon limb are provided. The empirical methods include basic rock mass classification methods such as RQD, Q-system, RMR and GSI method based on the field investigation data and geological mapping records.. Rock support design also done suing Q-system. Engineering and mechanical properties of intact rock were recorded from the laboratory tests on rock core samples from drill holes. Rock mass strength and modulus values have been calculated using various empirical relations. The Hoek and Brown rock mass strength parameters were determined using Roclab program. The analytical methods include assessment of stress related problems by calculation of tangential stress using Kirsch&# 146;s analogy, Hoek and Brown practical method. Rock burst impact depth is calculated form Martin and Christiansson. The adequacy of width of rock pillar was verified using Brown and Brady&# 146;s tributary area theory {{and with the help of}} Martin and Maybee&# 146;s study on rock pillars. The numerical methods include Unwedge and Phase 2 programs. Unwedge is used to determine potential wedge failures and spot bolting design for stabilising the wedges. The Phase 2 program has been used to find the principal stress situation, displacemnts, strength factor, volumetric strain, yield zone and rock support design. The numerical modelling has been modelled for varying in-situ stress situations, varying rock mass quality, boundary conditions, and support types in modelling. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{performed}} a density functional theory (DFT) {{calculation of the}} amide proton NMR chemical shift in proteins using a recently developed automated fragmentation quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (AF-QM/MM) approach. Systematic investigation was carried out to examine the influence of explicit solvent molecules, cooperative hydrogen bonding effects, density functionals, size of the basis sets, and the local geometry of proteins on calculated chemical shifts. Our result demonstrates that the predicted amide proton (1 HN) NMR chemical shift in explicit solvent shows remarkable improvement over that calculated with the implicit solvation model. The cooperative hydrogen bonding effect is also shown to improve the accuracy of 1 HN chemical shifts. Furthermore, {{we found that the}} OPBE exchange-correlation functional is the best density functional for the prediction of protein 1 HN chemical shifts among a selective set of DFT methods (namely, B 3 LYP, B 3 PW 91, <b>M</b> 062 <b>X,</b> <b>M</b> 06 <b>L,</b> mPW 1 PW 91, OB 98, OPBE), and the locally dense basis set of 6 - 311 ++G**/ 4 - 31 G * is shown to be sufficient for 1 HN chemical shift calculation. By taking ensemble averaging into account, 1 HN chemical shifts calculated by the AF-QM/MM approach can be used to validate the performance of various force fields. Our study underscores that the electronic polarization of protein is of critical importance to stabilizing hydrogen bonding, and the AF-QM/MM method is able to describe the local chemical environment in proteins more accurately than most widely used empirical models. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{design study}} of a {{scintillation}} fiber (SF) calorimeter for a cosmic ray observation is made. An evaluation of various fibers and design configuration was made. The proposed design has a dimension of 1 <b>m</b> (W) <b>x</b> 1 <b>m</b> (<b>L)</b> <b>x</b> 16 cm (H) contains 1000 fibers at each of 40 x- or 40 y-layers interleaved with 1 mm thick leadplates. Two or four CCD Particle Track Imaging Systems are connected to a bundle of SF edges at x- and y-ends. The overall weight of a calorimeter is 1, 200 kg including read-out systems and supporting boards. The designed calorimeter can measure cosmic ray nuclei and gamma-rays with position, angles and energy information suitable for detailed spectrum analysis. The system is particularly beneficial at very high energies where the flux is extremely low and it requires a very long exposure over many years in space. Emulsion chambers have an advantage for cosmic ray measurements if the exposure is limited to several months in space. In fact, the most important energy region for the current cosmic ray studies is at around 1, 000 TeV where a drastic change of elemental composition is indicated by various indirect observations. A detector whose size is {{in the order of}} 1 m(sup 2) requires several years of exposure in space accumulate sufficient statistics near 1, 000 TeV. Emulsions will be strongly contaminated by background radiation for such a long duration flight, while SF calorimeter is totally immune from this concern. This is particularly important for long-duration experiments. The SF calorimeter also allows time-tagging of individual events, extending the experimental capability in various ways...|$|R
