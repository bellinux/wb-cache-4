The different functions are integrated in a complex programme system, flexibly to use, which in its nuclear part is not bound to a special reactor type.

This means, for {{the first}} nuclear heatup of each fuel element, that local bundle power must be ramped very slowly to prevent {{cracking}} of the fuel pellets and limit {{the differences in the}} rates of thermal expansion of the fuel. PCIOMR rules also limit the maximum local power change (in kW/ft*hr), prevent pulling control rods below the tips of adjacent control rods, and require control rod sequences to be analyzed against core modelling software to prevent pellet-clad interactions.

50|$|If {{sufficient}} reactivity {{control authority}} is available, the reactor can be restarted, but a <b>xenon</b> burn-out <b>transient</b> {{must be carefully}} managed. As the control rods are extracted and criticality is reached, neutron flux increases many orders of magnitude and the 135Xe begins to absorb neutrons and be transmuted to 136Xe.

The time constant for this burn-off transient depends on the reactor design, power level history of the reactor {{for the past several}} days (therefore the 135Xe and 135I concentrations present), and the new power setting.

As the control rods are extracted and criticality is reached, neutron flux increases many orders of magnitude and the 135Xe begins to absorb neutrons and be transmuted to 136Xe. The reactor burns off the nuclear poison. As this happens, the reactivity and neutron flux increases, and the control rods must be gradually reinserted to counter the loss of neutron absorption by the 135Xe. Otherwise, the reactor neutron flux will continue to increase, burning off even more xenon poison, on a path to runaway criticality. The time constant for this burn-off transient depends on the reactor design, power level history of the reactor {{for the past several}} days, and the new power setting. For a typical step up from 50% power to 100% power, 135Xe concentration falls for about 3 hours.|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} account of the reactor physics studies for the final conceptual design of the Advanced Test Reactor is presented. The diffusion theory methods used for calculations of flux distributions and reactivity effects are described and compared with measurements and with higher order approximations to transport theory. These comparisons show diffusion theory to be adequate for the ATR conceptual design. Two-dimensional flux distributions {{for a number of}} shim control conditions and experimental loadings were determined by PDQ- 3 and TRANSAC-PDQ. The worths and effects on flux distributions of chemical and of blade type mechanical shim controls were compared. The effects of heavy water and of beryllium reflectors on reactivity and flux pattern were calculated. The time-dependent behavior of the reactor was investigated by use of TURBO and CANDLE. The changes in shim control poison and test and core flux distributions with fuel burnup were calculated and the full-power cycle time estimated. An investigation was made of the <b>xenon</b> <b>transient</b> after a fullpower shutdown and recovery. Results of one- and twodimensional fuel depletion studies are compared. The results of a number of time independent one-dimensional calculations and parametric studies are presented. Some comparisons were made of the results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional models of the ATR. The void coefficient of reactivity was found for the core, reflector, experiment, and flux trap regions of the reactor. Calculations of the temperature coefficient for the entire reactor and for individual regions were determined for one- and two-dimensional models. Xenon instability was studied for oscillations around one lobe, between lobes, and along the vertical axis. TURBO and CANDLE calculations were used {{to determine the effects of}} pedurbations on the sxial stability. An analytic method for determining axial stability was derived and applied to a single lobe model of the ATR. A perturbation technique was used to find the effects of reflector type and poisoning on the average core neutron lifetime. Calculations of the approximate lifetime of the delayed group from the reflector were made for a number of reflector conditions. Plots and tables of the gamma heat distribution in the ATR as determined by an DBM- 704 program are presented. (auth...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc Engineering Sciences (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} representing few group, homogenised neutron cross sections {{as a function of}} state parameters (e. g. burn-up, fuel and moderator temperature, etc.) that describe the conditions in the reactor. The problem is multi-dimensional and the cross section samples, required for building the representation, are the result of expensive transport calculations. At the same time, practical applications require high accuracy. The representation method must therefore be efficient {{in terms of the number}} of samples needed for constructing the representation, storage requirements and cross section reconstruction time. Sparse grid methods are proposed for constructing such an efficient representation. Approximation through quasi-regression as well as polynomial interpolation, both based on sparse grids, were investigated. These methods have built-in error estimation capabilities and methods for optimising the representation, and scale well with the number of state parameters. An anisotropic sparse grid integrator based on Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature was implemented, verified and coupled to a pre-existing cross section representation system. Some ways to improve the integrator’s performance were also explored. The sparse grid methods were used to construct cross section representations for various Light Water Reactor fuel assemblies. These reactors have different operating conditions, enrichments and state parameters and therefore pose different challenges to a representation method. Additionally, an example where the cross sections have a different group structure, and were calculated using a different transport code, was used to test the representation method. The built-in error measures were tested on independent, uniformly distributed, quasi-random sample points. In all the cases studied, interpolation proved to be more accurate than approximation for the same number of samples. The primary source of error was found to be the <b>Xenon</b> <b>transient</b> at the beginning of an element’s life (BOL). To address this, the domain was split along the burn-up dimension into “start-up” and “operating” representations. As an alternative, the Xenon concentration was set to its equilibrium value for the whole burn-up range. The representations were also improved by applying anisotropic sampling. It was concluded that interpolation on a sparse grid shows promise as a method for building a cross section representation of sufficient accuracy to be used for practical reactor calculations with a reasonable number of samples.

40|$|Reactor design {{information}} obtained from 3 years' {{operation of a}} small pressurized-water reactor, the SM- 1 (formerly APPR-l), is presented and discussed. The SM- 1 reactor, designed to produce 10 Mw(t) power, employs fully enriched uranium fuel {{in the form of}} UO/sub 2 / dispersed in stainless-steel fuel plates. The reactor is cooled by water at 1200 psia and mean temperature of 44) deg F. Core-physics measurements were performed of temperature coefficient, pressure coefficient, rod calibration, stuck rod position, and <b>transient</b> <b>xenon</b> as a function of core burn-out. Core burn-out characteristics were compared with few- group calculations, and reasonable agreement was obtained. Thermal-heat-balance data were obtained on the reactor core. The temperature pattern in the nominal and hot channels under operating conditions was calculated. These calculations indicated that certain of the fuel channels operated in the nucleate boiling regime. Examination of one of the fuel channels suspected of nucleate boiling indicated no adverse effects. The system response to load perturbations and during pump coast-down was measured utilizing plant instrumentation. This response was compared with analytical predictions using a lumped kinetic model, and reasonable agreement was found. Both neutron and gamma traverses were made through the primary shield during reactor operation. Gamma traverses were also made through the primary shield as a function of time after reactor shutdown. Conventional shielding calculational methods are found to give agreement with experiment sufficient for design purposes. An absolute ionization chamber was employed to measure N/sup 16 / activity in the reactor coolant. These measurements were compared with N/sup 16 / calculated from the (n,p) reaction on O/ sup 16 /.
