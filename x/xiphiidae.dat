50|$|Protosphyraena is {{a fossil}} genus of swordfish-like marine fish, that throve {{worldwide}} during the Upper Cretaceous Period (Coniacian-Maastrichtian). Though fossil remains of this taxon {{have been found}} in both Europe and Asia, it is perhaps best known from the Smoky Hill Member of the Niobrara Chalk Formation of Kansas (Late Coniacian-Early Campanian). Protosphyraena was a large fish, averaging 2-3 metres in length. Protosphyraena shared the Cretaceous oceans with aquatic reptiles, such as mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, as well as with many other species of extinct predatory fish. The name Protosphyraena is a combination of the Greek word protos ("early") plus Sphyraena, the genus name for barracuda, as paleontologists initially mistook Protosphyraena for an ancestral barracuda. Recent research shows that the genus Protosphyraena is not at all related to the true swordfish-family <b>Xiphiidae,</b> but belongs to the extinct family Pachycormidae.|$|E

40|$|This review characterizes each of {{the five}} extinct and extant {{families}} of billfishes and discusses the relevant literature. Families include: Hemingwayidae (monotypic; late Paleocene, Turkmenistan), Blochiidae (1 genus, 2 species; middle Eocene, Italy), Palaeorhynchidae (4 genera, ca. 22 species; early Eocene-possibly early Miocene, Europe, Iran, Russia, U. S. A.), <b>Xiphiidae</b> that includes the subfamilies Xiphiorhynchinae (1 genus, 9 species; early Eocene-late Oligocene, Egypt, Europe, U. S. A.) and Xiphiinae (monotypic; middle Miocene-present, world-wide temperate- tropical seas), and the Istiophoridae (3 genera, 13 species; middle Miocene-present; world-wide temperate-tropical seas). Billfishes first appeared in the region of the ancient Tethys Sea (or Paratethys), except for the Xiphiinae that first appeared in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Fossil specimens of all five billfish families are usually considered to have had the same environmental preferences as extant billfishes, however, those with upper and lower jaws of equal length were probably less adapted for spearing than those with a disproportionately longer rostrum. Three genera, Aglyptorhynchus, Palaeorhynchus, and Xiphiorhynchus existed for approximately 27 million yrs (Ma) before extinction, whereas the four extant genera Istiophorus, Makaira, Tetrapturus, and Xiphias have been in existence ca. 11 Ma, 15 Ma, 5 Ma, and 15 Ma, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Billfishes (Istiophoridae and <b>Xiphiidae)</b> {{are notorious}} for driving their rostra into animate and inanimate objects, a {{behavior}} usually resulting in transverse fracture of the bill and leaving the distal segment embedded (Gudger, 1940; Frazier et aI., 1994). Some billfishes recover from this loss because there are records ofapparently healthy fish with missing rostra (Frazier et aI., 1994). Generally only one rostral fragment is found in each object, but multiple stabbings have been reported. For example, fragments of three swordfish bills were discovered in a whale during flensing (Jonsgard, 1962), several 2 ̆ 2 marlin 2 ̆ 2 spears were found impaled in bales of rubber that were floating at sea (Smith, 1956), and two istiophorid rostra were identified in the timber of a vessel that was brought in for repair (Gudger, 1940; Fierstine and Crimmen, 1996).

40|$|Abstract. —The {{vulnerability}} of the highly mobile tunas (family Scombridae) and billfishes (families Istiophoridae and <b>Xiphiidae)</b> to various fishing gears and detection by aerial surveys is influenced by their depth distributions, travel speeds, residency times, and aggregation. As a result, understanding {{the effects of the}} physical environment on fish behavior is critical for robust population assessments. Numerous studies have attempted to understand the movements and habitat requirements of tunas and billfishes by correlating catch statistics with environmental conditions averaged over time and space. Such correlations do not necessarily elucidate the requisite relationships because the data are not gathered simultaneously, and because error terms are often too broad to demonstrate meaningful relationships. More important, using catch statistics {{to determine the effects of}} environmental conditions on catch statistics can never prove causation and result in tautology, unless independent measures of fish abundance are available. The situation is not necessarily improved when catch statistics are correlated with satellite-derived sea surface temperature data. Tunas and billfish fish do not always live at the surface and, more importantly, regularly move through vertical thermal gradients (� 1 °C m – 1) that are orders of magnitude steeper than horizontal gradients (� 1 °C km – 1). Sea surface temperature gradients per se are, therefore, unlikely to influence horizontal movements or aggregation...|$|E
40|$|The Cocos (Keeling) Islands {{comprise}} the most isolated oceanic atoll {{in the tropical}} Indian Ocean and are situated 1000 km south-west of Indonesia. The remoteness of the islands has shaped the composition of marine communities but also limited scientific research. This study summarises field research on the marine fishes of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands over the last 14 years (2001 - 2014). Sixty-seven new records (from 28 families) are described and raise {{the total number of}} known fishes to 602 species from 84 families. New records span a variety of body sizes (3 cm TL Gobiodon unicolor to 500 cm TL Rhincodon typus), were observed in all major habitats, and found at both the Southern Atoll and at North Keeling Island. Notable new records include first records for the families Alopiidae, Coryphaenidae, Eleotridae, Gempylidae, Istiophoridae, Molidae, Polymixiidae, Rhincodontidae, Sillaginidae and <b>Xiphiidae.</b> Sampling from pelagic and deepwater (60 - 300 m) reef environments significantly increased the number of species described from these habitats. New records include species that have dispersed more than 2500 km (Centropyge acanthops) and dispersal ability appears to explain the lack of syngnathids and the high representation of acanthurids and holocentrids in the community. Some of the Indian Ocean species that have colonised the Cocos (Keeling) Islands now co-occur with their Pacific Ocean sister species, increasing the potential for hybridisation.

40|$|Using a {{combination}} of diverse large predatory fishes and one seabird, we collected information on the cephalopod fauna of the western Indian Ocean. We analyzed the stomach contents of 35 fishes representing ten families (<b>Xiphiidae,</b> Istiophoridae, Scombridae, Carangidae, Coryphaenidae, Alepisauridae, Dasyatidae, Carcharhinidae, Alopiidae and Sphyrnidae) and of the sooty tern Onychoprion fuscata of the Mozambique Channel from 2000 to 2010. Both fresh and accumulated beaks were used for identifying cephalopod prey. Cephalopods were important prey for twelve predators; swordfish Xiphias gladius had the highest cephalopod proportion; sooty tern (O. fuscata) and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) had high proportions too. We recovered 23 cephalopod families and identified 38 species. Ten species from four Teuthida families (Ommastrephidae, Onychoteuthidae, Histioteuthidae and Ancistrocheiridae) and two Octopoda families (Argonautidae and Bolitaenidae) occurred very frequently in the stomach contents, while Sepiida were rare. Ommastrephidae were the most cephalopod food sources: the purpleback flying squid Sthenoteu this oualaniensis was the most prevalent prey by far, Ornithoteuthis volatilis was important for eleven predators and few but large specimens of the neon flying squid Ommastrephes bartramii were recovered in the stomachs of swordfish in the Indian South Subtropical Gyre province only. Predators' groups were identified based on cephalopod prey composition, on depth in which they forage, and on prey size. Surface predators' diets were characterized by lower cephalopod diversity but greater average numbers of cephalopod prey, whereas the deep-dwelling predators (swordfish and bigeye tuna) preyed on larger specimens than surface predators (O. fuscata or yellowfin tunas Thunnus albacares).

40|$|Seven {{species of}} the family Istiophoridae and Xiphias gladiu 6 were {{identified}} using only features of their rostrum. In the Istiophoridae, two rostral regions were emphasized, one-fourth and one·half {{the distance between the}} distal tip and the orbital margin of the lateral ethmoid bone. Characters studied in each region were the depth and width of rostrum and height, width, and position of nutrient canals (as seen in cross-section). Characters studied without reference to region were the distribution of denticles on both dorsal and ventral surfaces of the bilI and position of the prenasal bone. In the <b>Xiphiidae,</b> the only characters studied were the depth and width of the rostrum {{at the level of the}} dermethmoid bone and the presence and placement of central chambers as seen in radiographs. A total of 32 characters were analyzed as ratios using both multivariate and univariate statistics. The rostrum of X. gladius was separated from the Istiophoridae by its flat shape, Tetrapturus angwtirostris from all other istiophorids by its widely separated nutrient canals, and the complex of T. audax/T. pfluegeri/Makaira nigricans/M. indica from the complex of lstiophorus platypterus/T. albidus by having a smaller area of denticles on the dorsal surface. Tetrapturus pfluegeri was separated from T. audux, M. nigricans, and M. indica by having a longer denticle-free midline on the ventral surface of the rostrum. Tetrapturus audux was separated from M. nigricans and M. indica by the location of its nutrient canals. The complexes of Makaira nigricand/M. indica and I. platypterus/T. albidus were each separated using multivariate discriminant analysis.

40|$|Chiefly {{arising from}} their {{sporting}} potentialities in big game angling, the large “Bill-fishes”, or Marlin, and Sword-fishes have attracted considerable attention in recent times. Commercial fishermen of Japan and anglers of the United States {{have been most}} ardent {{in the pursuit of}} these peculiar creatures. While a good deal has been learnt about them, there still remains much to discover. In the case of the Marlins, for example, hardly anything is known of their reproduction, of the larval or postlarval early forms, and even those who have studied these fishes from ample material over a wide area are as yet uncertain of the absolute identity of the species, and are often unable to identify with any certainty the rare occasional reasonably small specimens that are encountered. In South Africa shore angling is so good throughout virtually the entire year that there has been little incentive to explore the possibilities further out, especially as quiet seas are a rare condition. Quite recently, however, big game angling at sea has developed almost explosively and increasingly large fishes are being captured. During our extensive travels in the tropical Western Indian Ocean it became obvious that great numbers of the larger angling fishes were present, including those treated here. Although that area is windy and storm-lashed for much of the year, remote from facilities, and barren, its potentialities are relatively unexplored, but are clearly so great that it will not be long before it becomes recognised as one of the chief big game angling areas of the world. These fishes are at present placed in the families <b>Xiphiidae</b> and Istiophoridae.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes gill specializations {{related to}} fast, continuous swimming in tunas, bonitos, and mackerels (family Scombridae), the billfishes (Istiophoridae, <b>Xiphiidae)</b> and the shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus (Lamnidae). These fishes all require gill adaptations for increased gas exchange to meet relatively high aerobic demands and for added rigidity {{to withstand the}} forceful branchial flow produced by ram ventilation. Preliminary research for this dissertation, included as an appendix chapter and published as Wegner et al. (2006), examined gill specializations in the striped marlin, Kajikia audax (formerly Tetrapturus audax), and the wahoo, Acanthocybium solandri, and {{sets the stage for}} Chapters 1 - 4. Chapter 1 documents changes in scombrid and billfish gill morphometrics which augment gill surface area above that of other fish groups and increase branchial resistance to slow and streamline ram-ventilatory flow. Many scombrids and billfishes also have gill fusions which provide support and secure the spatial relationship of filaments and lamellae. Chapter 2 details the structure, function, and distribution of these fusions within different species; they are most complex in large tunas and billfishes, which are obligate ram ventilators, but are absent in mackerels, which utilize active ventilation at slower swimming speeds. Chapter 3 investigates the convergence of mako and tuna gill structure in relation to high aerobic demands and ram ventilation and shows that although makos have relatively larger gill surface areas and shorter diffusion distances than those of other shark species, these features are not as specialized as those of tunas. This work suggests that differences in the gill design of elasmobranchs and teleosts may limit mako gill surface area and ultimately constrain mako aerobic performance in comparison to tunas. Chapter 4 tests this hypothesis with in vivo studies of gill function in makos swimming in a water tunnel. Mako gills {{are similar to those of}} tunas in terms of oxygen utilization, the total pressure gradient driving the ventilatory stream, and flow conditions along the respiratory surfaces. However, the interbranchial septum, an intrinsic feature of the shark gill, greatly contributes to mako branchial resistance, and this is compensated by changes to gill dimensions that ultimately limit gill surface area...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{comparative}} study of eye movement behaviour of teleost fish from 5 families with diverse visual specialisations and oculomotor function. In chapter 3 I compared basic oculomotor parameters in three species of fish from the families Creediidae, Syngnathidae and Pinguipedidae, that show asynchronous eye movements and a fovea. All three species showed a close correlation between their specific retinal specialisation, oculomotor range and the lifestyles and feeding habits. Direction of gaze was correlated in the two independently moving eyes in both sandperch (Pinguipedidae) and pipefish (Syngnathidae) {{but not in the}} sandlance (Creediidae). Properties of spontaneous and fixational fast eye movements (saccades) in the species studied show many similarities to those found in other vertebrates. The apparent independence of the two eyes in the teleosts studied seem to set them apart from many other vertebrates, where eye movements are largely correlated with respect to each other. The results presented in chapter 4, however, reveal a regular switching of saccadic activity between {{the left and the right}} eye in sandlance, pipefish and sandperch, suggesting that the two eyes are in some way correlated. Since saccades are often a motor correlate of attention this finding suggests that these teleosts with asynchronous eye movements may show periodic shifts of attention while observing their environment. In chapter 5 the correlation between the two eyes was also tested during optokinetic nystagmus. This basic response shown by all animals stabilises the gaze against rotational head movements and translation. In most vertebrates the optokinetic response is tightly yoked in both eyes. This is also the case for the butterflyfish (Chaetodontidae) which shows strong yoking of the eyes during spontaneous eye movements. However some capacity for independent optokinesis in the two eyes was observed. Both sandlance and pipefish are capable of following two conflicting stimuli independently. However monocular occlusion in the pipefish unmasks a link between the two eyes, which is overridden when both eyes receive visual input. The sandlance never showed any correlation between eyes during optokinesis, even during monocular stimulation. This suggests that there are different levels of linkage between the two eyes in the oculomotor system of teleosts, depending on the visual input. One of the main functions of the oculomotor system in vertebrates and most invertebrates is to keep the image of the world relatively still on the retina. As shown in chapter 6 the sandlance breaks this universal rule of image stabilisation by showing large postsaccadic drifting eye movements as part of its normal oculomotor behaviour. In these animals, up to 40 % of spontaneous saccades are followed by a drifting movement, either binocularly or in one eye only. The drifts are large and are always directed towards the most relaxed position of the eye, indicating that this form of eye movement is not visually driven. However the eye is visually responsive and saccades and an optokinetic response can be elicited during a drift. The drifting speed and the known acuity of the sandlance eye suggest that, during the drift, the image quality is not degraded. Several advantages of this unusual oculomotor behaviour can be related to the unusual optics and lifestyle of the sandlance. A unique modification of the eye muscles of billfish (<b>Xiphiidae)</b> maintains the eye and brain above ambient temperature; however the function of this adaptation and its effect on the oculomotor system is unknown. Chapter 7 aims to provide an insight into the visual abilities of billfish derived from anatomical observations of their retinal structure. The observations help explain the effect the increased retinal temperature might have for vision and eye movements. The blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) shows a well developed temporal area centralis and no visual streak, suggesting that a functional oculomotor system is required in this fish. A convergence of cones to ganglion cells at a ratio of at least 5 : 1 is present even in the area of highest acuity. The finding of two cone types suggest that the animal is capable of wavelength discrimination. Regional differences in size and composition of photoreceptors between dorsal and ventral retina potentially affect colour vision and sensitivity. The anatomical results suggest that sensitivity and spatial summation are of high priority to billfish. The possible function of the warm retina for increasing temporal resolution is discussed. These findings show the adaptability of the oculomotor system to suit the needs of different teleost lifestyles. However most of the parameters established for the oculomotor system of higher vertebrates also hold for teleosts...|$|E
