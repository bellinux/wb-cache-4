5|$|These {{scattering}} methods generally use monochromatic X-rays, {{which are}} restricted to a single wavelength with minor deviations. A broad spectrum of X-rays (that is, a blend of X-rays with different wavelengths) {{can also be used}} to carry out X-ray diffraction, a technique known as the Laue method. This is the method used in the original discovery of X-ray diffraction. Laue scattering provides much structural information with only a short exposure to the <b>X-ray</b> <b>beam,</b> and is therefore used in structural studies of very rapid events (Time resolved crystallography). However, it is not as well-suited as monochromatic scattering for determining the full atomic structure of a crystal and therefore works better with crystals with relatively simple atomic arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Phase-contrast X-ray imaging (Fig.26) {{refers to}} a variety of {{techniques}} that use phase information of a coherent <b>x-ray</b> <b>beam</b> to image soft tissues. (For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast x-ray imaging (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast X-ray imaging.) It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures {{in a wide range of}} biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot interferometry, moiré-based far-field interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, x-ray optics, or high resolution x-ray detectors.|$|E

25|$|The use of two lasers to {{heat the}} sample reduces the axial {{temperature}} gradient, this which allows for thicker samples to be heated more evenly. In order for a double-sided heating system to be successful {{it is essential that}} the two lasers are aligned so that they are both focused on the sample position.

25|$|This {{technique}} achieved {{substantially higher}} sensitivity than other techniques {{with the exception}} of the crystal interferometer. A basic limitation of the technique is the chromatic dispersion of grating diffraction, which limits its spatial resolution. A tabletop system with a tungsten-target x-ray tube running at 60kVp will have a limiting resolution of 60µm. Another constraint is that the <b>x-ray</b> <b>beam</b> is slitted down to only tens of micrometers wide.

In principle, the lightest element that can be analysed is beryllium (Z = 4), but due to instrumental limitations and low X-ray yields for the light elements, {{it is often difficult to}} quantify elements lighter than sodium (Z = 11), unless background corrections and very comprehensive inter-element corrections are made.|$|E
25|$|Phase-contrast X-ray imaging (PCI) or phase-sensitive X-ray imaging is {{a general}} term for {{different}} technical methods that use information concerning changes in the phase of an <b>X-ray</b> <b>beam</b> that passes through an object {{in order to create}} its images. Standard X-ray imaging techniques like radiography or computed tomography (CT) rely on a decrease of the X-ray beam's intensity (attenuation) when traversing the sample, which can be measured directly with the assistance of an X-ray detector. In PCI however, the beam's phase shift caused by the sample is not measured directly, but is transformed into variations in intensity, which then can be recorded by the detector.|$|E
40|$|In {{experiments}} on irradiation of metal surfaces by ions of keV energy, the emission of <b>X-ray</b> laser <b>beams</b> from the metal was observed not {{only during the}} irradiation but also 20 hours after it was switched off (from the "dead" sample). In contrast to an usual laser, the emitted collimated <b>X-ray</b> <b>beams</b> were of continuous frequency. In this paper the mechanism of that phenomenon is proposed. Subatomic electron states are formed inside the metal. These states are associated with anomalous well within the subatomically narrow ($ 10 ^{- 11 }cm$) region. Anomalous well is formed by the local reduction (of $MeV$ scale) in that region of the vacuum energy of the mass-generating field. States in anomalous well are long-living which results in population inversion and the subsequent laser generation observed. The energy of emitted <b>X-ray</b> <b>beams</b> are due to {{the conversion of the}} vacuum energy of the mass-generating field (<b>X-ray</b> laser <b>beams</b> from vacuum) ...|$|R

All measurements were performed for different field sizes and for 6 MV and 15 MV <b>X-ray</b> <b>beams,</b> respectively. A water-equivalent RW 3 slab (Goettingen White Water) produced by PTW was used as a bolus. ResultsPlacing a bolus in an irradiated field changes the shape of the PDD curve in the build-up region in comparison with the one obtained for an open field. All results has been inserted in tables and figures. ConclusionThe closer the bolus is to the water surface, the smaller the depth of the maximum dose in the phantom for all investigated fields and energies. The changes in the build-up region are important, even if the bolus does not touch {{the surface of the water}} phantom. The influence of the bolus can be ignored when the bolus-surface distance equals 25 cm for 6 MV <b>X-ray</b> <b>beams</b> and 39 cm for 15 MV <b>X-ray</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

25|$|X-ray {{scattering}} {{techniques are}} some of the most useful techniques for determining the structural identification and shape of lipids. An <b>X-ray</b> <b>beam</b> of light is applied to the lipid in which a distinct X-ray pattern is revealed. This lattice pattern is based on the electron density and localization of electrons dispersed throughout the lipid in order to determine atomic positions. The disadvantage is that it can be difficult to determine patterns in lipids that are not well oriented such as non-lamellar phases. Although this can be a limitation in producing electron density reconstructions in lipids, X-ray diffraction is still a reliable method for obtaining structural information and distinguishing between lamellar and non-lamellar phases.|$|E

The above-mentioned materials cannot be used in radial geometries where the <b>x-ray</b> <b>beam</b> must pass through the gasket.

50|$|Few {{movements}} are truly planar; planar X-ray imaging can capture {{the majority of}} movement, {{but not all of}} it. Accurately capturing and quantifying all three dimensions of movement requires a biplanar imaging system. Biplanar imaging is difficult to perform because many facilities have access to only one X-ray emitter. With the addition of a second X-ray and camera system, the 2-D plane of imaging expands to a 3-D volume of imaging at the intersection of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>beams.</b> Because the volume of imaging is at the intersection of two <b>X-ray</b> <b>beams,</b> the overall size of it is limited by the area of the X-ray emitters.|$|R
25|$|If the <b>X-ray</b> <b>beam</b> is {{vertically}} {{thin and}} impinges {{on the edge}} of the detector, X-ray refraction can change the status of the individual X-ray from “detected” to “undetected” and vice versa, effectively playing the same role as the crystal rocking curve in ABI. This analogy with ABI, already observed when the method was initially developed, was more recently formally demonstrated. Effectively, the same effect is obtained – a fine angular selection on the photon direction; however, while in ABI the beam needs to be highly collimated and monochromatic, the absence of the crystal means that EI can be implemented with divergent and polychromatic beams, like those generated by a conventional rotating-anode X-ray tube. This is done by introducing two opportunely designed masks (sometimes referred to as “coded-aperture” masks), one immediately before the sample, and one in contact with the detector (see figure).|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT), or Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) scan, is a helical tomography technique (latest generation), which traditionally produces a 2D {{image of the}} structures in a thin section of the body. In CT, a beam of X-rays spins around an object being examined and is picked up by sensitive radiation detectors after having penetrated the object from multiple angles. A computer then analyses the information received from the scanner's detectors and constructs a detailed image of the object and its contents using the mathematical principles {{laid out in the}} Radon transform. It has a greater ionizing radiation dose burden than projection radiography; repeated scans must be limited to avoid health effects. CT is based on the same principles as X-Ray projections but in this case, the patient is enclosed in a surrounding ring of detectors assigned with 500-1000 scintillation detectors (fourth-generation X-Ray CT scanner geometry).
