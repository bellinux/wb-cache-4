5|$|For {{all above}} {{mentioned}} <b>X-ray</b> diffraction methods, the scattering is elastic; the scattered X-rays {{have the same}} wavelength as the incoming <b>X-ray.</b> By contrast, inelastic <b>X-ray</b> scattering methods are useful in studying excitations of the sample, rather than the distribution of its atoms.|$|E
5|$|In April 1965, the United States Naval Research Laboratory group {{launched}} an Aerobee 150 rocket {{equipped with a}} pair of Geiger counters. This flight discovered seven candidate <b>X-ray</b> sources, including the first extragalactic <b>X-ray</b> source; Virgo X-1 was designated as the first <b>X-ray</b> source detected in Virgo. A later Aerobee rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range on July 7, 1967, yielded further evidence that the source of Virgo X-1 was the radio galaxy M87. Subsequent <b>X-ray</b> observations by the HEAO 1 and Einstein Observatory showed a complex source that included the active galactic nucleus of M87. However, there is little central concentration of the <b>X-ray</b> emission.|$|E
5|$|Other {{forms of}} elastic <b>X-ray</b> {{scattering}} include powder diffraction, Small-Angle <b>X-ray</b> Scattering (SAXS) and {{several types of}} <b>X-ray</b> fiber diffraction, which was used by Rosalind Franklin in determining the double-helix structure of DNA. In general, single-crystal <b>X-ray</b> diffraction offers more structural information than these other techniques; however, it requires a sufficiently large and regular crystal, which is not always available.|$|E
50|$|The anthropologists {{studied the}} autopsy <b>X-rays</b> in {{conjunction}} with premortem <b>X-rays</b> of the President. A sufficient number of unique anatomic characteristics were present in <b>X-rays</b> taken {{before and after the}} President's death to conclude that the autopsy <b>X-rays</b> were of President Kennedy. This conclusion was consistent with the findings of a forensic dentist employed by the committee. Since many of the <b>X-rays</b> taken {{during the course of the}} autopsy included Kennedy's teeth, it was possible to determine, using the his dental records, that the <b>X-rays</b> were of the President.|$|R
50|$|<b>X-rays</b> {{have been}} {{detected}} from V473 Lyrae during a survey looking for <b>x-rays</b> from young main sequence companions to Cepheid variables. However, the <b>x-rays</b> in this case appear to originate from the Cepheid itself, not from the companion. There may be a closer unseen companion or the <b>x-rays</b> may have another cause.|$|R
30|$|The {{attenuation}} {{behavior of}} soft <b>X-rays</b> {{is different from}} that of the hard <b>X-rays</b> used in previous studies. Attenuation of soft <b>X-rays</b> is governed by the penetrating depth of the object as well as its density, because soft <b>X-rays</b> from a portable apparatus have a continuous wavelength. Longer wavelengths tend to be attenuated by scattering rather than absorption, and in a thicker object, attenuation is more likely to be affected by scattering [12]. The effect of penetrating depth on density prediction for soft <b>X-rays</b> was investigated in this study, and the result of density CT images was presented using the attenuation behavior of soft <b>X-rays.</b>|$|R
5|$|Phase-contrast <b>X-ray</b> imaging (Fig.26) {{refers to}} a variety of {{techniques}} that use phase information of a coherent <b>x-ray</b> beam to image soft tissues. (For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast <b>x-ray</b> imaging (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast <b>X-ray</b> imaging.) It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures {{in a wide range of}} biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for <b>x-ray</b> phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot interferometry, moiré-based far-field interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and <b>x-ray</b> interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast <b>x-ray</b> imaging, making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus <b>x-ray</b> sources, <b>x-ray</b> optics, or high resolution <b>x-ray</b> detectors.|$|E

5|$|With seven {{different}} instruments on board, Granat {{was designed to}} observe the universe at energies ranging from <b>X-ray</b> to gamma ray. Its main instrument, SIGMA, was capable of imaging both hard <b>X-ray</b> and soft gamma-ray sources. The PHEBUS instrument was meant to study gamma-ray bursts and other transient <b>X-Ray</b> sources. Other experiments such as ART-P were intended to image <b>X-Ray</b> sources in the 35 to 100keV range. One instrument, WATCH, was designed to monitor the sky continuously and alert the other instruments to new or interesting <b>X-Ray</b> sources. The ART-S spectrometer covered the <b>X-ray</b> energy range while the KONUS-B and TOURNESOL experiments covered both the <b>X-ray</b> and gamma ray spectrum.|$|E

A spokesman for the German Federal Criminal Police Office, where the Dubai <b>x-rays</b> were reviewed, stated {{they would not have}} detected the bomb. When <b>X-rayed,</b> PETN would resemble the cartridge's powdered ink, and the timers resembled the normal printer cartridge electronics.|$|R
50|$|Megavoltage <b>x-rays</b> are {{preferred}} {{for treatment}} of deep lying tumours as they are attenuated less than lower energy photons, and will penetrate further, with a lower skin dose. Megavoltage <b>x-rays</b> also have higher relative biological effectiveness than orthovoltage <b>x-rays.</b> These properties help to make megavoltage <b>x-rays</b> the most common beam energies typically used for radiotherapy in modern techniques such as IMRT.|$|R
50|$|Archaeological {{materials}} have also benefited from <b>x-rays.</b> <b>X-rays</b> of soil segments have revealed artifacts that have eroded away, leaving them nearly undetectable {{to the naked}} eye. Worn and damaged surfaces, which appear unmarked, have yielded inscriptions or other markings on <b>x-rays.</b> Heavily corroded metal objects have also used <b>x-rays</b> {{to learn more about}} their original state. Industrial and medical CT scans have also been used by archaeologists to study a variety of artifacts. Underwater archaeologists have utilized <b>x-rays</b> to see what is beneath layers of concretions.|$|R
5|$|<b>X-ray</b> {{astronomy}} uses <b>X-ray</b> wavelengths. Typically, <b>X-ray</b> {{radiation is}} produced by synchrotron emission (the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), thermal emission from thin gases above 107 (10million) kelvins, and thermal emission from thick gases above 107 Kelvin. Since X-rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, all <b>X-ray</b> observations must be performed from high-altitude balloons, rockets, or <b>X-ray</b> astronomy satellites. Notable <b>X-ray</b> sources include <b>X-ray</b> binaries, pulsars, supernova remnants, elliptical galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and active galactic nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{selenide}} was {{the first}} material for blue LEDs, but gallium nitride is dominating the market now. Cadmium selenide was an important component in quantum dots. Sheets of amorphous selenium convert <b>X-ray</b> images to patterns of charge in xeroradiography and in solid-state, flat-panel <b>X-ray</b> cameras. Ionized selenium (Se+24) {{is one of the}} active mediums used in <b>X-ray</b> lasers.|$|E
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest <b>X-ray,</b> and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an <b>X-ray,</b> it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with <b>X-ray.</b>|$|E

50|$|Radiographs (originally called roentgenographs, {{named after}} the {{discoverer}} of <b>X-rays,</b> Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen) are produced by transmitting <b>X-rays</b> through a patient. The <b>X-rays</b> are projected through the body onto a detector; an image is formed based on which rays pass through (and are detected) versus those that are absorbed or scattered in the patient (and thus are not detected). Röntgen discovered <b>X-rays</b> on November 8, 1895 and received the first Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery in 1901.|$|R
5|$|Another use {{concerns}} <b>X-ray</b> optics, especially <b>X-ray</b> telescopes. The mirrors of the Chandra <b>X-ray</b> Observatory are {{coated with}} a layer of iridium 60nm thick. Iridium proved to be the best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium.|$|E
5|$|As cubic {{boron nitride}} {{consists}} of light atoms {{and is very}} robust chemically and mechanically, {{it is one of}} the popular materials for <b>X-ray</b> membranes: low mass results in small <b>X-ray</b> absorption, and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.|$|E
5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for X-rays, {{the oldest and}} {{still one of the}} most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for <b>X-ray</b> tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the <b>X-ray</b> images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for <b>X-ray</b> detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various <b>X-ray</b> emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive <b>X-ray</b> spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the study: There is a {{controversy}} {{over whether or}} not routine comparative <b>x-rays</b> should be prescribed for young children with bone and joint trauma. We conducted a retrospective analysis to assess the contribution of such <b>x-rays.</b> Material and methods: The series included 203 children aged less than fifteen years who had experienced bone and joint trauma. Two junior orthopedic surgeons, two senior orthopedic surgeons and two pediatric radiologists reread the <b>x-rays</b> to establish the diagnosis, using comparative <b>x-rays</b> to make any necessary correction of the diagnosis. The surgeons were asked to propose a therapeutic strategy for each diagnosis and the radiologists were asked to judge the value of the comparative <b>x-rays.</b> Results: The comparative <b>x-rays</b> were found to be reliable in only 87. 5 % of the cases, and were useful for diagnosis in only 8. 8 %. There were statistically significant differences depending on the localization, the patient's age, and the physician's experience. Discussion: Systematic use of comparative <b>x-rays</b> should be discouraged. Only trauma affecting the elbow in older children can, in particular cases, warrant prescription of comparative <b>x-rays.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Hot stars emit {{large amounts}} of <b>X-rays,</b> which are assumed to {{originate}} in the supersonic stellar wind.

We review the recent progress in modelling the influence of <b>X-rays</b> on the radiative equilibrium and on the radiative force.

5|$|Semiconductor {{detectors}} made {{of single}} crystal high-purity germanium can precisely identify radiation sources—for example in airport security.

The reflectivity has advantages over silicon in neutron and high energy <b>X-ray</b> applications.

Germanium crystals are also used in <b>X-ray</b> spectrometers for the determination of phosphorus, chlorine and sulfur.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to video}} fluoroscopy, <b>X-ray</b> {{microbeam}} studies use radiation to study movements of articulators.

Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow <b>x-ray</b> beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, <b>x-ray</b> microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the University of Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1920s, <b>X-ray</b> {{diffraction}} {{has been}} the principal method for determining the arrangement of atoms in minerals and metals. The application of <b>X-ray</b> crystallography to mineralogy began with the structure of garnet, which was determined in 1924 by Menzer. A systematic <b>X-ray</b> crystallographic study of the silicates was undertaken in the 1920s. This study showed that, as the Si/O ratio is altered, the silicate crystals exhibit significant changes in their atomic arrangements. Machatschki extended these insights to minerals in which aluminium substitutes for the silicon atoms of the silicates. The first application of <b>X-ray</b> crystallography to metallurgy likewise occurred in the mid-1920s. Most notably, Linus Pauling's structure of the alloy Mg2Sn led to his theory of the stability and structure of complex ionic crystals.|$|E

5|$|The first {{published}} reports of A-DNA <b>X-ray</b> diffraction patterns—and also B-DNA—used analyses based on Patterson transforms that provided {{only a limited}} amount of structural information for oriented fibers of DNA. An alternative analysis was then proposed by Wilkins et al., in 1953, for the in vivo B-DNA <b>X-ray</b> diffraction-scattering patterns of highly hydrated DNA fibers in terms of squares of Bessel functions.
