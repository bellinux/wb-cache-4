50|$|In general two {{elements}} x and y of a partial order may stand {{in any of}} four mutually exclusive relationships to each other: either <b>x</b> < <b>y,</b> <b>or</b> <b>x</b> = <b>y,</b> <b>or</b> <b>x</b> > <b>y,</b> <b>or</b> <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are incomparable (none of the other three). A totally ordered set is one that rules out this fourth possibility: all pairs of elements are comparable and we then say that trichotomy holds. The natural numbers, the integers, the rationals, and the reals are all totally ordered by their algebraic (signed) magnitude whereas the complex numbers are not. This {{is not to say}} that the complex numbers cannot be totally ordered; we could for example order them lexicographically via x+iy < u+iv if and only if <b>x</b> < u <b>or</b> (<b>x</b> = u and y < v), but this is not ordering by magnitude in any reasonable sense as it makes 1 greater than 100i. Ordering them by absolute magnitude yields a preorder in which all pairs are comparable, but this is not a partial order since 1 and i have the same absolute magnitude but are not equal, violating antisymmetry.|$|R

25|$|A t-(v,k,λ) design D is quasi-symmetric with {{intersection}} numbers x and y (x < y) {{if every}} two distinct blocks intersect in either <b>x</b> <b>or</b> <b>y</b> points.

A multiple (repeat all blocks a certain number of times) of a symmetric 2-(v,k,λ) design is quasisymmetric with x = λ and y = k. Hadamard 3-designs (extensions of Hadamard 2-designs) are quasisymmetric.|$|E
25|$|If {{asked to}} imagine the graph of the {{relationship}} y=ax2, one typically visualizes a range of values of x, but only one value of a. Of course a different value of a can be used, generating a different relation between x and y. Thus a is a parameter: it is less variable than the variable <b>x</b> <b>or</b> <b>y,</b> {{but it is not}} an explicit constant like the exponent2. More precisely, changing the parameter a gives a different (though related) problem, whereas the variations of the variables x and y (and their interrelation) are part of the problem itself.|$|E
25|$|A Hasse diagram is {{a simple}} picture of a finite {{partially}} ordered set, forming a drawing of the partial order's transitive reduction. Concretely, one represents each element of the set as a vertex on the page and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from x to y precisely when x < y {{and there is no}} z such that x < z < y. In this case, we say y covers <b>x,</b> <b>or</b> <b>y</b> is an immediate successor of x. In a Hasse diagram, it is required that the curves be drawn so that each meets exactly two vertices: its two endpoints. Any such diagram (given that the vertices are labeled) uniquely determines a partial order, and any partial order has a unique transitive reduction, but there are many possible placements of elements in the plane, resulting in different Hasse diagrams for a given order that may have widely varying appearances.|$|E

It is also the first Pokémon games to include 3D functions, {{not only in the}} games' overworld, but compatible with the 3D hardware of the Nintendo 3DS family of systems. The player controls a young trainer who goes on a quest to catch and train creatures known as Pokémon, and win battles against other trainers while training their own. By defeating enemy Pokémon in turn-based battles, the player's Pokémon gains experience, allowing them to level up and increase their battle statistics, learn new moves to use in battle, and in some cases, evolve into more powerful Pokémon. Alternatively, players can capture wild Pokémon, found during random encounters, by weakening them in battle by depleting their health and catching them with Poké Balls, allowing them to be added to their party. Players are also able to battle and trade Pokémon with other human players using the Nintendo 3DS's Internet features, which was also newly enhanced in the 6th generation of games. Like in previous games in the series, certain Pokémon are only obtainable in either <b>X</b> <b>or</b> <b>Y,</b> keeping players encouraged to trade with others in order to obtain all Pokémon from both versions.|$|E
