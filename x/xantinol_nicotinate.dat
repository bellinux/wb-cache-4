At high dosages, it is advisable to seek oneâ€™s physician's guidance if combining with potent vasodilators such as bromocriptine, Gingko biloba, picamilon, vinpocetine or <b>xantinol</b> <b>nicotinate.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{carpal tunnel}} {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is the most common}} cause of severe hand pain. In this study we treated acute pain in CTS patients by means of local intradermal injections of anti-inflammatory drugs (mesotherapy). Methods: In twenty-five patients (forty-five hands), CTS diagnosis was confirmed by clinical and neurophysiological examination prior to mesotherapy. A mixture containing lidocaine 10 mg, ketoprophen lysine-acetylsalycilate 80 mg, <b>xantinol</b> <b>nicotinate</b> 100 mg, cyanocobalamine 1, 000 mcg plus injectable water was used. Sites of injection were three parallel lines above the transverse carpal ligament and two v-shaped lines, one at the base of the thenar eminence, and the other at the base of the hypothenar eminence. Results: The day after the treatment, all but four patients reported a significant reduction in pain and paresthesias. After 12 months, 17 patients had a complete pain relief, eight patients reported recurrence of pain and sensory symptoms and four out of them underwent surgical treatment. Conclusions: With the obvious limits of a small-size open-label study, our results suggest that mesotherapy can temporary relieve pain and paresthesias in most CTS patients and in some cases its effect seems to be long-lasting. Further controlled studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings and to compare mesotherapy to conventional approaches for the treatment of CTS. (Korean J Pain 2014; 27 : 49 - 53...|$|E
