50|$|This {{rapid and}} violent type of {{rejection}} occurs within minutes to hours {{from the time}} of the transplant. It is mediated by the binding of XNAs (<b>xenoreactive</b> natural antibodies) to the donor endothelium, causing activation of the human complement system, which results in endothelial damage, inflammation, thrombosis and necrosis of the transplant. XNAs are first produced and begin circulating in the blood in neonates, after colonization of the bowel by bacteria with galactose moieties on their cell walls. Most of these antibodies are the IgM class, but also include IgG, and IgA.|$|E
50|$|While kidneys can {{routinely}} {{be obtained}} from human donors, most organs {{are in short supply}} leading to consideration of xenotransplants from other species. Pigs are especially likely sources for xenotransplants, chosen for the anatomical and physiological characteristics they share with humans. However, the sugar galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (αGal) has been implicated as a major factor in hyperacute rejection in xenotransplantation. Unlike virtually all other mammals, humans and other primates do not make αGal, and in fact recognize it as an antigen. During transplantation, <b>xenoreactive</b> natural antibodies recognize αGal on the graft endothelium as an antigen, and the resulting complement-mediated immune response leads to a rejection of the transplant.|$|E
50|$|Galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, {{commonly}} known as alpha gal, is a carbohydrate found in most mammalian cell membranes. It is not found in primates, including humans, whose immune systems recognize it as a foreign body and produce <b>xenoreactive</b> immunoglobulin M antibodies, leading to organ rejection after transplantation. Anti-alpha gal immunoglobulin G antibodies {{are some of the}} most common in humans. Regular stimulation from gut flora, typically initiated within the first six months of life, leads to an exceptionally high titre of around 1% of all circulating IgG. Alpha gal has also been suggested to play a role in an IgE-specific allergic response to some meats. Recent studies are showing increasing evidence that this allergy may be induced by the bite of the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) in North America and the castor bean tick (Ixodes ricincus) in Sweden.|$|E

Methods: Adult goats with anti-pig <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies underwent left pneumonectomy followed by orthotopic transplantation of pig left lung (group 1) or immunodepletion of their <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies by extracorporeal right pig lung perfusion before transplantation without (group 2) or with (group 3) complete clampage of the right pulmonary artery. In group 4, goat left lungs were orthotopically transplanted into pigs and served as negative controls (pig serum does not have anti-goat <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies). Each study group included 5 animals. Immunosuppression in surviving recipients included cyclosporine and azathioprine. Results: Group 1 recipients died 7 ± 3 hours after xenograft reimplantation of severe pulmonary hypertension and dysfunction and vasogenic shock, with little evidence of histologic xenograft injury. Group 2 xenografts had a stable circulatory and respiratory function on reperfusion and survived 9 ± 4 days. Group 3 animals also tolerated complete occlusion of the right pulmonary artery, and xenografts assured the total respiratory support for 4 ± 1 days. After immunodepletion, goat serum showed no detectable titers of <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies, which began to reappear by postoperative day 2, where xenografts showed histologic stigmata of acute (humoral and cellular-mediated) rejection that evolved to a complete xenograft necrose at death. Group 4 xenografts showed scattered features of acute rejection 5 ± 1 days after the operation. Conclusions: Pig left lung xenografts can provide prolonged and complete respiratory support after depletion of goat <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies, but they ultimately necrose once recipient <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies return to pretransplantation values.

40|$|The {{ability to}} control the {{response}} of B cells {{is of particular interest}} in xenotransplantation as Ab-mediated hyperacute and acute xenograft rejection are major obstacles in achieving long-term graft survival. Regulatory T cells have been proven to play a very important role in the regulation of immune responses to self or non-self Ags. Previous studies have shown that TCRalphabeta+CD 3 +CD 4 -CD 8 - (double-negative (DN)) T cells possess an immune regulatory function, capable of controlling antidonor T cell responses in allo- and xenotransplantation through Fas-Fas ligand interaction. In this study, we investigated the possibility that <b>xenoreactive</b> DNT cells suppress B cells. We found that DNT cells generated from wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 mice expressed B 220 and CD 25 after rat Ag stimulation. These <b>xenoreactive</b> B 220 +CD 25 + DNT cells lysed activated, but not naive, B and T cells. This killing, which took place through cell-cell contact, required participation of adhesion molecules. Our results indicate that Fas ligand, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, and TCR-MHC recognition was not involved in DNT cell-mediated syngenic cell killing, but instead this killing was mediated by perforin and granzymes. The <b>xenoreactive</b> DNT cells expressed high levels of granzymes in comparison to allo- or <b>xenoreactive</b> CD 8 + T cells. Adoptive transfer of DNT cells in combination with early immune suppression by immunosuppressive analog of 15 -deoxyspergualin, LF 15 - 0195, significantly prolonged rat heart graft survival to 62. 1 +/- 13. 9 days in mice recipients. In conclusion, this study suggests that <b>xenoreactive</b> DNT cells can control B and T cell responses in perforin/granzyme-dependent mechanisms.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Our {{objectives}} were to study {{delayed xenograft rejection}} {{and the effectiveness of}} pretransplantation total lymphoid irradiation combined with immunosuppression on rejection in a pig-to-baboon cardiac xenograft model. Methods: Baboons were treated with pretransplantation total lymphoid irradiation, cyclosporine A (INN: ciclosporin), and methotrexate. Orthotopic pig-to-baboon cardiac transplantations were performed after depletion of circulating <b>xenoreactive</b> natural antibody by pretransplantation donor organ hemoperfusion. Tissue samples were collected for immunologic and immunopathologic evaluation. Results: Pig cardiac xenografts survived more than 18 and 19 days without evidence of hyperacute rejection. Immunologic analysis of serum samples demonstrated that circulating <b>xenoreactive</b> natural antibody levels did not return to pretransplantation levels. The production of <b>xenoreactive</b> natural antibodies from the recipient's splenocytes was inhibited completely. Histologic examination of xenografts showed the feature of acute vascular rejection. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated infiltration of cardiac xenografts by large numbers of macrophages, small numbers of natural killer cells, and a few T cells. The infiltrating macrophages also showed expression of interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor. Diffuse deposition of immunoglobulin G, C 1 Q, C 3, and fibrin on xenograft vasculature was observed. Interleukin- 2 expression was not found in rejected cardiac xenografts. Xenograft endothelial cells also showed evidence of activation (expression of cytokines interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor). Conclusions: This study demonstrates prolonged discordant cardiac xenograft survival and delayed xenograft rejection in a pig-to-baboon model. The delayed xenograft rejection is mediated by both humoral and cellular mechanisms. Pretransplantation total lymphoid irradiation combined with cyclosporine A and methotrexate can inhibit <b>xenoreactive</b> natural antibody production but not elicited antipig antibody production and the xenoreactivity of macrophages.

40|$|Lipid {{inflammatory}} mediators {{are thought}} to {{play a critical role}} in the pathogenesis of vascular injury. Among the events which might cause the synthesis of eicosanoids in blood vessels is activation of the complement. To evaluate how complement might influence eicosanoid metabolism, we investigated endothelial cells exposed to <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies and complement, as might occur in rejecting xenografts where severe vascular injury is a typical feature. While resting porcine aortic endothelial cells released only prostaglandin (PG) I 2, endothelial cells stimulated with <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies and complement released PGE 2 and thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2), in addition to increased amounts of PGI 2. This alteration in eicosanoid metabolism was associated with induction of cyclooxygenase (Cox) - 2 and thromboxane synthase, but not Cox- 1. Unlike results seen in other systems, the upregulation of Cox- 2 and the subsequent release of eicosanoids by endothelial cells was not directly induced by complement but rather required production of IL- 1 alpha, which acted on endothelial cells as an autocrine factor. Since eicosanoids have a potent effect on inflammation, vascular tone and platelet aggregation, we postulated that the abnormalities in eicosanoid release induced by <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies and complement might provide one explanation for the vascular injury, focal ischemia, and thrombosis observed in acute vascular rejection and other vasculitides mediated by complement...|$|E

In the last 2 decades, major {{progress has been made}} in understanding the immunobiology of pig-into-(non) human primate transplantation and today we are on the threshold of the first clinical trials. Hyperacute rejection, which is mediated by pre-existing anti-alphaGal <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies, can in non-human primates be overcome by complement- and/or antibody-modifying interventions. A major step forward was the development of genetically engineered pigs, either transgenic for human complement regulatory proteins or deficient in the alpha 1, 3 -galactosyltranferase enzyme. However, several other immunologic and nonimmunologic hurdles remain. Acute vascular xenograft rejection is mediated by humoral and cellular mechanisms. Elicited <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies play a key role. In addition to providing B cell help, <b>xenoreactive</b> T cells may directly contribute to xenograft rejection. Long-term survival of porcine kidney- and heart xenografts in non-human primates has been obtained but required severe T and B cell immunosuppression. Induction of xenotolerance, e. g. through mixed hematopoietic chimerism, may represent the preferred approach, but although proof of principle has been delivered in rodents, induction of pig-to-non-human primate chimerism remains problematic. Finally, it is now clear that innate immune cells, in particular macrophages and natural killer cells, can mediate xenograft destruction, the determinants of which are being elucidated. Chronic xenograft rejection is not well understood, but recent studies indicate that non-immunological problems, such as incompatibilities between human procoagulant and pig anticoagulant components may play an important role. Here, we give a comprehensive overview of the currently known obstacles to xenografting: immune and non-immune problems are discussed, as well as the possible strategies that are under development to overcome these hurdles.

40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTLs) recognize antigens in {{the context}} of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene products. The T-cell receptor (TCR) that mediates this MHC-restricted antigen recognition recognizes short peptide fragments rather than the intact antigen. Presentation of peptides to the TCR may thus be a major function of the MHC. An intriguing question emerging from this model is whether peptide presentation also applies to foreign MHC antigens and which of the available MHC molecules can present preferentially the peptides of the foreign MHC molecule. Allo- and <b>xenoreactive</b> CTLs might either recognize native MHC class I molecules or peptides presented by self MHC or by the foreign class I MHC itself. The finding that synthetic peptides corresponding to MHC class I regions are recognized by allo- and <b>xenoreactive</b> CTLs suggests that recognition of foreign MHC by CTLs might involve degraded fragments presented by syngeneic class I molecules. We used MHC transgenic mice as a tool to study these questions. The CTL responses against human (HLA) antigen B 27 were analyzed by using HLA-B 27 transgenic mice with various H- 2 haplotypes. We report here that mouse xeno-MHC-specific (anti-B 27) CTLs are perfectly able to kill human and mouse cells expressing the appropriate xenoantigen and that in primary and secondary responses to xeno-MHC, the mouse T-cell repertoire does not use self-H- 2 as a restriction element. Absence of H- 2 restriction was confirmed by the lack (less than 1 / 10 (6] of H- 2 -restricted HLA-specific CTL precursors. Therefore, H- 2 -restricted recognition of xeno-MHC antigens cannot be generalized as part of a classical MHC class I-specific response. These results indicate that <b>xenoreactive</b> CTLs usually recognize intact MHC molecules or MHC peptides preferentially presented by their native MHC molecule. We suggest the latter possibility...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Natural <b>xenoreactive</b> {{antibodies}} (Abs) {{directed against}} the Bdi-epitope (Gal alpha 1 - 3 Gal beta) on the cells of non-primate mammals take part in hyperacute rejection of xenotransplanted organs. We found that some Abs, which were one-step affinity purified on Bdi-Sepharose, cross-reacted with the disaccharide Gal alpha 1 - 4 GlcNAc beta. The epitope Gal alpha 1 - 4 GlcNAc has not been identified on mammals or bacterial polysaccharides yet. METHODS: To isolate the antibodies of the corresponding specificity the disaccharide was immobilized on Sepharose and antibodies were affinity purified from pooled serum of blood group O individuals. RESULTS: These one-step purified Abs cross-reacted with Bdi, but after a prior absorption step on Bdi-Sepharose no cross-reactivity with Bdi was observed any longer. Surprisingly, the quantity of anti-Gal alpha 1 - 4 GlcNAc isolated from the same serum pool, 4 - 7 microg/ml, was {{equal to that of}} anti-Bdi or more. Independently of ABO blood groups all the tested healthy donors had anti-Gal alpha 1 - 4 GlcNAc Abs at a similar level.

40|$|Hyperacute {{rejection}} of a porcine organ by higher primates is {{initiated by the}} binding of <b>xenoreactive</b> natural antibodies of the recipient to {{blood vessels in the}} graft leading to complement activation. The majority of these antibodies recognize the carbohydrate structure Gal(alphal, 3) Gal (gal epitope) present on cells of pigs. It is possible that the removal or lowering of the number of gal epitopes on the graft endothelium could prevent hyperacute rejection. The Gal(alpha 1, 3) Gal structure is formed by the enzyme Galbeta 1, 4 GlcNAc 3 -alpha-D-galactosyltransferase [alpha(1, 3) GT; EC 2. 4. 1. 51], which transfers a galactose molecule to terminal N-acetyllactosamine (N-lac) present on various glycoproteins and glycolipids. The N-lac structure might be utilized as an acceptor by other glycosyltransferases such as Galbeta 1, 4 GlcNAc 6 -alpha-D-sialyltransferase [alpha(2, 6) ST], Galbeta 1, 4 GlcNAc 3 -alpha-D-Sialyltransferase [alpha(2, 3) ST], or Galbeta 2 -alpha-L-fucosyltransferase [alpha(1, 2) FT; EC 2. 4. 1. 691, etc. In this report we describe the competition between alpha(1, 2) FT and alpha(1, 3) GT in cells in culture and the generation of transgenic mice and transgenic pigs that express alpha(1, 2) Fr leading to synthesis of Fucalpha, 2 Galbeta- (H antigen) and a concomitant decrease in the level of Gal(alpha 1, 3) Gal.

There is, however, little known about the xenospecific immune responses involved in such an intracerebral xenotransplantation. The aim of our study was to investigate whether 1) naive human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC) display cytotoxicity against pfVM cells of E 28 pig fetuses, and 2) priming of human PBMC by xenogeneic antigen presenting cells (APC) modulates pfVM-directed cellular cytotoxicity. For this purpose fresh PMBC from nine individual donors were primed by incubation with either irradiated pfVM cells or porcine spleen cells (PSC) as APC in the presence of IL- 2 for 1 week before assessing cytotoxicity in a Cr- 51 release assay. Also, direct NK reactivity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of fresh PMBC against pfVM cells was assessed. No direct cytotoxicity of naive cells (either NK reactivity or ADCC) against pfVM cells could be determined. Only PMBC primed with PSC were capable of lysing pfVM cells. PBMC primed with pfVM cells did not show cytolytic capacity towards pfVM. Interestingly, large differences in xenospecific T-cell responses exist between individual donor PBMC. Thus, human T cells are capable of killing pfVM cells in a <b>xenoreactive</b> response, but only after priming by donor APC.

In addition, the TR allowed for long-term hamster cardiac xenograft (Xg) survival when Xgs were transplanted 2 weeks (Day 0) after the initiation of the TR (started on Day - 14). The present study was undertaken to investigate some {{of the characteristics of}} this T-I xenotolerance in more detail. METHODS: To investigate the duration of the effect of the TR on the T-I xenotolerance, hamster Xgs were transplanted at various times after initiation of the TR. To investigate whether the maintenance of the T-I xenotolerance depended on the presence of the graft, tolerated Xgs were removed on Day + 28, and the subsequent evolution of the T-I xenotolerance as well as of second hamster Xg was followed. In addition, the reversibility of NK cell nonresponsiveness by recombinant interleukin- 2 was investigated in vitro. RESULTS: Xgs transplanted on day 0 or Day + 7 showed long-term survival. However, all Xgs transplanted on Day + 15, + 30, and + 60 were rapidly rejected. The latter rejection occurred in the absence of formation of anti-hamster immunoglobulin (Ig) M <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies (xAbs) but correlated with the recovery of anti-hamster NK cell reactivity from day + 14 on. Rejected Xgs showed infiltration of NK cells but absence of IgM xAbs or complement factor deposition. When tolerated first Xgs (transplanted on Day 0) were removed on Day + 28, second hamster Xgs survived without treatment when transplanted 1 or 2 weeks later. However, second hamster Xgs transplanted 3 weeks after removal of the first Xgs were all rapidly rejected. Again, the latter rejection was characterized by the infiltration of the Xgs with NK cells and by the absence of anti-hamster IgM xAbs formation. <b>Xenoreactive</b> NK cell nonresponsiveness was not only shorter than <b>xenoreactive</b> B cell nonresponsiveness, but was also more fragile. This was evident from the fact that after addition of recombinant interleukin- 2 in vitro, specific anti-hamster NK nonresponsiveness was easily broken.

We have generated an antibody with high specificity and avidity for Neu 5 Gc. Fetal tissues, normal adult tissues, and breast carcinomas from humans showed reactivity to this antibody, primarily within secretory epithelia and blood vessels. The presence of small amounts of Neu 5 Gc was confirmed by MS. Absent any known alternate pathway for its synthesis, we reasoned that these small amounts of Neu 5 Gc might originate from exogenous sources. Indeed, human cells fed with Neu 5 Gc incorporated it into endogenous glycoproteins. When normal human volunteers ingested Neu 5 Gc, a portion was absorbed and eliminated in urine, and small quantities were incorporated into newly synthesized glycoproteins. Neu 5 Gc has never been reported in plants or microbes to our knowledge. We found that Neu 5 Gc is rare in poultry and fish, common in milk products, and enriched in red meats.

The major immunological barrier to xenotransplantation is the hyperacute rejection (HAR) response that is mediated by preformed <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies and complement.

We have used the human early cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter to drive expression of the human complement regulatory protein CD 59 (hCD 59) in transgenic pigs. A total of eight live transgenic founder animals was born from which five transgenic lines could be established. mRNA analysis and Western blotting revealed high expression of hCD 59 in heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, and skin in animals of lines 1 and 5, {{as well as in}} the pancreas of four lines. This pattern of expression was confirmed by immunhistological staining. A cell-specific expression in heart and kidney tissue of transgenic lines 1 and 5 was determined. Primary fibroblasts and endothelial cell cultures derived from the aorta of transgenic pigs showed a significantly diminished sensitivity against the challenge with <b>xenoreactive</b> human antibodies and complement whereas non-transgenic control cells were highly susceptible to complement mediated lysis. Ex vivo perfusion of kidneys with pooled human blood revealed a significant protective effect of hCD 59 against HAR.

These data support the concept that hCD 59 protects nonprimate cells against human complement mediated lysis and suggest that donor pigs transgenic for hCD 59 could play a crucial role in clinical xenotransplantation. Two of five hCD 59 transgenic lines showed strong hCD 59 expression in several organs relevant for xenotransplantation and a protective effect against HAR.

In light of new information provided by this structure, we have reanalyzed the existing TCR/MHC cocrystal structures and discovered unique features of TCR Vα domain position on class I MHC that correlate with CD 8 dependence. Finally, we propose that the orientation seen in TCR recognition of MHC is a consequence of selection during T cell development...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the ever}} {{increasing}} shortage of suitable human donors, alternative strategies are sought to moderate the current {{discrepancy between the}} number of executable and required transplantations. Xenotransplantation (i. e., the transplantation of organs [tissues or cells] between different species) appears to be a reasonable solution. However, various problems (immunological, physiological, infectious-microbiological, ethical-juridicial) seem to be associated with xenotransplantation. One of the most formidable barriers to xenotransplantation is the phenomenon of hyperacute rejection that may lead to the destruction of the transplanted vascularized organ in a few minutes to hours. In the pathogenesis of hyperacute rejection, <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies and the complement system appear to be of primary importance. Various methods can be applied to prevent hyperacute rejection; both the recipient and the donor can be treated. In this brief review, the author attempts to present a synopsis of the possible therapeutical interventions to prevent hyperacute rejection. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of xenotransplantation faces daunting immunological hurdles, {{some of which}} might be overcome with the induction of tolerance. Porcine organs transplanted into primates are subject to several types of rejection responses. Hyperacute rejection mediated by naturally occurring <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies and complement can be overcome without tolerance. Acute vascular rejection and cellular rejection, however, may present important opportunities for immunological tolerance, and humoral rejection might be approached by various mechanisms including (i) clonal deletion, (ii) anergy, (iii) immune deviation, (iv) induction of immunoregulatory or suppressor cells, or (v) veto cells. B-cell tolerance, useful for preventing humoral rejection, might be approached through clonal anergy. It remains to be determined, however, whether tolerance induction is required for xenotransplantation and by which means the various mechanisms of tolerance can be applied {{in the setting of}} xenotransplantation. Regardless, the study of tolerance will surely expand understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of the immune system...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} {{shortage of}} donor organs has driven {{many in the}} transplantation community to consider the use of animals as organ donors for humans, that is, xenotransplantation. While successful xenotransplantation of primate kidneys was achieved 25 years ago, most now advocate use of nonprimates as donors {{because of the risk}} of disease transmission and ethical concerns attendant to the use of primates. The major hurdle to xenotransplantation of organs between phylogenetically disparate species is the hyperacute rejection reaction that invariably destroys organ xenografts placed in unmodified recipients. Here we review recent insights concerning the pathogenesis of hyperacute rejection reactions. We focus particular attention on the endothelial cell, which serves not only as the target of <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies and complement, but also, as a consequence of endothelial cell activation, as an instrument of tissue injury. We discuss a phenomenon called 2 ̆ 2 accommodation 2 ̆ 2 in which an organ graft acquires resistance to humoral-mediated injury...|$|E
40|$|An in vivo {{model system}} to {{understand}} the mechanism of xenograft rejection was established using human peripheral blood leukocyte-reconstituted SCID (hu-PBL-SCID) mice. Human <b>xenoreactive</b> natural antibodies (XNA), of IgM and IgG subtypes, capable of binding to pig aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) were detected in the sera of hu-PBL-SCID by ELISA and flowcytometric methods. Western blot analysis of PAEC lysates showed that IgM and IgG XNA from hu-PBL-SCID recognized xenoantigens with similar molecular mass as those recognized by XNA from normal human serum (NHS). This result demonstrated that hu-PBL-SCID contained XNA representing the same repertoire {{as that of the}} NHS. XNA from NHS and hu-PBL-SCID were also able to induce intracellular Ca 2 + signals in cultured PAEC several fold above the basal level. This result revealed their functional similarity and demonstrated {{for the first time that}} XNA in the absence of C can activate PAEC, which may lead to the pathology of xenograft rejection. In vivo, PAEC transplanted under the kidney capsule of hu-PBL-SCID mice showed deposition of human IgM and mouse C. In summary, the present study demonstrates that hu-PBL-SCID can serve as a useful model to characterize innate immunity against xenograft...|$|E
40|$|Immunoglobulins {{regulate}} the complement system by activating complement on foreign surfaces and diverting reactive complement proteins away from autologous cell surfaces. Based on this model, we explored {{the ability of}} Ig to balance complement activation versus control in a pig-to-primate cardiac xenotransplantation model in which the binding of <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies of the recipient to graft blood vessels and the activation of complement cause hyperacute rejection. Human IgG added to human serum caused a dose-dependent decrease in deposition of iC 3 b, cytotoxicity, and heparan sulfate release when the serum was incubated with porcine endothelial cells. This decrease was not caused by alteration in antibody binding or consumption of complement but presumably reflected decreased formation of C 3 convertase on the endothelial cells. Infusion of purified human IgG into nonhuman primates prevented hyperacute rejection of porcine hearts transplanted into the primates. As expected, the transplants contained deposits of recipient Ig and C 1 q but not other complement components. The inhibition of complement on endothelial cell surfaces and in the xenotransplantation model supports the idea that IgG regulates the classical complement pathway and supports therapeutic use of that agent in humoral-mediated disease...|$|E
40|$|T-cell-deficient mice, either anti-thymocyte serum treated or nude mice, were immunized with hapten (4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -dinitrophenyl acetic acid, NNP) conjugates of syngeneic, allogeneic, or {{xenogeneic}} erythrocytes. Immunization with syngeneic conjugates led to {{a stronger}} anti-NNP response than immunization with allogeneic or xenogeneic conjugates. A study of congenic mouse strains suggested that a prerequisite for this effect was that immunogenic erythrocytes and responding animals shared H- 2 -controlled characteristics. F 1 hybrid erythrocyte conjugates injected into F 1 hybrid mice behaved like other syngeneic erythrocytes. The same erythrocyte conjugates injected into either parental strain induced a weak response indistinguishable from the response to allogeneic erythrocyte conjugates. Parental erythrocyte conjugates injected into F 1 mice induced an anti-NNP response that was {{significantly lower than the}} response to F 1 erythrocyte conjugates but significantly higher than the response to allogeneic conjugates. The response of normal mice to syngeneic erythrocytes was weaker than the response of T-cell-deficient mice, which could have been caused by suppressor T cells. Their response to allogeneic conjugates was higher than the response of T-cell-deficient mice and the response to xenogeneic conjugates higher still. This was probably due to allo- or <b>xenoreactive</b> helper cells...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: One major {{barrier to}} {{successful}} xenotransplantation is acute vascular rejection, a process pathologically characterized by microvascular thrombosis and diffuse fibrin deposition in transplant blood vessels. This pathologic picture {{may result from}} a disturbance in the coagulant or fibrinolytic pathways that regulate normal vascular patency. This study evaluated the regulation of fibrinolytic activity defined by tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 as it may exist {{in the setting of}} acute vascular rejection. MATERIALS AND METHODS, RESULTS: Serial biopsies from cardiac xenotransplants evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated progressive decreases in tissue plasminogen activator and increases in plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1. In vitro studies measuring fibrinolytic activity of cell culture medium from porcine aortic endothelial cells stimulated with human serum or autologous porcine serum revealed that human serum triggered as much as 93 % increase in antifibrinolytic activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that porcine vascular endothelial cells change toward an antifibrinolytic state following stimulation with human <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies and complement. The shift is at least partly explained by an increased ratio of plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 to tissue plasminogen activator, and is at least in part mediated by the activation of complement. This increased antifibrinolytic activity may contribute to the thrombotic diathesis seen in acute vascular rejection in pig-to-primate xenografts...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{transplantation}} {{of organs}} from other species into humans {{is considered to}} be a potential solution to the shortage of human donor organs. Organ transplantation from pig to human, however, results in hyperacute rejection, initiated by the binding of human natural antidonor antibody and complement. The major target antigen of this natural antibody is the terminal disaccharide Galα 1, 3 Gal, which is synthesized by Galβ 1, 4 GlcNAc α 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase. Here we review our current knowledge of this key enzyme. A better understanding of structure, enzyme properties, and expression pattern of α 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase has opened up several novel therapeutic approaches to prevent hyperacute vascular rejection. Cloning, and expression in vitro of the corresponding cDNA, has allowed to develop strategies to induce immune tolerance, and deplete or neutralize the natural <b>xenoreactive</b> antibody. Elucidation of the genomic structure has led to the production of transgenic animals that are lacking α 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase activity. A detailed knowledge of the enzyme properties has formed the basis of approaches to modify donor organ glycosylation by intracellular competition. Study of the expression pattern of α 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase has helped to understand the mechanism of hyperacute rejection in discordant xenotransplantation, and that of complement-mediated, natural immunity against interspecies transmission of retroviruses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The use {{of animals}} {{as a source}} of organs and tissues for {{xenotransplantation}} can overcome the growing shortage of human organ donors. However, the presence of <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies in humans directed against swine Gal antigen present on the surface of xenograft donor cells leads to the complement activation and immediate xenograft rejection as a consequence of hyperacute reaction. To pre-vent hyperacute rejection, it is possible to change the swine genome by a human gene modifying the set of donor’s cell surface proteins. The gene construct pGal-GFPBsd containing the human gene encoding!-galactosidase enzyme under the promoter of EF- 1 ! elongation factor ensuring systemic expres-sion was introduced by microinjection into a male pronucleus of the fertilised porcine oocyte. As a result, the founder male pig was obtained with the transgene mapping to chromosome 11 p 12. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed and the Southern analysis confirmed transgene integration estimating the approximate number of transgene copies as 16. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a reduction in the level of epitope Gal on the cell surface of cells isolated from F 0 and F 1 transgenic animals. The complement-mediated cytotoxicity assay showed increased viability of the transgenic cells in comparisonwith thewild-type, which confirmed the protective influence of α-galactosidase expression...|$|E
40|$|Rejection of renal and cardiac xenografts is {{initiated}} when natural antibodies of {{the recipient}} bind to donor endothelium, activating complement {{on the surface of}} endothelial cells. Pulmonary xenotransplants, however, reveal less evidence of antibody binding and complement activation and, in contrast to other xenografts, fare worse when the complement of the graft recipient is depleted. Accordingly, we asked whether distinct immunochemical reactions might occur after xenotransplantation of the lung and what implications such reactions might have for pulmonary pathophysiology. Analysis of serum from baboons after transplantation with porcine lungs revealed complexes containing baboon IgM and porcine von Willebrand factor. The baboon IgM in these complexes was specific for Galα 1 - 3 Gal. Immune complexes were also seen, albeit to a lesser extent, in the serum of kidney and heart xenotransplant recipients. Deposits of porcine von Willebrand factor and baboon C 3 were detected in livers and spleens of transplanted baboons. These results indicate pulmonary xenotransplantation eventuates in formation of immune complexes and in the deposition of those complexes at distant sites. Immune complex formation could explain the peculiar fate of <b>xenoreactive</b> antibodies after pulmonary xenotransplantation and might contribute to the pathophysiology of the lung and systemic changes not previously considered a complication of xenotransplantation...|$|E
40|$|Xenotransplantation is an {{innovative}} {{field of research}} {{with the potential to}} provide us with an alternative source of organs to face the severe shortage of human organ donors. For several reasons, pigs have been chosen as the most suitable source of organs and tissues for transplantation in humans. However, porcine xenografts undergo cellular immune responses representing a major barrier to their acceptance and normal functioning. Innate and adaptive xenogeneic immunity is mediated by both the recognition of xenogeneic tissue antigens and the lack of inhibition due to molecular cross-species incompatibilities of regulatory pathways. Therefore, the delivery of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) -dependent and related negative signals to control innate (NK cells, macrophages) and adaptive T and B cells might overcome cell-mediated xenogeneic immunity. The proof of this concept has already been achieved in vitro by the transgenic overexpression of human ligands of several inhibitory receptors in porcine cells resulting in their resistance against xenoreactivity. Consequently, several transgenic pigs expressing tissue-specific human ligands of inhibitory coreceptors (HLA-E, CD 47) or soluble competitors of costimulation (belatacept) have already been generated. The development of these robust and innovative approaches to modulate human anti-pig cellular immune responses, complementary to conventional immunosuppression, will help to achieve long-term xenograft survival. In this review, we will focus on the current strategies to enhance negative signaling pathways for the regulation of undesirable cell-mediated <b>xenoreactive</b> immune responses...|$|E
