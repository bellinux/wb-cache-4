The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), a well-vascularized extra-embryonic tissue located underneath the eggshell, has a successful history as a biological platform for the molecular analysis of cancer including viral oncogenesis, carcinogenesis, tumor <b>xenografting,</b> tumor angiogenesis, and cancer metastasis. Since the chicken embryo is naturally immunodeficient, the CAM readily supports the engraftment of both normal and tumor tissues.

Using a human fetal prostate xenograft model, researchers studied the effects of early exposure to estrogen with and without secondary estrogen and testosterone treatment. A xenograft model is a graft of tissue transplanted between organisms of different species. In this case, human tissue was transplanted into rats; therefore, there was no need to extrapolate from rodents to humans. Histopathological lesions, proliferation, and serum hormone levels were measured at various time-points after <b>xenografting.</b> At day 200, the xenograft that had been exposed to two treatments of estrogen showed the most severe changes. Additionally, researchers looked at key genes involved in prostatic glandular and stromal growth, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, hormone receptors, and tumor suppressors using a custom PCR array. Analysis of DNA methylation showed methylation differences in CpG sites of the stromal compartment after estrogen treatment. These variations in methylation are likely a contributing cause to the changes in the cellular events in the KEGG prostate cancer pathway that inhibit apoptosis and increase cell cycle progression that contribute to the development of cancer.|$|E

The freedom from reoperation rates for both graft types were determined. For morphologic study, the pathologic findings of 23 valves of 123 explanted Ionescu-Shiley pericardial <b>xenografts</b> with structural valve deterioration, nonstructural valve deterioration, or both were determined and compared with those of 20 explanted Carpentier-Edwards pericardial <b>xenografts</b> with structural valve deterioration, nonstructural valve deterioration, or both. Each pathologic finding was graded and assigned a score. Both types were matched for age at reoperation (50 - 75 years) and duration of valve function (8 - 11 years). Results: Freedom from reoperation caused by structural valve deterioration, nonstructural valve deterioration, or both was significantly better for Carpentier-Edwards pericardial <b>xenografts</b> than for Ionescu-Shiley pericardial <b>xenografts</b> at 8 years after the operation (Carpentier-Edwards pericardial xenografts: 91. 3 % vs Ionescu-Shiley pericardial xenografts: 71. 9 %, P =. 0061), but it was similar for both types at 12 years (Carpentier-Edwards pericardial xenografts: 43. 6 % vs Ionescu-Shiley pericardial xenografts: 43. 6 %, P =. 2865). No severe leaflet tears were seen among Carpentier-Edwards pericardial <b>xenografts.</b> The mean area percentage of tissue overgrowth was 15. 3 % in Carpentier-Edwards pericardial <b>xenografts</b> and 3. 4 % in Ionescu-Shiley pericardial <b>xenografts</b> (P =. 0001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{efficiency}} of two vitrification protocols to cryopreserve human preantral follicles {{with the use of}} a <b>xenografting</b> model. DESIGN: Pilot study. SETTING: Gynecology research unit in a university hospital. PATIENT(S) : Ovarian biopsies were obtained from seven women aged 30 - 41 years. INTERVENTION(S) : Ovarian tissue fragments were subjected to one of three cryopreservation protocols (slow freezing, vitrification protocol 1, and vitrification protocol 2) and xenografted for 1 week to nude mice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : The number of morphologically normal follicles after cryopreservation and grafting and fibrotic surface area were determined by histologic analysis. Apoptosis was assessed by the TUNEL method. Morphometric analysis of TUNEL-positive surface area also was performed. Follicle proliferation was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULT(S) : After <b>xenografting,</b> a difference was observed between the cryopreservation procedures applied. According to TUNEL analysis, both vitrification protocols showed better preservation of preantral follicles than the conventional freezing method. Moreover, histologic evaluation showed a significantly higher proportion of primordial follicles in vitrified (protocol 2) -warmed ovarian tissue than in frozen-thawed tissue. The proportion of growing follicles and fibrotic surface area was similar in all groups. CONCLUSION(S) : Vitrification procedures appeared to preserve not only the morphology and survival of preantral follicles after 1 week of <b>xenografting,</b> but also their ability to resume folliculogenesis.

The role of nude mice natural defences in the expression of HMCL <b>xenografting</b> phenotypes was studied. Sublethal whole body irradiation and silica pretreatment of recipients enabled poorly tumourigenic HMCL to grow in most animals without affecting their splenic NK activity.

Methods: Two experiments were performed with heterotopic transplantation models in 14 guinea pigs and 85 rats. So that the minimal dose of FK 506 for viable fresh <b>xenografts</b> could be determined, FK 506 was given in escalating doses (0, 1. 5, 2. 5, and 3. 5 mg/kg) for recipient animals after xenogeneic transplantation. With the goal of obtaining a long-term survival of the <b>xenografts,</b> the effect of cryopreservation on <b>xenografts</b> was assessed and thereafter different cycles of immunosuppression every third week were evaluated in fresh or cryopreserved <b>xenografts</b> in the second experiment. Results: An FK 506 dosage of more than 2. 5 mg/kg per day was much more effective than smaller dosages, as demonstrated by morphologic assessment. A higher dosage of FK 506 potentially delayed the rejection of <b>xenografts</b> and can thus maintain tracheal <b>xenograft</b> viability for less than 4 weeks in rat recipients. In experiment 2, the cryopreserved <b>xenografts</b> showed less histologic viability than fresh <b>xenografts</b> but greater patency of the lumen.

Methods: Baboons were treated with pretransplantation total lymphoid irradiation, cyclosporine A (INN: ciclosporin), and methotrexate. Orthotopic pig-to-baboon cardiac transplantations were performed after depletion of circulating xenoreactive natural antibody by pretransplantation donor organ hemoperfusion. Tissue samples were collected for immunologic and immunopathologic evaluation. Results: Pig cardiac <b>xenografts</b> survived more than 18 and 19 days without evidence of hyperacute rejection. Immunologic analysis of serum samples demonstrated that circulating xenoreactive natural antibody levels did not return to pretransplantation levels. The production of xenoreactive natural antibodies from the recipient's splenocytes was inhibited completely. Histologic examination of <b>xenografts</b> showed the feature of acute vascular rejection. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated infiltration of cardiac <b>xenografts</b> by large numbers of macrophages, small numbers of natural killer cells, and a few T cells. The infiltrating macrophages also showed expression of interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor. Diffuse deposition of immunoglobulin G, C 1 Q, C 3, and fibrin on <b>xenograft</b> vasculature was observed. Interleukin- 2 expression was not found in rejected cardiac <b>xenografts.</b> <b>Xenograft</b> endothelial cells also showed evidence of activation (expression of cytokines interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor).

Certain structural and functional features of the original human tumours, including carcinoembryonic antigen and epithelial membrane antigen, continue to be expressed by the resulting <b>xenografts.</b> Stromal responses such as elastosis and oestrogen-receptor activity were lost by the <b>xenografts.</b> No metastases were detected in tumour-bearing mice. This study suggests that <b>xenografts</b> may have some value in experimental pathology as one type of model of human breast carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Spermatogonial {{stem cells}} (SSC) {{exist on the}} {{basement}} membrane of the seminiferous tubules in the testis throughout a male animal?s life. These cells self-renew to maintain a stem cell population while producing daughter cells that differentiate into sperm. Because of their relatively undistinguishable morphology, very little was known about them until testis <b>xenografting</b> and spermatogonial stem cell transplantation (SSCT) were developed. Both technologies are promising tools to preserve male genetic information {{as well as to}} study the characteristics of SSC. In this dissertation, I investigate testis <b>xenografting</b> and SSCT in cats and dogs, which are important animal models for biomedical research. First, I examine the effect of donor age on spermatogenesis in feline xenografts and the ability of xenograft-derived sperm to support embryo development. In addition, I compare the outcomes of <b>xenografting</b> using testis tissue from two additional species of carnivore, dogs and ferrets. My studies indicate that the optimal donor age was just prior to onset of puberty and xenograft sperm had poor fertility compared to control sperm, necessitating further investigation. Furthermore, the comparative study demonstrates differences in the ability of testicular tissue from different species of carnivore to establish spermatogenesis following testicular <b>xenografting.</b> Second, I describe my development of all three major steps of SSCT in the cat and dog including depleting endogenous male germ cells in recipients, isolating male germ cells from donors and injecting the isolated germ cells. My studies provide a foundation to perform SSCT in the cat, and I was successful at performing SSCT in the dog. Finally, I examine multiple steps to develop transgenesis in dogs, which will enhance their utility as genetic models. This study includes 1) methodology for the accurate staging of dog blastocysts, 2) attempted derivation of canine embryonic stem cells (cESC), 3) manipulation of blastocysts, and 4) transfer of canine embryos. Our results demonstrate that canine transgenesis mediated via cESC and/or SSCT are technically feasible. These studies examine the potential of stem cell-based technologies in the preservation of male genetic information and biomedical research. In addition, my work provides a foundation to achieve transgenesis in the dog...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} used animal models of cultured keratinocytes autografting is based on <b>xenografting</b> of human keratinocytes to the rat or athymic mice, {{immunological}} neutral recipient that acts as biological carrier. It could be studied in this model many facts that occur after transplant without the ethical aspect in the clinical study. The proposition of the experimental model {{is related to the}} sequence of the total or partial skin transplant, as autografting or <b>xenografting,</b> cultured or not, to the back of athymic mice. The model presents the possibility of study in vivo athymic animal, when the in vivo study in anima nobili is not ethical. It permits the <b>xenografting</b> evaluation of cultured cells graft or of the genetically modified cells and of the association of the cultured cells and the dermal substitutes, the composite grafts, and of the autografting. Um dos modelos animais mais utilizados de auto-enxertia de queratinócitos cultivados é baseado em xeno-enxerto de queratinócitos humanos em rato atímico, um receptor imunologicamente neutro que atua como carreador biológico. Muitos fatos podem ser estudados nesse modelo que acontecem após o transplante sem os aspectos éticos do estudo clínico. A proposição do modelo experimental esta relacionada a sequência do transplante de pele parcial ou total como auto-enxerto ou xeno-enxerto, cultivado ou não, no dorso do rato atímico. O modelo apresenta a possibilidade do estudo in vivo do animal atímico, quando o estudo in vivo em anima nobili não é considerado ético. Isso permite a avaliação do xeno-enxerto de células humanas normais ou modificadas geneticamente modificadas cultivadas e a associação de células cultivadas e substitutes dérmicos, de enxertos compostos e de auto-enxerto...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: Malignant {{mesothelioma}} is an aggressive, therapy-resistant tumor. Mesothelioma cells {{may assume}} an epithelioid or a sarcomatoid phenotype, and presence of sarcomatoid cells predicts poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated differentiation of mesothelioma cells in a <b>xenograft</b> model, where mesothelioma cells of both phenotypes were induced to form tumors in SCID mice. Methods: <b>Xenografts</b> were established and thoroughly characterized using a comprehensive immunohistochemical panel, array comparative genomic hybridization of chromosome 3, fluorescent {{in situ hybridization}} and electron microscopy. Results: Epithelioid and sarcomatoid cells gave rise to <b>xenografts</b> of similar epithelioid morphology. While sarcomatoid-derived <b>xenografts</b> had higher growth rates, the morphology and expression of differentiation-related markers was similar between <b>xenografts</b> derived from both phenotypes. Array comparative genomic hybridization showed a convergent genotype for both <b>xenografts,</b> resembling the original aggressive sarcomatoid cell sub-line. Conclusions: Human mesothelioma <b>xenografts</b> from sarcomatoid and epithelioid phenotypes converged to a similar differentiation state, and genetic analyses suggested that clonal selection in the mouse microenvironment was a major contributing factor. This thoroughly characterized animal model {{can be used for}} further studies of molecular events underlying tumor cell differentiation...|$|R

In autoradiograms, we observed an overall higher radioactivity signal in Raji <b>xenografts</b> under baseline than under blockade conditions with a focal distribution pattern (Fig.  2 d). The control NCI-H 69 <b>xenograft</b> displayed a low radiotracer accumulation under baseline and blockade conditions indicating a non-specific uptake of 111 In-DOTA-belatacept that was comparable to the signals observed in Raji <b>xenografts</b> under blockade conditions (Fig.  2 d).|$|R
40|$|Leukocytosis {{sometimes}} accompanies {{malignant neoplasms}} {{in the absence}} of infection. It is thought that the production of colony-stimulating factor by neoplasms is the most potent cause of tumour-induced leukocytosis; several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this. We examined 155 human tumour <b>xenografts</b> established in nude mice, and found that 17 of the <b>xenografts</b> induced remarkable leukocytosis (> 15, 000 microliters- 1) in nude rats. We examined granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) production by the <b>xenografts</b> to study the mechanisms underlying this tumour-induced leukocytosis. Ten of the 17 <b>xenografted</b> human tumours appeared to express the G-CSF gene. Serum G-CSF increased, to concentrations of 179 - 37, 218 pg ml- 1, in host animals transplanted with the ten <b>xenografts</b> expressing the G-CSF gene transcripts. The biological activity of serum G-CSF also increased, to concentrations of 206 - 9, 074 pg ml- 1, in the host animals transplanted with the ten <b>xenografts.</b> Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated G-CSF production at the cellular level in three of the ten <b>xenografts.</b> These results suggested that the production of G-CSF is a common event in human tumour <b>xenografts</b> associated with leukocytosis, but that factors other than G-CSF are also likely to be involved. Leukocytosis induced by neoplasms seems to be a heterogeneous and complex disorder...|$|R
