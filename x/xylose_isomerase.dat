40|$|Hydrogen {{biofuels}} {{have been}} proposed as an environmentally-friendly and renewable energy substitute for petroleum-based fossil fuels. One species of bacteria capable of degrading cellulosic materials and producing vast amounts of hydrogen is Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus. This species {{is one of the}} more well-studied thermophilic hydrogen producers as it can utilize a broad range of substrates and produce near theoretical maximum amounts of hydrogen by dark fermentation. Another species, Caldicellulosiruptor kristjanssonii, had its genome recently published but there is limited research done on this bacterium. It is studied here because of its ability to withstand even higher temperatures than C. saccharolyticus. It was found that both organisms were able to utilize glucose, xylose, cellobiose, Avicel, CMC, switchgrass, and xylan as sole carbon sources, with the exception of C. kristjanssonii which could only grow on CMC with yeast extract supplementation. Yeast extract was also determined to decrease, if not eliminate, the lag phase of growth for both organisms though growth was possible without yeast extract with the supplementation of a vitamin solution. C. saccharolyticus grew the best on xylose with cell densities reaching 2. 5 × 10 ^ 8 cells/mL while C. kristjanssonii grew the best on cellobiose, reaching cell densities of about 3. 2 × 10 ^ 8 cells/mL. Growth was not hindered on modified media containing 2 g/L soluble sugars or 4 g/L insoluble polymers, but it did have a detrimental effect on the growth rate and hydrogen yields, although carbon balances were near 100 %. Enzyme assays were performed to study the native cellulase activities of these organisms while only recombinant enzyme assays have been done previously. Greater exoglucanase, endoglucanase, and xylanase activity was observed in the supernatant portion of the cultures compared to the cell-free extracts, suggesting that cellulases are secreted into the extracellular environment. Generally, the cellulases had the highest specific activity with the corresponding growth substrate, but it is noteworthy that growth on Avicel induced the synthesis of xylanases in C. saccharolyticus. Proteomics and RNA-sequencing were done to confirm the expression of enzymes previously annotated in the genomes as well as to examine metabolic regulation when grown in different conditions. Remarkably, growth on glucose and xylan stimulated flagella production even though both organisms are reportedly non-motile. These flagellar proteins are thought to be associated with substrate attachment rather than motility. Moreover, many glycoside hydrolase proteins were upregulated according to the growth substrates the organisms were subjected to and several genes encoding ABC transporters (Csac_ 2504, Csac_ 2506, Csac_ 0681 and Calkr_ 2435) were found to have broad substrate specificities. Proteomic analyses revealed that <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerases,</b> an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, were upregulated not only in growth conditions with pentose sugars, but also in cultures grown on hexose sugars. This finding indicates that the hexose sugars are being converted into fructose, facilitating a carbohydrate preference. Enzymes in the EMP pathway including phosphofructokinase (Csac_ 2441 and Calkr_ 1980) were upregulated when grown on glucose compared to other conditions, as expected.

Both share an acid residue Glutamic acid 216 of the enzyme that bridges the two cations. Two basic amino acids surround the negative charged ligands to neutralize them. The second cavity faces the metal cavity and both cavities share the same access route.

The <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase</b> from Ampullariella sp. strain 3876 is similar in size to other bacterial xylose isomerases and has limited amino acid sequence homology to the available sequences from E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Streptomyces violaceus-ruber. In all cases yet studied, the bacterial gene for xylulose kinase is downstream from the gene for <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase.</b> We present evidence suggesting that in Ampullariella sp. strain 3876 these genes are similarly arranged...|$|E
40|$|An alkaliphilic, {{thermophilic}} Bacillus sp. (NCIM 59) produced extracellular <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase</b> at pH 10 and 50 °C {{by using}} xylose or wheat bran as the carbon source. The distribution of <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase</b> {{as a function}} of growth in comparison with distributions of extra- and intracellular marker enzymes such as xylanase and β-galactosidase revealed that <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase</b> was truly secreted as an extracellular enzyme and was not released because of sporulation or lysis. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration, preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ion-exchange chromatography. The molecular weight of <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase</b> was estimated to be 160, 000 by gel filtration and 50, 000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating the presence of three subunits. The enzyme is most active at pH 8. 0 and with incubation at 85 °C for 20 min. Divalent metal ions Mg 2 +, Co 2 +, and Mn 2 + were required for maximum activity of the enzyme. The Km values for D-xylose and D-glucose at 80 °C and pH 7. 5 were 6. 66 and 142 mM, respectively, while Kcat values were 2. 3 × 102 s- 1 and 0. 5 × 102 s- 1, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase</b> gene from Bacillus subtilis was cloned from a genomic BamH 1 library by {{complementation}} of an isomerase defective Escherichia coli strain {{as previously}} described. The ATG initiation codon is {{preceded by a}} Shine-Dalgarno sequence and two hexamers being characteristic for the promoter region of Bacillus genes. The structural gene consists of 1320 base pairs, thus coding for a polypeptide chain of 440 amino acids with a molecular weight of 49 680. The polypeptide primary structure shows over 50 % homology {{to that of the}} E. coli <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase...</b>|$|E
40|$|Transformation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by yeast {{expression}} plasmids {{bearing the}} Escherichia coli <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase</b> gene leads to {{production of the}} protein. Western blotting (immunoblotting) experiments show that immunoreactive protein chains which comigrate with the E. coli enzyme {{are made in the}} transformant strains and that the amount produced parallels the copy number of the plasmid. When comparable amounts of immunologically cross-reactive <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase</b> protein made in E. coli or S. cerevisiae were assayed for enzymatic activity, however, the yeast protein was at least 10 (3) -fold less active...|$|E
40|$|A key {{challenge}} in the successful treatment of Acanthamoeba infections {{is its ability to}} transform into a dormant cyst form that is resistant to physiological conditions and pharmacological therapies, resulting in recurrent infections. The carbohydrate linkage analysis of cyst walls of Acanthamoeba castellanii showed variously linked sugar residues, including xylofuranose/xylopyranose, glucopyranose, mannopyranose, and galactopyranose. Here, it is shown that exogenous xylose significantly reduced A. castellanii differentiation in encystation assays (P[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 05 using paired t test, one-tailed distribution). Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) probes against <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase</b> and cellulose synthase, as well as specific inhibitors, the findings revealed that <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase</b> and cellulose synthase activities are crucial in the differentiation of A. castellanii. Inhibition of both enzymes using siRNA against <b>xylose</b> <b>isomerase</b> and cellulose synthase but not scrambled siRNA attenuated A. castellanii metamorphosis, as demonstrated by the arrest of encystation of A. castellanii. Neither inhibitor nor siRNA probes had any effect on the viability and extracellular proteolytic activities of A. castellanii...|$|E
