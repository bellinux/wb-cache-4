Reactive oxygen species, especially superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, are important signalling molecules in cardiovascular cells. Enhanced superoxide production increases nitric oxide inactivation and leads to an accumulation of peroxynitrites and hydrogen peroxide. Reactive oxygen species participate in growth, apoptosis and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, in the modulation of endothelial function, including endothelium-dependent relaxation and expression of proinflammatory phenotype, and in the modification of the extracellular matrix. All these events play important roles in vascular diseases such as hypertension, suggesting that the sources of reactive oxygen species and the signalling pathways that theymodifymay represent important therapeutic targets. Potential sources of vascular superoxide production include NADPH-dependent <b>oxidases,</b> <b>xanthine</b> <b>oxidases,</b> lipoxygenases, mitochondrial oxidases and nitricoxide synthases.

The evolutionary reasons for this loss of urate conversion to allantoin remain the topic of active speculation. The antioxidant effects of uric acid have led researchers to suggest this mutation was beneficial to early primates and humans.

40|$|Background—Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{is associated}} with an increased risk of stroke due almost exclusively to emboli from left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombi. Recently, we reported that AF was associated with endocardial dysfunction, limited to the left atrium (LA) and LAA and manifest as reduced nitric oxide (NO �) production and increased expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1. We hypothesized that reduced LAA NO � levels observed in AF may be associated with increased superoxide (O 2) production. Methods and Results—After a week of AF induced by rapid atrial pacing in pigs, O 2 production from acutely isolated heart tissue was measured by 2 independent techniques, electron spin resonance and superoxide dismutase–inhibitable cytochrome C reduction assays. Compared with control animals with equivalent ventricular heart rates, basal O 2 production was increased 2. 7 -fold (P� 0. 01) and 3. 0 -fold (P� 0. 02) in the LA and LAA, respectively. A similar 3. 0 -fold (P� 0. 01) increase in LAA O 2 production was observed using a cytochrome C reduction assay. The increases could not be explained by changes in atrial total superoxide dismutase activity.

40|$|According to the {{procedure}} pr e paring the nitrate reductase of cattle liver, the fowl liver enzyme was partially purified from the homogenate by repeated fractionation with ammonium sulfate and following treatment with Ca-phosphate gel. This preparation was very {{soluble in water}} and buffer making a clear pale yellow solution and could be preserved for a considerably long time in cold when it was kept moist after removing water {{as far as possible}} by means of an aspirator. However, the enzyme was denatured and lost its solubility as well as activity, if it was further dried in vacuo. As cattle liver enzyme, acetaldehyde was indispensable as a hydrogen donor for the enzymatic reduction of nitrate and the enhancement of the activity was provoked by some ferrous salts. Although this implies the rationality of the aldehyde oxidase hypothesis concerning the principle of the nitrate reductase, a proportionality between both activities of the nitrate reductase and the aldehyde oxidase could not be observed with many preparations which were prepared by the same procedure but from different livers. The final concentration of 2 x 10 ^- 2 M of nitrate and acetaldehyde was most suitable for the estimation of the activity. The direct relationship of the activity to the dose of the enzyme and the reaction time was also established. The reductase activity with and without ferrous ion was inhibited by NaN_ 3, thiourea, 8 -hydroxyquinoline, EDTA, KCN, monoiod acetate, PCMB and Cu salts, which might suggest the participation of metal and SH group in the enzymatic nitrate reduction. However, some of the properties of the fowl enzyme were different from those of cattle. There were two peaks in the pH-activity curve, at pH about 4. 5 and about 5. 8, though the later agreed with the optimum pH of the crude liver homogenate {{as well as that of}} the cattle liver enzyme. The reduction was carried out most actively at 60 ℃ higher than the optimum temperature of the cattle enzyme. Furthermore, the reductase of the fowl liver exhibited a peculiar absorption spectrum which have a plateau from 250 to 280 ma, contrary to that of cattle having a peak at 262 m/ 1. On the other hand, the spectra of both enzymes in a visible range were approximately similar to each other, presenting a maximum at 405 mμ. In place of acetaldehyde, flavin fraction of liver, raw DPN solution from yeast, and mitochondria of liver could conjugate with the nitrate reductase of fowl liver as a hydrogen donating system. Moreover, dialisable substances of the liver extract could also function as an immediate substrate of the enzyme. Since the substances could be separated into 4 fractions and all these fractions had the ability to bring about the reduction of nitrate by the reductase, there might be at least 4 kinds of the inherent hydrogen donors in the liver tissue. As described above, the nitrate reductase was active in the acid media too. However, the reaction mixture was clarified at pH 5. 0 producing a coagulated deposit which became now almost insoluble in buffer of neutrality. Concerning both clear supernatant and suspension of precipitate, the activities of the aldehyde and <b>xanthine</b> <b>oxidases</b> as well as nitrate reductase could be established. The activity of the precipitate was higher than that of the supernatant, while pH-activity curves of both fractions were similar to each other and to that of the original enzyme; there were two optimum pHs. However, the absorption spectra were quite different. The extinction at 405 m/. c was maintained in the spectrum of the supernatant but lost in that of the precipitate which had been dissolved in weak alkaline solution. On the contrary, the plateau in ultraviolet range remained in the later though it was narrowed, whereas it was lost but a peak at 270 mp was appeared in the former. Similary, the enzyme was divided into two fractions, the clear supernatant and the precipitate, by heating, for example at 60 ° or 70 ℃ for 10 min. In this case too, both fractions had the activities of the nitrate reductase and the aldehyde and <b>xanthine</b> <b>oxidases.</b> However, the activities of the supernatant were higher than that of the precipitate, in opposition to the case of acid treatment. Furthermore, it was found that the absorption spectra of these fractions differ from one another. Hence, at any rate, it is supposed that there might be some kinds of enzymes which accompany both activities of the aldehyde and <b>xanthine</b> <b>oxidases</b> as well as nitrate reductase. 生体組織には種々の酵素の外にこれ等に関与する多くの物質が含まれていて互に影響しながら組織特有の反応系を形成している. 従つて組織内に於ける酵素反応の特性を知るには切片乃至ホモゼネートを用いて研究する事が好ましく従来は組織の磨砕懸濁液を 3000 　r. p. m. で 5 ～ 10 分遠心分離して料大部を除いたホモゼネートを酵素液とした. ?と廿日鼠或いは牛の肝臓による硝酸還元酵素作用には水素供与系としての種々の脱水素酵素との共軛係及びアルデヒドの影響若しくはプリン類の反応阻害等に多少の差異が観察された. 特に後者は硝酸還元酵素の本体に関するアルデヒド乃至キサンチン酸化酵素説や哺乳類で尿素,鳥類では尿酸を最終生成物とするプリン代謝系の粗異等と関連して興味が深い. 併しこれ迄の経験では肝臓組織内に含まれている低分子物質の種類,量等によって支配される反応系が動物でそれぞれ異なつているために硝酸還元酵素作用にも影響して間接的に若干の相異を惹ぎ起し,観察された差異が醇素の本質そのものに基くものであるかどうかは疑問であつた. 一方牛肝酵素の部分精製を一行いその性質を報告した. 特に本酵素がアルデヒド及びキサンチン酸化酵素と密接な関係を持ちこれ等の酵素活性は常に伴われるがその作用力は必ずしも平行するものではない事を観察した. この事は?肝透析ホモゼネートについても略ゝ同様であるが酵素そのものの性質をより明確にするために今回は牛肝の場合に傲つて精製した酵素標品について実験した...|$|R

With the exception of bacterial Mo-nitrogenase, where Mo is a constituent of the FeMo-cofactor, Mo is bound to a pterin, thus forming the molybdenum cofactor Moco, which in different variants is the active compound at the catalytic site of all other Mo-containing enzymes. In eukaryotes, the most prominent Mo-enzymes are nitrate reductase, sulfite <b>oxidase,</b> <b>xanthine</b> dehydrogenase, aldehyde <b>oxidase,</b> and the mitochondrial amidoxime reductase. The biosynthesis of Moco involves the complex interaction of six proteins and is a process of four steps, which also requires iron, ATP and copper.

The cell utilizes this in many energetically difficult oxidation reactions such as dehydrogenation of a C-C bond to an alkene. FAD-dependent proteins function in a large variety of metabolic pathways including electron transport, DNA repair, nucleotide biosynthesis, beta-oxidation of fatty acids, amino acid catabolism, as well as synthesis of other cofactors such as CoA, CoQ and heme groups. [...] One well-known reaction is part of the citric acid cycle (also known as the TCA or Krebs cycle); succinate dehydrogenase (complex II in the electron transport chain) requires covalently bound FAD to catalyze the oxidation of succinate to fumarate by coupling it with the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol. The high-energy electrons from this oxidation are stored momentarily by reducing FAD to FADH2. FADH2 then reverts to FAD, sending its two high-energy electrons through the electron transport chain; the energy in FADH2 is enough to produce 1.5 equivalents of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. There are also redox flavoproteins that non-covalently bind to FAD like Acetyl-CoA-dehydrogenases which are involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids like leucine (isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase), isoleucine, (short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), valine (isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase), and lysine (glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase).

Study of the distribution of either fusion proteins in the secreted droplets showed that the membrane forms crescent-like and blebbing structures, thus confirming earlier electron microscopic data, which suggested that the milk-lipid droplet membrane undergoes structural rearrangement after secretion...|$|R
