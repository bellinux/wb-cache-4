40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of <b>xipamide</b> on plasma alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide and the renin-aldosterone-kallikrein system in twelve healthy men, using a {{double-blind}} cross-over design. After a run-in period on placebo for 1 week the subjects were treated with either placebo (n = 6) or <b>xipamide</b> 20 mg once daily (n = 6) for 16 weeks and were then switched to the alternative medication for another 16 weeks. The plasma concentration of alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide fell after 1 week of <b>xipamide</b> administration and increased during prolonged <b>xipamide</b> administration but remained suppressed. The changes in plasma alpha-ANP observed after 1 week of <b>xipamide</b> were negatively correlated with the changes in haematocrit and haemoglobin. Plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone concentration (PAC), and urinary excretion of aldosterone and kallikrein increased after 1 week of <b>xipamide</b> administration, levelled off during the second and fourth weeks, but remained elevated during further prolonged <b>xipamide</b> administration for 16 weeks. The xipamide-induced changes in PRA and PAC were positively correlated with {{the changes in the}} haematocrit and haemoglobin.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a new potent diuretic, <b>xipamide,</b> was evaluated {{in the treatment of}} patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.

The intra-erythrocyte and intra-leucocyte Na+ concentration was increased by 11 and 7 %, respectively, during <b>xipamide</b> administration, while the intracellular K+ concentration was decreased by 3 and 4 %, respectively. No significant effect of <b>xipamide</b> could however be demonstrated on the ouabain-sensitive, bumetanide-sensitive or ouabain-bumetanide-resistant 86 Rb uptake and on the maximal 3 H-ouabain binding in erythrocytes and leucocytes.

This retrospective analysis shows the efficacy of diuretic combination therapy with furosemide and <b>xipamide</b> {{in the treatment of}} 184 hospitalised candidates waiting for orthotopic heart transplantation. In comparison the dose of furosemide could be reduced from 159 mg in monotherapy (mean daily dose) to 41 mg, if combined with <b>xipamide</b> (32 mg).

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization of metal complexes of Schiff base derived from <b>xipamide,</b> a diuretic drug. The bidentate ligand {{is derived from the}} inserted condensation of 5 -aminosulfonyl- 4 -chloro-N- 2, 6 -dimethyl phenyl- 2 -hydroxybenzamide (<b>Xipamide)</b> with salicylaldehyde in a 1 [*]:[*] 1 molar ratio. Using this bidentate ligand, complexes of Hg(II), Zn(II), and VO(IV) with general formula ML 2 have been synthesized. The synthesized complexes were characterized by several techniques using molar conductance, elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, FT-IR spectroscopy, electronic spectra, mass spectra, and particle size analysis. The elemental analysis data suggest the stoichiometry to be 1 [*]:[*] 2 [M[*]:[*]L]. All the complexes are nonelectrolytic in nature as suggested by molar conductance measurements. Infrared spectral data indicate the coordination between the ligand and the central metal ion through deprotonated phenolic oxygen and azomethine nitrogen atoms. Spectral studies suggest tetrahedral geometry for Hg(II), Zn(II) complexes, and square pyramidal geometry for VO(IV) complex. The pure drug, synthesized ligand, and metal complexes were screened for their antifungal activities against Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus. The ligand and its Hg(II) and VO(IV) complexes were screened for their diuretic activity too...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose Loop diuretics {{are widely}} used to inhibit the Na+, K+, 2 Cl- co-transporter, but they also inhibit the cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl - channel. Here, we investigated the mechanism of CFTR inhibition by loop diuretics and explored the effects of chemical structure on channel blockade. Experimental Approach Using the patch-clamp technique, we tested the effects of bumetanide, furosemide, piretanide and <b>xipamide</b> on recombinant wild-type human CFTR. Key Results When added to the intracellular solution, loop diuretics inhibited CFTR Cl- currents with potency approaching that of glibenclamide, a widely used CFTR blocker with some structural similarity to loop diuretics. To begin to study the kinetics of channel blockade, we examined the time dependence of macroscopic current inhibition following a hyperpolarizing voltage step. Like glibenclamide, piretanide blockade of CFTR was time and voltage dependent. By contrast, furosemide blockade was voltage dependent, but time independent. Consistent with these data, furosemide blocked individual CFTR Cl- channels with 'very fast' speed and drug-induced blocking events overlapped brief channel closures, whereas piretanide inhibited individual channels with 'intermediate' speed and drug-induced blocking events were distinct from channel closures. Conclusions and Implications Structure-activity analysis of the loop diuretics suggests that the phenoxy group present in bumetanide and piretanide, but absent in furosemide and <b>xipamide,</b> might account for the different kinetics of channel block by locking loop diuretics within the intracellular vestibule of the CFTR pore. We conclude that loop diuretics are open-channel blockers of CFTR with distinct kinetics, affected by molecular dimensions and lipophilicity...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin {{receptor}} blockers are {{the basis}} of renoprotection therapy in chronic kidney disease. Parallel to decrease of glomerular filtration rate, there {{is an increase in}} the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and the number of functio­ning nephrons reduces, which requires a change of treatment regimen. Reducing the risk of cardiovascular events on the background of increased hypertension probably dictates the need for a priority administration of sympatholytics, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers withdrawal.

40|$|AbstractThe {{diuretic}} agents bumetanide, <b>xipamide,</b> indapamide, {{and related}} compounds were investigated {{in order to}} determine the effect of different ionization sites on their collisionally activated dissociation and the corresponding fragmentation pathways. Therefore, analytes were selectively alkylated, and structural analogues as well as deuterium labeled compounds synthesized, which contain a reduced number of ionizable hydrogen atoms. Thus, specific hydrogen abstractions and their correlated dissociation routes of the negatively charged molecules were eliminated, providing evidence for the influence of the location of ionization on product ion spectra. Fragment ions such as m/z 78 indicate ionization at the commonly present sulfamoyl residue of diuretics but does not exclude additional ionization sites. Product ion spectra of the investigated diuretic agents proved to be composed by fragmentations initiated from different hydrogen abstractions. Moreover, the generation of radical anions by collision-activated dissociation of even-electron precursor ions was observed, the generation of which is discussed by proposed fragmentation pathways...|$|E

Critical factors are identified in a screening design (a 26 – 2 fractional factorial design), and afterwards, optimal conditions for the separation are reached by means of an optimization design (a 22 + 2 × 2 + k central composite design).
