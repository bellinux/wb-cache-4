5000|$|Horizontal cloth FP {{shutters}} {{are normally}} limited to 1/1000 s maximum speed {{because of the}} difficulties in precisely timing extremely narrow slits and the unacceptable distortion resulting from a relatively slow wipe speed. Their maximum flash synchronization speed is also limited because the slit is fully open only to the film gate (36 mm wide or wider) and able to be flash exposed up to 1/60 s <b>X-synchronization</b> (nominal; 18 ms = 1/55 s actual maximum; in reality, a 40 mm slit allow for variance gives 1/50 s stop slow).

5000|$|... 1960: Konica F (Japan): first SLR with 1/2000 {{second and}} 1/125 second flash <b>X-synchronization</b> focal-plane shutter. Modern focal-plane {{shutters}} are dual curtain traveling slit shutters. They provide faster shutter speeds by timing the second shutter curtain to close sooner {{after the first}} curtain opens and narrowing the slit [...] "wiping" [...] the exposure on the film, instead of moving the curtains faster across film gate, because they are too fragile to survive the necessary accelerative shocks. Long wipe times can cause cartoonish distortion of very fast moving objects instead of truly freezing their motion. (The use of leaning in illustration {{to give the impression}} of speed is a caricature of the distortion caused by the slow wiping FP shutters of Graflex large format SLRs from {{the first half of the}} 20th century.) Unacceptable distortion (as well as difficulties in precisely timing very narrow slits) had stalled traditional cloth horizontal-travel FP shutters for 35 mm cameras at 1/1000 sec. and 1/60 sec. X-sync for decades. The F's Hi-Synchro shutter provided faster speeds by having its metal blades travel vertically, i.e. along the shorter side of the 24Ã—36 mm frame. In 1982, the Nikon FM2 (Japan) reached 1/4000 sec. (and 1/200 sec. flash X-sync) with a vertical-travel FP shutter using honeycomb pattern etched titanium foil blades, stronger and lighter than plain stainless steel. This allowed quicker shutter-curtain travel time (3.6 milliseconds, about half of earlier vertical, metal bladed shutters) and thereby truly faster shutter speeds. The Nikon FE2 (Japan), with an improved version of this shutter, boosted X-sync speed to 1/250 sec. (3.3 ms curtain travel time) in 1983. The fastest FP shutter ever used in a film camera was the 1/12,000 sec. (1/300 sec. X-sync; 1.8 ms curtain travel time) duralumin and carbon fiber bladed one introduced by the Minolta Maxxum 9xi (Japan) in 1992.|$|E
