25|$|Almost all {{shoulder}} dislocations are downwards (inferior) and of these, 95% are in {{a forward}} direction. Clinically this {{is referred to as}} an anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint. Not only does the arm appear out of position when the shoulder dislocates, but the dislocation also produces pain. Muscle spasms may increase the intensity of pain. Swelling and bruising normally develop, and in some cases there may be numbness and muscle weakness. Problems seen with a dislocated shoulder are tearing of the ligaments or tendons reinforcing the joint capsule and, less commonly, nerve damage. Doctors usually diagnose a dislocation by a physical examination, but <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> are taken to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out a related fracture and other complications. <b>X</b> <b>rays</b> are also taken after relocation to ensure it is in the correct place.|$|E

25|$|X-rays make up X-radiation, {{a form of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×1016 Hz to 3×1019 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning Röntgen radiation, after the German scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it X-radiation to signify an unknown type of radiation.

25|$|Several {{experimental}} studies, {{which use}} heavy ion beams simulating space radiation, provide constructive {{evidence of the}} CNS risks from space radiation. First, exposure to HZE nuclei at low doses (<50 cGy) significantly induces neurocognitive deficits, such as learning and behavioral changes as well as operant reactions in the mouse and rat. Exposures to equal or higher doses of low-LET radiation (e.g., gamma or <b>X</b> <b>rays)</b> do not show similar effects. The threshold of performance deficit following exposure to HZE nuclei depends on both the physical characteristics of the particles, such as linear energy transfer (LET), and the animal age at exposure. A performance deficit {{has been shown to}} occur at doses that are similar to the ones that will occur on a Mars mission (<0.5 Gy). The neurocognitive deficits with the dopaminergic nervous system are similar to aging and appear to be unique to space radiation. Second, exposure to HZE disrupts neurogenesis in mice at low doses (<1 Gy), showing a significant dose-related reduction of new neurons and oligodendrocytes in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Third, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neuronal precursor cells arise following exposure to HZE nuclei and protons at low dose, and can persist for several months. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents can possibly reduce these changes. Fourth, neuroinflammation arises from the CNS following exposure to HZE nuclei and protons. In addition, age-related genetic changes increase the sensitivity of the CNS to radiation.|$|E

Neutron and <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> imaging provide complementary information for precisely identifying the three phases silica sand, air, and water of a compacted sand specimen that is partially saturated. Neutron tomography provides high contrast of the water phase, whereas <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> tomography provides high contrast of the silica sand phase due to different fundamental interaction mechanisms of neutron and <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> with matters. <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> interacts with the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus, whereas neutron radiation interacts with the nucleus of an atom.

40|$|The <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> luminosities of early-type {{galaxies are}} {{correlated}} with their optical (e. g., blue) luminosities (L sub X approx. L sub B exp 1. 6), but the <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> luminosities exhibit considerable scatter {{for a given}} optical luminosity L sub B. This dispersion in <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> luminosity {{is much greater than}} the dispersion of other properties of early-type galaxies (for a given L sub B), such as luminosity scale-length, velocity dispersion, color, and metallicity. Here, researchers consider several possible sources for the dispersion in <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> luminosity. Some of the scatter in <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> luminosity may result from stellar population variations between galaxies with similar L sub B. Since the <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> emitting gas is from accumulated stellar mass loss, the L sub X dispersion may be due to variations in integrated stellar mass loss rates. Another possible cause of the L sub X dispersion may be variations in the amount of cool material in the galaxies; cool gas may act as an energy sink for the hot gas. Infrared emission may be used to trace such cool material, so researchers look for a correlation between the infrared emission and the <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> emission of early-type galaxies at fixed L sub B. Velocity dispersion variations between galaxies of similar L sub B may also contribute to the L sub X dispersion. The most likely a priori source of the dispersion in L sub X is probably the varying amount of ram-pressure stripping in a range of galaxy environments. The hot gaseous halos of early-type galaxies can be stripped in encounters with other galaxies or with ambient cluster gas if the intracluster gas is sufficiently dense. Researchers find that the most likely cause of dispersion in the <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> properties of early type galaxies is probably the ram-pressure stripping of gaseous halos from galaxies.
