50|$|The Carolina Sandhills {{region is}} {{characterized}} by <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> community vegetation dominated by pine treesMuch of the Carolina Sandhills is known for an ecosystem of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and wiregrass (Aristida stricta). This ecosystem is maintained by frequent low-intensity fires that facilitate the reproduction of the trees, wiregrass, and associated plants. This ecosystem once formed {{one of the more}} extensive ecosystems in North America, and longleaf pine was once the dominant tree that covered ~60% of the Atlantic Coastal Plain and Gulf of Mexico Coastal Plain. Today, however, only 1.4% of this region supports longleaf pine.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the land}} use history has proven {{crucial for the}} {{conservation}} of biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. In southern Sweden, very small and fragmented areas of the disturbance-dependent habitat <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> calcareous grassland support a large number of threatened and rare plants and animals. In order to find out if historical land use could explain variation in present-day habitat quality, the land use on eight such sites was traced back to the 18 th century and compared with key factors such as the amount of bare sand, lime content and P availability. There was no support for the common explanation of the decline in <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> calcareous grassland being caused by abandonment of agricultural fields during the last century. Instead, fertilization history was the main explanation for the difference in depletion depth of CaCO 3 seen between the sites. The decline in <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> calcareous grassland since the 18 th century is most probably the result of the drastic changes in land use during the 19 th century, which {{put an end to the}} extensive sand drift. Since cultivation was shown to have played an important role in the historical land use of <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> calcareous grassland, grazing alone may not be the optimal management option for these grasslands. Instead more drastic measures are needed to restore the high calcium content and maintain proper disturbance levels...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} sandy {{grassland}} habitats {{of interest for}} biodiversity conservation {{can be found in}} Europe. One such habitat is the threatened <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> calcareous grassland, which is home to a large number of endangered species. It is characterized by a discontinuous vegetation cover, mainly consisting of stress-tolerant species favoured by nutrient-poor and dry conditions. The <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> calcareous grassland habitat has declined during the last century due to intensification of farming, afforestation, abandonment, acidification and nutrient enrichment. Understanding the land use history has proven crucial for the conservation of biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. Land use was traced back to the 18 th century, and land use history was compared with the amount of bare sand, lime content and P availability. Previous agricultural activity was found to have created these habitats in flat areas lacking natural disturbance. However, ploughing was probably not the factor retaining CaCO 3 in the top soil. Instead, it seems very likely that it was the wind erosion, promoted by cultivation, which counteracted depletion by exposing the CaCO 3 rich sand. The largest changes in land use took place more than 100 years ago. Areas that were recently cultivated had the highest levels of extractable P, which may pose a threat to biodiversity. The restoration potential of topsoil removal and soil perturbation in degenerated <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> calcareous grassland was investigated. Restoration actions performed in 2006 resulted in increased pH and reduced nitrogen availability. Early colonisation of the key species Koeleria glauca after both deep perturbation and topsoil removal was found. The proportion of target species in 2012 was 20 % after topsoil removal, compared to 30 % in target vegetation, and less than 1 % in controls. Deep perturbation lead to 7 % target species, while almost no effects of shallow perturbation could be seen. The increased pH after soil perturbation also resulted in increased species richness of bryophytes. Six red-listed beetle species associated with open, dry grasslands were found after soil perturbation, out of which four were found only in perturbated plots. The availability of propagules is a key factor for the re-establishment of plant species in grasslands after restoration. The seed rain and the seed bank of <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> calcareous grassland in southern Sweden were investigated with the aim to assess the potential contribution of soil seed bank and natural seed rain for the re-establishment of threatened plant species after habitat restoration. Most target species had a negligible persistent seed bank. Many target species were well-represented in the within-patch seed rain, but seed dispersal seemed to be very limited beyond the natal population...|$|E

5000|$|Xeric hammocks, {{also known}} as <b>xeric</b> forests, <b>sand</b> hammocks, live oak forests, oak woodlands, or oak hammocks, grow on old sand dunes that are very well drained. The most common canopy tree in xeric hammocks is the sand live oak, (Quercus geminata). Other species of scrub oak and pine are also found in xeric hammocks. Plants that are typical of scrub or sandhill communities, {{particularly}} palmetto, are found under the canopy. Xeric hammocks are somewhat resistant to fire, but a fire that becomes established in a hammock will destroy it.|$|R
50|$|Warea carteri {{was listed}} as an {{endangered}} species in 1987 due to habitat loss (52 FR 2234). The primary threats to W. carteris persistence are habitat destruction and fire suppression. On the Lake Wales Ridge, W. carteri is threatened primarily by the conversion of its habitat to citrus groves or residential subdivisions. In Highlands County, 64.2 percent of the <b>xeric</b> vegetation (<b>sand</b> pine scrub, scrubby flatwoods, and southern ridge sandhills) present before settlement was converted to other land uses by 1981. An additional 10.3 percent of the xeric vegetation was moderately altered, primarily by building roads to create residential subdivisions (Peroni and Abrahamson 1985). The situation is similar in Polk and Lake counties. Fire suppression has been in practice throughout W. carteris range for many decades. Fire suppression {{is a threat to}} this species because its demography and reproduction seem to be closely tied to fire. The historical distribution of W. carteri includes the sites of at least 14 herbarium collections made in what is now the Miami urban area in Miami-Dade County, from 1878 to 1934. Nearly all of the suitable habitat for the plant in this area has been altered by urban growth. The remaining tracts of native vegetation have been searched carefully in recent years.ec The plant is almost certainly extirpated from the county. Warea carteri has probably been extirpated from Brevard County as well as no specimens have been observed in recent years. The status of the two largest populations of W. carteri in central Florida (at Archbold Biological Station and Tiger Creek Preserve) has been monitored for 6 years (M. Evans, Archbold Biological Station, personal communication 1995). Extreme fluctuations of population size are observed year to year. The data accumulated on population sizes indicate a strong relationship with fire. W. carteri seems to respond quickly, strongly, and positively to fire. Major population increases and the discovery of new populations consistently occur 1 year after fire, while major population crashes, including the appearance of no above ground individuals, occur 2 years after fire. The demography of W. carteri is being studied at Archbold Biological Station, Tiger Creek Preserve, and the Lake Placid Scrub. Dozens of local patches are known from Archbold Biological Station and Tiger Creek Preserve, although not all patches have aboveground plants in any given year. At both Archbold Biological Station and Tiger Creek Preserve, many W. carteri populations have behaved fairly predictably in response to fire. Populations either appear or boom the year following fire (11 of 16 instances of population doubling at Tiger Creek Preserve occurred the year after a fire). Population crashes occur in the second year (18 of 26 populations at Tiger Creek Preserve lost more than 50 percent 2 years post fire). Populations in sites that have experienced prolonged fire suppression usually persist only in very low above ground densities. Warea carteri is currently protected at Archbold Biological Station, Lake Placid Scrub, Tiger Creek Preserve, Lake Wales Ridge SF, Snell Creek and Horse Creek. Polk County. BLM is in contact with the SFWMD and FWS to determine the best course of action to pursue in order to protect and manage W. carteri at this site.|$|R
40|$|Questions: (1) Does soil {{acidification}} in calcareous sandy grasslands lead to loss of plant diversity? (2) What {{is the relationship}} between the soil content of lime and the plant availability of mineral nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in sandy grasslands? Location: Sandy glaciofluvial deposits in south-eastern Sweden covered by <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> calcareous grasslands (EU habitat directive 6120). Methods: Soil and vegetation were investigated in most of the <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> calcareous grasslands in the Scania region (136 sample plots distributed over four or five major areas and about 25 different sites). Environmental variables were recorded at each plot, and soil samples were analysed for exchangeable P and N. as well as limestone content and pH. Data were analysed with regression analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. Results: Plant species richness was highest on weakly acid to slightly alkaline soil; a number of nationally red-listed species showed a similar pattern. Plant species diversity and number of red-listed species increased with slope. Where the topsoil had been acidified, limestone was rarely present above a depth of 30 cm. The presence of limestone restricts the availability of soil P, placing a major constraint on primary productivity in sandy soils. Conclusions: Acidification of sandy grasslands leads to reduced abundance of desirable species, although the overall effect is rather weak between pH 5 and pH 9. Slopes are important for high diversity in sandy grasslands. Calcareous soils cannot be restored through shallow ploughing, but deep perturbation could increase the limestone content of the topsoil and Favour of target species...|$|E
40|$|Severely {{disturbed}} habitats such {{as military}} training grounds, gravel pits and sand pits {{contribute to the}} species diversity of the agricultural landscape in Europe. They host a number of red-listed species not found elsewhere, illustrating that many plant species are threatened by extinction due to too little soil disturbance. Implementing a suitable disturbance regime is therefore crucial to ensure species-rich environments. We have reviewed the literature on soil disturbance as a restoration measure in dry sandy grasslands, with a special focus on <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> calcareous grasslands as these are severely threatened. Our objective was to elucidate the relations between diversity and disturbance regimes, and to determine how disturbance {{can be used to}} counteract acidification, to reduce nutrient availability and to create gaps in the vegetation. Our findings indicate that the current disturbance regime should be based on the historical disturbance regime, the productivity of the habitat and the propagule supply, in order to promote diversity at a landscape scale. Based on earlier studies and on the diversity/disturbance theory, we propose a conceptual model {{that can be used to}} determine the appropriate soil disturbance regime for restoration purposes. Our analysis highlights the importance of considering soil productivity, soil chemistry and dispersal limitations when choosing restoration measures and disturbance regimes for the conservation of biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|The {{diversity}} of orchid species in semi-natural calcareous grassland {{is thought to}} depend on floral variability. However, differences in primary life-history strategy, or the overall suite of functional traits, could also affect coexistence. Both primary strategy (affecting day-to-day survival) and reproductive traits (representing periodic events) have been hypothesized {{to contribute to a}} general mechanism regulating the local persistence and relative abundance of species. We recorded species identity at 8, 000 points at the centimetre scale along sixteen 5 -m long transects at the Olive Lawn, a <b>xeric</b> <b>sand</b> calcareous grassland near Lecco, Italy. Transects allowed the relative abundance and spatial aggregation of Grime's competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal (CSR) strategies to be quantified. Orchid flowering and fruiting phenology was recorded alongside the phenology of graminoid growth. Seven orchid species were present and exhibited a spectrum of strategies spanning two extremes, (1) small early-flowering ruderals (R/CR-selected), and (2) larger-leaved competitors (C/CR) flowering later as dominant graminoids attained maximum height. These orchids, and other subordinate species in the community, exhibited random spatial distributions amongst dominant graminoids that exhibited a high degree of spatial aggregation and similar, but non-identical, stress-tolerator (S) strategies. The reproductive phenology of meadow orchids is an intimate component of their CSR strategies, and appears to promote coexistence by allowing segregation between temporal niches and the exploitation of opportunities between clumps of dominant species. Only for closely related species with identical CSR strategies, such as Ophrys benacensis and Ophrys sphegodes, could specific floral differences alone explain coexistence...|$|E
