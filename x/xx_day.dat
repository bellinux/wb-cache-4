40|$|Background: There are an {{estimated}} 4. 7 million with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and 2. 1 million with hip osteoarthritis in the United Kingdom. Resources to manage OA within the National Health Service are limited. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines advocate education and self-management for all people with osteoarthritis. Most recently E-health programmes via the internet {{are being used to}} deliver health services and information.. Arthritis Australia & Osteoarthritis Research Society International developed Myjointpain. org to support Australians in self-managing hip and/or knee joint pain. There is currently no equivalent UK e-health resource [...] This study explored the attitudes, facilitators and barriers towards using e-health by people self-managing hip/knee OA in the UK. Method: A qualitative design using semi-structured telephone interviews was used. Patient and public involvement (PPI) members were recruited via Nottingham City Hospital. PPI members were included if they had Hip and/or Knee joint pain and internet access. Each PPI member was provided with an information sheet and consent form. All consenting members received a link to the Myjointpain,org website and given <b>XX</b> <b>days</b> to practice using the programme. Participants were then contacted for a telephone interview. The interviews were transcribed and a six step thematic analysis used. This included (1) Reading/re-reading of transcript, (2) Coding interesting features of data, (3) Categorising codes into potential themes/subthemes, (4) Reviewing themes, (5) Defining themes, (6) Producing final report. Themes identified were independently verified. Results:. Twelve PPI members wre recruited and contributed to telephone interviews. Overall PPI members were open to using an e-health initiative to self-manage their joint pain; Facilitators that encouraged PPI members to use Myjointpain. org included:. the interactive nature of the e-health programme; the personalised action plan, and participatns’ preceived trustworthiness of the content of the website.,However excess information was reported as a barrier of use, as well as finding time to use the website due to busy lifestyles. The use of email/telephone prompting was thought may help people better engage with on line self management programmes. [...] Conclusion PPI members with hip and /or knee OA in the UK report that they are receptive and open to considering using the Myjointpain. org web based e learning self management programme. Such an approach that emphasises personalised and interactive aspects to facilitate self management helps promote engagement with self management. Prompting is helpful in maintaining engagement (e. g. via e-mail) and provision of too much information may prevent people from engaging with the programme. Myjointpain. org presents an exciting opportunity for e-health strategies for people with arthritis in the UK. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies on}} neuro-immuno-modulation {{indicate}} that the thymus is involved in many neurological diseases, including experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Twenty Lewis rats were induced for EAE. At X, XII, <b>XX</b> and XXX <b>days</b> post-inoculation the animals were killed, and the thymus was recovered and harvested. Specimens of thymus were submitted to morphological light microscopy analysis (1 % toluidine blue) and ultra-structural analysis (transmission electron microscopy). Significant morphometric data were collected by examining the images quantitatively and by statistically analysing the values. Our {{results show that the}} microenvironment of the thymus is severally involved in acute EAE. Thymocytes and reticular epithelial cells show many changes which are closely related to the pathogenesis of EAE. In particular we observed: (1) inside the cell an increase in intra-cytoplasmic vacuoles, and changes in the thickness of the nuclear membrane, mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, cellular inter-digitations and cellular electron-density; (2) outside the cell an increase in pericellular translucent halo, intercellular spaces, intercellular contacts and apoptotic and necrotic figures. The evidence of a thymic role in MS may suggest the intriguing therapeutic concept of thymectomy in the management of this neurological disease...|$|R
40|$|Sexually dimorphic adult {{behaviors}} {{are often the}} result of exposure to gonadal testosterone or its metabolite estradiol [8, 9] during development. However, a number of published findings challenge this idea [11]. For example, in the zebra finch exposure to testosterone during development cannot completely masculinize female song [13]. In addition, both bovine and rodent XY embryos develop {{at a faster rate}} than <b>XX</b> embryos, beginning <b>days</b> before gonadal differentiation [1, 2, 12]. This accelerated growth of the male embryos is linked to a gene on the Y chromosome in two mouse strains [2]. These studies suggest that an alternate mechanism exists by which sexual dimorphisms arise in the CNS but they do not offer any insights into what this mechanism(s) is or whether it works synergistically or independently of gonadal hormones. One theory that has gained considerable support is that in addition to encoding proteins that determine whether the undifferentiated gonad develops into testes or ovaries, sex chromosome genes directly influence the development of sex differences [4, 6, 10]. In fact, {{there are a number of}} genes that are differentially expressed in male and female mouse embryo brains before the development of gonads. It is possible these genes affec...|$|R

5|$|TY Pyxidis is an {{eclipsing binary}} star whose {{apparent}} magnitude ranges from 6.85 to 7.5 over 3.2 days. The two components are both of spectral type G5IV with a diameter 2.2 times, and mass 1.2 {{times that of the}} Sun, and revolve around each other every 3.2 days. The system is classified as a RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a binary system with prominent starspot activity, and lies 184 ± 5 light-years away. The system emits X-rays, and analysing the emission curve over time led researchers to conclude that there was a loop of material arcing between the two stars. RZ Pyxidis is another eclipsing binary system, made up of two young stars less than 200,000 years old. Both are hot blue-white stars of spectral type B7V and are around 2.5 {{times the size of the}} Sun. One is around five times as luminous as the Sun and the other around four times as luminous. The system is classified as a Beta Lyrae variable, the apparent magnitude varying from 8.83 to 9.72 over 0.66 <b>days.</b> <b>XX</b> Pyxidis is one of the more-studied members of a class of stars known as Delta Scuti variables—short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology. Astronomers made more sense of its pulsations when it became clear that it is also a binary star system. The main star is a white main sequence star of spectral type A4V that is around 1.85 ± 0.05 times as massive as the Sun. Its companion is most likely a red dwarf of spectral type M3V, around 0.3 times as massive as the Sun. The two are very close—possibly only 3 times the diameter of the Sun between them—and orbit each other every 1.15 days. The brighter star is deformed into an egg shape.|$|R

While there is great interest in incorporating symptomatology, little is known about how patient reported symptoms are associated with future exacerbations and exacerbation-related costs. Methods: The mMRC and CAT were mailed to a randomly selected sample of 4, 000 Medicare members aged > 40 years, diagnosed with COPD (≥ 2 encounters with International Classification of Dis­eases- 9 th Edition Clinical Modification: 491. xx, 492. xx, 496. <b>xx,</b> ≥ 30 <b>days</b> apart). The exacerbations and exacerbation-related costs were collected from claims data during 365 -day post-survey after exclusion of members lost to follow-up or with cancer, organ transplant, or pregnancy. A logistic regression model estimated the predictive value of exacerbation history and symptomatology on exacerbations during follow-up, and a generalized linear model with log link and gamma distribution estimated the predictive value of exacerbation history and symptomatology on exacerbation-related costs. Results: Among a total of 1, 159 members who returned the survey, a 66 % (765) completion rate was observed. Mean (standard deviation) age among survey completers was 72. 0 (8. 3), 53. 7 % female and 91. 2 % white. Odds ratios for having post-index exacerbations were 3. 06, 4. 55, and 16. 28 times for members with 1, 2, and ≥ 3 pre-index exacerbations, respectively, relative to members with 0 pre-index exacerbations (P 0. 10). Conclusion: The patient-reported symptoms contribute important information related to future COPD exacerbations and exacerbation-related costs beyond that explained by exacerbation history.
