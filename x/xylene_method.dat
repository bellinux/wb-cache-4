40|$|BackgroundFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples can be DNA-extracted {{and used}} for human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) genotyping. The xylene-based gold standard for extracting FFPE samples is laborious, suboptimal and involves health hazards for the personnel involved. ObjectivesTo compare extraction with the standard <b>xylene</b> <b>method</b> to a xylene-free method used in an HPV LabNet Global Reference Laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC); based on a commercial method with an extra heating step. Study designFifty FFPE samples {{were randomly selected from}} a national audit of all cervical cancer cases diagnosed in Sweden during 10 years. For each case-block, a blank-block was sectioned, as a control for contamination. For xylene extraction, the standard WHO Laboratory Manual protocol was used. For the CDC method, the manufacturers 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 protocol was followed except for an extra heating step, 12020 C for 20 minutes. Samples were extracted and tested in parallel with 2 -globin real-time PCR, HPV 16 real-time PCR and HPV typing using modified general primers (MGP) -PCR and Luminex assays. ResultsFor a valid result the blank-block had to be betaglobin-negative in all tests and the case-block positive for beta-globin. Overall, detection was improved with the heating method and the amount of HPV-positive samples increased from 70...|$|E

Special cells were required. (1) Variation with frequency. The results agree approximately with the equations: For carefully dried nitrobenzene at 30 °C, psi =. 028 ° + 6. 03 x 104 /f; for distilled water at 23. 5 °, psi = 0. 8 ° + 2. 09 x 106 / f. These indicate that in addition to the true dielectric loss there is a leakage through the liquid proportional to 1 /f. For xylene, psi was too small to measure, less than. 01 ° at 3 x 10 5 cycles. K was found to be practically independent of the frequency, being 2. 24 for xylene and of the order of 100 for water. (2) Variation with temperature, for nitrobenzene.

The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the scope of CNT/LDPE nano-composites for engineering applications. Nano-composites of LDPE and MWCNT are generally prepared by using the melt blending method but in the present investigation these have been prepared by using solvent mixing <b>method.</b> <b>Xylene</b> has been used as a solvent which can dissolve low density polyethylene (LDPE) at about 125  °C. The solution of LDPE in xylene has been ultrasonicated with various percentages of MWCNT (0, 1, 2, 5, 10  wt% of MWCNT) composite to form thin film after drying. MWCNT used in this study have been synthesised by electric arc discharge method. Characteristics of these composites have been determined by Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Raman spectroscopy revealed variation in intensity of CNT's peak with variation in concentration of CNT. The results indicated that intensity of CNT's peak was found to increase with the increase in concentration of CNT which indicated the type of interaction between polymer and CNT. SEM analysis reveals CNT-polymer interfacial adhesion and shows agglomeration of CNT's at some locations and presence of individual tubes at other locations. These investigations show that LDPE/MWCNT composites can be fabricated using simple solvent mixing method.

Of the variables studied, the temperature difference between the modulator and GC oven, the boiling point of the analyte, and the GC column internal diameter produced significant effects on modulator efficiency. ^ The thermal and chromatographic performance characteristics of the modulator were investigated. Direct measurements of the capillary column showed exponential temperature changes during modulator passage. Van 2 ̆ 7 t Hoff plots produced estimates of the free energy of interaction between the analyte and stationary phase on the modulator that were in good agreement with literature values. ^ GC x GC was applied to three separate analyses of petroleum fuels. A quantitative analysis of trace levels of oxygenates and aromatics in groundwater were performed using headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) sampling. The oxygenates studied were methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl butyl ether (EBE). The aromatics studied were the BTEX compounds, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and <b>xylenes.</b> Results yielded <b>method</b> detection limits of 360 - 630 parts-per-trillion (v/v). GC x GC resolved all oxygenate and BTEX components from all traditional one-dimensional GC coeluters present in standard gasoline samples. ^ Quantitation of BTEX and all heavier aromatic compounds in finished gasoline was performed. The target aromatic species were resolved from other compound classes. Structurally related aromatics were grouped in a manner that facilitated identification and integration. Quantitation produced results directly comparable with more complicated standard methods. ^ An oil spill source identification case from the U. S.

40|$|Wastewater {{produced}} from the petroleum industry contains hazardous organic compounds such as benzene, toluene and <b>xylene</b> (BTX). A <b>method</b> based on advanced oxidation {{process has been}} applied to treat the organic compounds using semiconductor photocatalysts. Three types of ternary photocatalysts,namely ZnO/WO 3 /SnO 2 (ZWS), ZnO/WO 3 /Fe 2 O 3 (ZWF) andZnO/WO 3 /TiO 2 (ZWT) were prepared viamodified sol-gel method with different percentage ofatomic ratios of each metal oxide. Characterization of the catalyst was conducted using X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance ultra-violetspectroscopy (DR-UV), field emission scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (FESEM-EDX) and nitrogen adsorptionanalyses. The XRD analysis revealed that all the prepared catalysts are mostlyin polycrystalline phases. The existence of binary species such as ZnWO 4, SnW 3 O 9 and Fe 2 WO 6 were detected in the bulk matrices of the ternary oxide catalysts. The types of physisorption isotherm represented by ZWS (90 : 9 : 1), ZWS (90 : 3 : 7), ZWS (33 : 33 : 34) and ZWT (33 : 33 : 34) photocatalysts were of the Type IV isotherm and hysteresis loop assigned for the mesoporousity of the respective catalysts. The band gap energy of each photocatalyst was determined by DR-UV and it showedthat the band gap was affected by the change in ratio of the precursors. FESEM-EDX analysis for all the prepared ternary catalysts exhibited small and dispersed particles. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared ternary catalysts was tested on thesimulated BTX aqueous phase (1000 ppm) irradiated under UV-light. ZWSwith the ratio of 90 : 3 : 7, 7 : 3 : 90 and 1 : 90 : 9 gave 66. 97 %, 59. 02 % and 61. 01 % of the BTX degradation, respectively. Meanwhile, ZWF (33 : 33 : 34), ZWS (33 : 33 : 34), and ZWT (33 : 33 : 34) photocatalysts gave 43. 27 %, 68. 58 %, and 70. 41 % of the BTX degradation, respectively. All the degradation processes were conducted using 365 nm UV-light at ambient temperature and pressure. The total organic carbon (TOC) analysis revealed that the percentageof mineralization of the treated compounds were 40. 58 % (ZWF 33 : 33 : 34), 64. 91 % (ZWS 33 : 33 : 34), and 65. 36 % (ZWS 33 : 33 : 34) with slightly increased in the percentage of degradation using 312 nm light source.

40|$|Author: Molecular Profiling Initiative, NCI This {{method was}} {{successful}} in our lab using prostate tissue and for our specific objectives. Investigators must be aware that {{they will need to}} tailor the following protocol for their own research objectives and tissue under study. Investigators can utilize X chromosome inactivation (methylation) to determine the clonality status of a tumor or premalignant lesion in females. The technique is based on a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme and analysis of a polymorphic locus on the X chromosome. Clonal cell populations will show "loss" of the non-methylated allele after restriction digest. The assay can be performed on DNA recovered from microdissected samples. Both frozen tissue and fixed-embedded archival tissue can be utilized. ### Materials 1. DNA sample (see [Processing of Microdissected Tissue - DNA-based Analysis]([URL] - Proteinase K (Sigma) - Proteinase K buffer (0. 05 M Tris-HCL, 0. 001 M EDTA, 1 % Tween 20, 0. 1 mg/ml proteinase K, pH 8. 0) - Phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (1 : 1 : 1, v:v:v) (Gibco) - 3 M Na Acetate, pH 5. 2 (Life Technologies) - Isopropanol - Glycogen, 10 mg/ml (GenHunter) - 70 % ethanol - Buffer 1 (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8. 0, 10 mM MgCl 2, 50 mM NaCl) - Hha I restriction enzyme (Life Technologies) - REact 2 Buffer (Life Technologies) - 10 X PCR buffer (100 mM Tris-HCL pH 8. 3, 500 mM KCL, 15 mM MgCl 2, 0, 01 % w/v gelatin, autoclaved) (Perkin Elmer) - dNTP, each 10 mM (Perkin Elmer) - 7 -deaza dGTP, 10 mM (Boehringer Mannheim) - DMSO, minimum 99. 5 %, GC (Sigma) - Forward and reverse primers, each 20 µM (Human Androgen Receptor Gene (HUMARA) CAG trinucleotide repeat microsatellite primers are described in Allen et al) - AmpliTaq Gold, 5 U/ml (Perkin Elmer) - a 32 P-dCTP, 20 µCi/µl (NEN) - Gel-Mix 6 (Life Technologies) - 10 X TBE (1 M Tris, 0. 9 M Boric Acid, and 0. 01 M EDTA) (Life Technologies) - Loading dye (95 % formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0. 05 % bromophenol blue, 0. 05 % <b>xylene</b> cyanol) ### <b>Methods</b> *TIP: Investigators must be especially careful when using this methodology to analyze archival tissue specimens. Formalin-fixation in particular results in DNA that is difficult to amplify and often produces inconsistent PCR results, including artifactual allelic loss and poor amplification of large products. If this technique is utilized for analysis of archival samples, we highly recommend that replicate experiments (multiple independent dissections, triplicate PCR reactions, etc.) be used to verify results*. **A: LCM and Proteinase K Treatment** 1. Obtain microdissected cells using the [LCM procedure]([URL] - *TIP: The number of cells needed to successfully perform the assay varies depending on the quality and processing conditions of the tissue samples. One thousand cells is recommended as a good starting point*. - Suspend approximately 1000 microdissected cells in 20 µl proteinase K buffer. - Incubate overnight at 37 °C. **B: DNA Purification** 1. Lyse the cells overnight at 42 °C, in 50 µl phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. - Boil 10 min at 95 °C. - Vortex 1 min. - Centrifuge 20 min at 14, 000 rpm at RT. - Pipet upper phase into new tube and discard lower phase. - Add 5 µl 3 M NaAc. - Add 250 µl isopropanol. - Add 2 µl glycogen. - Vortex briefly. - Place on dry ice for 30 min. - Centrifuge 14, 000 rpm for 30 min. - Add 300 µl 70 % ethanol. - Vortex briefly. - Centrifuge 2 min at 14, 000 rpm at RT. - Discard supernatant. - Dry pellet at RT for 5 min, or 37 °C for 2 min. - Resuspend the pellet in 20 µl buffer 1. - Incubate at 37 °C for 3 min to completely dissolve the pellet. **C: DNA Digestion** 1. Pipet 8 µl of the resuspended DNA into a reaction tube. - Add 1 µl REact buffer 2. - Add 1 µl Hha I. - Incubate overnight at 37 °C. - Incubate at 90 °C for 10 min. - Use 2 µl of this digested DNA for PCR (see below). - Use 2 µl of the non-digested DNA from B 18 above as a negative control for PCR. - *TIP: Parallel analysis of control DNA that is known to be from a monoclonal population is recommended to verify the efficiency of the restriction digest. DNA recovered from a tissue specimen that was processed similar to the tissue sample under study is ideal*. **D: PCR** 1. Set up the following PCR reaction: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") 2. Cycles are as follows: ![Table 2]([URL] "Table 2 ") **E: Gel Electrophoresis** 1. Prepare gel consisting of 6 % acrylamide as in [LOH protocol]([URL] - Add 4 µl dye to 20 µl PCR product. - Denature the samples for 5 min at 94 °C. - Load 3 µl onto gel. - Electrophorese at 1800 volts for 1 to 2 hours. - *TIP: In clonality analysis, the PCR products are ~ 200 bp. Therefore do not overload the gel with sample and run the gel {{for a longer period of}} time to sharpen the bands and increase separation*. - Transfer the gel to 3 mm Whatman paper and dry. Perform an autoradiograph with Kodak BIOMAX film as described in [LOH protocol]([URL] - *TIP: Try a short exposure (1 hour) time first and only re-expose depending on the results*. ### Results A sample is considered to be composed of a monoclonal cell population when two alleles are recognized in the undigested DNA sample and complete absence of one allele is seen in the digested DNA sample. - *TIP: DNA that is recovered from microdissected samples and "semi-purified" using a one-step proteinase K buffer strategy will sometimes produce "non-specific" PCR products in addition to the true alleles. Normal-cell DNA from archival specimens from control subjects serves as a good comparator and can assist in interpretation of allele patterns*. ### References 1.
