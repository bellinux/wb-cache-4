5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{also contains}} a sugar-binding protein, or lectin, that has affinity for the sugars <b>xylose</b> and melibiose. The lectin is mitogenic—that is, it can stimulate cells {{to begin the process}} of cell division, resulting in mitosis. Further, the lectin has antiviral properties: it inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus enzyme reverse transcriptase. Other studies suggest that B.edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus and tobacco mosaic virus grown in culture. Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of viral replication, and as new drugs in the treatment of viral disease.|$|E

25|$|Mammals are not {{generally}} {{thought of as}} pollinators, but some rodents, bats and marsupials are significant pollinators and some even specialise in such activities. In South Africa certain species of Protea (in particular Protea humiflora, P. amplexicaulis, P. subulifolia, P. decurrens and P. cordata) are adapted to pollination by rodents (particularly Cape Spiny Mouse, Acomys subspinosus) and elephant shrews (Elephantulus species). The flowers are borne near the ground, are yeasty smelling, not colourful, and sunbirds reject the nectar with its high <b>xylose</b> content. The mice apparently can digest the <b>xylose</b> and they eat large quantities of the pollen. In Australia pollination by flying, gliding and earthbound mammals has been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|Other sugars are not {{fermentable}} at all. After {{consumption by}} the yeast, {{the ratio of}} non-fermentable sugars (the ones that are not consumed by yeast: arabinose and <b>xylose)</b> is between 0.5 and 1.7 grams per litre. Sugars exercise a control over the taste – they balance the spiciness of the acidity and the burning of the alcohol.|$|E
25|$|The O-glucose on notch can {{be further}} {{elongated}} to a trisaccharide {{with the addition of}} two <b>xylose</b> sugars by xylosyltransferases, and the O-fucose can be elongated to a tetrasaccharide by the ordered addition of an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) sugar by an N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase called Fringe, the addition of a galactose by a galactosyltransferase, and the addition of a sialic acid by a sialyltransferase.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure, but an {{appropriate}} diet and the enzyme <b>xylose</b> isomerase can help. The ingestion of glucose simultaneously with fructose improves fructose absorption and may prevent {{the development of}} symptoms. For example, people may tolerate fruits such as grapefruits or bananas, which contain similar amounts of fructose and glucose, but apples are not tolerated because they contain high levels of fructose {{and lower levels of}} glucose.|$|E
25|$|Added {{sugar is}} not always evident in food products. While {{expected}} in desserts, candies, and soft drinks, sugar is also added {{to a wide range}} of non-sweet items such as bread, crackers, potato chips, peanut butter, soup, salad dressing, ketchup, mayonnaise, and many other common sauces. Forms of added sugar include technically accurate, but misleading, terms such as cane juice, evaporated cane juice, corn syrup and corn syrup solids, malt syrup, rice syrup, dextrose, maltose, maltodextrin, molasses, treacle, and <b>xylose.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of sugar substitutes approved {{for food use}} are artificially synthesized compounds. However, some bulk natural sugar substitutes are known, including sorbitol and xylitol, which are found in berries, fruit, vegetables, and mushrooms. It is not commercially viable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, so they are produced by catalytic hydrogenation of the appropriate reducing sugar. For example, <b>xylose</b> is converted to xylitol, lactose to lactitol, and glucose to sorbitol. Other natural substitutes are known, but these have yet to gain official approval for food use.|$|E
25|$|Cellulose {{production}} depends {{heavily on}} several {{factors such as}} the growth medium, environmental conditions, and the formation of byproducts. The fermentation medium contains carbon, nitrogen, and other macro and micro nutrients required for bacteria growth. Bacteria are most efficient when supplied with an abundant carbon source and minimal nitrogen source. Glucose and sucrose are the most commonly used carbon sources for cellulose production, while fructose, maltose, <b>xylose,</b> starch, and glycerol have been tried. Sometimes, ethanol may be used to increase cellulose production. The problem with using glucose is that gluconic acid is formed as a byproduct which decreases the pH of the culture and in turn, decreases the production of cellulose. Studies have shown that gluconic acid production can be decreased in the presence of lignosulfonate. Addition of organic acids, specifically acetic acid, also helped in a higher yield of cellulose. Studies of using molasses medium in a jar fermentor as well as added components of sugarcane molasses on certain strains of bacteria have been studied with results showing increases in cellulose production.|$|E
500|$|Another {{chemical}} {{extracted from}} the species was an acidic polysaccharide (made up of mostly mannose, glucose, glucuronic acid and <b>xylose)</b> which showed anticoagulant properties. The article concluded that [...] "the polysaccharides from these mushrooms may constitute {{a new source of}} compounds with action on coagulation, platelet aggregation and, perhaps, on thrombosis". Another study reported that the species may be effective in stopping platelet binding in vitro, with possible uses regarding hypercholesterolemia. Research has shown that A.auricula-judae can be used to lower cholesterol levels generally, and, in particular, is one of two fungi shown to reduce the level of bad cholesterol.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Xylose,</b> fucose, mannose, and GlcNAc phosphoserine glycans {{have been}} {{reported}} in the literature. [...] Fucose and GlcNAc have been found only in Dictyostelium discoideum, mannose in Leishmania mexicana, and <b>xylose</b> in Trypanosoma cruzi. [...] Mannose has recently been reported in a vertebrate, the mouse, Mus musculus, on the cell-surface laminin receptor alpha dystroglycan4. It has been suggested this rare finding may be linked to the fact that alpha dystroglycan is highly conserved from lower vertebrates to mammals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of bacterial overgrowth {{can be made}} by physicians in various ways. Malabsorption can be detected by a test called the D-xylose test. [...] <b>Xylose</b> is a sugar that does not require enzymes to be digested. The D-xylose test involves having a patient drink a certain quantity of D-xylose, and measuring levels in the urine and blood; if {{there is no evidence of}} D-xylose in the urine and blood, it suggests that the small bowel is not absorbing properly (as opposed to problems with enzymes required for digestion).|$|E
2500|$|Halostagnicola larsenii is a halophilic, neutrophilic, chemo-organotroph {{and uses}} oxygen as its {{terminal}} electron acceptor. H. larsenii can utilize {{a variety of}} carbohydrates such as fructose, glycerol, lactose, glucose, arabinose, acetate, ribose, starch, maltose, galactose, ribose, <b>xylose,</b> glutamate, and propionate as substrates for growth. Growth substrates were determined {{through the use of}} the isolation medium, which contained the substrate being tested along with yeast extract. [...] Additionally, H. larsenii undergoes assimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrite to ammonia. This process differs from nitrate reduction because it occurs aerobically and uses ferrodoxin as an electron donor.|$|E
2500|$|Experimental {{fields of}} Salicornia have been planted in Ras al-Zawr (Saudi Arabia), Eritrea (northeast Africa) and Sonora (northwest Mexico) {{aimed at the}} {{production}} of biodiesel. The company responsible for the Sonora trials (...) claims [...] between 225 and 250 gallons of BQ-9000 biodiesel can be produced per hectare (approximately 2.5 acres) of salicornia, and is promoting a $35 million scheme to create a [...] salicornia farm in Bahia de Kino. Stems and roots of Salicornia brachiata plants had high cellulose contents (ca. 30%), whereas tender stem tips contents low cellulose content (9.2%). Salicornia brachiata revealed the dominance of rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, and glucose, with meager presence of ribose and <b>xylose</b> in their structural polysaccharide.|$|E
2500|$|The optimum {{temperature}} for growth of Sporobolomyces salmonicolor is between , being the highest tolerable temperature. Growth {{does not occur}} at [...] This species does not undergo fermentation. Additionally, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor shows positive urease activity and a positive staining response when stained with diazonium blue B. Diazonium blue B is a technique used to classify asexual yeasts {{as members of the}} Zygomycota, Basidiomycota or Ascomycota. The major ubiquinone present is Q-10. The cell wall of S.salmonicolor contains fucose, mannose, glucose and galactose, however <b>xylose</b> is absent. Colonies grow in the presence of glucose, sucrose, maltose, cellobiose, ,-trehalose, melezitose, D-arabinose, ethanol, glycerol, D-mannitol, D-glucitol, D-gluconate, succinate, nitrate and urease. This species does not assimilate myo-inositol or D-glucuronate, and do not form extracellular starch-like compounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{action of}} {{micro-organisms}} can fix uranium; Thermoanaerobacter can use chromium(VI), iron(III), cobalt(III), manganese(IV) and uranium(VI) as electron acceptors while acetate, glucose, hydrogen, lactate, pyruvate, succinate, and <b>xylose</b> {{can act as}} electron donors for the metabolism of the bacteria. In this way the metals {{can be reduced to}} form magnetite (Fe3O4), siderite (FeCO3), rhodochrosite (MnCO3), and uraninite (UO2). Other researchers have also worked on the fixing of uranium using bacteria , Francis R. Livens et al. (Working at Manchester) have suggested that the reason why Geobacter sulfurreducens can reduce [...] cations to uranium dioxide is that the bacteria reduce the uranyl cations to [...] which then undergoes disproportionation to form [...] and UO2. This reasoning was based (at least in part) on the observation that [...] is not converted to an insoluble neptunium oxide by the bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|The {{source for}} these {{nutrients}} is {{often found in}} the grape must itself, though MLF inoculations that run concurrent with alcoholic fermentation risk the yeast outcompeting the bacteria for these nutrients. Towards the end of fermentation, {{while most of the}} original grape must resources have been consumed, the lysis of dead yeast cells (the [...] "lees") can be a source for some nutrients, particularly amino acids. Plus, even [...] "dry" [...] wines that have been fermented to dryness still have unfermentable pentose sugars (such as arabinose, ribose and <b>xylose)</b> left behind that can be used by both positive and spoilage bacteria. As with wine yeast, manufacturers of cultured LAB inoculum usually offer specially prepared nutritional additives that be used as a supplement. However, unlike wine yeast, lactic acid bacteria can not use the supplement diammonium phosphate as a nitrogen source.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogenation is {{a useful}} means for {{converting}} unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives. [...] Substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes, but also aldehydes, imines, and nitriles, which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds, i.e. alcohols and amines. [...] Thus, alkyl aldehydes, which can be synthesized with the oxo process from carbon monoxide and an alkene, {{can be converted to}} alcohols. E.g. 1-propanol is produced from propionaldehyde, produced from ethene and carbon monoxide. Xylitol, a polyol, is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar <b>xylose,</b> an aldehyde. Primary amines can be synthesized by hydrogenation of nitriles, while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile. For example, isophorone diamine, a precursor to the polyurethane monomer isophorone diisocyanate, is produced from isophorone nitrile by a tandem nitrile hydrogenation/reductive amination by ammonia, wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into an amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another amine.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the huge supply of agricultural cellulose, the lignocellulosic material {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Nature's polymer", would be an ideal source of material for biofuels and many other products. Composed of lignin and monomer sugars such as glucose, fructose, arabinose, galactose, and <b>xylose,</b> these constituents are very valuable in their own right. To this point in history, there are some methods commonly used to coax [...] "recalcitrant" [...] cellulose to separate or hydrolyse into its lignin and sugar parts, treatment with; steam explosion, supercritical water, enzymes, acids and alkalines. All these methods involve heat or chemicals, are expensive, have lower conversion rates and produce waste materials. In recent years the rise of [...] "mechanochemistry" [...] has resulted in the use of ball mills and other mill designs to reduce cellulose to a fine powder {{in the presence of a}} catalyst, a common bentonite or kaolinite clay, that will hydrolyse the cellulose quickly and with low energy input into pure sugar and lignin. Still currently only in pilot stage, this promising technology offers the possibility that any agricultural economy might be able to get rid of its requirement to refine oil for transportation fuels. This would be a major improvement in carbon neutral energy sources and allow the continued use of internal combustion engines on a large scale.|$|E

50|$|This natural {{ability of}} S. stipitis to ferment <b>xylose</b> to ethanol, has {{inspired}} efforts to engineer this trait into Saccharomyces cerevisiae.S. cerevisiae is preferred for ethanol production from grain and sugar cane, because it ferments hexose sugars very rapidly {{and is very}} robust. However, it does not natively metabolize <b>xylose.</b> This limits the usefulness of S. cerevisiae {{in the production of}} fuels and chemicals from plant cell walls, which contain a large amount of <b>xylose.</b> In response, S. cerevisiae has been engineered to ferment <b>xylose</b> through the addition of the S. stiptis genes, XYL1 and XYL2, coding for <b>xylose</b> reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase, respectively. The concerted action of these enzymes converts <b>xylose</b> to xylulose, which is naturally fermented by S. cerevisae. Additional modifications are necessary for rapid fermentation of <b>xylose,</b> however.|$|E
5000|$|In another approach, {{bacterial}} <b>xylose</b> isomerases {{have been}} introduced into S. cerevisiae. This enzyme catalyze the direct formation of D-xylulose from D-xylose. Many attempts at expressing bacterial isomerases were not successful due to misfolding or other problems, but a <b>xylose</b> isomerase from the anaerobic fungus Piromyces Sp. has proven effective.
