30|$|Artificial {{pollination}} experiments {{showed that}} T. sinense is self-compatible and outcrossing fertile, and no apomixes is occurred. The fruit set from <b>xenogamy</b> {{is higher than}} that from control and cross-pollination under natural conditions, indicating the pollinator limitation in natural population. The results showed that T. sinense is self-compatible, and sometimes needs pollination vector, and can be pollinated by wind and insect (Syrphid fly and bees), which is in accordance with that from out-crossing index and pollen-ovule ratio. According to Dafni (1992), the out-crossing index is 3, indicating T. sinense is self-compatible, with facultative <b>xenogamy,</b> and sometimes needs pollinators. The pollen-ovule ratio (720 [*]±[*] 28) belongs to the range of 244.7 - 2588.0 corresponding to the values reported for facultative <b>xenogamy</b> (Cruden 1977). Therefore, the mating system of T. sinense is mixed with self-pollination and out-crossing, {{and there is no}} apomixes. While, the fruit set from <b>xenogamy</b> and control is respectively higher 25.87 % and 18.43 % than that from autogamy, and the seed germination rate from autogamy is respectively lower 56.43 % and 32.35 % than that from <b>xenogamy</b> and control, suggesting that outcrossing predominated in the breeding system of T. sinense.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we studied}} the main {{characteristics}} of flowering, reproductive system {{and diversity of}} pollinators for the biofuel plant Jatropha curcas (L.) in a site of tropical southeastern Mexico, within its center of origin.

The plants produced fruits with both geitonogamy and <b>xenogamy,</b> although insect pollination significantly increased the number and quality of fruits. A high diversity of flower visiting insects (36 species) was found, of which nine were classified as efficient pollinators. The native stingless bees Scaptotrigona mexicana (Guérin-Meneville) and Trigona (Tetragonisca) angustula (Latreille) were the most frequent visitors and their presence coincided with the hours when the stigma was receptive.

We aim to test the compatibility between flower color varieties in G. lutea and its dependence on pollen vectors. Within a sympatric population containing both flower color morphs, we analyzed differences in reproductive success (number, weight, viability and germinability of seeds) depending on fertilization treatments (autogamy and <b>xenogamy</b> within variety and among varieties). We found a 93 % reduction in number of seeds and a 37 % reduction in seed weight respectively of autogamy treatments compared to <b>xenogamy</b> crossings. Additionally, reproductive success is higher within color varieties than among varieties, due to a 45 % seed viability reduction on hybrids from different varieties.

40|$|Withania ashwagandha Kaul (Solanaceae) is {{an annual}} plant species of immense {{medicinal}} importance. It is {{a repository of}} a large number of pharmacologically active secondary metabolites known as withanolides. Evidence for the delimitation of the species from W. somnifera has been provided by our group using multidisciplinary approaches. Knowledge of reproductive biology of medicinal plants is crucial for improvement, effective conservation and management plans to evolve genetically superior varieties. The present paper reports our findings on the floral biology, pollination behavior and breeding system of W. ashwagandha in natural populations grown at our experimental field under near natural conditions. Flowering (peak) takes place during April–July and anthesis occurs between 08 : 00 and 11 : 00 h. The period of stigma receptivity coincides with anther dehiscence. Fruit set on pollination treatments ranged from 90. 8 % (passive autogamy), 72 % (assisted autogamy), 30. 30 % (<b>xenogamy),</b> and 56. 50 % (geitonogamy) through 50. 40 % (open pollination). <b>Xenogamy</b> brings about very low fruit set, seed-set and seed germination percentages. It is inferred that W. ashwagandha is predominantly an autogamous and self-compatible species. Self-compatibility is mainly accomplished due to close proximity of stigma and anthers. This work is the first report on the reproductive biology of W. ashwagandha and will be useful for conservation and development of improved varieties of this multipurpose herb.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe {{extent to}} which plants depend on pollinators for outcross pollen {{transportation}} is a key issue in plant reproductive ecology. We evaluated the putative breeding system, floral display, and natural pollination in two Southern Cone of South American orchids, Gavilea araucana and G. venosa, by performing four hand pollination trials (agamospermy, autogamy, geitonogamy, and <b>xenogamy</b> tests) and by counting each flower and fruit produced by plants in natural conditions. Fruit set differed significantly depending {{on the origin of}} pollen {{as well as on the}} presence of a pollen vector. None of these species produced fruits by the agamospermy tests, therefore indicating that they require the presence of pollen on the stigmas for fruit setting. By contrast, only G. araucana was capable of fruit setting following the autogamy test, therefore demostrating that this orchid needs not depend on pollinators for fruit set. Furthermore, G. araucana and G. venosa produced 100 % fruits by geitonogamy and by <b>xenogamy,</b> thereby indicating that both plants are totally self-compatible. The mean number of flowers per plant was 2. 1 times higher in G. venosa with respect to G. araucana; however, natural fruiting success was 28. 8 % and 98. 9 %, respectively. Furthermore, while the increase in fruiting success significantly and positively correlated with an increase in floral display in G. araucana, in G. venosa these variables were unrelated.

30|$|In this study, fruits were {{produced}} after the autogamy treaments, suggesting T. sinense is autonomously self-pollinated. T. sinense also exhibits several floral traits specially associated with self-pollination: bisexual flower, the recurved style positioned {{lower than the}} anthers, protogyny, no temporal separation between pollen viability and stigma receptivity (Faegri & van der Pijl 1979). However, the fruit set, seed mass and germinate rate from autogamy are significantly lower than that from <b>xenogamy</b> and control. In addition, pollination experiments showed that fruit set of T. sinense in natural population was limited by pollinators, {{and there is no}} agamospermy.

Reproductive output from four manual pollination treatments (autogamy, geitonogamy, <b>xenogamy,</b> and distant <b>xenogamy)</b> was examined in a common garden. Pod set, seed set, and seed germination were quantified {{for each of the}} treatments. Seed set from four wild populations was compared to that of an openly visited common garden array. A. filipes was found to be self-compatible, but to benefit greatly from outcrossing. Less seed germinated from distantly outcrossed treatments than for any other treatment, indicating possible outbreeding depression. Common garden plants set less seed per pod than any wild population, possibly due to a depauperate pollinator guild in the common garden. Bees were surveyed at wild A. filipes populations to identify common pollinators. Solitary and social bee species were observed visiting A. filipes to estimate aspects of their pollination efficacies, particularly foraging tempo and frequency of stigmatic contact. The nesting biologies of bees that visit A. filipes were considered as a component of bee manageability. Bees in the genus Osmia (Megachilidae) dominated this pollinator guild. Bombus nevadensis queens were the fastest foragers; honey bees and native solitary bees did not differ in foraging tempo. Megachilid bees consistently contacted the stigma during foraging, but honey bees exhibited sideworking behavior, contacting stigmas far less frequently than any other bee species observed.

40|$|Campanula medium L. (Campanulaceae) is a {{biennial}} herb, {{endemic to}} Italy (NW Tuscany and Liguria) and SE France (Provence) (1). However, presently it is widespread as sub-spontaneous across Europe, {{probably due to}} its high ornamental interest as cut flower, with many existing cultivars. The plant is also protected in Tuscany, listed in the annex A of the regional law n° 56 / 2000. Given the high economical and local conservational interest of this species, we decided to investigate its pollination ecology, whose knowledge represents a crucial step to optimise cultivation and conservation plans. It {{is well known that}} Campanulaceae show secondary pollen presentation mechanism, in order to increase the accuracy of pollen capture and transfer by pollinators, and Campanula in particular shows also proterandry (2). Despite this, the pollination ecology of C. medium has never been investigated before. A natural population in the Apuan Alps (Tuscany, Massa Carrara) was investigated from June to September 2008. To determine the breeding system, four experimental treatments were applied on 48 randomly chosen flowers from 24 different individuals: (i) spontaneous self-pollination, to test autonomous self-pollination within a single flower, (ii) forced self-pollination and (iii) forced geitonogamy; (iv) forced <b>xenogamy,</b> to test for outcrossing ability. A control group (14 flowers freely exposed to environment) was selected. Each flower was marked and checked daily, to document flower senescence, fruit production and fruit seed set. According to (3), Index of Self-Incompatibility (ISI) and Index of Automatic Self-pollination (IAS) were calculated. In addition, the percentage of pollen limitation within the population was assessed as indicated in (4). We investigated secondary pollen presentation and the temporal dynamics of the sexual phases. Flowers in different flowering stages were randomly sampled in order to estimate pollen viability (by means of the tetrazolium assay, using MTT) and stigma receptivity (by means of Perex test) (5). Concerning stigma biology, its opening and receptivity were studied in relation to the presence of the pollen on the style. In addition, the pollinators and their behavior during the visits were recorded. The most representative ones were collected for identification. To test correlations and significant trends (p ≤ 0. 01), the Spearman Index and Kruskal-Wallis test were applied. Our study showed that C. medium is partially self-compatible, partially autogamous and mostly outcrossing. The fruit set from experimental <b>xenogamy</b> was higher than that resulting from controls, suggesting a pollen limitation in the population studied. Proterandry for the species is confirmed: male and female phases were clearly separated and the presence of pollen on the style affects negatively the receptivity and the opening speed of the stigma. In addition, our study highlighted that the time of anthesis was longer in plants with a self-pollination treatment (14. 13 ± 4. 32 days) than plants subject to <b>xenogamy</b> (4. 15 ± 1. 52). This delay in flower senescence, probably due to a lower production of ethylene (6), could be an interesting issue concerning the knowledge of floral life span, {{which is one of the}} most important parameters in species of horticultural interest, and especially in cut flowers.

They possess {{secondary}} pollen presentation mechanism as a device to avoid autonomous autogamy but it does not prevent geitonogamy.   The fruit set largely occurs through geitonogamy and <b>xenogamy.</b>   The papilionid and pierid butterflies, and sphingid hawk moth pollinate the flowers while nectar collection.   Honey bees and blue-banded digger bees feed on pollen and effect only accidental pollination.   The nectar is sucrose-rich and contains essential and non-essential amino acids.   Birds are seed dispersal agents.   Seeds are non-dormant and germinate readily but their continued growth and establishment is subject to the availability of soil moisture and nutrients. The plant is not able to populate itself in its natural area.   Further, the local uses of flowers and leaves of this plant appear to be negatively affecting its reproductive success.   P. tomentosa serves as a keystone species for bees and butterflies because this is the only prominent and profuse flowering species during dry season in the study region. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{flowering}} phenology, pollination {{ecology and}} breeding system of Caesalpinia crista L. were studied in Dinghushan Nature Reserve, Guangdong, China. The species started blooming in February or March, then last till late April. It took about one week from first flower appearance {{to its full}} blooming, which lasted for 2 - 4 d. The pollen-ovule ratio was 18 000 ± 500. The breeding system was self-incompatible, and protogynous <b>xenogamy.</b> Hymenoptera constituted the major group of pollinators. The pollination type is ambophily, the species could be pollinated by wind if the pollinators were unavailable: {{this is the first}} record of ambophily in the genus Caesalpinia. The floral structure adaptation to the pollinating behavior of carpenter bees was described. The influences of artificial treatments in pollination biological studies on the flowering and fruiting of the plants were also discussed. Key words: pollination; ambophily; breeding system; flowering phenology; Caesalpinioideae; Caesalpinia crista Plant reproductive ecology is a vital and highly produc-tive field within modern biology (Lovett Doust and Lovett Doust, 1988; Richards, 1997; Geber et al., 1999). Caesalpinia is a pantropical genus with 120 - 150 species of trees, shrubs, and lianas, but the study of pollination ecology of the ge...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mating system}} of Sesbania sesban was studied using one natural {{population}} and two cultivated populations. A {{large number of}} progeny (600) was assayed from each population for one polymorphic locus of Malate dehydrogenase (Mdh). The level of out-crossing in the studied populations ranged from 40 – 100 %. The genotype frequencies were in agreement {{with those of the}} Hardy-Weinberg expected genotype proportions as in randomly mating populations at P < 0. 05. The floral structure and the pollen shedding behaviour of the flowers of S. sesban could favour cross-pollination and/or self-pollination depending on the circumstances. Self-pollination usually occurs late in the flowering period when pollinators fail to visit the flowers. Such a “delayed selfing” facilitates out-crossing in the presence of appropriate pollinators under natural conditions, but confers a selective advantage where pollinators are limiting. The results indicated that S. sesban could be self-fertilized in the absence of pollinators or could out-cross with other heterozygous individuals in the neighboring population when suitable pollinators are available. S. sesban exhibits “facultative <b>xenogamy</b> ” or “delayed selfing” and is a mixed mating species. Key words/phrases: Allozymes, delayed selfing, Hardy-Weinberg equilib-rium, malate dehydrogenase, mixed mating syste...|$|E
40|$|Acrotriche serrulata {{exhibits}} {{a complex and}} uncommon form of flowering. It starts with a male-phase flower that shows secondary pollen presentation on the perianth and follows with a female phase after the corolla is removed or abscissed. We examined the potential for insects, lizards, and mammals to act as pollinators. Observations and experiments on breeding system, phenology, floral scent, flower visitors, and lizard feeding were undertaken in southern Australia. Acrotriche serrulata sets little fruit by autonomous selfing but readily sets fruit after facilitated geitonogamy and <b>xenogamy.</b> Flower anthesis is diurnal and nocturnal. The nectar profile includes acetaldehyde, ethanol, and ethyl acetate. The nocturnal mammals Trichosurus vulpecula and the introduced Rattus rattus were the only visitors observed to actively forage on the flowers. In contrast, the skinks Egernia whitii, Niveoscincus ocellatus, and Niveoscincus metallicus routinely passed flowers full of nectar and foraged only on those presented during feeding observations. Insects visited the flowers but did not behave as pollinators. Acrotriche serrulata {{is likely to be}} pollinated by nocturnal mammals attracted to its flowers by scent. Effective pollinators appear to be rare over some of its range. This may have implications for the long-term reproductive success and conservation of A. serrulata...|$|E
