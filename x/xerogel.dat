5000|$|V2O5 gels are {{prepared}} using the ion-exchange method. Vanadium (V) polymerizes aniline. Before synthesis of a hybrid battery, potentiometric titration of V2O5 gel with (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2*6H2O is carried out; this determines {{the amount of}} V(V) present in the gel. Aniline solution is slowly added onto the V2O5*nH2O gel. The following procedure is demonstrated in Figure 3. [...] V2O5 is used because of its high specific capacity, high thermal stability, and high structural flexibility with lithium. Up to three moles of lithium ions can be added into the V2O5 lattice to create different structures. The structures created give the hybrid a long battery life. However, the intercalation capacity depends on the moderate electrical conductivity and low diffusion coefficient of the lithium ions in the vanadium oxide matrix. Polyaniline is easily produced to have controlled structural and electronic properties. Polyaniline eliminates the coordinated water of the V2O5 <b>xerogel,</b> so more lithium ions can {{be integrated into the}} structure. The organic part of the PAni/V2O5 hybrid degrades with the increase of temperature. V(V) is reduced to V(IV), and aniline is oxidized to polyaniline. Re-oxidizing V(IV) to a higher oxidation state of V(V) increases initial cell voltage and specific capacity. Since polyaniline is an electrochemically active component, it improves the specific charge of the hybrid material. Combining polyaniline with V2O5 yields a larger specific charge difference. Thus, a greater total capacity contribution than V2O5 alone. Furthermore, the hybrid has a higher specific capacity than that of the V2O5 <b>xerogel.</b> Electrical conductivity is as high as 0.09 S/cm for 15 days.|$|E

Abstract: In this work, {{cordierite}} was synthesized by the sol-gel process, using {{a simple}} aqueous process from sodium metassilicate, aluminum nitrate and magnesium nitrate as reagents. Three original syntheses route were developed, {{in order to}} compare the <b>xerogel</b> homogeneity, since the particle size depends on the process route and the <b>xerogel</b> composition. The <b>xerogel,</b> formed by gelation of the reagent aqueous solutions, showed segregation of phases. However, {{the presence of a}} high concentration of urea, as chelante agent, avoided the salts efflorescence and the precipitation of insoluble hydroxilate cation species, maintaining the gel homogeneity during the gelation and the drying process. The AI MASNMR spectra for both xerogels, exposed or not to NH 3 /H 2 O vapor atmosphere, allowed to compare their respective homogeneity degree, because the ratio of [AI(4) /AI(6) ] can be correlated with the aluminosilicate homogeneity. An increase in the [AI(4) /AI(6) ] ratio represents that more aluminum ion enters into the <b>xerogel</b> network as [AIO 4], causing the enhancement on its homogeneity degree. The AI MASNMR spectra suggested that the <b>xerogel</b> exposed to NH 3 /H 2 O vapor was more homogeneous than the <b>xerogel</b> that was not exposed, because it was observed more aluminum ions in the tetrahedral coordination in this <b>xerogel.</b> These results were correlated with XRD spectra for the crystalline phase evolution during the <b>xerogel</b> calcination. The calcination of the xerogels showed different crystallization temperatures, since the most homogeneous <b>xerogel</b> crystallizes to cordierite phases at lowest temperature. The <b>xerogel</b> not exposed to NH 3 /H 2 O vapor produced m-cordierite, spinel (MgAI 2 O 4), and quartz, after 48 h of calcination at 900 °C. A similar phase evolution occurred for the <b>xerogel</b> exposed to NH 3 /H 2 O vapor, but the crystallization kinetics and polymorphic transformation were faster in this case. Therefore, the <b>xerogel</b> exposed to NH 3 /H 2 O vapor was more homogeneous than the one not exposed, because stable cordierite (a-cordierite) crystallization occurred at low temperature...|$|E

The specific aim {{of this paper is}} to synthesise hybrid <b>xerogels</b> in acid media using methyltriethoxysilane (MTEOS) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as silica precursors and to investigate the effect of the MTEOS molar ratio on the structure and porous texture of <b>xerogels.</b> Gelation time exponentially increased as the MTEOS molar ratio increased. Increasing the MTEOS molar ratio yielded <b>xerogels</b> with lower density and lower particle size. The incorporation of MTEOS resulted in new FTIR bands at 1276 and 791 cm- 1, which was attributed to vibrational modes of methyl group. The band around 1092 cm- 1 associated with siloxane bonds shifted to lower wavenumbers and split into two bands. The 29 Si spectra only showed the Q n (n= 2, 3, 4) signal in <b>xerogels</b> with 0 % MTEOS and the T n (n= 2, 3) signal in <b>xerogels</b> with 100 % MTEOS; hybrid <b>xerogels</b> showed both Q and T signals.

Increasing the MTEOS molar ratio produced <b>xerogels</b> with lower pore volumes and lower average pore size.

To proceed with research in this area, we suggest in the present study to use as a support the TuO 2 –SiO 2 bi...|$|E
40|$|Biodegradable, controlled-release carrier {{materials}} with non-toxic degradation products are valuable for local delivery of biologically active molecules. Previously, {{it was shown}} that room-temperature processed silica sol-gels (or <b>xerogels)</b> are porous, resorbable materials that can release molecules of various sizes in a controlled, time dependent manner. Previous in vitro studies also demonstrated benefits of silica <b>xerogels</b> as controlled-release materials {{for the treatment of}} bone infections. Herein the tissue and cell response to <b>xerogels</b> is documented using a subacute implantation procedure. The tissue response was correlated to composition, surface properties, resorption rate and incorporation of the antibiotic vancomycin. Ca- and P-free and Ca- and P-containing <b>xerogels,</b> with and without apatite (AP) surface, were used. <b>Xerogels</b> were implanted either as discs in a subcutaneous site, or as granules in the iliac crest of New Zealand white rabbits. The samples with surrounding tissue were retrieved after 2 and 4 weeks of implantation. Silica <b>xerogels</b> implanted either as discs subcutaneously or as granules in the iliac crest showed a favorable tissue response. The granules, either with or without Ca and P content, gradually resorbed over time. The resorption was accompanied by extensive trabecular bone growth and a minimal inflammatory response. Ca- and P-containing granules with an AP-surface layer showed a slower resorption rate and more extensive new bone growth than those without AP layer. Among AP-coated granules, those with incorporated vancomycin showed the most favorable tissue response. The present in vivo data together with prior in vitro data suggest that these <b>xerogels</b> have potential as controlled-release materials for the treatment of bone infections and as carrier materials for a variety of other applications. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} of an {{approach}} to incorporate redox-active manganese oxide into the 3 -dimensional porous structure of carbon <b>xerogels</b> under self-limiting electroless conditions. By varying {{the structure of the}} carbon backbone, we found that deposition of manganese oxide preferably takes place on the external surface area of the carbon <b>xerogels.</b> From our detailed analysis we conclude that 3 -dimensional carbon <b>xerogels</b> with particle and pore sizes ranging from 10 to 20 nm and low manganese oxide precursor concentration combined with long deposition times are beneficial for fast operating pseudocapacitance electrodes with high capacitance and effective use of the redox active component. 1...|$|R
40|$|Carbon <b>xerogels</b> were {{prepared}} by the polycondensation of resorcinol and formaldehyde using three different solution pH values and the gels were carbonized at three different temperatures. Results show {{that it is possible}} to tailor the pore texture of carbon <b>xerogels</b> by adjusting the pH of the initial solution and the carbonization temperature. Materials with different textural properties were obtained and used as catalysts for NO oxidation at room temperature. The NO conversions obtained with carbon <b>xerogels</b> were quite high, showing that carbon <b>xerogels</b> are efficient catalysts for NO oxidation. A maximum of 98 % conversion for NO was obtained at initial concentration of NO of 1000 ppm and 10 % of O 2. The highest NO conversions were obtained with the samples presenting the highest surface areas. The temperature of reaction has a strong influence on NO oxidation: the conversion of NO decreases with the increase of reaction temperature...|$|R
