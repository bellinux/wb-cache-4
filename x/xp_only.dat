The version in Windows 2000 and Windows <b>XP</b> <b>only</b> implements SNTP, and violates several aspects of the NTP version 3 standard. Beginning with Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista, a compliant implementation of full NTP is included. Microsoft says that the W32Time service cannot reliably maintain sync time to the range of 1 to 2 seconds. If higher accuracy is desired, Microsoft recommends using a different NTP implementation.|$|E
