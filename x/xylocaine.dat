25|$|Lidocaine, {{also known}} as <b>xylocaine</b> and lignocaine, is a {{medication}} used to numb tissue in a specific area. It {{is also used to}} treat ventricular tachycardia and to perform nerve blocks. Lidocaine mixed {{with a small amount of}} adrenaline (epinephrine) is available to allow larger doses for numbing, to decrease bleeding, and to make the numbing effect last longer. When used as an injectable, it typically begins working within four minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. Lidocaine mixtures may also be applied directly to the skin or mucous membranes to numb the area.|$|E

50|$|Surface {{anaesthesia}} {{is given}} by instillation of 2.5 ml <b>xylocaine.</b> One drop of <b>xylocaine</b> instilled four times after every 4 minutes will produce conjunctival and corneal anaesthesia. Paracaine, tetracaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine etc. may also be used in place of <b>xylocaine.</b> Cataract surgery by phacoemulsification is frequently performed under surface anaesthesia. Facial nerve, which supplies the orbicularis oculi muscle, is blocked in addition for intraocular surgeries. Topical anaesthesia is known to cause endothelial and epithelial toxicity, allergy and surface keratopathy.|$|E

50|$|Nils Löfgren (18 August 1913 - 21 January 1967) was a Swedish chemist who {{developed}} the anaesthetic Lidocaine (under the name <b>Xylocaine)</b> in 1943. At this time, he had recently finished his licentiate degree, and was teaching organic chemistry at the University of Stockholm. He and his co-worker Bengt Lundqvist sold the rights to <b>Xylocaine</b> to the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra AB.|$|E
5000|$|Topical anesthetics benzocaine, eugenol, {{and forms}} of <b>xylocaine</b> are used topically to numb various areas before {{injections}} or other minor procedures.|$|E
50|$|The pink lady is the defacto term {{describing}} <b>xylocaine</b> viscous and {{a liquid}} antacid such as Maalox for treating emergency room patients {{to help determine}} if the chest pains are either heart or digestive related. Emergency room doctors instruct attending nurses to administer the pink lady, which is actually 10 mL of <b>xylocaine</b> viscous jelly and 20 mL of liquid antacid such as Maalox, or Mylanta, administered orally. Esophageal symptoms may subside indicating that the symptoms could be non-cardiac. If symptoms persist, the attending doctor investigates further for cardiac or other disorders.|$|E

50|$|Topical {{anesthetic}} {{agents are}} typically intraorally to control pain or irritation caused by toothache, teething, or sores in {{or around the}} mouth. Topical anesthetics are available by prescription or over-the-counter. They are available in sprays, dental paste, dental gels, lozenges, ointments and solutions. Anbesol, Chloraseptic, Orajel and <b>Xylocaine</b> are examples of available anesthetics over-the-counter. Some medications are also given {{in order to control}} plaque and gingivitis. This type of medication is typically available in a mouthwash.|$|E

Disassembler) and Mark Newlands (a.k.a. Mark N, Overcast); and took their name from the German word Nasenbluten, which translates as nosebleed. This refers to the phrase [...] "nosebleed techno" [...] as {{used to describe the}} harder and faster variants of the techno genre. Early in 1993 Lubinski founded the Dead Girl Records label (initially typset as dEAdGirL) in Swansea.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of cystoscopy—flexible and rigid—differing in the {{flexibility}} of the cystoscope. Flexible cystoscopy is carried out with local anaesthesia on both sexes. Typically, a topical anesthetic, most often <b>xylocaine</b> gel (common brand names are Anestacon and Instillagel) is employed. The medication is instilled into the urethra via the urinary meatus five to ten minutes prior {{to the beginning of the}} procedure. Rigid cystoscopy can be performed under the same conditions, but is generally carried out under general anaesthesia, particularly in male subjects, due to the pain caused by the probe.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that local anesthetics, {{arterial}} catheters and central venous catheters cause a higher risk in haematoma formation in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients also show a resistance to local anaesthetics. Resistance to <b>Xylocaine</b> and Bupivacaine is not uncommon, and Carbocaine tends to work better in EDS patents. Special recommendations for anesthesia in EDS patients are prepared by orphan anesthesia.eu and deal with all aspects of anesthesia for EDS patients. Detailed recommendations for anesthesia and perioperative care of patients with EDS {{should be used to}} improve patient safety.|$|E
5000|$|Procaine is used less {{frequently}} today since more effective (and hypoallergenic) alternatives such as lidocaine (<b>Xylocaine)</b> exist. Like other local anesthetics (such as mepivacaine, and prilocaine), procaine is a vasodilator, thus is often coadministered with epinephrine {{for the purpose}} of vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction helps to reduce bleeding, increases the duration and quality of anesthesia, prevents the drug from reaching systemic circulation in large amounts, and overall reduces the amount of anesthetic required. Unlike cocaine, a vasoconstrictor, procaine does not have the euphoric and addictive qualities that put it at risk for abuse.|$|E

5000|$|Random {{formed at}} the Brisbane auditions for The X Factor (Australia) in December 2004. Initially <b>Xylocaine</b> [...] "Xy" [...] Latu and Andy-Iese [...] "Jesse" [...] Tolo-Paepae were to compete as a duo, Rough Diamonds; while Tasesa Junior [...] "TJ" [...] Tauvao wanted to enter {{as a solo}} artist: he was {{attending}} with his brother Wayne Tauvao and their cousin, Donald Tauvao - all three were former members of a vocal trio, 315. Prior to auditioning all five agreed to compete as a combined R&B vocal quintet and named themselves, Random. The group were mentored by Mark Holden and won the TV talent contest.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used local anesthetic is lidocaine (also called <b>xylocaine</b> or lignocaine), a modern replacement for procaine (also known as novocaine). Its half-life in the body is about 1.5-2 hours. Other local anesthetic agents in current use include articaine (also called septocaine or ubistesin), bupivacaine (a long-acting anesthetic), and mepivacaine. A combination of these may be used depending on the situation. Also, most agents come in two forms: with and without epinephrine (adrenaline) or other vasoconstrictor that allow the agent to last longer and also controls bleeding in the tissue during procedures. Usually the case is classified using the ASA Physical Status Classification System before any anesthesia is given.|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} was first practiced by Herman Knapp in 1884. Here, 2% <b>xylocaine</b> is {{introduced into the}} muscle cone behind the eyeball. The injection is usually given through the inferior fornix of {{the skin of the}} outer part of the lower lid when the eye is in primary gaze. The ciliary nerves, ciliary ganglion, oculomotor nerve and abducens nerve are anesthetized in retrobulbar block. As a result, global akinesia, anaesthesia and analgesia are produced. The superior oblique muscle, which is outside the muscle cone, is not usually paralyzed. The complications of retrobulbar block are globe perforation, optic nerve injury, retrobulbar haemorrhage and extraocular muscle palsy. Retrobulbar anaesthesia is contraindicated in posterior staphyloma, high axial myopia and enopthalmos.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{inserting}} the probe, mild {{to moderate}} sedation is induced in the patient to ease the discomfort and to decrease the gag reflex, thus making the ultrasound probe easier to pass into the esophagus. Mild or moderate sedation can be induced with medications such as midazolam (a benzodiazepine with sedating, amnesiac qualities), fentanyl (an opioid), or propofol (a sedative/general anesthetic, depending on dosage) [...] Usually a local anesthetic spray {{is used for the}} back of the throat, such a <b>xylocaine</b> and/or a jelly/lubricant anesthetic for the esophagus. Children are anesthetized. Adults are sometimes anesthetized as well. Unlike the TTE, the TEE is considered an invasive procedure and is thus performed by physicians in the U.S., not sonographers.|$|E
50|$|Koller {{introduced}} cocaine as a {{local anaesthetic}} for eye surgery. Prior to this discovery, he had tested solutions such as chloral hydrate and morphine as anaesthetics {{in the eyes of}} laboratory animals without success. Freud was fully aware of the pain-killing properties of cocaine, but Koller recognized its tissue-numbing capabilities, and in 1884 demonstrated its potential {{as a local}} anaesthetic to the medical community. Koller's findings were a medical breakthrough. Prior to his discovery, performing eye surgery was difficult because the involuntary reflex motions of the eye to respond to the slightest stimuli. Later, cocaine was also used as a local anaesthetic in other medical fields such as dentistry. In the 20th century, other agents such as <b>Xylocaine</b> have replaced cocaine as a local anaesthetic.|$|E
5000|$|Random {{a former}} five-member Australian R&B vocal group formed in 2005. Band members included, <b>Xylocaine</b> [...] "Xy" [...] Latu, Wayne Tauvao, Tasesa Junior [...] "TJ" [...] Tauvao, Donald Tauvao and Andy-Iese [...] "Jesse" [...] Tolo-Paepae. Random were {{the winners of}} the first season of The X Factor (Australia); they were also the first (of three worldwide) group to win the franchise. In October that year they issued their debut self-titled album, which peaked in the ARIA Albums Chart top 100. Their first single, [...] "Put Your Hands Up", peaked at No. 7 on the related ARIA Singles Chart. A follow up single, [...] "Are You Ready", reached No. 36. The group disbanded in 2007 but briefly reunited in October 2009 for a one-off performance.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the same}} time, Bloody Fist Records based in Newcastle, Australia {{released}} many records of hardcore/gabber, industrial, and noise. Artists signed to Bloody Fist in its lifetime include Syndicate, <b>Xylocaine,</b> Epsilon and Nasenbluten. Label founder Mark Newlands said, in 1997, [...] "I {{think that the}} uncomfortableness also comes from a reaction towards the mainstream and popular culture that's constantly shoved down our throats, that's forced on the people via television, radio, mass media, etc. I think that also fuels the fire and keeps the aggressiveness there and the uncomfortableness." [...] Newlands described their music as products of [...] "cut'n'paste mentality" [...] and an industrial environment. In her Experimental Music, Gail Priest credits the label as recognized globally for its contributions to the breakcore genre, and for spurring its 1990s development. The Bloody Fist sound became breakcore from what was the noise genre, with added elements of high beats per minute and [...] "extreme, thick, low-fi textures". By way of example, Nasenbluten's 1996 Fuck Anna Wood exemplified this style with controversial public affairs audio samples collaged into dialogue atop early hardcore beats.|$|E
50|$|Evidence of the {{capacity}} for invertebrates to experience nociception and pain has been widely studied in crustaceans. In the crab Neohelice granulata, electric shocks delivered via small holes in the carapace elicited a defensive threat display. Injection of morphine reduced the crabs' sensitivity to the shock in a dose-dependent manner, with the effect declining with increasing duration between morphine injection and shock. Naloxone injection inhibited the effects of morphine, as is seen in vertebrates. Morphine also had inhibitory effects on the escape tail-flick response to electric shock in the mantis shrimp, Squilla mantis, that was reversed by naloxone, indicating that the effect is found in crustacean groups other than decapods. When the irritants acetic acid or sodium hydroxide were applied to the antennae of grass prawns, Penaeus monodon, {{there was an increase}} in rubbing and grooming of the treated areas which was not seen if they had previously been treated with a local anaesthetic, benzocaine, however, the benzocaine did not eliminate the level of rubbing seen in response to mechanical stimulation with forceps. There was no effect of benzocaine on the general locomotion of the prawns, so the reduction in rubbing and grooming was not simply due to inactivity of the animal. Another local anaesthetic, <b>xylocaine,</b> reduced the stress of eyestalk ablation in female whiteleg shrimps, Litopenaeus vannamei, as indicated by levels of feeding and swimming.|$|E
50|$|Resuscitative equipment, {{monitoring}} and personnel must be immediately available prior to performance of this block. The retrobulbar block is {{performed with the}} patient either seated or supine and looking straight ahead. The head should be maintained in a neutral position. A needle (22-27 Gauge, 3 cm long) is inserted at the inferolateral border of the bony orbit and directed straight back until it has passed the equator of the globe. It is then directed medially and cephalad toward {{the apex of the}} orbit. Occasionally a 'pop' is felt as the needle tip passes through the muscle cone delineating the retrobulbar space. Following a negative aspiration for blood, 2-4mls of local anesthetic solution is injected and the needle is withdrawn. 2% Lidocaine (<b>Xylocaine)</b> and 0.5% to 0.75% bupivicaine (Marcaine) are two commonly used agents. Epinephrine, commonly mixed in with local anesthetics for vasconstriction, is not used in seeing eyes as this can cause a central retinal artery occlusion. An enzyme, hyaluronidase, is frequently a component of the anaesthetic solution, as it accelerates and improves dispersal of the agent. Akinesia and anesthesia quickly ensue within minutes with a successful retrobulbar injection.Retrobulbar block can be used successfully for corneal transplantation but may require a supplemental facial nerve block. Retrobulbar block can block levator palpebrae muscle but not orbucularis oculi. Several techniques for facial nerve block can be used in conjunction with retrobulbar block.|$|E
5000|$|Before an NG tube is inserted, {{it must be}} {{measured}} {{from the tip of}} the patient's nose, loop around their ear and then down to roughly 5 cm below the xiphoid process. The tube is then marked at this level to ensure that the tube has been inserted far enough into the patient's stomach. Many commercially available stomach and duodenal tubes have several standard depth markings, for example 18" [...] (46 cm), 22" [...] (56 cm), 26" [...] (66 cm) and 30" [...] (76 cm) from distal end; infant feeding tubes often come with 1 cm depth markings. The end of a plastic tube is lubricated (local anesthetic, such as 2% <b>xylocaine</b> gel, may be used; in addition, nasal vasoconstrictor and/or anesthetic spray may be applied before the insertion) and inserted into one of the patient's anterior nares. The tube should be directed straight towards the back of the patient as it moves through the nasal cavity and down into the throat. When the tube enters the oropharynx and glides down the posterior pharyngeal wall, the patient may gag; in this situation the patient, if awake and alert, is asked to mimic swallowing or is given some water to sip through a straw, and the tube continues to be inserted as the patient swallows. Once the tube is past the pharynx and enters the esophagus, it is easily inserted down into the stomach. The tube must then be secured in place to prevent it from moving.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{analgesic}} {{effect of}} <b>xylocaine</b> alone versus <b>xylocaine</b> with corticosteroid injection after ultrasonographically (US) -guided treatment of rotator cuff calcific tendonosis {{has not been}} described in English literature. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the analgesic effect of <b>xylocaine</b> only with <b>xylocaine</b> and corticosteroid following US-guided percutaneous treatment of rotator cuff calcific tendonosis. Methods: This prospective study enrolled 88 patients who were given different analgesic treatments [xylocaine only, n =  23; <b>xylocaine</b> with corticosteroid, n =  44; control (no <b>xylocaine</b> or corticosteroid), n =  21]. The assessment of a patient's painful symptoms was recorded before treatment, and 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after treatment using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: There were no significant differences in age, sex, calcification size before and after treatment, and amount of calcification decrease after treatment, but there was a significant difference in calcification morphology among the groups (p =  0. 010). General linear model analysis indicated that the three groups had no difference in pain prior to treatment. After treatment, the <b>xylocaine</b> only and the <b>xylocaine</b> with corticosteroid groups had less pain than the control group at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after treatment. At 3 months after treatment, the <b>xylocaine</b> only group had less pain than the control group (p =  0. 039), and the <b>xylocaine</b> with corticosteroid and control groups had similar levels of pain. Conclusion: Injection of <b>xylocaine</b> alone after US-guided treatment of rotator cuff calcific tendonosis provided a longer pain relief period than that of a mixture of <b>xylocaine</b> with corticosteroid...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{compare the}} effect of {{buffered}} commercial 1 % <b>xylocaine</b> (with 1 : 200, 000 adrenaline) and the unbuffered commercial 1 % <b>xylocaine</b> (with 1 : 200, 000 adrenaline) preparation on pain during infiltration and procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomised, double blind controlled trial involving 85 patients who underwent bilateral vasectomy under local infiltration anaesthesia. RESULTS: Each patient served as his own control by receiving the buffered commercial preparation {{on one side and}} unbuffered commercial preparation on the other. Linear analogue pain scores during infiltration and procedure were recorded and analysed. The study demonstrated that pain perceived by the patient both during infiltration and the procedure was significantly lower when buffered commercial <b>xylocaine</b> was used as compared to the pain perceived with the use of unbuffered commercial <b>xylocaine.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Use of buffered <b>xylocaine</b> is a simple, inexpensive and significantly effective way of reducing pain during infiltration and in surgical procedures performed under local anaesthesia...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{effectiveness}} of intravenous atropine sulphate which blocks the peripheral muscarinic receptors at the heart and retrobulbar <b>xylocaine</b> hydrochloride which blocks the conduction at ciliary ganglion on the afferent limb of OCR was studied during strabismus surgery. The study was conducted on fifty three patients of either sex having squint of {{more than ten years}} duration. The patients were randomly allocated into four groups. No preanaesthetic medication with atropine or retrobulbar block with <b>xylocaine</b> was given in control group of patients. In the second group, only preanaesthetic medication with atropine was given; while in the third group only retrobulbar injection of <b>xylocaine</b> was given five minutes before operation. In the last group both atropine as preanaesthetic medication and <b>xylocaine</b> as retrobulbar block were given.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To compare {{analgesic}} {{efficacy and}} pain caused by administration of lidocaine/prilocaine cream (EMLA(R)) versus <b>xylocaine</b> 1 % local infiltration for punch biopsy and electrocoagulation of genital warts in men. DESIGN [...] Open randomised comparative parallel-group study. SETTING [...] Department of Dermatovenereology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Dijkzigt, the Netherlands. PATIENTS [...] 63 males with warts on the genital mucosa and/or perianal area. METHODS [...] EMLA(R) cream (2. 5 - 5 g) was applied during 13 - 45 minutes before surgery. <b>Xylocaine</b> 1 % (0. 1 - 4 ml) was infiltrated 0. 5 - 4 minutes before surgery. Pain during administration and surgery {{was assessed by}} the patient on a verbal rating scale and on a visual analogue scale. RESULTS [...] EMLA(R) application was painless in all patients (n = 31) whereas <b>xylocaine</b> infiltration was slightly painful in 17 / 29 patients and moderately painful in 10 / 29 patients. EMLA(R) analgesia was satisfactory for 94 % of biopsies and 62 % of electrocoagulations. <b>Xylocaine</b> infiltration was satisfactory in all procedures. CONCLUSIONS [...] EMLA(R) application on the male genital mucosa is painless {{but it has a}} lower analgesic efficacy than <b>xylocaine</b> infiltration.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} dilution of paramagnetic contrast agent with iodinated contrast and <b>xylocaine</b> on the signal intensity during magnetic resonance arthrography, and to improve the paramagnetic contrast agent concentration utilized in this imaging modality. Materials and Methods: Samples specially prepared for the study with three different concentrations of paramagnetic contrast agent diluted in saline, iodinated contrast agent and <b>xylocaine</b> were imaged with fast spin echo T 1 -weighted sequences with fat saturation. The samples were placed into flasks and graphical analysis of the signal intensity was performed {{as a function of}} the paramagnetic contrast concentration. Results: As compared with samples of equal concentrations diluted only with saline, the authors have observed an average signal intensity decrease of 20. 67 % for iodinated contrast agent, and of 28. 34 % for <b>xylocaine.</b> However, the increased gadolinium concentration in the samples caused decrease in signal intensity with all the dilutions. Conclusion: Minimizing the use of iodinated contrast media and <b>xylocaine</b> and/or the use of a gadolinium concentration of 2. 5 mmol/L diluted in saline will improve the sensitivity of magnetic resonance arthrography...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of <b>Xylocaine</b> spray for the pain caused by endotracheal tube, and its impact on patients’ satisfaction of intensive care. Methods: A quantitative evaluation of the effect before and after <b>Xylocaine</b> spray on endotracheal tube pain relief, and a qualitative interview study of the impact of this intervention on patients’ satisfaction of intensive care in a prospective, clinical investigation. Those in the medical intensive care unit being endotracheal intubated and being able to clearly communicate with the caregivers were enrolled after providing their inform consent. We prescribed <b>Xylocaine</b> 10 % pump spray as frequently as demanded. Results: Nineteen patients were eligible for this study. The numerical rating scale of the throat pain before local <b>Xylocaine</b> spray were 8. 82 ± 0. 79, 7. 98 ± 0. 92, 7. 07 ± 0. 76, 6. 37 ± 0. 83 and 5. 47 ± 1. 23, sequentially, compared with after therapy results, which were 3. 84 ± 0. 86, 3. 57 ± 0. 74, 3. 06 ± 0. 70, 2. 61 ± 0. 77 and 1. 96 ± 0. 88 (p< 0. 01). The interval between <b>Xylocaine</b> demanded gradually increased with time after endotracheal tube intubation, and was also different between the daytime and the night-time on the first day of admission (p< 0. 001). Most of the patients suffered from throat pain due to endotracheal intubation, and they agreed their satisfaction was affected by the factors, the level of throat pain being controlled (correlation: 0. 89, p< 0. 01), and the caregivers’ attitude with regard to the pain control (correlation: 0. 46, p< 0. 05). Conclusion: <b>Xylocaine</b> spray is demanded is an effective therapy to manage the pain caused by endotracheal tube, which is also crucial to meet patient satisfaction in intensive care...|$|E
40|$|Purpose : To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} intracameral preservative-free 1 &#x 0025; <b>xylocaine</b> on the corneal endothelium as an adjuvant to topical anaesthesia during phacoemulsification and Acrysof foldable IOL implantation. Material &#x 0026; Methods: This is a prospective, controlled, randomised, double-masked study. 106 patients with soft to moderately dense (Grade 1 - 3) senile cataract and corneal endothelial cell density of > 1500 /mm 2 were randomised to the <b>xylocaine</b> group (n= 53) and control group(n= 53). Central endothelial specular microscopy and ultrasound corneal pachymetry were performed preoperatively. On the first postoperative day the eyes were evaluated for corneal oedema and Descemet&#x 2032;s folds. Ultrasound corneal pachymetry was performed at 1, 3 and 12 months. Specular microscopy was performed at 3 and 12 months. Cell loss was expressed {{as a percentage of}} preoperative cell density. Six patients could not complete one year follow-up.
