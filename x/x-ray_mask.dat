Although the SU- 8 before photo-curing has been evaluated as a negative-tone photoresist for ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray lithographies, the characteristic of the SU- 8 after photo-curing has not been investigated. A polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sheet was irradiated by a synchrotron radiation through an <b>X-ray</b> <b>mask,</b> and relationships between the dose energy and exposure depth, and between the dose energy and dimensional transition, were investigated.

Some of them can be investigated by double exposures evaluated with overlay measurement methods. We use a method that needs a minimum of process steps. Both exposures are made within the same resist. The resist patterns are measured directly. No additional processing step other than lithography and resist developing are necessary. We built an experimental alignment system for x-ray lithography in a vacuum chamber, so we can expose in vacuum or in a He atmosphere. A swivel-mounted microscope allows the observation of the alignment marks on the mask and on the wafer. With six motordriven screws we can adjust wafer to mask. With another setup it is possible to make tilted exposures. After the double exposure we measure the relative position of special metrology marks with light optics on an accuracy of 30 nm (3 delta value).
