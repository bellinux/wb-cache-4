25|$|Sugar-free gum {{sweetened}} with <b>xylitol</b> {{has been}} shown to reduce cavities and plaque. The sweetener sorbitol has the same benefit, but is only about one-third as effective as <b>xylitol.</b> Other sugar substitutes, such as maltitol, aspartame and acesulfame K, have also been found to not cause tooth decay. <b>Xylitol</b> is specific in its inhibition of Streptococcus mutans, bacteria that are significant contributors to tooth decay. <b>Xylitol</b> inhibits Streptococcus mutans in the presence of other sugars, with the exception of fructose. <b>Xylitol</b> is a safe sweetener that benefits teeth and saliva production because, unlike most sugars, it is not fermented to acid. Daily doses of <b>xylitol</b> below 3.44grams are ineffective and doses above 10.32grams show no additional benefit. Other active ingredients in chewing gum include fluoride, which strengthens tooth enamel, and p-chlorbenzyl-4-methylbenzylpiperazine, which prevents travel sickness. Chewing gum also increases saliva production.|$|E
25|$|As of 2015 the {{evidence}} concerning use of <b>xylitol</b> (a sugar alcohol) in chewing gum was insufficient {{to determine if}} it is effective at preventing caries.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of sugar substitutes approved {{for food use}} are artificially synthesized compounds. However, some bulk natural sugar substitutes are known, including sorbitol and <b>xylitol,</b> which are found in berries, fruit, vegetables, and mushrooms. It is not commercially viable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, so they are produced by catalytic hydrogenation of the appropriate reducing sugar. For example, xylose is converted to <b>xylitol,</b> lactose to lactitol, and glucose to sorbitol. Other natural substitutes are known, but these have yet to gain official approval for food use.|$|E
25|$|Dental care – Carbohydrates and sugars usually {{adhere to}} the tooth enamel, where {{bacteria}} feed upon them and quickly multiply. The bacteria convert the sugar to acids that decay the teeth. Sugar substitutes, unlike sugar, do not erode teeth as they are not fermented by the microflora of the dental plaque. A sweetener that can actually benefit dental health is <b>xylitol,</b> which tends to prevent bacteria from adhering to the tooth surface, thus preventing plaque formation and eventually decay. <b>Xylitol</b> cannot be fermented by bacteria that feed on sugar, so they have difficulty thriving, thus helping to prevent plaque formation.|$|E
25|$|Mannitol is {{classified}} as a sugar alcohol; that is, it {{can be derived from}} a sugar (mannose) by reduction. Other sugar alcohols include <b>xylitol</b> and sorbitol. Mannitol and sorbitol are isomers, the only difference being the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 2.|$|E
25|$|Foods {{containing}} sorbitol, {{present in}} some diet drinks and foods, and occurring naturally in some stone fruits, or <b>xylitol,</b> present in some berries, and other polyols (sugar alcohols), such as erythritol, mannitol, and other ingredients that end with -tol, commonly added as artificial sweeteners in commercial foods.|$|E
25|$|Agents {{are added}} to {{suppress}} the tendency of toothpaste to dry into a powder. Included are various sugar alcohols, such as glycerol, sorbitol, or <b>xylitol,</b> or related derivatives, such as 1,2-propylene glycol and polyethyleneglycol. Strontium chloride or potassium nitrate is included in some toothpastes to reduce sensitivity. Sodium polyphosphate is added to minimize the formation of tartar.|$|E
25|$|Calcium, {{as found}} in food such as milk and green vegetables, is often {{recommended}} to protect against dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent decay of a tooth by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. Streptococcus mutans {{is the leading cause}} of tooth decay. Low concentration fluoride ions act as bacteriostatic therapeutic agent and high concentration fluoride ions are bactericidal. The incorporated fluorine makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and, thus, resistant to decay. Topical fluoride is more highly recommended than systemic intake such as by tablets or drops to protect the surface of the teeth. This may include a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash or varnish. Standard fluoride toothpaste (1,000–1,500 ppm) is more effective than low fluoride toothpaste (< 600ppm) to prevent dental caries. After brushing with fluoride toothpaste, rinsing should be avoided and the excess spat out. Many dental professionals include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine visits and recommend the use of <b>xylitol</b> and amorphous calcium phosphate products. Silver diamine fluoride may work better than fluoride varnish to prevent cavities. Water fluoridation also lowers the risk of tooth decay.|$|E

2500|$|The {{three primary}} {{compounds}} used as sugar substitutes in the United States are saccharin (e.g., Sweet'N Low), aspartame (e.g., Equal, NutraSweet) and sucralose (e.g., Splenda, Altern). Maltitol and sorbitol are often used, frequently in toothpaste, mouth wash, and in {{foods such as}} [...] "no sugar added" [...] ice cream. Erythritol is gaining momentum {{as a replacement for}} these other sugar alcohols in foods as it is much less likely to produce gastrointestinal distress when consumed in large amounts. In many other countries, <b>xylitol,</b> cyclamate, and the herbal sweetener stevia are used extensively.|$|E
2500|$|Other common {{preventative}} measures {{center on}} reducing sugar intake. One way {{this is done}} is with sugar replacements such as <b>Xylitol</b> or Erythritol which cannot be metabolized into sugars which normally enhance S. mutans growth.

2500|$|Hydrogenation is {{a useful}} means for {{converting}} unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives. [...] Substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes, but also aldehydes, imines, and nitriles, which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds, i.e. alcohols and amines. [...] Thus, alkyl aldehydes, which can be synthesized with the oxo process from carbon monoxide and an alkene, {{can be converted to}} alcohols. E.g. 1-propanol is produced from propionaldehyde, produced from ethene and carbon monoxide. <b>Xylitol,</b> a polyol, is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar xylose, an aldehyde. Primary amines can be synthesized by hydrogenation of nitriles, while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile. For example, isophorone diamine, a precursor to the polyurethane monomer isophorone diisocyanate, is produced from isophorone nitrile by a tandem nitrile hydrogenation/reductive amination by ammonia, wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into an amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another amine.|$|E

50|$|<b>Xylitol</b> {{is often}} fatal to dogs. According to the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, {{the number of}} cases of <b>xylitol</b> {{toxicosis}} in dogs has significantly increased since the first reports in 2002. Dogs that have eaten foods containing <b>xylitol</b> (greater than 100 milligrams of <b>xylitol</b> consumed per kilogram of bodyweight) have presented with low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening. Low blood sugar can result in a loss of coordination, depression, collapse and seizures in as little as 30 minutes. Intake of doses of <b>xylitol</b> (greater than 500 - 1000 mg/kg bwt) has been implicated in liver failure in dogs, which can be fatal. The possible cause of hypoglycemia experienced by dogs is that <b>xylitol</b> in chewing gum is released more slowly and absorbed over longer period than when it is consumed as a pure form.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Xylitol</b> [...] is a {{sugar alcohol}} {{used as a}} sweetener. The name derives from ξύλον, xylon, [...] "wood" [...] + suffix -itol, used to denote sugar alcohols. <b>Xylitol</b> is {{categorized}} as a polyalcohol or sugar alcohol (alditol). It has the formula CH2OH(CHOH)3CH2OH and is an achiral isomer of pentane-1,2,3,4,5-pentol. [...] Multiple studies utilizing electron microscopy have indicated that <b>xylitol</b> is effective in inducing remineralization of deeper layers of demineralized enamel. Fair evidence was found that <b>xylitol</b> (as chewing gum, lozenges, nasal spray, etc.) reduced the incidence of acute middle ear infection in healthy children.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xylitol</b> is {{a natural}} sweetener, {{also known as a}} sugar alcohol. <b>Xylitol</b> {{inhibits}} acid production by oral bacteria and promotes remineralisation of the teeth. It can be found in various products which include chewing gums and lozenges. <b>Xylitol</b> has been found to reduce mutans strepococci in plaque and saliva and reduce the binding of these to the acquired enamel pellicle. This in turn leads to less adherent plaque and a decrease in acid production. In addition, chewing <b>xylitol</b> gum will stimulate increased salivary flow which in turn increases the amount of calcium in the saliva and enhances the oral clearance.|$|E

One of the reasons for lower <b>xylitol</b> production was mutation in a putative gene encoding for an aldo-keto reductase that catalyzes the reduction of xylose to <b>xylitol.,</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Early {{studies from}} Finland in the 1970s found, {{compared}} with chewing sucrose-sweetened gum, <b>xylitol</b> resulted in nearly two fewer cavities or missing teeth. [...] Cavity-causing bacteria prefer six-carbon sugars or disaccharides, while <b>xylitol</b> is non-fermentable and {{cannot be used}} as an energy source - while still being taken up into the cell (due to similar shape) and interfering with bacterial growth and reproduction. The harmful micro-organisms are starved in the presence of <b>xylitol,</b> allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption. This same property renders it unsuitable for making bread as it interferes with the ability of yeast to digest sugars. [...] At least six grams of <b>xylitol</b> per day, in three to five chewing episodes, is thought to be needed for dental efficacy. A source of <b>xylitol</b> that releases it slowly, and a one- to three-minute initial pulse are thought to improve the dental effect.|$|E
