40|$|The {{issue of}} the {{observability}} of Old Isolated Neutron Stars (ONSs) accreting from the interstellar gas, is reconsidered using the spectra presented in Zampieri et al. (1995). In particular, we focus our attention on the overall soft <b>X</b> [...] <b>ray</b> emission of ONSs, which may provide a substantial contribution to the <b>X</b> [...] <b>ray</b> <b>background</b> in the 0. 5 [...] 2 keV band. It is found that if accretion is channeled into polar caps by a magnetic field of ∼ 10 ^ 9 G, up to ∼ 12 - 25 % of the unresolved soft excess observed at high latitudes in the <b>X</b> [...] <b>ray</b> <b>background</b> can be {{explained in terms of}} emission from accreting isolated ONSs.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} 2 - 10 keV X-ray {{emission}} of complete samples of AGN and galaxies selected at 12 and recently compiled by Rush, Malkan & Spinoglio (1993). As a necessary complement we also study the IR emissivity {{of the largest}} sample of hard <b>X</b> [...] <b>ray</b> selected AGN (Grossan 1992). Our purposes are to probe the unified scheme of active nuclei and to evaluate the local <b>X</b> [...] <b>ray</b> volume emissivity of low luminosity and `hidden' AGN. We confirm that X-ray emission is basically restricted to AGN, Seyfert 1 's being much more powerful emitters than Seyfert 2 's. We find no signal of X-ray emission for the remaining galaxies selected at 12, not even for those having a flat far-infrared spectrum, which would be prime candidates to host hidden AGN. Our result on the local volume emissivity of the Seyfert 1 's is fully consistent with those derived from studies of the hard <b>X</b> [...] <b>ray</b> luminosity function.

40|$|We {{present the}} X-ray source number counts in two energy bands (0. 5 - 2 and 2 - 10 keV) {{from a very}} large source sample: we combine data of six {{different}} surveys, both shallow wide field and deep pencil beam, performed with three different satellites (ROSAT, Chandra and XMM-Newton). The sample covers with good statistics the largest possible flux range so far: [2. 4 * 10 ^- 17 - 10 ^- 11] cgs in the soft band and [2. 1 * 10 ^- 16 - 8 * 10 ^{- 12 }]cgs in the hard band. Integrating the flux distributions over this range and {{taking into account the}} (small) contribution of the brightest sources we derive the flux density generated by discrete sources in both bands. After a critical review of the literature values of the total Cosmic <b>X</b> [...] <b>Ray</b> <b>Background</b> (CXB) we conclude that, with the present data, the 94. 3 %, and 88. 8 % of the soft and hard CXB can be ascribed to discrete source emission.

Three of the five models predicting the relative X ray to optical or radio flare luminosities are in serious disagreement with the observations. For the largest optical flare with coincident X ray coverage, the 3 sigma upper limit on X ray emission in the 0. 15 to 0. 8 keV band is 8. 7 x 10 to the 28 th power erg/s, corresponding to a ratio of X ray to B-band luminosity of less than 0. 3.

40|$|Some {{results on}} the nature of the {{interstellar}} medium that are specifically concerned with the disk-halo interaction are discussed. Over the last five years or so it has become clear that the supernovae rate in our Galaxy is spatially clumped and the consequences of such clumping are superbubbles and supershells fed by tens or hundreds of supernovae per shell. These objects evolve and expand rapidly and soon break out of the disk of the Galaxy, feeding the halo with very significant mass, energy, and momentum. As cooling occurs, gas will rain down onto the disk of the Galaxy completing the cycle. The basic flow of physical quantities from disk to halo and vice versa are discussed. Some of the many implications are noted including aspects of dynamo theory, quasar absorption lines, the theory of galactic coronae, and the nature of the <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> <b>background.</b> The essential difference here with the McKee-Ostriker (1977) theory is that the filling factor of the hot gas in the disk is significantly less than unity...|$|E

The intensity is dependent on galactic longitude even when only high galactic data are used, allowing the setting of a lower limit of 20 pct. on the galactic contribution to the mean emission band. The spectrum of the total background is consistent with a power law of slope similar to 0. 7 between 0. 16 and 3. 5 keV with evidence for a steep rise toward lower energies.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} Lyman-alpha forest cloud systems are combined with observations on the baryonic mass density of the Universe and constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis to set boundary conditions on the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) at the epoch of z= 2. 5. The Universe is considered a closed system and allowed to expand adiabatically from the epoch when QSOs first ionized the IGM (5 <= z_on <= 20). The average kinetic energy of a gas is calculated in the region where the gas transitions from relativistic to non-relativistic behavior. All of the above measurements are then {{used to determine the}} thermal history of the IGM in the redshift range 2. 5 <= z <= z_on. The hot IGM is assumed to inverse Compton scatter photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMBR) and consequently distort the CMBR as seen at the present epoch. The temperature of the IGM at z= 2. 5 and the epoch z_on are adjusted, within the constraints defined above, to give the best overall agreement with published data on the temperature of the IGM. We find that the model of the IGM proposed here does not grossly distort the CMBR, and in fact agrees quite closely with the preliminary results from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite.

40|$|When {{the neutral}} {{interstellar}} medium {{is exposed to}} EUV and soft X ray radiation, the argon atoms in it are far more susceptible to being ionized than the hydrogen atoms. We make use of this fact to determine the level of ionization in the nearby, warm, neutral medium (WNM). By analyzing FUSE observations of ultraviolet spectra of 44 hot subdwarf stars a few hundred pc away from the Sun, we can compare column densities of Ar I to those of O I, where the relative ionization of oxygen {{can be used as}} a proxy for that of hydrogen. The measured deficiency [Ar I/O I]= 0. 427 +/- 0. 11 dex below the expectation for a fully neutral medium implies that the electron density n(e) ∼ 0. 04 cm^- 3 if n(H) = 0. 5 cm^- 3. This amount of ionization is considerably larger than what we expect from primary photoionizations resulting from cosmic rays, the diffuse X-ray background, and X-ray emitting sources within the medium, along with the additional ionizations caused by energetic secondary photoelectrons, Auger electrons, and photons from helium recombinations. We favor an explanation that bursts of radiation created by previous, nearby supernova remnants that have faded by now may have elevated the ionization, and the gas has not yet recombined to a quiescent level. A different alternative is that the low energy portion of the soft <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> <b>background</b> is poorly shielded by the H I because it is frothy and has internal pockets of very hot, X-ray emitting gases.

The HXRBS data covers the <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> spectrum from about 25 keV to about 440 keV in 15 spectral channels, while the BCS data used covers a region of the Spectrum around 3 angstroms including emission from the Ca XIX ion.

Despite of these strengths, ultrafast <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> have been poor at picking up excited state moieties from the unexcited ones. With time resolved anti Stokes resonant <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> Raman scattering AS RXRS performed at the LCLS, and ab initio theory we establish background free excited state selectivity {{in addition to the}} elemental, chemical, orbital and magnetic selectivity of <b>x</b> <b>rays.</b> This unparalleled selectivity extracts low concentration excited state species along the pathway of photo induced ligand exchange of Fe CO 5 in ethanol. Conceptually a full theoretical treatment of all accessible insights to excited state dynamics with AS RXRS with transform limited <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> pulses is given which will be covered experimentally by upcoming transform limited <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> source...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect of {{guidelines}} for <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> requests on requests for cervical spine <b>x</b> <b>rays.</b> SETTING: Accident and emergency (A&E) department of tertiary referral centre. METHODS: Guidelines for all <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> requests were introduced in the (A&E) department of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in February 1992. The effect of the guidelines on requests for cervical spine <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> was assessed by retrospective review of all such <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> taken over two 30 d periods, {{before and after the}} introduction of the guidelines. Junior staff had been in post for 3 months during both periods assessed. Films were reviewed for quality by a consultant radiologist. RESULTS: Guidelines reduced the number of inappropriate requests significantly; however, 26 % of requests were still unnecessary. The standard of radiography improved but 49 % of <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> remained inadequate, usually because the C 7 /T 1 level was not demonstrated on the lateral view. The A&E doctors correctly interpretated the radiographs in 95 % of examinations. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines reduce inappropriate <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> requests. Further improvements can be expected with continued education...|$|R
