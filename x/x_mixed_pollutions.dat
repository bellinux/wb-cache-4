40|$|International audienceThe ever {{increasing}} human {{population and the}} resultant increase in anthropogenic activities {{have led to a}} gradual decline ingroundwater quality across many regions of the world. Amongst the many contaminants, nitrates are currently considered as one ofthe major causes of groundwater pollution mainly due to their high solubility in water. Frequently attributed to agricultural activities,nitrates can also come from other sources from urban and suburban areas, particularly due to the presence of on-site sanitationsystems. To reclaim groundwater quality by acting on the most significant and dominant sources, it is necessary to precisely determine theorigin of nitrates. A robust approach based on the combined use of multiple environmental tracers was implemented on two watersheds characterizedby <b>mixed</b> <b>pollution</b> sources (on-site sanitation and agricultural activities). These two watersheds are located in Reunion Island (IndianOcean), where on-site sanitation dominates, with a significant non-compliance rate: it is estimated that in Reunion Island the on-sitesanitation is found in 60 % of houses, with a non-compliance rate close to 80 %. The hydrochemical analysis coupled with the spatial analysis of land use/land cover helped us to characterize the differentgroundwater facies. Water isotope ratios (delta 18 O and delta 2 H) were used to determine the average recharge altitude, while therare earths, pharmaceutical compounds, nitrate isotopic ratios (delta 15 N and delta 18 O), boron isotopes 10 B and 11 B allowed usdiscriminate between the agricultural and urban sources of nitrates in groundwater. The relative contribution of pollution from on-sitesanitation and agricultural activities was determined. Finally, CFC's and SF 6 were used to calculate the apparent ages of water and identify the temporal effectiveness of measuresimplemented in the watershed, characterized by <b>mixed</b> <b>pollution</b> sources...|$|R

Measurements are compared to calculations by the CAABA/MECCA 0 -D box model, which was adapted to the chamber conditions and took the aerosol liquid water content and composition into account.

Profiles of NO <b>x</b> <b>mixing</b> ratios of the lower 100 m of the atmosphere confirm that, in contrast to South Pole, air chemistry at Dome C is dominated by strong diurnal cycles in solar irradiance and atmospheric stability. Depth profiles of mixing ratios in firn air suggest that the upper snowpack at Dome C holds a significant reservoir of photolytically produced NO 2 and is a sink of gas phase ozone (O 3). First-time observations of BrO at Dome C suggest 2 – 3 pptv near the ground, with higher levels in the free troposphere. Assuming steady-state, observed mixing ratios of BrO and RO 2 radicals are too low to explain the large NO 2 : NO ratios found in ambient air. A previously not considered interference with pernitric acid (HNO 4) may explain part of this inconsistency. During 2011 – 2012 NO <b>x</b> <b>mixing</b> ratios and flux were larger than in 2009 – 2010 consistent with also larger surface O 3 mixing ratios resulting from increased net O 3 production.

Profiles of NO <b>x</b> <b>mixing</b> ratios of the lower 100 m of the atmosphere confirm that, in contrast to the South Pole, air chemistry at Dome C is strongly influenced by large diurnal cycles in solar irradiance and a sudden collapse of the atmospheric boundary layer in the early evening.

First-time observations of bromine oxide (BrO) at Dome C show that mixing ratios of BrO near the ground are low, certainly less than 5 pptv, with higher levels in the free troposphere. Assuming steady state, observed mixing ratios of BrO and RO 2 radicals are too low to explain the large NO 2 : NO ratios found in ambient air, possibly indicating the existence of an unknown process contributing to the atmospheric chemistry of reactive nitrogen above the Antarctic Plateau.

Previous studies have examined the influence of SNOx on ozone (O 3) chemistry. We employ the ECHAM 5 /MESSy atmospheric chemistry model (EMAC) to go further in the reaction chain and investigate the influence of SNOx on lower tropospheric NO x, O 3, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), nitric acid (HNO 3), the hydroxyl radical (OH) and the lifetime of methane (τ CH 4). We show that SNOx is responsible for a significant contribution to the NO <b>x</b> <b>mixing</b> ratio in many regions, especially in the tropics. Furthermore, the concentration of OH is substantially increased due to SNOx, resulting in an enhanced oxidizing efficiency of the global troposphere, reflected in a ~ 10 % decrease in τ CH 4 due to soil NO emissions. On the other hand, in some regions SNOx has a negative feedback on the lifetime of NO x through O 3 and OH, which results in regional increases in the mixing ratio of NO x despite lower total emissions in a simulation without SNOx. In a sensitivity simulation in which we reduce the other surface NO x emissions by the same amount as SNOx, we find that they have a much weaker impact on OH and τ CH 4 and do not result in an increase in the NO <b>x</b> <b>mixing</b> ratio anywhere...|$|R

Meredith Fowlie and Nicholas Muller ∗ February 5, 2013 Much {{of the air}} pollution currently regulated under U. S. emissions trading programs is non-uniformly mixed, meaning that health and environmental damages depend on the location and dispersion characteristics of the sources. Existing policy regimes ignore this fact. Emissions are penalized at a single permit price, regardless of {{the location of the}} source. In theory, differentiated policies can be designed to accommodate non-uniformly <b>mixed</b> <b>pollution</b> using emissions penalties that vary with emissions damages. Under perfect certainty, damage-based policy differentiation is unambiguously welfare improving. In the presence of uncertainty about damages and abatement costs, differentiated policies may not welfare dominate simpler, undifferentiated designs. Using rich data from a major U.

Surprisingly, we find that differentiated emissions trading results in welfare loss as compared to the undifferentiate...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{intensive}} field measurement {{campaign was}} performed in July/August 2002 at the Global Atmospheric Watch station Izaña on Tenerife to study the interaction of mineral dust aerosol and tropospheric chemistry (MINATROC). A dense Saharan dust plume, with aerosol masses exceeding 500 µg m - 3, persisted for three days. During this dust event strongly reduced mixing ratios of RO x (HO 2, CH 3 O 2 and higher organic peroxy radicals), H 2 O 2, NO x (NO and NO 2) and O 3 were observed. A chemistry boxmodel, constrained by the measurements, {{has been used to}} study gas phase and heterogeneous chemistry. It appeared to be difficult to reproduce the observed HCHO mixing ratios with the model, possibly related to the representation of precursor gas concentrations or the absence of dry deposition. The model calculations indicate that the reduced H 2 O 2 mixing ratios in the dust plume can be explained by including the heterogeneous removal reaction of HO 2 with an uptake coefficient of 0. 2, or by assuming heterogeneous removal of H 2 O 2 with an accommodation coefficient of 3 × 10 - 4. However, these heterogeneous reactions cannot explain the low RO <b>x</b> <b>mixing</b> ratios observed during the dust event. Whereas a mean daytime net ozone production rate (NOP) of 1. 06 ppb v /hr occurred throughout the campaign, the reduced RO x and NO <b>x</b> <b>mixing</b> ratios in the Saharan dust plume contributed to a reduced NOP of 0. 14 ? 0. 32 ppb v /hr, which likely explains the relatively low ozone mixing ratios observed during this event...|$|R
