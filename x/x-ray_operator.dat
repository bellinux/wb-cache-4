These so called remote x-ray operators are licensed under the New South Wales Radiation Control Act 1990. This study aimed to investigate the experiences and perceptions of remote <b>x-ray</b> <b>operator</b> radiography and examine the role of remote operators in New South Wales {{from the perspective of a}} cohort of rural radiographers and nurse and GP remote x-ray operators involved in frontline delivery of rural radiographic services. Methodology Semi-structured in-depth interviews were performed with twenty rural radiographers, ten rural nurses and seven rural general practitioners from various rural communities in New South Wales. Interview questions explored the informants’ knowledge, opinions and values, experience and behaviour, and attitudes and feelings in relation to remote <b>x-ray</b> <b>operator</b> radiography. Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed. Data analysis was subsequently performed using an iterative process based on a modified grounded theory methodology. Data labelling and comparative analysis were carried out in parallel with data collection, allowing progressive modification of the interview theme list to ensure that theoretical saturation was achieved. Results Data analysis led to the emergence of three key concepts, together with their relevant themes and sub-themes. The primary key concept, ‘Dimensions of Practice’, was inclusive of the central precepts of remote <b>x-ray</b> <b>operator</b> radiography. It includes themes titled ‘Licence Conditions and Limitations’, ‘Competency Requirements’ and ‘Image Quality and Practice Standards’. The key concept of ‘Service Provision and Equity of Access’, represents the realities of clinical practice in the rural and remote health care setting. It includes themes of ‘Clinical Management and Decision Making’, ‘Access and Availability’, ‘Patient Expectations’ and ‘Commitment to Service’. The third key concept is ‘Professional Roles and Relationships’, which deals with the interactions that take place between individual practitioners and the factors that influence them. It encompasses the xii themes of ‘Boundary Delineation’, ‘Professional Status and Esteem’ and ‘Interprofessional Conflict and Collaboration’. Relationships between the key concepts, via their themes and sub-themes were also explored. Conclusions Analysis of the data led to the development of a conceptual model and a single story line that represent the perspectives of the study informants. Remote <b>x-ray</b> <b>operator</b> radiography takes place at the intersection of the occupational worlds of rural radiographers, nurses and general practitioners. Remote operators provide a valuable service that prevents rural residents having to travel to access minor radiographic examinations. However, the quality of the radiography they perform is below the standard expected of radiographers. Improvements in collaborative teamwork could improve the quality of service, although interprofessional communication is stifled by status and hierarchical relationships.

40|$|Abstract: Introduction: In {{rural and}} remote parts of New South Wales (NSW) Australia, GPs and {{registered}} nurses who have completed a short course in basic radiography perform X-ray examinations when or where a radiographer is not available. This {{is a form}} of 'skills transfer'. They are licensed under the NSW Radiation Control Act 1990 to perform a limited range of examination types, providing a valuable service that prevents rural and remote residents from having to travel to access services. The aim of this survey was to gather background information about the NSW remote <b>X-ray</b> <b>operators</b> and investigate their self-perceived need for continuing education. Method: A questionnaire was mailed to all 131 remote <b>X-ray</b> <b>operators</b> in NSW, with reminder letters sent 6 weeks later. The questionnaire consisted of 30 close-ended and 3 open-ended questions. Among the questions, respondents were asked to rate their self-perceived competency in 12 examinations covered by their licence, and to indicate how well they understood and how challenging they found certain aspects of radiographic practice. Results: Seventy-four percent of the respondents were nurses, 24 % GPs and there were 2 physiotherapists, with an overall response rate of 63 %. The majority (80 %) performed radiography in towns of 3000 people or less. Together with other remote operator colleagues, 58 % said that they performed an average of 2 to 10 examinations per week. Most thought their radiography was 'Good but not excellent' (48 %) or 'Satisfactory most of the time' (41 %). For 2 of the examinations (ankle and wrist) more than 90 % of the respondents felt competent. For another 6 examinations less than 80 % felt competent. Only 23 % felt they could perform a chest X-ray on a premature baby. The most challenging aspects for respondents were dealing with paediatric and difficult patients; and the highest level of understanding was in 'Radiation protection'. Nineteen percent 'Never' did continuing education in radiography and radiology and 35 % 'Rarely' did so. The GPs did more continuing education than others, and 80 % felt a need for continuing education in this field. Approximately half (51 %) said they had 'regular' contact with a radiographer and 32 % 'sometimes' had contact. Seventy percent said this was 'Extremely' helpful. Approximately one-third (34 %) received feedback about their radiography 'Regularly', most (44 %) from a local radiographer. Preferred methods of continuing education were: face-to-face training; working alongside a radiographer; reviewing or auditing of their radiographs; and distance or online education. The support needed to undertake radiography continuing education was: time off from regular duties, transport and accommodation, and the support of management. Conclusions: The survey results strongly suggest a need for continuing education in radiography and radiology for NSW remote <b>X-ray</b> <b>operators.</b> The GP respondents appeared to have different needs from the nurses and physiotherapists. Recognising their special circumstances and the isolation under which they work, ongoing educational support, as well as the opportunity to benchmark their practice against more mainstream services, should be embedded in the system. There is an opportunity to develop a best practice model for supporting and re-credentialing limited X-ray licence holders and to create a national benchmark. A well planned strategy may have relevance in other practice settings where skills transfer may be practised now or in the future...|$|R
30|$|Nearly {{half of all}} {{deaths and}} injured persons were medical doctors, all male. Only nine of the deaths are in the Ehrenbuch, the book of honour {{containing}} the names of people who died {{for the advancement of}} radiology [1]. The victims who lost their life were only 35  years old on average when all groups are taken together. Among the patients were three young children. Diagnostic imaging (excluding dental imaging), i.e. fluoroscopy, radiography or a combination of the two, comprised 71  % of cases of the group of accidents for which sufficient information was available. This is of no surprise as fluoroscopy had {{to be done in the}} dark and frequent adjustments in tube position and the setting of the diaphragm were required. Relatively few accidents occurred during therapy. The body parts that most often came into contact with a live part of the X-ray system were the hand and arm. Several shocks to the head resulted from bending towards the tube or its wires while supporting a patient. As discharges took place before a body part made physical contact with a live part of the system, many reports of accidents mentioned their occurrence. The improper training of <b>X-ray</b> <b>operators</b> was also frequently reported.|$|R
50|$|Over 1,000 {{women from}} many {{different}} backgrounds and many different countries served with the SWH. Only the medical professionals such as doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians and <b>x-ray</b> <b>operators</b> received a salary and expenses while non-medical staff such as orderlies, administrators, drivers, cooks and others received no pay at all (and were in fact expected to pay their way). In keeping with {{the aims of the}} SWH it was a deliberate policy that, as far as possible, all members of SWH units should be women so allowing opportunities for unqualified women who could nonetheless get the chance to both serve the war effort in some capacity and the cause of women’s rights. Some women joined because {{it was one of the}} few opportunities open to women to help the war effort; others saw it as a rare chance for adventure in a world that up till then offered women very few chances; and all shared, with varying degrees, the desire to improve the lot of women. Over £500,000 was raised by every manner possible to fund the organisation and during the war years it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of patients lives were saved, nursed and helped by these extraordinary, courageous and talented women.|$|R

He also developed the first full-body twenty by seventy-two inch x-ray for biomechanical analysis. Dr. Sausser was a founding member of the New York State Spinographic Association as well as the Board of Counselors of Spinographers and <b>X-Ray</b> <b>Operators,</b> which would later evolve into today's American Chiropractic College of Radiology.

The result of the latter battle eventually allowed him to become the first chiropractor licensed to operate an x-ray laboratory in New York.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{evaluate}} the different quality indicators that Airport Security Certifying Companies use at Barcelona-El Prat airport. To do so, I developed two different tools which aim to calculate the performance of <b>X-Ray</b> machine <b>operators</b> as well as making use {{of the information that}} is automatically recorded every time someone goes through the metal detectors at the airport security checkpoints. The first tool was developed to address two important problems that I found: an excessive amount of time (money) spent to calculate the performance of <b>X-Ray</b> machine <b>operators</b> and the real chances of a human error in the calculation process. In order to solve these two problems described above I decided to use Microsoft Excel's macros to automate the calculation of the performance of <b>X-Ray</b> machine <b>operators.</b> In this calculation method different variables such as type of filter, passengers or, employees were considered. The results of this automatization are highly beneficial from a management perspective: there's been a reduction of 99. 5 % in the time spent doing the calculation of this indicator. Before the automatization, it took 16 hours to make this calculation. However, thanks to this new tool the time needed was lowered to only 5 minutes. If we look at these figures in a year basis, numbers are even more impressive. Since this indicator is calculated 15 times a year, a total amount of 30 days of work was needed to make all the calculations, or which is the same, a whole month salary of an employee. With this new tool, the time needed has been reduced to only 75 minutes a year. This reduction by a 99. 5 % should also lead to huge savings in labour costs. Last but not least, the way the tool was programmed has eliminated any chance of an eventual human error. Airia Ingeniería y Servicios S. A., the company auditing the security of Barcelona-El Prat airport has been using this tool since last April. I spent most of the time of this project developing the second tool, which aims to analyze the passengers flow at the metal detectors (security checkpoints). This application was programmed as well with Microsoft Excel's macros. The application shows the average flow of passengers per hour and per day comparing it with a theoretical capacity of the filters that are currently used. Moreover, the tool also analyzes in a daily basis the performance of the filters during peak hours. This tool could be extremely useful to the airport's operators {{as well as to the}} company developing these filters.

40|$|Background—Radiofrequency current {{ablation}} of {{atrial fibrillation}} (AF) requires high technical skills to achieve optimal catheter stability and {{is associated with}} an individually high x-ray exposure to both {{the patient and the}} operator. To facilitate catheter navigation and to reduce the <b>operator’s</b> <b>x-ray</b> burden, remote navigation (RN) systems have been developed. Considerations for navigation of a novel remote robotic navigation system in pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedures are reported. Methods and Results—In 65 patients with drug-refractory AF (43 paroxysmal, 22 persistent), complete circumferential PVI was performed using RN in conjunction with different electroanatomic mapping systems. Acute complete PVI using exclusively RN was achieved in 95 %. The procedure time was 19540 minutes. The <b>operator’s</b> <b>x-ray</b> exposure time was reduced by 64 minutes (35 %) using RN. In 7 of 14 patients with persistent AF, conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved by radiofrequency current ablation. During a median follow-up period of 239 days (range, 184 to 314 days), 47 of 65 patients (73 %) remained free of any documented atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrences after a single procedure. The relative proportion of patients remaining free of AF was 76 % and 68 % for paroxysmal and persistent AF, respectively. Conclusions—PVI using the novel RN system can be performed safely and effectively. One third of the operator’s fluoroscopy exposure time might be saved using RN. However, the questions of whether the overall fluoroscop...|$|R
40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is {{redesigning}} its Computer-Based Training (CBT) {{program for}} radiological workers. The redesign represents {{a major effort}} to produce a single, highly interactive and flexible CBT program that will meet the training needs {{of a wide range}} of radiological workers [...] from researchers and <b>x-ray</b> <b>operators</b> to individuals working in tritium, uranium, plutonium, and accelerator facilities. The new CBT program addresses the broad diversity of backgrounds found at a national laboratory. When a training audience is homogeneous in terms of education level and type of work performed, it is difficult to duplicate the effectiveness of a flexible, technically competent instructor who can tailor a course to the express needs and concerns of a course's participants. Unfortunately, such homogeneity is rare. At LLNL, they have a diverse workforce engaged in a wide range of radiological activities, from the fairly common to the quite exotic. As a result, the Laboratory must offer a wide variety of radiological worker courses. These include a general contamination-control course in addition to radioactive-material-handling courses for both low-level laboratory (i. e., bench-top) activities as well as high-level work in tritium, uranium, and plutonium facilities. They also offer training courses for employees who work with radiation-generating devices [...] x-ray, accelerator, and E-beam operators, for instance. However, even with the number and variety of courses the Laboratory offers, they are constrained by the diversity of backgrounds (i. e., knowledge and experience) of those to be trained. Moreover, time constraints often preclude in-depth coverage of site- and/or task-specific details. In response to this situation, several years ago LLNL began moving toward computer-based training for radiological workers. Today, that CBT effort includes a general radiological safety course developed by the Department of Energy's Hanford facility and a contamination-control program developed by LLNL. A comprehensive study guide and a post-training practical exam supplement the CBT effort. The ''hands-on'' practical is particularly important in that it gives participants not only the opportunity to demonstrate what they've learned, but to ask questions about their individual work situations. The challenge is how to make the CBT program more facility- and task-specific while, at the same time, making the program more in tune with the education and/or experience levels of individual trainees. To that end, they have designed a CBT program, which they refer to as an ''onion''. That is, the course is layered, going from the general to the more and more specific...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{sensitivity}} of the inverse problem of recovering the velocity field in a bounded domain from the boundary dynamic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (DDtN) for the wave equation. Three main results are obtained: (1) assuming that two velocity fields are non-trapping and are equal to a constant near the boundary, it is shown that the two induced scattering relations must be identical if their corresponding DDtN maps are sufficiently close; (2) a geodesic <b>X-ray</b> transform <b>operator</b> with matrix-valued weight is introduced by linearizing the operator which associates each velocity field with its induced Hamiltonian flow. A selected set of geodesics whose conormal bundle can cover the cotangent space at an interior point is used to recover the singularity of the X-ray transformed function at the point; a local stability estimate is established for this case. Although fold caustics are allowed along these geodesics, it is required that these caustics contribute to a smoother term in the transform than the point itself. The existence of such a set of geodesics is guaranteed under some natural assumptions in dimension {{greater than or equal to}} three by the classification result on caustics and regularity theory of Fourier Integral Operators. The interior point with the above required set of geodesics is called "fold-regular"; (3) assuming that a background velocity field with every interior point fold-regular is fixed and another velocity field is sufficiently close to it and satisfies a certain orthogonality condition, it is shown that if the two corresponding DDtN maps are sufficiently close then they must be equal.
