5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E
25|$|<b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> is also {{a special}} type of Cathode ray tube, whilst x-ray emits when high voltage {{electrons}} hit the anode.|$|E
25|$|The Coolidge <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> {{was invented}} during the {{following}} year by William D. Coolidge. It made possible the continuous emissions of X-rays. X-ray tubes similar to this are still in use in 2012.|$|E
30|$|Meanwhile, <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> {{based on}} carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) field-emission electron sources have been extensively developed because CNT emitters have several advantages compared with thermionic electron sources. The advantages of CNT emitters include (1) cold electron sources, and hence, little heat is generated inside the tube [6] {{which is important}} for the minimization of an X-ray tube; (2) simplicity and easy controllability in a pulse operation [7, 8]; (3) high current density for electron and X-ray microscopy devices [9, 10]. Several types of <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> have also been developed using CNT field emitters [11 – 15]. However, the miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> are mostly not vacuum-sealed and thus should be operated in a vacuum chamber or with a vacuum pump. In addition, the maximum operating voltages of the miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> were less than 30 kV. As a consequence, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> have limited practical applications.|$|R
50|$|Some X-ray {{examinations}} (such as, e.g., {{non-destructive testing}} and 3-D microtomography) need very high-resolution images and therefore require <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> that can generate very small focal spot sizes, typically below 50 µm in diameter. These tubes are called microfocus <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are used}} in medical imaging among other uses. <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> used for continuous-duty {{operation}} in fluoroscopy and CT imaging equipment may use a focused cathode and a rotating anode to dissipate the large amounts of heat thereby generated. These are housed in an oil-filled aluminium housing to provide cooling.|$|R
25|$|Both {{of these}} X-ray {{production}} processes are inefficient, with a production efficiency {{of only about}} one percent, and thus most of the electric power consumed by the tube is released as waste heat. When producing a usable flux of X-rays, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> must be designed to dissipate the excess heat.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known experimenter with X-rays was actuary William Morgan. In 1785 {{he presented}} a {{paper to the}} Royal Society of London describing the effects of passing electrical currents through a partially evacuated glass tube, the first <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube.</b> This work was further extended by Humphry Davy and his assistant Michael Faraday.|$|E
25|$|Bremsstrahlung: This is {{radiation}} given off by {{the electrons}} as they are scattered by the strong electric field near the high-Z (proton number) nuclei. These X-rays have a continuous spectrum. The intensity of the X-rays increases linearly with decreasing frequency, from zero at {{the energy of the}} incident electrons, the voltage on the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E

25|$|Another {{tool for}} {{decreasing}} dose is collimation. It {{may be that}} {{from the field of}} view provided by the detector, only a small part is interesting for the intervention. The <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> can be shielded at the parts that are not necessary to be visible by a collimator, thus only sending dose to the detector for the body parts in question. Modern C-Arms enable to navigate on acquired images without constant fluoroscopy.|$|E
25|$|In medical {{diagnostic}} applications, the low energy (soft) X-rays are unwanted, {{since they are}} totally absorbed by the body, increasing the radiation dose without contributing to the image. Hence, a thin metal sheet, often of aluminium, called an X-ray filter, is usually placed over {{the window of the}} <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> absorbing the low energy part in the spectrum. This is called hardening the beam since it shifts the center of the spectrum towards higher energy (or harder) x-rays.|$|E
25|$|Beam Hardening: X-ray {{radiation}} {{consists of}} hard and soft particles, i.e. particles {{with a lot}} of energy and particles with little energy. Unnecessary exposure is mostly caused by soft particles, as they are to weak to pass through the body and interact with it. Hard particles, by contrast, pass through the patient. A filter in front of the <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> can catch the soft particles, thus hardening the beam. This decreases dose without impacting image quality.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, John Ambrose Fleming {{invented the}} {{thermionic}} diode, the first kind of vacuum tube. This used a hot cathode that caused an electric current to flow in a vacuum. This idea was quickly applied to <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes,</b> and hence heated-cathode <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes,</b> called [...] "Coolidge tubes", completely replaced the troublesome cold cathode tubes by about 1920.|$|R
50|$|Historically, X-rays were {{discovered}} radiating from experimental discharge tubes called Crookes tubes invented by British physicist William Crookes and others. As {{the medical and}} other uses of X-rays became apparent, workshops began to manufacture specialized Crookes <b>tubes</b> to produce <b>X-rays.</b> These were the first <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes.</b> These first generation cold cathode or Crookes <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> were used until the 1920s.|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{diagnostic}} X-ray {{units are}} used for radiographic imaging in many countries. For obtaining entrance surface doses, a numerical dose determination method has been applied in Japan. Although this technique is effective, it has to account for errors, particularly fluctuations, due to the beam quality and output of <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes.</b> As {{a part of our}} quality control procedures, we recorded the entrance surface air kerma, tube voltage, and half-value layer measurements made for four diagnostic <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> over a 103 -week period. The entrance surface air kerma for one of the four <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> had increased significantly by 11. 4 % over 1 year from its initial setting, whereas the tube voltages and half-value layers did not deviate significantly from their initial values. Medical physicists and radiological technologists should be aware of this fluctuation for diagnostic <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> and take it into consideration when calculating the entrance surface air kerma. © 2014 Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics. 発行後 1 年より全文公...|$|R
25|$|This {{technique}} achieved {{substantially higher}} sensitivity than other techniques {{with the exception}} of the crystal interferometer. A basic limitation of the technique is the chromatic dispersion of grating diffraction, which limits its spatial resolution. A tabletop system with a tungsten-target <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> running at 60kVp will have a limiting resolution of 60µm. Another constraint is that the x-ray beam is slitted down to only tens of micrometers wide. A potential solution has been proposed in the form of parallel imaging with multiple slits.|$|E
25|$|In CT, an <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> {{opposite}} an X-ray detector (or detectors) in a ring-shaped apparatus rotate {{around a}} patient, producing a computer-generated cross-sectional image (tomogram). CT is {{acquired in the}} axial plane, with coronal and sagittal images produced by computer reconstruction. Radiocontrast agents are often used with CT for enhanced delineation of anatomy. Although radiographs provide higher spatial resolution, CT can detect more subtle variations in attenuation of X-rays (higher contrast resolution). CT exposes the patient to significantly more ionizing radiation than a radiograph.|$|E
25|$|X-rays can be {{generated}} by an <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> a vacuum tube that uses a high voltage to accelerate the electrons released by a hot cathode to a high velocity. The high velocity electrons collide with a metal target, the anode, creating the X-rays. In medical X-ray tubes the target is usually tungsten or a more crack-resistant alloy of rhenium (5%) and tungsten (95%), but sometimes molybdenum for more specialized applications, such as when softer X-rays are needed as in mammography. In crystallography, a copper target is most common, with cobalt often being used when fluorescence from iron content in the sample might otherwise present a problem.|$|E

25|$|In August 1896 Dr. HD. Hawks, a {{graduate}} of Columbia College, suffered severe hand and chest burns from an x-ray demonstration. It was reported in Electrical Review and led to many other reports of problems associated with x-rays being sent in to the publication. Many experimenters including Elihu Thomson at Edison's lab, William J. Morton, and Nikola Tesla also reported burns. Elihu Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> {{over a period of}} time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering. Other effects were sometimes blamed for the damage including ultraviolet rays and (according to Tesla) ozone. Many physicians claimed there were no effects from x-ray exposure at all.|$|E
25|$|A {{technique}} to eliminate mechanical scanning of the grating and still retain the maximum spatial resolution is electronic phase stepping. It scans the source spot of the <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> with an electro-magnetic field. This causes {{the projection of}} the object {{to move in the}} opposite direction, and also causes a relative movement between the projection and the Moiré fringes. The images are digitally shifted to realign the projections. The end result is that the projection of the object is stationary, while the Moiré fringes move over it. This technique effectively synthesizes the phase stepping process, but without the costs and delays associated with mechanical movements.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1951 Franklin finally arrived. Wilkins {{was away}} on holiday and missed an initial meeting at which Raymond Gosling stood in for him along with Alex Stokes, who, like Crick, would solve the basic {{mathematics}} that make possible a {{general theory of}} how helical structures diffract X-rays. No work had been done on DNA in the laboratory for several months; the new <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> sat unused, waiting for Franklin. Franklin {{ended up with the}} DNA from Signer, Gosling became her PhD student, and she had the expectation that DNA X-ray diffraction work was her project. Wilkins returned to the laboratory expecting, on the other hand, that Franklin would be his collaborator and that they would work together on the DNA project that he had started.|$|E

25|$|If the X-ray beam is {{vertically}} {{thin and}} impinges {{on the edge}} of the detector, X-ray refraction can change the status of the individual X-ray from “detected” to “undetected” and vice versa, effectively playing the same role as the crystal rocking curve in ABI. This analogy with ABI, already observed when the method was initially developed, was more recently formally demonstrated. Effectively, the same effect is obtained – a fine angular selection on the photon direction; however, while in ABI the beam needs to be highly collimated and monochromatic, the absence of the crystal means that EI can be implemented with divergent and polychromatic beams, like those generated by a conventional rotating-anode <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube.</b> This is done by introducing two opportunely designed masks (sometimes referred to as “coded-aperture” masks), one immediately before the sample, and one in contact with the detector (see figure).|$|E
25|$|In film-screen radiography, an <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> {{generates a}} beam of X-rays, which is aimed at the patient. The X-rays that pass through the patient are {{filtered}} through a device called an grid or X-ray filter, to reduce scatter, and strike an undeveloped film, which is held tightly to a screen of light-emitting phosphors in a light-tight cassette. The film is then developed chemically and an image appears on the film. Film-screen radiography is being replaced by phosphor plate radiography but more recently by digital radiography (DR) and the EOS imaging. In the two latest systems, the X-rays strike sensors that converts the signals generated into digital information, which is transmitted and converted into an image displayed on a computer screen. In digital radiography the sensors shape a plate, but in the EOS system, which is a slot-scanning system, a linear sensor vertically scans the patient.|$|E
