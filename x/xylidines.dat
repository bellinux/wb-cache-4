30|$|A poor {{medium and}} {{consequently}} low biomass yield are impractical {{for the production}} of high yield of LME. According to our preliminary experiments, conditions promoting laccase expression by C. unicolor CBS 117347 appeared to be different to those previously reported for many other fungi.

Full-scale single-cylinder knock tests were run with 20 deg B. T. C. and maximum-economy spark settings at compression ratios of 6. 9, 8. 0, and 10. 0, and with two inlet-air temperatures. The fuels tested consisted of triptane, four triptane and one <b>xylidines</b> blend with 28 -R, and 28 -R fuel alone. Indicated specific fuel consumption at lean mixtures was decreased approximately 17 percent at a compression ratio of 10. 0 and maximum-economy spark setting, as compared to that obtained with a compression ratio of 6. 9 and normal spark setting. When compression ratio was increased from 6. 9 to 10. 0 at an inlet-air temperature of 150 F, normal spark setting, and a fuel-air ratio of 0. 065, 55 -percent triptane was required with 28 -R fuel to maintain the knock-limited brake power level obtained with 28 -R fuel at a compression ratio of 6. 9. Brake specific fuel consumption was decreased 17. 5 percent at a compression ratio of 10. 0 relative to that obtained at a compression ratio of 6. 9.

30|$|Genes {{encoding}} LME of the white-rot fungi {{have been}} found to be differentially regulated in response to a wide variety of environmental signals (Janusz et al. 2013). Among them, copper and aromatic compounds are considered as the most potent inducers of enzyme synthesis (Revankar and Lele 2006; Elisashvili and Kachlishvili 2009; Lisova et al. 2010; Janusz et al. 2013). In this study, supplementing the culture medium with 1  mM CuSO 4 or 1  mM <b>xylidine</b> significantly accelerated laccase secretion and increased enzyme yield (Figure  2). Moreover, additive effect on the laccase expression was observed when copper and <b>xylidine</b> were supplemented to the medium simultaneously. It is worth noting that addition of <b>xylidine</b> or this compound in combination with copper to actively growing culture completely repressed laccase production during at least 24  h. Subsequently, the enzyme secretion resumed and during the subsequent 24  h of fermentation it enhanced 4 -fold and 5 -fold, respectively. It is possible that the enhanced synthesis of laccase is a response of C. unicolor to chemical stress in presence of high concentrations of two toxic compounds. The stimulating effect of copper on the laccase production by C. unicolor strains was described by other authors (Michniewicz et al. 2006; Janusz et al. 2007; Lisova et al. 2010). However, the addition of only 50  μM copper stimulated C. unicolor strain 137 laccase expression up to 100 -fold and resulted to a maximum enzyme level of 4 U/mL; higher concentrations of Cu 2 + (0.2  mM) did not further stimulate laccase activity (Michniewicz et al. 2006). Moreover, all the tested aromatic compounds were ineffective as inducers of laccase synthesis by C. unicolor VKM F- 3196 while copper in concentration of 0.1  mM provided 15 U laccase activity/mL on the 8 th day of fungus cultivation (Lisova et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|The {{cultivation}} of Trametes versicolor for laccase production and cell growth were strongly dependent on experimental conditions namely {{physical and chemical}} parameters as well as nutrient availability and inducer stimulation. Biomass growth was compared for a rich medium and for a defined medium in two different temperatures.

It was clearly shown that laccase production is not associated with cell growth, indicating that this ligninolytic enzyme must be produced in the defined medium by a secondary metabolism. In order to obtain laccase induction, addition of solid lignin, lignosulphonates, veratryl alcohol, <b>xylidine</b> and ethanol was tested at different concentrations. To optimise laccase activity, the combined effect of inducer addition and simultaneously glucose suppression was studied.
