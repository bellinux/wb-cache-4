40|$|Among the {{different}} optical modulator technologies {{available such as}} polymer, III-V semiconductors, Silicon, the well-known Lithium Niobate (LN) offers the best trade-off in terms of performances, ease of use, and power handling capability [1 - 9]. The LN technology is still widely deployed within the current high data rate fibre optic communications networks. This technology {{is also the most}} mature and guarantees the reliability which is required for space applications [9]. In or der to fulfil the target specifications of opto-microwave payloads, an optimization of the design of a Mach-Zehnder (MZ) modulator working at the 1500 nm telecom wavelength was performed in the frame of the ESA-ARTES "Multi GigaHertz Optical Modulator" (MGOM) project in order to reach ultra-low optical insertion loss and low effective driving voltage in the Ka band. The selected modulator configuration was the <b>X-cut</b> <b>crystal</b> orientation, associated to high stability Titanium in-diffusion process for the optical waveguide. Starting from an initial modulator configuration exhibiting 9 V drive voltage @ 30 GHz, a complete redesign of the coplanar microwave electrodes was carried out in order to reach a 6 V drive voltage @ 30 GHz version. This redesign was associated to an optimization of the interaction between the optical waveguide and the electrodes. Following the optimisation steps, an evaluation program was applied on a lot of 8 identical modulators. A full characterisation was carried out to compare performances, showing small variations between the initial and final functional characteristics. In parallel, two similar modulators were submitted to both gamma (10 - 100 krad) and proton irradiation (10. 109 p/cm²) with minor performance degradation...|$|E
40|$|Lithium niobate is an {{artificial}} piezoelectric electro-optic crystal with many applications in optoelectronic devices. The illumination of a LiNbO 3 crystal with visible radiation has {{as a consequence}} {{the development of a}} bulk space charge electric field along polar axis c of the crystal (bulk photovoltaic effect). Using a combination of advanced high resolution X-ray diffractometry and synchrotron topography (synchrotron area diffractometry) we have observed that the illumination of Fe:LiNbO 3 samples with white light results in the development of deformations in the bulk of the crystal. Object of the present dissertation is the systematic study of these crystalline deformations {{in order to determine the}} different components of deformation tensor and the mechanism that creates them. For this reason we have studied the type of the deformations, its spatial and temporal evolution and its dependence on the nature of the doping material, the dimensions of the light pattern and the intensity of the light. Based on our experimental results we extracted a value for the bulk photovoltaic field in Fe:LiNbO 3 demonstrating the possibilities of the most advanced method of synchrotron diffraction and topography. We have observed that the illumination of Fe:LiNbO 3 samples with white light resulted in the development of deformations following the macroscopic pattern of inhomogeneous illumination. We did not observe any deformations after the illumination of Mg doped or non doped samples. For the x-cut and z-cut Fe: LiNbO 3 samples the deformations have been visualized as contrast in synchrotron radiation topographs. From the monochromatic topographs as a function of x-ray incidence angle, we have extracted the rocking curves from the whole crystal with a spatial resolution of 10 µm. We have used the angular shift of the peak of the rocking curves after illumination in order to draw the contour maps of the effective misorientation from the whole crystal. The effective misorientation contour map of the z-cut sample was used in order to calculate the tensile strain in the centre of the illuminated region, εzz= 0. 8 ? 10 - 4 and the shear deformations at the borders of the illuminated region, εzx(zy) = 1. 35 ? 10 - 4. We have assumed that the illumination of a Fe:LiNbO 3 crystal creates, through the bulk photovoltaic effect, space charge regions parallel to the physical surfaces of the z-cut sample. Through the converse piezoelectric effect we have attributed the photodeformations in the centre of the illuminated region to the Εz component of the bulk photovoltaic field and the photodeformations in the borders of the illuminated region mainly to the Εx,Ey components of the electric field. The lattice deformations developed in the z-cut Fe:LiNbO 3 crystal after illumination can be used to study the space charge field Εph. Based on the experimental results of the present study we have calculated the bulk photovoltaic field for the 0. 138 mole% Fe:LiNbO 3 crystal (cFe+ 2 = 6 x 1024 m- 3), Eph= 1. 3 ± 0. 1 ? 107 V/m. We have studied the temporal evolution of the deformations and its dependence on the light intensity and compared it with the corresponding temporal evolution of the photovoltaic electric potential induced in the z-cut sample. We have confirmed that the deformations in iron doped lithium niobate are related to the macroscopic photovoltaic field since the simulation of relaxation times vs light intensity with the use of Eph= 1. 3 ? 107 V/m describes very well the experimental relaxation times. The experimental results of the illumination of the <b>x-cut</b> <b>crystal</b> showed that the photodeformations relax in the crystal surface in a different way than in the z-cut crystal. In the x-cut sample the contribution of extra elastic terms that have to be introduced in order to relax the incompatibility between regions of the crystal with different piezoelectric deformations seems to be more important and anisotropic. ...|$|E

40|$|Pulse-echo {{ultrahigh}} frequency ultrasonic measurements in gamma irradiated natural brazilian <b>X-cut</b> quartz <b>crystals</b> reveal {{the existence of}} Debye relaxation peaks at low (18 K) and high (155 and 255 K) temperatures which {{can be attributed to}} transitions of the hole trapped at the oxygen ion nearest to the substitutional aluminum impurities.

The low-temperature peak shows an apparent radiation annealing for gamma doses in excess of one megarad attributed to the closing of tunnelling transitions of the hole from low-lying intermediate energy levels due to electrostatic shifts of the asymmetry of the double-well potential by ionized defects.

40|$|Mechanical strain {{mediated}} magnetoelectric {{effects are}} studied in bilayers and trilayers of piezoelectric quartz and magnetostrictive permendur (P), an alloy of Fe-Co-V. It is {{shown that the}} magneto-electric voltage coefficient (MEVC), proportional to {{the ratio of the}} piezoelectric coupling coefficient to the permittivity, is higher in quart-based composites than for traditional ferroelectrics based ME composites. In bilayers of <b>X-cut</b> single <b>crystal</b> quartz and permendur, the MEVC varies from 1. 5 V/cm Oe at 20 Hz to ~ 185 V/cm Oe at bending resonance or electromechanical resonance corresponding to longitudinal acoustic modes.

A model for low-frequency and resonance ME effects is provided for theoretical estimates of MEVC and calculated MEVC are in general agreement with measured values. Magneto-electric composites with quartz have the desired characteristics such as the absence of ferroelectric hysteresis and pyroelectric losses and could potentially replace ferroelectrics in composite-based magnetic sensors, transducers and high frequency devices...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} section of this report a review of some of the {{attempts}} to measure cavity collapse pressures is presented. The second section deals with the experimental measurement of the stresses developed in a solid subjected to cavitation.

Both the generation and collapse of such cavities gave rise to transient stress pulses which traveled along the bar and were detected by means of an <b>X-cut</b> quartz <b>crystal.</b> The charge appearing on the opposite faces of the quartz disc was allowed to develop a voltage which was subsequently amplified and :recorded photographically from an oscilloscope.

40|$|Exploratory {{measurements}} {{were made to}} determine the attenuation of sound in liquid helium {{as a function of}} pressure, in the range of temperature between 0. 20 K and 1 K. Short ultrasonic pulses at a carrier frequency of 11. 8 mc were generated in a tube containing liquid helium by an <b>X-cut</b> quartz <b>crystal</b> which was operated at resonance. A second crystal, matched with the first, was used as a receiver. Changes in the ampli-tude of the transmitted sound pulses were measured with a comparison pulse, provided by a signal generator with a calibrated, continuously variable output attenuator. Low temperatures were obtained by the adiabatic demagnetization of iron ammonium alum. In an experiment utilizing magnetic cooling, the demagnetization capsule must be thermally isolated, insofar as it is possible, {{from the rest of the}} apparatus. The path length over which the sound pulses were transmitted could not be varied conveniently; consequently only changes in the absorption coefficient, as a function of temperature, could be measured directly.

40|$|C. E. Chase (1) {{showed that}} the {{attenuation}} coefficient for sound waves in liquid helium goes through a broad maximum {{in the vicinity of}} 0. 9 0 K before falling to zero at lower temperatures. At the top of the curve two minor peaks, separated from each other by a temperature difference of about 0. 1 °K, were observed. Earlier work done at Cambridge University by Chase (2), which had demonstrated that the anomalous increase in absorption just below 1 °K could be ascribed to a relaxation process, had not revealed a fine structure similar to that found at M. I. T., but the Cambridge measurements had been made at only three temperatures below 1 °K, and the additional peak could easily have been missed. The peaks on the absorption curve were therefore interpreted as indicating the presence of two separate relaxation mechanisms in the liquid. For his measurements at M. I. T. Chase used a single <b>X-cut</b> quartz <b>crystal,</b> in con-junction with a polished brass reflector, to transmit and receive 20 -[sec pulses of sound at a carrier frequency of 12 Mc/sec.

Two different kinds of damage produced by oxygen implantation were seen: near-surface damage correlated to electronic stopping, which causes an increase of the extraordinary refractive index, and end-of-ion range damage generated by collision cascades, which decreases the extraordinary refractive index values.

The 3. 3 MeV He 2 + Rutherford backscattering/channelling technique {{was used to}} analyse the implanted LiNbO 3 crystals. The spectra obtained demonstrate that the scattering peaks of the elastic resonance of 3. 045 MeV He- 4 with O- 16 show a broadened half-width. With increasing implant dose, the damage peak of the Nb atoms shifts to the lower-energy side, and the apparent half-width of the resonance peak becomes narrower. The results are explained as being due to the different reduction of stopping power in a channelling direction for He ions after different dose implantations. The reduction of the stopping power for channelled ions can be deduced from the different half-widths of the resonance scattering peaks for spectra corresponding to aligned and random beam directions. The damage depth distributions for implanted LiNbO 3 crystals were obtained after considering the corresponding reductions of channelled stopping power.
