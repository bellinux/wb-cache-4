50|$|The {{publication}} of the NAPAP-fIIa crystal structure triggered many researches on thrombin inhibitors. NAPAP is an active site thrombin inhibitor. It fills the S3 and S2 pockets with its naphthalene and piperidine groups. AstraZeneca used the information to develop melagatran. The compound was poorly orally available, but after renovation they got a double prodrug {{which was the first}} oral DTI in clinical trials, <b>ximelagatran.</b> <b>Ximelagatran</b> was on the European market for approximately 20 months when it was suspended. Studies showed that treatment for over 35 days was linked with the risk of hepatic toxicity. It was never approved by the FDA.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ximelagatran</b> showed good {{efficacy}} {{compared with}} warfarin in several trials in {{prevention and treatment}} of deep vein thrombosis and as thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation. Development was stopped by manufacturer AstraZeneca, however, because of reports of liver enzyme derangements and liver failure. [...] Recent studies have indicated Dabigatran is slightly more effective for stroke thromboprophylaxis {{in the setting of}} atrial fibrillation than coumadin.|$|E
5000|$|Another type of {{anticoagulant}} is {{the direct}} thrombin inhibitor. [...] Current {{members of this}} class include the bivalent drugs hirudin, lepirudin, and bivalirudin; and the monovalent drugs argatroban and dabigatran. An oral direct thrombin inhibitor, <b>ximelagatran</b> (Exanta) was denied approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2004 http://www.fvleiden.org/ask/73.html and was pulled from the market entirely in February 2006 after reports of severe liver damage and heart attacks. http://www.astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com/article/512052.aspx In November 2010, dabigatran {{was approved by the}} FDA to treat atrial fibrillation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ximelagatran</b> was {{generally}} well tolerated {{in the trial}} populations, but a small proportion (5-6%) developed elevated liver enzyme levels, which prompted the FDA to reject an initial application for approval in 2004. The further development was discontinued in 2006 following reports of hepatotoxicity. Subsequent analysis of Phase 2 clinical study data using extreme value modelling (see Extreme value theory) showed that the elevated liver enzyme levels observed in Phase 3 clinical studies could have been predicted; {{if this had been}} known at the time, it might have affected decisions on future development of the compound.|$|E
50|$|Researchers at Boehringer Ingelheim {{also used}} the publicized {{information}} about the NAPAP-fIIa crystal structure, starting with the NAPAP structure {{that led to the}} discovery of dabigatran, which is a very polar compound and therefore not orally active. By masking the amidinium moiety as a carbamate-ester and turning the carboxylate into an ester they were able to make a prodrug called dabigatran etexilate, a highly lipophilic, gastrointestinally absorbed and orally bioavailable double prodrug such as <b>ximelagatran,</b> with the plasma half-life of approximately 12 hours. Dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed, it lacks interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes and with other food and drugs, {{there is no need for}} routine monitoring and it has a broad therapeutic index and a fixed-dose administration, which is excellent safety compared with warfarin. Unlike <b>ximelagatran,</b> a long-term treatment of dabigatran etexilate has not been linked with hepatic toxicity, seeing as how the drug is predominantly eliminated (>80%) by the kidneys. Dabigatran etexilate was approved in Canada and Europe in 2008 for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing hip- and knee surgery. In October 2010 the US FDA approved dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Many pharmaceutical companies have attempted to develop orally bioavailable DTI drugs but dabigatran etexilate is the only one to reach the market.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Ximelagatran,</b> {{the first}} oral direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor, {{was shown to}} be an effective antithrombotic agent but was associated with potential liver toxicity after prolonged administration. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The aim of the EXTEND study was to assess safety and efficacy of extended administration (35 days) of <b>ximelagatran</b> or enoxaparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after elective hip replacement and hip fracture surgery. A follow-up period, including assessment of liver enzymes (in particular alanine aminotransferase; ALAT), until post-operative day 180 was planned, with visits at days 56 and 180. RESULTS: Randomization and administration of study drugs were stopped following a report of serious liver injury occurring 3 weeks after completion of <b>ximelagatran</b> treatment. At the time of study termination, 1158 patients had been randomized and 641 had completed the 35 -day treatment; with 303 <b>ximelagatran</b> and 265 enoxaparin patients remaining in the study through to the day 56 follow-up visit. Overall, 58 patients showed an ALAT increase to > 2 x upper limit of normal: 31 treated with enoxaparin, 27 with <b>ximelagatran.</b> Three <b>ximelagatran</b> patients also showed symptoms potentially related to liver toxicity. Eleven <b>ximelagatran</b> patients showed an ALAT increase after study treatment ended. The clinical development of <b>ximelagatran</b> was terminated and the drug withdrawn from the market. Evaluation of the relative efficacy of the two treatments as specified in the protocol was impossible due to the premature termination of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged administration of <b>ximelagatran</b> was associated with an increased risk of liver toxicity. In a substantial proportion of patients, ALAT increase occurred after treatment withdrawal. The findings seen with <b>ximelagatran</b> should be considered when designing studies with new antithrombotic agent...|$|E

In the SPORTIF III and V trials, the oral direct thrombin inhibitor <b>ximelagatran</b> was as effective as warfarin in {{reducing the risk of}} stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. We assessed any differential effect of warfarin versus <b>ximelagatran</b> on the risk and outcome of cardioembolic and noncardioembolic stroke. METHODS: 7329 patients with AF and > or = 1 risk factors for stroke were randomized to treatment with warfarin (target international normalized ratio 2. 0 [...] 3. 0) or fixed-dose <b>ximelagatran.</b> Strokes were classified into specific subtypes. Therapeutic effect of warfarin and <b>ximelagatran,</b> adverse events, and stroke outcomes were assessed according to stroke subtype. RESULTS: The annual stroke rate was low for both cardioembolic (<b>ximelagatran,</b> 0. 39 %; warfarin, 0. 47 %) and noncardioembolic stroke (<b>ximelagatran,</b> 0. 57 %; warfarin, 0. 37 %). In ischemic strokes, 33. 9 % (<b>ximelagatran)</b> and 34. 3 % (warfarin) had strokes of presumed cardioembolic origin. When fatal stroke, disabling stroke, myocardial infarction, and death from any cause were combined as poor outcome, patients with cardioembolic strokes had the highest rate of poor outcome (40 %) but this was non- significant. CONCLUSIONS: In SPORTIF III and V the efficacy of warfarin and <b>ximelagatran</b> were similar for prevention of cardioembolic and noncardioembolic strokes.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Ximelagatran</b> is a novel, oral direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor that {{is currently}} being investigated for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical effects of melagatran, the active form of <b>ximelagatran,</b> in patients with both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Materials and methods: In this open-label study, 12 patients received a fixed dose of 48 mg oral <b>ximelagatran</b> twice daily for 6 - 9 days. Plasma samples were collected for determination of melagatran concentrations and scintigraphic changes and adverse events were recorded. Results: Peak plasma concentrations of melagatran were attained approximately 2 h after administration of <b>ximelagatran.</b> Melagatran plasma concentration profiles were similar on Days 1, 2, and 6 - 9. Plasma {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} increased following administration of <b>ximelagatran</b> and reached a peak that was approximately twofold higher than the predose activated partial thromboplastin time and correlated with melagatran plasma concentrations (R- 2 = 0. 69). All but one patient (with malignancy) showed regressed or unchanged lung scintigraphic findings, and six of these demonstrated no, or only minor, perfusion defects at central evaluation after 6 - 9 days of <b>ximelagatran</b> treatment.

40|$|<b>Ximelagatran</b> {{is a novel}} oral direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor {{that offers}} a number of advantages over the standard treatment, warfarin, in patients with atrial fibrillation. Two large clinical trials, one open-label (Stroke Prevention Using Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial Fibrillation [SPORTIF] III), one double-blind (SPORTIF V), have compared the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose <b>ximelagatran</b> without anticoagulation monitoring with dose-adjusted warfarin using a non-inferiority design. On {{the basis of the}} results, the investigators concluded that <b>ximelagatran</b> was just as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism (the primary end point), because the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion was met. Reanalysis of the data with rather conservative interpretive criteria, however, revealed a number of deficiencies: 1) an unreasonably generous margin that was potentially biased toward non-inferiority, given the low baseline event rate of warfarin; 2) the inappropriateness of the analytical method used to estimate the non-inferiority margin; 3) a lack of confidence that <b>ximelagatran</b> retains at least 50 % of warfarin’s effect (a prerequisite to the establishment of non-inferiority); 4) significant heterogeneity in the magnitude of efficacy observed in the two trials; and 5) safety concerns regarding increased liver toxicity with <b>ximelagatran</b> without a significant offsetting advantage in major bleeding. This imbalance in the benefit-risk profile materially undermines the investigators’ claim of non-inferiority of <b>ximelagatran</b> and led the Food and Drug Administration to reject the sponsor’s application for <b>ximelagatran.</b> Despite published conclusions to the contrary, we conclude that <b>ximelagatran</b> has not been shown to be non-inferior to warfarin.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} compare the {{tolerability}} and safety of three fixed doses of <b>ximelagatran</b> versus warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). BackgroundAnticoagulants such as warfarin {{lower the risk of}} stroke in patients with NVAF. <b>Ximelagatran</b> is a novel, oral direct thrombin inhibitor with predictable pharmacokinetics and no known food or pharmacokinetic drug interactions. MethodsThis was a 12 -week, randomized, parallel-group, dose-guiding study of NVAF patients with at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary end point was the number of thromboembolic events and bleedings. Three groups received <b>ximelagatran</b> (n = 187) at 20, 40, or 60 mg twice daily, given in a double-blind fashion, without routine coagulation monitoring. In a fourth group, warfarin (n = 67) was managed and monitored according to normal routines, aiming for an International Normalized Ratio of 2. 0 to 3. 0. ResultsA total of 254 patients received study drug. One ischemic stroke (nonfatal) and one transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred in the <b>ximelagatran</b> group. Two TIAs occurred in the warfarin group. No major bleeds were observed in the <b>ximelagatran</b> group. One major bleed occurred in a warfarin-treated patient. The number of minor and multiple minor bleeds was low, but there was a slight increase by <b>ximelagatran</b> dose. The 60 -mg dose resulted in the same number of bleeding events as that with warfarin.

DATA SOURCE: Studies with random assignment were identified by an electronic search of the medical literature up to 2006. Data were double-entered into the Review Manager software, version 4. 2. 5. DATA SYNTHESIS: We included three well-conducted clinical trials involving 4, 914 participants. Sub-groups with two dosages of <b>ximelagatran</b> (24 mg and 36 mg, b. i. d.), were defined. <b>Ximelagatran</b> showed significantly lower frequency of total venous thromboembolism (VTE) than warfarin, but only with the 36 -mg dosage (risk relative, RR: 0. 72; 95 % confidence interval, CI: 0. 64 - 0. 81; p < 0. 00001). For the 24 -mg subgroup, total VTE frequency was similar (RR: 0. 86; 95 % CI: 0. 73 - 1. 01; p = 0. 06). No significant differences were shown with either <b>ximelagatran</b> dosage for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, any bleeding or severe bleeding. At {{the end of the}} treatment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation was less frequent in the 24 -mg <b>ximelagatran</b> sub-group (RR: 0. 33; 95 % CI: 0. 12 - 0. 91; p = 0. 03], but during the follow-up period, the ALT elevation rate was greater in the 36 -mg <b>ximelagatran</b> group (RR: 6. 97; 95 % CI: 1. 26 - 38. 50; p = 0. 03].

40|$|Background: To show {{results of}} a {{prespecified}} pooled analysis of the studies SPORTIF III (open-label) and SPORTIF V (double-blind), to assess the homogeneity of the results and to explore subgroup analyses and adverse events. Methods and Results: 7, 329 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and 1 additional stroke risk factor were randomized to warfarin (international normalized ratio 2. 0 - 3. 0) or <b>ximelagatran</b> (36 mg twice daily). Over 11, 346 patient-years (mean 18. 5 months/patient), 184 patients developed primary events of stroke and systemic embolism (<b>ximelagatran</b> 1. 62 vs. warfarin 1. 65 %/year; p = 0. 94). Heterogeneity between trials {{with respect to the}} primary event rate (study-by-treatment interaction p = 0. 026) was found. This could not be explained statistically by baseline patient characteristics or by treatment (except perhaps by the better anticoagulation with warfarin in SPORTIF V) and was not evident for secondary end-points. There was no conclusive difference in major bleeding rates (<b>ximelagatran</b> 1. 88 vs. warfarin 2. 46 %/year; p = 0. 054), but combined minor plus major bleeding was lower with <b>ximelagatran</b> (31. 7 vs. 38. 7 %/year; p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Abstract Objectives <b>Ximelagatran</b> {{is a novel}} oral direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor. It has favorable pharmacodynamic properties, with a broad therapeutic range {{without the}} need for anticoagulation monitoring. We aimed to discover whether <b>ximelagatran</b> offers a genuine future replacement to warfarin for patients in persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Materials and methods We provide an evidence-based review of the relative merits and disadvantages of warfarin and aspirin. We subsequently present an overview of the evidence for the utility of <b>ximelagatran</b> in the treatment of AF. Results Adjusted dose warfarin is recommended over aspirin for patients in AF at high risk of future stroke. Some of this benefit is partially offset by the higher bleeding risks associated with warfarin therapy. The SPORTIF III and V studies have shown that <b>ximelagatran</b> is not inferior to warfarin in the prevention of all strokes in patients with AF (both persistent and paroxysmal). This benefit was partially offset by the finding of a significant elevation of liver transaminases (> 3 × normal) in 6 % of patients. Conclusions Current data would suggest that <b>ximelagatran</b> might represent a future alternative to warfarin. The lack of need for anticoagulant monitoring has been partially offset by a need for regular monitoring of liver function. Further data from randomized clinical trials is clearly needed. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{effects of}} <b>ximelagatran,</b> an oral direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor (DTI), recombinant hirudin (r-hirudin) and enoxaparin on thrombin generation and platelet activation were studied in humans. BackgroundRecombinant hirudin (parenteral DTI) and enoxaparin (low molecular weight heparin) {{have been demonstrated}} to be clinically effective in acute coronary syndromes. <b>Ximelagatran</b> is currently under investigation for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism. The shed blood model allows {{for the study of}} thrombin generation and platelet activation in humans in vivo. MethodsThis was an open-label, parallel-group study involving 120 healthy male volunteers randomized to receive one of three oral doses of <b>ximelagatran</b> (15, 30 or 60 mg), r-hirudin (intravenous) or enoxaparin (subcutaneous) at doses demonstrated to be clinically effective in acute coronary syndromes, or to serve as a control. Thrombin generation (prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 [F 1 + 2] and thrombin-antithrombin complex [TAT]) and platelet activation (β-thromboglobulin [β-TG]) biomarkers were studied using a shed blood model involving blood collection from skin incisions made using standardized bleeding time devices. ResultsOral <b>ximelagatran,</b> intravenous r-hirudin and subcutaneous enoxaparin rapidly and significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased F 1 + 2, TAT and β-TG levels in shed blood, indicating inhibition of thrombin generation and platelet activation. Statistically significant concentration (melagatran, the active form of <b>ximelagatran)</b> -response relationships for F 1 + 2 (p = 0. 005), TAT (p = 0. 005) and β-TG (p < 0. 001) levels, with IC 50 s of 0. 376 (F 1 + 2), 0. 163 (TAT) and 0. 115 (β-TG) μmol/l, were detected. Melagatran showed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with low variability. All drugs were well tolerated. ConclusionsOral administration of the DTI <b>ximelagatran</b> resulted in a rapid inhibition of both thrombin generation and platelet activation in a concentration-dependent manner using a human shed blood model.

40|$|The oral direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor <b>ximelagatran</b> (24 mg twice daily) {{has been}} shown to significantly reduce the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) vs. placebo over 18 months, with no significant influence on bleeding (THRIVE III). The influence of potential prognostic factors on the risk of recurrent VTE or major and/or minor bleeding and their impact on <b>ximelagatran</b> treatment was evaluated in the THRIVE III study population. The effect of sex, age, body weight, renal function, malignancy, type of initial VTE event, and history of previous VTE events was investigated in the intention-to-treat population using Cox proportionate hazard modelling. <b>Ximelagatran</b> was administered to 612 patients and placebo to 611 patients. Within the placebo group, risk of recurrent VTE was higher among men than women (hazard ratio [HR]: 2. 50, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 49, 4. 17), and in patients with one or more than one previous VTE event (HR: 1. 73, 95 % CI 1. 00, 2. 99). There was a higher risk of bleeding among women than men in both the <b>ximelagatran</b> (HR: 1. 49, 95 % CI 1. 06, 2. 09) and placebo (HR: 1. 48, 95 % CI 1. 01, 2. 15) groups, and in placebo-treated patients with an initial pulmonary embolism (HR: 1. 53, 95 % CI 1. 06, 2. 23) compared to those with initial deep vein thrombosis.

40|$|International audienceDietary vitamin K {{is known}} to {{influence}} the anticoagulation response to warfarin. It is possible that dietary vitamin K availability also influences the pharmacological activity of other oral anticoagulants, which target the vitamin-K dependent clotting proteins in the coagulation cascade. This study examined whether vitamin K insufficiency affected anticoagulation response to the direct thrombin inhibitor, <b>ximelagatran.</b> Anticoagulation response to <b>ximelagatran</b> and warfarin in rats on a normal diet was compared to those on a vitamin K deficient diet. <b>Ximelagatran</b> and warfarin increased prothrombin time (PT) by 1. 4 - and 1. 3 -fold, {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) by 1. 8 - and 1. 4 -fold and ecarin clotting time (ECT) by 6. 8 - and 1. 2 -fold, respectively, in rats on normal diet. Vitamin K deficient diet alone caused modest increases in PT, APTT and ECT. The anticoagulant activity of both <b>ximelagatran</b> and warfarin was significantly greater in rats on vitamin K deficient diet (6. 1 - and 12. 3 -fold for PT, 2. 6 - and 5. 1 -fold for APTT and 2. 9 - and 1. 6 -fold for ECT, respectively) compared to those on normal diet. Factor II activity was reduced by both <b>ximelagatran</b> (58 %) and warfarin (44 %) in rats on normal diet. However, factor II activity was virtually abolished (< 0. 1 %) by both drugs in rats on vitamin K deficient diet.

40|$|<b>Ximelagatran</b> is {{the first}} oral agent in {{a new class of}} direct {{thrombin}} inhibitors and is under investigation for the prevention and treatment of a range of thromboembolic disorders. Atrial. fibrillation (AF) is associated with a markedly increased risk of stroke and, while study results have consistently demonstrated that anticoagulant therapy with warfarin reduces this risk, there are substantial unmet needs in the management of AF-associated thrombotic risk. In particular, warfarin has unpredictable activity leading to the risk of bleeding complications and the need for routine anticoagulant monitoring. <b>Ximelagatran</b> has a range of potential benefits over warfarin in the prevention of AF-associated stroke, including predictable anticoagulant activity that is not affected by food and a tow potential for drug-drug interactions. Consequently, the risk of bleeding complications may be,reduced and there is a fixed-dose regimen with no requirement for routine anticoagulant monitoring. The SPORTIF (Stroke Prevention using an ORal Thrombin Inhibitor in atrial. Fibrillation) series of studies is investigating {{the extent to which these}} potential advantages translate into clinical benefits. SPORTIF III is a Phase III study of the efficacy and safety of <b>ximelagatran</b> compared with warfarin in the prevention of stroke in 3407 patients with AF. The results demonstrate that <b>ximelagatran</b> has effectiveness non-inferior to well-controlled warfarin in the prevention of stroke and is associated with a lower risk of bleeding complications. With its predictable anticoagulant effect and the enhanced convenience offered by a fixed-dose regimen and with no requirement for routine coagulation monitoring, these results indicate that <b>ximelagatran</b> promises clinical benefits over warfarin that could improve the management of stroke risk in patients with AF.

40|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) {{is often}} {{caused by a}} disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque with activation of coagulation, platelets and inflammation. The aims were; to investigate whether the oral direct thrombin inhibitor, <b>ximelagatran</b> affected markers for coagulation, platelet and inflammation in a patient cohort with recent MI and if the coagulation markers could identify patients with increased risk of new ischemic events; to evaluate some of the mechanisms involved in formation of platelet-monocyte aggregates (PMAs). In a biomarker substudy patients with recent MI were randomized to 24 - 60 mg of <b>ximelagatran</b> or placebo for six months. There was a persistent dose-independent reduction of coagulation markers (F 1 + 2, D-dimer) by <b>ximelagatran</b> treatment. 60 % reduced their D-dimer levels after one week and that group had less ischemic events during treatment. There was an early increase of the platelet activation marker and <b>ximelagatran</b> in higher doses attenuated these increased levels. Both in vivo and in vitro the direct thrombin inhibitor diminished procoagulant activity and tissue factor (TF) presenting microparticles. In contrast, the inflammatory markers increased {{after six months of}} <b>ximelagatran</b> treatment. The PMA-levels were elevated for long-term after MI. In vitro thrombin inhibition diminished formation of PMAs. Formation of PMAs in stimulated whole blood was P-selectin dependent and induced TF expression through phosphorylation of the Src-family member Lyn in monocytes. Addition of an oral direct thrombin inhibitor reduces coagulation and platelet activation markers for long-term after a MI together with reduced procoagulant activity which may contribute to the clinical benefit of the drug. Early reduction of D-dimer levels seems to be suitable to identify patients with reduced risk of new ischemic events independent of antithrombotic treatment. Circulating PMAs persist after a MI connecting coagulation to inflammation. Within these aggregates P-selectin induces TF, the main initiator of coagulation, partly through phosphorylation of Lyn...|$|E
40|$|Biliary {{excretion}} is {{an important}} elimination route for many drugs and metabolites. For such compounds, {{it is important to}} know the extent of excretion and drug exposure in the bile, e. g., for the risk assessment of drug interactions, liver toxicity and the effects of genetic variants. In this thesis, duodenal aspiration of bile was performed in healthy volunteers and complemented with experiments in an in vivo model in pigs to increase the understanding of the intestinal and hepatobiliary disposition of two direct thrombin inhibitors. The compounds investigated, <b>ximelagatran</b> and AZD 0837, are both prodrugs that require bioactivation to exert their pharmacological effect. Upon co-administration with erythromycin and ketoconazole, respectively, altered plasma exposure to <b>ximelagatran</b> and AZD 0837 and their respective metabolites has been observed. The main objective of this thesis was to characterize the biliary excretion of the compounds, and investigate whether this elimination route explains the observed drug-drug interactions. High plasma-to-bile AUC ratios were observed, in particular for <b>ximelagatran,</b> its active metabolite melagatran, and AR-H 067637, the active metabolite of AZD 0837. These high ratios indicate the involvement of active transporters in the biliary excretion of the compounds, which is important since transporters constitute possible sites for drug interactions. The effects of erythromycin and ketoconazole on the plasma exposure of the prodrugs and metabolites were confirmed in both the pig and the clinical studies. The changes seen in plasma for <b>ximelagatran</b> and its metabolites were partly explained by reduced biliary clearance. Inhibited CYP 3 A 4 metabolism likely caused the elevated plasma levels of AZD 0837, whereas reduced biliary clearance was seen for AR-H 067637 suggesting an effect on its excretion into bile. In summary, the studies led to mechanistic insights in the hepatobiliary disposition of <b>ximelagatran</b> and AZD 0837, and demonstrate the value of combined clinical and animal studies for the investigation of the biliary drug excretion...|$|E
40|$|For {{prevention}} and treatment of thrombotic diseases with an anticoagulant drug {{it is important that}} an adequate dose is given to avoid occurrence or recurrence of thrombosis, without increasing the risk of bleeding and other adverse events to unacceptable levels. The aim of this thesis was to develop mathematical models that describe the dose-concentration (pharmacokinetic) and concentration-response (pharmacodynamic) relationships of direct thrombin inhibitors, in order to estimate optimal dosages for treatment and long-term secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models were developed, based on data from clinical investigations in healthy volunteers and patients receiving intravenous inogatran, subcutaneous melagatran and/or its oral prodrug <b>ximelagatran.</b> The benefit-risk profiles of different <b>ximelagatran</b> dosages were estimated using clinical utility functions. These functions were based on the probabilities and fatal consequences of thrombosis, bleeding and elevation of the hepatic enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALAT). The studies demonstrate that the pharmacokinetics of melagatran and <b>ximelagatran</b> were predictable and well correlated to renal function. The coagulation marker, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), increased non-linearly with increasing thrombin inhibitor plasma concentration. Overall, the systemic melagatran exposure (AUC) and APTT were similarly predictive of thrombosis and bleedings. The identified relationship between the risk of ALAT-elevation and melagatran AUC suggests that the incidence approaches a maximum at high exposures. The estimated clinical utility was favourable compared to placebo in the overall study population and in special subgroups of patients following fixed dosing of <b>ximelagatran</b> for long-term secondary prevention of VTE. Individualized dosing was predicted to add limited clinical benefit in this indication. The models developed can be used to support the studied dosage and for selection of alternative dosing strategies that may improve the clinical outcome of <b>ximelagatran</b> treatment. In addition, the models may be extrapolated to aid the dose selection in clinical trials with other direct thrombin inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Background: Warfarin, which {{requires}} coagulation monitoring, {{is associated with}} relatively high rates of thromboem-bolism despite providing adequate prophylaxis. This study compared an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, <b>ximelagatran,</b> with warfarin in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the medication {{for the prevention of}} venous thromboembo-lism in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Methods: Following surgery, patients were randomly assigned to fixed-dose oral <b>ximelagatran</b> (36 mg twice daily) or warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2. 5), both administered for seven to twelve days in a double-blind, double-dummy design. Warfarin was initiated on the evening of the day of surgery, and <b>ximelagatran,</b> on the morning after surgery. The primary efficacy end point was the incidence of asymptomatic deep-vein thrombosis determined by bilateral venography, objectively confirmed symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and death from all causes during treatment. Results: Adequate venograms or confirmed symptomatic events (efficacy population) were obtained for 1949 pa-tients. Venous thromboembolism and death from all causes occurred in 22. 5 % (221) of 982 ximelagatran-treated pa-tients and in 31. 9 % (308) of 967 warfarin-treated patients (p < 0. 001). Proximal deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were observed in 3. 1 % (thirty) and 0. 2 %, respectively, of the patients in the <b>ximelagatran</b> group and in 3. 4 % (thirty-three) and 0. 4 %, respectively, of the patients in the warfarin group.

40|$|Recently two novel enzymes were {{identified}} in the outer mitochondrial membrane, mARC 1 and mARC 2. These molybdenum containing enzymes can reduce a variety of N-hydroxylated compounds, such as N-hydroxy-guanidines and sulfohydroxamic acids, as well as convert nitrite into nitric oxide (NO). However, their endogenous functions remain unknown. Here we demonstrate a specific developmental pattern of expression of these enzymes. mARC 1, but not mARC 2, {{was found to be}} expressed in fetal human liver, whereas both, in particular mARC 2, are abundant in adult liver and also expressed in omental and subcutaneous fat. Caloric diet restriction of obese patients caused a decreased expression of mARC 2 in liver, similar to that seen in the livers of starved rats. Knock down of mARC 2 expression by siRNA in murine adipocytes had statistically significant effect on the level of diglycerides and on the fatty acid composition of some triglycerides, concomitantly a clear trend toward the reduced formation of most of triglyceride and phospholipid species was observed. The involvement of mARC 2 in the metabolism of the hepatotoxic drug <b>ximelagatran</b> was evaluated in hepatocytes and adipocytes. <b>Ximelagatran</b> was shown to cause oxidative stress and knock down of mARC 2 in adipocytes prevented <b>ximelagatran</b> induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. In conclusion, our data indicate that mARC 1 and mARC 2 have different developmental expression profiles, and that mARC 2 is involved in lipogenesis, is regulated by nutritional status and responsible for activation of <b>ximelagatran</b> into a mitotoxic metabolite(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) causes 50, 000 to 100, 000 ischemic strokes {{annually in}} the U. S., most {{of which could be}} prevented by oral anticoagulant treatment of the highest-risk patients. The greatest barrier to such treatment is the narrow therapeutic index of the vitamin K antagonists ([VKAs]: warfarin and related coumarin derivatives), the only oral anticoagulant agents currently available. Safe and effective treatment with the VKAs requires careful monitoring, because they interact with many other drugs and foods, and their anticoagulant action is unpredictable. Besides vitamin K, candidate targets for anticoagulant therapy include thrombin, a key prothrombotic mediator. <b>Ximelagatran,</b> the oral direct thrombin inhibitor at the most advanced stage of clinical development, is rapidly absorbed and bioconverted to its active moiety, melagatran—a potent, competitive inhibitor of both free and clot-bound thrombin. Two large clinical trials have demonstrated that fixed-dose oral <b>ximelagatran,</b> 36 mg twice daily, administered without coagulation monitoring, prevents stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with nonvalvular AF as effectively as well-controlled, adjusted-dose warfarin (international normalized ratio 2. 0 to 3. 0). The overall risk of bleeding was lower with <b>ximelagatran</b> than warfarin, although differences in rates of major hemorrhage were not statistically significant. Elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase levels above 3 × the upper limit of normal occurred in approximately 6 % of ximelagatran-treated patients but typically returned toward pretreatment levels without associated symptoms. In terms of preventing thromboembolism without hemorrhage, <b>ximelagatran</b> may have a more favorable benefit:risk profile than warfarin for patients with AF...|$|E
40|$|International audienceXimelagatran, {{the first}} oral {{agent in the}} new class of direct {{thrombin}} inhibitors, was withdrawn from the market due to a potential risk of severe liver injury. Increased rates of liver enzyme elevations had been observed during clinical trials of chronic use. Despite intensive preclinical investigations the cellular mechanisms behind the observed hepatic effects remain unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether <b>ximelagatran</b> has an effect on the plasma membrane fluidity and the membrane lipid composition which may be important for the cell integrity. After 1 h exposure of primary human hepatocytes with 10 or 100 microM <b>ximelagatran,</b> a significant elevation of membrane fluidity was observed. This elevation was maintained at 24 h, but diminished at 48 h exposure. As changed membrane lipid composition could influence membrane fluidities, changes in membrane lipid profiles were also studied. After 1 h exposure, the phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine molar ratio decreased, whereas the total cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio decreased after a 48 h exposure. The change in membrane fluidity and lipid composition in human hepatocytes exposed to <b>ximelagatran</b> might indicate changes in plasma membrane properties that in susceptible subjects, could result in loss of membrane integrity and leakage of cellular proteins...|$|E
40|$|The oral {{thrombin}} inhibitor <b>ximelagatran</b> {{was withdrawn}} {{in the late}} clinical trial phase because it adversely affected the liver. In approximately 8 % of treated patients, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) was expressed as transient alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations. No evidence of DILI had been revealed in the pre-clinical in vivo studies. A whole genome scan study performed on the clinical study material identified a strong genetic association between the major histocompatibility complex alleles for human leucocyte antigens (HLA) (HLA-DR 7 and HLA-DQ 2) and elevated ALT levels in treated patients. An immunemediated pathogenesis was suggested. Here, we evaluated whether HLA transgenic mice models {{could be used to}} investigate whether the expression of relevant HLA molecules was enough to reproduce the DILI effects in humans. In silico modelling performed in this study revealed association of both <b>ximelagatran</b> (pro-drug) and melagatran (active drug) to the antigen-presenting groove of the homology modelled HLA-DR 7 molecule suggesting "altered repertoire" as a key initiating event driving development of DILI in humans. Transgenic mouse strains (tgms) expressing HLA of serotype HLA-DR 7 (HLA-DRB 1 * 0701, -DRA* 0102), and HLA-DQ 2 (HLA-DQB 1 * 0202, -DQA 1 * 0201) were created. These two lines were crossed with a human (h) CD 4 transgenic line, generating the two tgms DR 7 xhCD 4 and DQ 2 xhCD 4. To investigate whether the DILI effects observed in humans could be reproduced in tgms, the mice were treated for 28 days with <b>ximelagatran.</b> Results revealed no signs of DILI when biomarkers for liver toxicity were measured and histopathology was evaluated. In the <b>ximelagatran</b> case, presence of relevant HLA-expression in a preclinical model did not fulfil the prerequisite for reproducing DILI observed in patients. Nonetheless, for the first time an HLA-transgenic mouse model has been investigated for use in HLA-associated DILI induced by a low molecular weight compound. This study shows that mimicking of genetic susceptibility, expressed as DILI-associated HLA-types in mice, is not sufficient for reproducing the complex pathogenesis leading to DILI in man.

40|$|Shir-Jing Ho 1, Tim A Brighton 2, 31 St George Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia; 2 University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; 3 SEALS (Randwick), Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, AustraliaAbstract: Warfarin sodium is an {{effective}} oral anticoagulant drug. However, warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window with significant risks of hemorrhage at therapeutic concentrations. Dosing is difficult and requires frequent monitoring. New oral anticoagulant agents are required to improve current anticoagulant therapy. Furthermore, while warfarin is effective in venous disease, it does not provide more than 60 % risk reduction compared with placebo in venous thrombosis prophylaxis and considerably lower risk reduction in terms of arterial thrombosis. <b>Ximelagatran</b> is an oral pro-drug of melagatran, a synthetic small peptidomimetic with direct thrombin inhibitory actions and anticoagulant activity. As an oral agent, <b>ximelagatran</b> {{has a number of}} desirable properties including a rapid onset of action, fixed dosing, stable absorption, apparent low potential for medication interactions, and no requirement for monitoring of drug levels or dose adjustment. It has a short plasma elimination half-life of about 4 hours in cases of unexpected hemorrhage or need for reversal. Its main toxicity relates to the development of abnormal liver biochemistry and/or liver dysfunction with “long-term” use of the drug. This usually occurs within the first 6 months of commencing therapy, with a small percentage of patients developing jaundice. The biochemical abnormality usually resolves despite continuation of the drug. The cause of this toxicity remains unknown. Clinical studies to date have shown that <b>ximelagatran</b> is noninferior to warfarin in stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, noninferior to standard therapy as acute and extended therapy of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and superior to warfarin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism post-major orthopedic surgery. It has also been shown to be more effective than aspirin alone for prevention of recurrent major cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction.
