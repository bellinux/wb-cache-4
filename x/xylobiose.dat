Pre-weighed amounts of xylose (final concentration of 3. 5  mg/ml), <b>xylobiose</b> (7  mg/ml) and hydrolyzed xylan from sugarcane bagasse (HXSB) which contained xylose, <b>xylobiose</b> and xylotriose (6. 8  mg/ml) were evaluated as inducers of xylanase. It was observed that xylose did not suppress enzyme induction of T. aurantiacus when used in low concentrations, regardless of whether it was inoculated with <b>xylobiose.</b> <b>Xylobiose</b> promoted fast enzyme production stopping after 10  h, even at a low consumption rate of the carbon source; therefore <b>xylobiose</b> appears to be the natural inducer of xylanase.

In this work, we have investigated the molecular basis for the action mode of xylanases 10 B at high temperatures using biochemical, biophysical and crystallographic methods. The crystal structure of xylanase 10 B from hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga petrophila RKU- 1 (TpXyl 10 B) has been solved in the native state and in complex with <b>xylobiose.</b> The complex crystal structure showed a classical binding mode shared among other xylanases, which encompasses the − 1 and − 2 subsites. Interestingly, TpXyl 10 B displayed a temperature-dependent action mode producing <b>xylobiose</b> and xylotriose at 20 °C, and exclusively <b>xylobiose</b> at 90 °C as assessed by capillary zone electrophoresis. Moreover, circular dichroism spectroscopy suggested a coupling effect of temperature-induced structural changes with this particular enzymatic behavior. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the CD analysis suggesting that an open conformational state adopted by the catalytic loop (Trp 297 -Lys 326) provokes significant modifications in the product release area (+ 1,+ 2 and + 3 subsites), which drives the enzymatic activity to the specific release of <b>xylobiose</b> at high temperatures...|$|E

Significant amounts of low molecular mass compounds, <b>xylobiose</b> and trace amounts of xylose were liberated from birch wood xylan after 24  h (Lin et al.

Xylanase from Thermotoga maritima is an extremely thermostable enzyme which hydrolyzed xylo-oligosaccharides and xylans to yield predominantly <b>xylobiose</b> as end product (Jiang et al. [2004]). <b>Xylobiose</b> and small xylooligomers as main products in high amount from Arundo biomass confirmed this activity.

The results on Arundo indicated also that action of β-glucosidases is dependent on enzymatic load in the reaction mixture, and this phenomenon could be analyzed with respect to the known interrelation of cellulases and xylanases in the bioconversion of lignocellulosic material (Hu et al.

We studied primarily the responses toward cellobiose, which is the major product of cellulose hydrolysis by microorganisms, and toward hemicellulose hydrolysis products. We found that cellobiose, cellotriose, D-glucose, <b>xylobiose,</b> and D-xylose, as well as other sugars that are hemicellulose components, served as chemoattractants for C. gelida, as determined by a modification of Adler's capillary assay.

Thus, we present d-xylose quantitation results for solution-phase assays performed with both the fluorescent reporter resorufin, generated from N-acetyl- 3, 7 -dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red), and 2, 2 ′-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonate) (ABTS), whose corresponding radical cation has an absorbance maximum at ∼ 400 nm. We also describe a useful solid-phase variation of the assay performed with the peroxidase substrate 3, 3 ′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, which produces an insoluble brown precipitate. In addition, kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of the natural substrates <b>xylobiose</b> and xylotriose were obtained using this assay for a glycosyl hydrolase family 39 β-xylosidase from Thermoanaerobacterium sp. strain JW/SL YS 485 (Swiss-Prot accession no. O 30360). At higher <b>xylobiose</b> substrate concentrations the enzyme showed an increase in the rate indicative of transglycosylation, while for xylotriose marked substrate inhibition was observed. At lower <b>xylobiose</b> concentrations kcat was 2. 7 ± 0. 4 s− 1, Km was 3. 3 ± 0. 7 mM, and kcat/Km was 0. 82 ± 0. 21 mM− 1 [*]·[*]s− 1. Nonlinear curve fitting to a substrate inhibition model showed that for xylotriose Ki was 1. 7 ± 0. 1 mM, kcat was 2. 0 ± 0. 1 s− 1, Km was 0. 144 ± 0. 011 mM, and kcat/Km was 14 ± 1. 3 mM− 1 [*]·[*]s− 1...|$|E
40|$|By {{inspection}} of the predicted proteome of the fungus Myceliophthora thermophila C 1 for VAO-type flavoprotein oxidases, a putative oligosaccharide oxidase was identified. By homologous expression and subsequent purification the respective protein could be obtained. The protein was found to contain a bicovalently bound FAD cofactor. By screening {{a large number of}} carbohydrates, several mono- and oligosaccharides could be identified as substrate. The enzyme exhibits a strong substrate preference towards xylooligosaccharides, hence it is named xylooligosaccharide oxidase (XylO). Chemical analyses of the product formed upon oxidation of <b>xylobiose</b> revealed that the oxidation occurs at C 1, yielding xylobionate as product. By elucidation of several XylO crystal structures (in complex with a substrate mimic, xylose and <b>xylobiose),</b> the residues that tune the unique substrate specificity and regioselectivity could be identified. The discovery of this novel oligosaccharide oxidase reveals that the VAO-type flavoprotein family harbors oxidases tuned for specific oligosaccharides. The unique substrate profile of XylO hints to a role in the degradation of xylan derived oligosaccharides by the fungus M. thermophila C 1...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli {{is being}} {{developed}} as a biocatalyst for bulk chemical production from inexpensive carbohydrates derived from lignocellulose. Potential substrates include the soluble xylodextrins (xyloside, xylooligosaccharide) and <b>xylobiose</b> that are produced by treatments designed to expose cellulose for subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Adjacent genes encoding <b>xylobiose</b> uptake and hydrolysis were cloned from Klebsiella oxytoca M 5 A 1 and are functionally expressed in ethanologenic E. coli. The xylosidase encoded by xynB contains the COG 3507 domain characteristic of glycosyl hydrolase family 43. The xynT gene encodes a membrane protein containing the MelB domain (COG 2211) found in Na+/melibiose symporters and related proteins. These two genes form a bicistronic operon {{that appears to be}} regulated by xylose (XylR) and by catabolite repression in both K. oxytoca and recombinant E. coli. Homologs of this operon were found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus lactis, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Bacillus subtilis based on sequence comparisons. Based on similarities in protein sequence, the xynTB genes in K. oxytoca appear to have originated from a gram-positive ancestor related to L. lactis. Functional expression of xynB allowed ethanologenic E. coli to metabolize xylodextrins (xylosides) containing up to six xylose residues without the addition of enzyme supplements. 4 -O-methylglucuronic acid substitutions at the nonreducing termini of soluble xylodextrins blocked further degradation by the XynB xylosidase. The rate of xylodextrin utilization by recombinant E. coli was increased when a full-length xynT gene was included with xynB, consistent with xynT functioning as a symport. Hydrolysis rates were inversely related to xylodextrin chain length, with <b>xylobiose</b> as the preferred substrate. Xylodextrins were utilized more rapidly by recombinant E. coli than K. oxytoca M 5 A 1 (the source of xynT and xynB). XynB exhibited weak arabinosidase activity, 3 % that of xylosidase...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} omega-epoxyalkyl glycosides of D-xylopyranose, <b>xylobiose</b> and {{xylotriose}} were tested as potential active-site-directed inhibitors of xylanases from glycoside hydrolase families 10 and 11. Whereas family- 10 enzymes (Thermoascus aurantiacus Xyn and Clostridium thermocellum Xyn Z) are resistant toelectrophilic attack of active-site carboxyl residues, glycosidehydrolases of family 11 (Thermomyces lanuginosus Xyn and Trichoderma reesei Xyn II) are irreversibly inhibited. Theapparent inactivation and association constants (k(i), 1 /K(i)) are one {{order of magnitude}} higher for thexylobiose and xylotriose derivatives. The effects of the aglycone chainlength can clearly be described. <b>Xylobiose</b> and n-alkyl beta-D-xylopyranosides are competitive ligands and provide protectionagainst inactivation. MS measurements showed 1 : 1 stoichiometries inmost labelling experiments. Electrospray ionization MS/MS analysisrevealed the nucleophile Glu(86) as the modified residue inthe T. lanuginosus xylanase when 2, 3 -epoxypropyl beta-D-xylopyranoside was used, whereas the acid/base catalyst Glu(178) was modified by the 3, 4 -epoxybutyl derivative. The active-site residues Glu(86) and Glu(177) in T. reesei Xyn II are similarly modified, confirming earlier X-raycrystallographic data [Havukainen, Törrönen, Laitinen and Rouvinen (1996) Biochemistry 35, 9617 - 9624].

40|$|AbstractHypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei) is a {{saprophytic}} fungus {{that produces}} hydrolases, which are applied {{in different types}} of industries and used {{for the production of}} biofuel. A recombinant Hypocrea strain, which constantly expresses the main transcription activator of hydrolases (Xylanase regulator 1), was found to grow faster on xylan and its monomeric backbone molecule d-xylose. This strain also showed improved ability of clearing xylan medium on plates. Furthermore, this strain has a changed transcription profile concerning genes encoding for hydrolases and enzymes associated with degradation of (hemi) celluloses. We demonstrated that enzymes of this strain from a xylan cultivation favoured break down of hemicelluloses to the monomer d-xylose compared to the parental strain, while the enzymes of the latter one formed more <b>xylobiose.</b> Applying supernatants from cultivation on carboxymethylcellulose in enzymatic conversion of hemicelluloses, the enzymes of the recombinant strain were clearly producing more of both, d-xylose and <b>xylobiose,</b> compared to the parental strain. Altogether, these results point to a changed hydrolase expression profile, an enhanced capability to form the xylan-monomer d-xylose and the assumption that there is a disordered induction pattern if the Xylanase regulator 1 is de-regulated in Hypocrea...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Corn husks are {{the major}} wastes of corn {{industries}} with meagre economic significance. The present study was planned for value addition of corn husk through extraction of xylan, followed by its enzymatic hydrolysis into xylooligosaccharides, a pentose based prebiotic. Compositional analysis of corn husks revealed neutral detergent fibre 68. 87 %, acid detergent fibre 31. 48 %, hemicelluloses 37. 39 %, cellulose 29. 07 % and crude protein 2. 68 %. Irrespective of the extraction conditions, sodium hydroxide {{was found to be}} more effective in maximizing the yield of xylan from corn husks than potassium hydroxide (84 % vs. 66 %). Application of xylanase over the xylan of corn husks resulted into production of xylooligosaccharides with different degree of polymerization namely, <b>xylobiose</b> and xylotriose in addition to xylose monomer. On the basis of response surface model analysis, the maximum yield of <b>xylobiose</b> (1. 9 mg/ml) was achieved with the enzymatic hydrolysis conditions of pH 5. 8, temperature 44 °C, enzyme dose 5. 7 U/ml and hydrolysis time of 17. 5 h. Therefore, the corn husks could be used as raw material for xylan extraction vis a vis its translation into prebiotic xylooligosaccharides...|$|E
