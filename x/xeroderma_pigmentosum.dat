5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results {{in the development of}} cancers. An example of such a hereditary cancer syndrome is <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum,</b> which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these three conditions, several other human syndromes, that also have defective DNA repair, show several features of premature aging. These include ataxia telangiectasia, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, some subgroups of <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum,</b> trichothiodystrophy, Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Some {{individuals}} with the rare inherited syndrome <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum</b> have mutations in ERCC4. These patients {{are classified as}} XP complementation group F (XP-F). Diagnostic features of XP are dry scaly skin, abnormal skin pigmentation in sun-exposed areas and severe photosensitivity, accompanied by a great than 1000-fold increased risk of developing UV radiation-induced skin cancers.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{somewhat}} {{effective for}} hidradenitis suppurativa and some cases of severe acne rosacea. It {{can also be}} used to help treat harlequin ichthyosis, lamellar ichthyosis and is used in <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum</b> cases to relieve keratoses. Isotretinoin has been used to treat the extremely rare condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. It is also used for treatment of neuroblastoma, a form of nerve cancer.|$|E
25|$|TALEN {{has also}} been {{utilized}} experimentally to correct the genetic errors that underlie disease. For example, {{it has been used}} in vitro to correct the genetic defects that cause disorders such as sickle cell disease, <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum,</b> and epidermolysis bullosa. Recently, it was shown that TALEN can be used as tools to harness the immune system to fight cancers; TALEN-mediated targeting can generate T cells that are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs and show anti-tumor activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{melanoma}} is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those {{with low levels of}} skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum</b> also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion.|$|E
25|$|Examples of PS include Werner {{syndrome}} (WS), Bloom syndrome (BS), Rothmund–Thomson syndrome (RTS), Cockayne syndrome (CS), <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum</b> (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD), combined xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS), restrictive dermopathy (RD), and Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Individuals {{with these}} disorders {{tend to have}} a reduced lifespan. Progeroid syndromes have been widely studied in the fields of aging, regeneration, stem cells, and cancer. The most widely studied of the progeroid syndromes are Werner syndrome and Hutchinson–Gilford progeria, as they are seen to most resemble natural aging.|$|E
25|$|F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1922 {{short story}} The Curious Case of Benjamin Button {{is about a}} boy who was born with the {{appearance}} of a 70-year-old and who ages backwards. This short story is thought to be inspired by progeria. The description of the fictitious Smallweed family in the Charles Dickens' Bleak House suggests the characters suffered from progeria. Christopher Snow, the main character in Dean Koontz's Moonlight Bay Trilogy, suffers from <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum,</b> as does Luke from the 2002 novel Going Out by Scarlett Thomas.|$|E
25|$|One {{class of}} {{mutations}} affects the gene CDKN2A. An alternative reading frame mutation in this gene {{leads to the}} destabilization of p53, a transcription factor involved in apoptosis and in fifty percent of human cancers. Another mutation in the same gene results in a nonfunctional inhibitor of CDK4, a cyclin-dependent kinase that promotes cell division. Mutations that cause the skin condition <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum</b> (XP) also increase melanoma susceptibility. Scattered throughout the genome, these mutations reduce a cell's ability to repair DNA. Both CDKN2A and XP mutations are highly penetrant (the chances of a carrier to express the phenotype is high).|$|E
25|$|TTD {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} {{in one of three}} genes, ERCC2, ERCC3, or GTF2H5, the first two of which are also linked to <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum.</b> However, patients with TTD do not show a higher risk of developing skin cancer, in contrast to patients with XP. The three genes associated with TTD encode for XPB, XPD and p8/TTDA of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, which is involved in transcription and DNA damage repair. Mutations in one of these genes cause reduction of gene transcription, which may be involved in development (including placental development), and thus may explain retardation in intellectual abilities, in some cases; these mutations also lead to reduction in DNA repair, causing photosensitivity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum</b> mostly {{affects the}} eye and skin. Individuals with XP have extreme {{sensitivity}} to light in the ultraviolet range starting from {{one to two years}} of age, and causes sunburn, freckling of skin, dry skin and pigmentation after exposure. When the eye is exposed to sunlight, it becomes irritated and bloodshot, and the cornea becomes cloudy. Around 30% of affected individuals also develop neurological abnormalities, including deafness, poor coordination, decreased intellectual abilities, difficulty swallowing and talking, and seizures; these effects tend to become progressively worse over time. All affected individuals have a 1000-fold higher risk of developing skin cancer: half of the affected population develop skin cancer by age 10, usually at areas most exposed to sunlight (e.g. face, head, or neck). The risk for other cancers such as brain tumors, lung cancer and eye cancers also increase.|$|E

2500|$|Cells with {{disabling}} {{mutations in}} [...] ERCC4 {{are more sensitive}} than normal to particular DNA damaging agents, including ultraviolet radiation and to chemicals that cause crosslinking between DNA strands. Genetically engineered mice with disabling mutations in ERCC4 also have defects in DNA repair, accompanied by metabolic stress-induced changes in physiology that result in premature aging. Complete deletion of ERCC4 is incompatible with viability of mice, and no human individuals have been found with complete (homozygous) deletion of ERCC4. Rare individuals in the human population harbor inherited mutations that impair the function of ERCC4. When the normal genes are absent, these mutations can lead to human syndromes, including <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum,</b> Cockayne syndrome and Fanconi anemia.|$|E

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the XPG-I is {{a protein}} domain found on <b>Xeroderma</b> <b>Pigmentosum</b> Complementation Group G (XPG) protein. The XPG protein is an endonuclease which repairs DNA {{damage caused by}} ultraviolet light (UV light). The XPG protein repairs DNA by a process called, Nucleotide excision repair. Mutations in the protein commonly cause <b>Xeroderma</b> <b>Pigmentosum</b> which often lead to skin cancer.|$|E
50|$|Since DNA repair {{is under}} genetic control, it can easily undergo mutations. Many genetic {{disorders}} such as <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum</b> (XP; MIM 278700) are caused by mutations in genes that repair DNA.

The autosomal recessive disorder <b>xeroderma</b> <b>pigmentosum</b> or XP has a frequency of 1 in every 250,000 individuals of all races and ethnic groups. Those affected with the autosomal recessive disorder XP are extremely sensitive to UV light produced by the sun and even with a short exposure to it causes dry, flaking skin and pigmented spots that can develop into skin cancer.
