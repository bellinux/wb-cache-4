It houses a 6-bed ward, isolation room, dental surgery, <b>X-ray</b> <b>room</b> and operating theatre. In the late 1980s the building became volunteer accommodation, until it was decommissioned in 2016 {{with the opening of}} the International Volunteer Lodge.

The center provides primary care services such as vaccinations, spaying and neutering, microchiping, surgery, dental exams and cleanings, as well as flea, tick and heartworm control.

2500|$|ICRC chose KID {{for their}} first border [...] where acute trauma {{patients}} were cared for, at first mainly war wounded but later large numbers of landmine victims. Surgical equipment was donated from the French hospital ship L'Île de Lumière. Initially two hospitals (A and B) were constructed with 900 beds each in 17 wards: four pediatric wards, including one intensive feeding center; two wards for gynecology and obstetrics; two surgical wards, including an admission and emergency center; one tuberculosis center; and eight general medicine wards, In addition, there was a surgical unit with two [...] containing four operating tables, and a post-operative unit. There also were two hospital kitchens, a warehouse, a laboratory, and an <b>x-ray</b> <b>room.</b> Each ward housed 70-120 patients, and the maximal capacity of the entire facility was about 1,800 patients.|$|E

40|$|The X-ray machine {{workload}} (W) {{is defined}} as the integral of the anode current of the tube for a certain period of time. Information about the workload of an X-ray machine is needed in calculations of the structural shielding in the <b>X-ray</b> <b>rooms</b> and in comparing the results of radiation monitoring, conducted in the <b>X-ray</b> <b>rooms,</b> with the permissible levels of doses to different categories of exposed persons. In the Russian Federation, the calculations of the structural shielding in the <b>X-ray</b> <b>rooms</b> are currently based on the conservative approach developed in the 1970 s. This approach assumes that a very high value of workload, Wsum = 1000 mA×min×week- 1, is used in the calculatons. Additionally to this conservative assumption, the maximum value of 100 kV for the anode voltage is used. The aim {{of this study was to}} collect and analyze the information concerning real workload values of the X-ray machines placed in the routine rooms.  The total values of the weekly workload and its distribution as a function of the tube voltage were registered.  The average and maximum values of workload among surveyed X-ray units were about 2 – 4 times lower than the value of 1000 mA×min×week- 1 specified in the National sanitary norms SanPin 2. 6. 1. 1192 - 03. Demo calculations show that if one uses the actual distribution of medical procedures depending on the tube voltage instead of the single value of 100 kV specified in the SanPiN 2. 6. 1. 1192 - 03, then the required thickness of the shielding construction in the <b>X-ray</b> <b>rooms</b> can be reduced with a factor of two. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{generosity}} of Dr. Samuel Houston of Polo and the perseverance {{of the board}} members, under the able leadership of Mrs. W. H.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the range of}} collimation errors in <b>x-ray</b> <b>rooms</b> and to calculate their possible effects on the radiation dose for anteroposterior pelvic examinations. Methods: A collimator test tool was suspended at 3 heights (14, 21, and 28 cm) above the table Bucky in 9 <b>x-ray</b> <b>rooms.</b> Heights corresponded to the typical patient thickness (mean, ± 2 SD) of 67 patients undergoing anteroposterior pelvic radiography. The x-ray beam was visually collimated to the inner boundary of the test tool and exposed to radiation. Differences between the visualized field size and the resultant x-ray field size (corrected for magnification) indicated a collimation error. Next, using a pelvic phantom, minimum textbook collimation was set and then changed and verified to simulate a range of possible collimation errors. Phantom examinations used a standard anteroposterior technique with exposure termination using outer automatic exposure control chambers. Dose area product (DAP) was recorded. Results: All but 1 of the 9 x-ray machines had a smaller irradiated area than was visually set. Errors ranged from a 16...|$|R
30|$|Our {{university}} hospital {{is a large}} six-storey concrete building {{with the department of}} radiology centrally located on the fourth floor. Floors consist of 30 -cm-thick concrete, with inner walls of gypsum board. Walls of <b>x-ray</b> <b>rooms</b> and barriers in front of operator desks in the department are shielded with 2  mm of lead or lead-equivalent glass. As a consequence, unless in the direct neighbourhood of an exposed patient, the level of scattered radiation is generally negligible.|$|R

5|$|Lead's high density, atomic number, and {{formability}} {{form the}} basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation. Lead has no natural resonance frequencies; as a result, sheet-lead is used as a sound deadening layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios. Organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy, mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe. Lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in <b>X-ray</b> <b>rooms</b> due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient.
