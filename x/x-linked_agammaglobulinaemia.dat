40|$|The {{presence}} of human thymus lymphoid tissue (HTL) antigen, {{which we have}} proposed as a marker of thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) in human beings, complement receptor and rosette formation with sheep erythrocytes were tested on the lymphocytes from various immunodeficiency diseases. It is postulated that both T and B cells are reduced in severe combined immunodeficiency, B but not T cells are defective in infantile <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinaemia,</b> and both T and part of B cell populations (IgA producers) are impaired in ataxia telangiectasia. The HTL antigen-positive cells (HTLC) were reduced in two cases of ataxia telangiectasia and a case of severe combined immunodeficiency. HTLC were present in numbers comparable to normal controls in two cases of <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinaemia</b> and two cases of isolated IgA deficiency. The number of rosette-forming cells with sheep erythrocytes (RFC) in ataxia telangiectasia were rather higher than controls, which means that rosette formation is not specific to T cells, {{at least in some}} situations, although there is some evidence suggesting that it is a property of T cells in normal conditions. The complement receptor lymphocytes (CRL) have been suggested to be B cells in the mouse. However, CRL were present in normal numbers in the cases of <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinaemia.</b> This indicates that CRL are not necessarily antibody-forming cells in man...|$|E
40|$|Sera from hypogammaglobulinaemic chickens, aged 22 – 44 days, and age-matched {{controls}} were assayed for C 1 haemolytic activity by three methods, two involving cell intermediates (EAIgMC 4 and EAckC 4) {{and the third}} an EAck and a guinea-pig R 1. Total haemolytic complement (C) was also titrated using rabbit erythrocytes bearing chicken antibody. Immunoglobulin status was monitored by immunoelectrophoresis. C 1 activity was reduced in the hypogammaglobulinaemic chickens by all three assay methods, and the differences were highly significant statistically. Total C also tended to be lowered in the hypogammaglobulinaemic group, but the depression was of borderline significance. Thus, hypogammaglobulinaemic chickens have a functional deficiency of C 1 at least as pronounced as that of patients with <b>X-linked</b> recessive <b>agammaglobulinaemia...</b>|$|R
40|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} are reportedly more frequent than expected in immunodeficient patients {{and in their}} relatives. The hypothesis that genetic factors related to immunodeficiency may predispose {{to the development of}} autoimmunity was studied in relatives of patients with variable immunodeficiency (VID), ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), or <b>X-linked</b> infantile <b>agammaglobulinaemia</b> (X-LA). Close relatives of patients with VID or A-T had thyroid and gastric autoantibodies significantly more frequently than did control subjects. No abnormalities were detected in unaffected relatives of X-LA patients. The increased incidence of organ-specific autoantibodies in close relatives of VID patients was confined to those families with more than one member with immunodeficiency. These data suggest that {{there are at least two}} forms of VID, one of which is associated with familial autoimmunity.

The possibility that the C 1 INH deficiency and in this patient, whether genetic or acquired, fostered the susceptibility to the production of anaphylactoid reactions after gammaglobulin injections urges further studies of the association of C 1 INH deficiency and anaphylactoid reactions to gammaglobulin injections.

Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection acquired through contaminated blood products is widely described in this patient cohort. The natural history of HCV infection in patients with XLA tends to follow a more rapid and aggressive course compared to immunocompetent individuals. Furthermore, standard anti-viral therapy appears to be less efficacious in this patient cohort.

This confirms and extends a previous linkage study (Kwan et al. 1986) which demonstrated linkage with S 21 and 19. 2. Of the families 14 were informative for either pXG 12 or S 21 and these probes should thus be of great diagnostic value.

Further experiments using flow cytometry revealed a striking predominance of CCR 7 – T cells in a subgroup of CVID patients, and an association with impaired T cell proliferation.

In addition, IVIG is used extensively in the treatment of a wide variety of autoimmune disorders. IVIG is administered at distinct doses in the two clinical settings: whereas immunodeficient patients are treated with replacement levels of IVIG, patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are administered with very high doses of IVIG.

Although immunoglobulin substitution largely abolished life-threatening respiratory tract infections, considerable infectious and non-infectious morbidity was still encountered in these patients. Almost all patients suffered from chronic or recurrent {{upper and lower}} airway infections, mainly caused by Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococci. The lower respiratory tract infections led to cumulative damage to the respiratory tract, especially in XLA patients. Also the incidence of infections outside the respiratory tract (giardiasis, Campylobacter jejuni infections) was more common in XLA patients than in CVID patients. Nodular lymphoid hyperplasia was only found in CVID. A variety of other non-infectious complications were seen especially in CVID. Neoplastic complications occurred in nine patients (two cases of thymoma, two colorectal cancer, one gastric carcinoma, two haematological malignancies, two cases of skin cancer).

To examine the possibility that sporadic male cases with <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinaemia</b> (XLA), which is caused by mutations in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene, might be misregistered as having CVID, we employed a flow cytometric test to identify XLA in hypogammaglobulinaemic males registered as CVID in the Japanese Immunodeficiency Registry. From 30 male cases registered as having CVID between 1992 and 1998, we selected 21 males with low or unreported peripheral B cell counts. Blood samples could be obtained from 11 patients and their mothers. Using flow cytometric analysis, the Btk-deficient status in monocytes was demonstrated in seven out of nine cases with decreased numbers of peripheral B cells.

The patient manifested a mild phenotype with a delayed onset of the disease. Another mutation, in which the intron 3 donor splice site is lost, was also associated with very low mRNA levels and an absence of detectable Btk protein. Patients with this mutation showed extensive heterogeneity of the immunological phenotype. In the BLCL of a third patient, with an Arg 288 substitution in the SH 2 domain, the mutation {{did not appear to}} affect the expression level, nor to abrogate in vitro phosphorylation activity.

40|$|<b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinaemia</b> (XLA) is an {{inherited}} disorder characterised {{by a lack}} of circulating B-cells and antibodies. While the gene involved in XLA has not yet been identified, the locus for the disorder is tightly linked to the polymorphic marker DXS 178, which maps to Xq 22. Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A. The gene encoding this enzyme has been characterized and also maps to Xq 22. Using pulsed field gel electrophoresis we have constructed a long-range restriction map that shows that the α-galactosidase A gene (GLA) and DXS 178 lie no more than 140 kb apart on a stretch of DNA containing a number of putative CpG islands. We have also isolated yeast artifical chromosome (YAC) clones that confirm this physical linkage. The localisation of DXS 178 near the α-galactosidase A gene will facilitate carrier detection in Fabry families using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The identification of a number of CpG islands near DXS 178 also provides candidate locations for the gene responsible for XLA...|$|E
40|$|Bruton's {{tyrosine}} kinase (Btk) is a cytoplasmic protein kinase that is defective in <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinaemia</b> in man and in X-linked immunodeficiency in the mouse. There is controversy regarding {{the stages of}} B cell development that are dependent on Btk function. To determine the point in B cell differentiation at which defects in Btk become apparent, we generated a mouse model by inactivating the Btk gene through an in-frame insertion of a lacZ reporter by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. The phenomenon of X-chromosome inactivation in Btk+/- heterozygous female mice enabled us to evaluate the competition between B cell progenitors expressing wild-type Btk and those expressing the Btk-/lacZ allele in each successive step of development. Although Btk was already expressed in pro-B cells, the first selective disadvantage only became apparent at the transition from small pre-B cells to immature B cells in the bone marrow. A second differentiation arrest was found during the maturation from IgD(low) IgM(high) to IgD(high) IgM(low) stages in the periphery. Our results show that Btk expression is essential at two distinct differentiation steps, both past the pre-B cell stage...|$|E

While {{the assessment of}} serum specific HCV antibodies {{in some of these}} patients was not informative because of the impairment in specific antibody production, the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay used to detect serum HCV RNA was a useful method for diagnosing infection. We found that 38 % of late onset hypogammaglobulinaemic patients (CVI, HIM or IgG subclass deficiency) had evidence of HCV infection. HCV infection was not detectable in patients with XLA or AT. The majority of our patients had persistent viraemia, and those who underwent liver biopsy showed histological findings of chronic hepatitis. Moreover, we could demonstrate in vitro that eight of 18 HCV-infected patients were actively producing anti-HCV antibodies, despite their impaired antibody production. The high rate of HCV infection in hypogammaglobulinaemic patients could be related to several nosocomial routes of transmission, including intravenous immune globulin administration.

40|$|<b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinaemia</b> (XLA) is an {{inherited}} immunodeficiency that {{is caused by}} a block in early B-cell differentiation. Whereas early B precursors in the bone marrow are present in substantial numbers, XLA-affected individuals have dramatically reduced numbers of circulating mature B cells, plasma cells and immunoglobulins of all isotypes. We report on a Japanese family with 3 XLA patients, in whom the serum immunoglobulin levels and number of B cells showed a significant difference among them in spite of harbouring the same splice donor site mutation in the BTK gene. We developed concise method for detection of this mutation, which is helpful for discovering the carrier. Patient 2 showed a significant serum immunoglobulin levels of all isotypes, including allergen-specific IgE. Expression of a normal and truncated size BTK gene was detected in patient 2 ′s peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Expression of BTK protein was also detected in some B cells. These results suggest that the leaky phenotype in patient 2 was caused in part by the expression of a normal BTK gene transcript.

Two overlapping yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), which cover a region of approximately 1000 kb around DXS 178 and form {{part of a larger}} YAC contig, were hybridised to an ordered cosmid library constructed from a human fibroblast cell line with karyotype 49,XXXXX. Positive cosmids were gridded in high density arrays onto nylon filters and rescreened with a series of YACs, YAC end probes and additional markers from the region to assign cosmids into intervals. A 640 kb-YAC hybridising to p 212 (DXS 178) was used for direct selection of PCR-amplified cDNA from two cDNA libraries. To identify the cosmids containing transcribed sequences the enriched cDNA from each library was radiolabelled and hybridised back to positive clones which mapped to the region of interest.

40|$|Pleckstrin {{homology}} (PH) domains may act as membrane localization modules through specific {{interactions with}} phosphoinositide phospholipids. These interactions could represent responses to second messengers, with scope for regulation by soluble inositol polyphosphates. A biosensor-based assay was used here to probe interactions between PH domains and unilamellar liposomes containing different phospholipids and to demonstrate specificity for distinct phosphoinositides. The dynamin PH domain specifically interacted with liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate [PI(4, 5) P 2] and, more weakly, with liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol- 4 -phosphate [PI(4) P]. This correlates with phosphoinositide {{activation of the}} dynamin GTPase. The functional GTPase of a dynamin mutant lacking the PH domain, however, cannot be activated by PI(4, 5) P 2. The phosphoinositide-PH domain interaction can be abolished selectively by point mutations in the putative binding pocket predicted by molecular modelling and NMR spectroscopy. In contrast, the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) PH domain specifically bound liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol- 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate [PI(3, 4, 5) P 3]: an interaction requiring Arg 28, a residue found to be mutated in some <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinaemia</b> patients.

The intracellular cytokine content of CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes, and their CD 28 +/− subsets, were measured following in vitro activation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. The cytokines IL- 2, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and the early activation marker CD 69, were assessed by four-colour flow cytometry of whole blood cultures taken before and after IVIG infusion. There was a significant increase in IL- 2 expression in CD 4 + (and CD 4 + 28 −) cells and an increase in TNF-α expression in CD 8 + 28 − cells following IVIG in CVID, but not in XLA patients. IFN-γ and CD 69 expression were not affected by IVIG infusion. This increase in TNF-α and IL- 2, combined with unchanged IFN-γ expression, is evidence against the putative ‘anti-inflammatory’ role of IVIG, and may explain the failure of resolution of granulomata in CVID patients treated with IVIG alone...|$|E

Btk-deficient early B cell precursors experience a block in their differentiation potentially reversible {{by the addition of}} an intact Btk gene. Btk expression was measured in 69 XLA patients with 47 different mutations and normal expression was detected in seven. We characterized these Btk mutant forms functionally by transfection into a lymphoma cell line that lacks endogenous Btk expression (Btk−/− DT 40 cells) and analysed the calcium flux in response to B cell receptor stimulation. To test whether co-expression of a mutated form could compromise the function of the intact Btk transfection, studies in wild-type (WT) DT 40 cells were also performed. Study reveals that none of the seven Btk mutants analysed was able to revert the absence of calcium mobilization upon IgM engagement in Btk−/− DT 40 cells, as does intact Btk. In addition, calcium mobilization by anti-IgM stimulation in DT 40 Btk+/+ cells was unaffected by co-expression with Btk mutants. These results suggest that gene addition would be feasible not only for patients with XLA and mutations that prevent Btk expression, but for those with expression of a mutant Btk...|$|E
40|$|Bruton's {{tyrosine}} kinase (Btk) is a non-receptor protein {{tyrosine kinase}} (PTK) that {{is expressed in}} all haemopoietic lineages except mature T cells and plasma cells. Despite {{the broad range of}} expression. mutations that inactivate this molecule affect primarily the development of the B-cell lineage. As a PTK, Btk could potentially be involved directly or indirectly in the processes that relate to the malignant transformation of all the cell lineages where this molecule is expressed. Previous studies have failed to demonstrate mutations in patients with B-cell origin acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We have utilized a recently developed method that enables the rapid and convenient detection of mutations at the cDNA level, namely, the non-isotopic RNase cleavage assay (NIRCA) to analyse Btk sequences from 27 patients with different types of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The only alteration that we observed was a polymorphism at position 2031. This polymorphism has already been seen in previous studies. Furthermore, using the same methodology, we identified the Btk mutations in six XLA (<b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinaemia)</b> patients. Our results, although they do not exclude the involvement of Btk mutations in the development or progression of some type of AML, nevertheless suggest that such mutations do not constitute a major co-factor in the development of myeloid malignancies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBruton's {{tyrosine}} kinase (Btk) {{is essential for}} normal B-cell receptor signalling. The lack of expression of functional Btk in humans leads to the B-cell deficiency <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinaemia</b> (XLA). We report here that Btk is also important for signalling via the collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) in platelets. GPVI is coupled to the Fc receptor γ chain (FcRγ). The FcRγ-chain contains a consensus sequence known as the immune-receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM upon GPVI stimulation is the initial step in the regulation of phospholipase C γ 2 (PLCγ 2) isoforms via the {{tyrosine kinase}} p 72 Syk (Syk) in platelets. Here we show that collagen and a collagen-related peptide (CRP), which binds to GPVI but does not bind to the integrin α 2 β 1, induced Btk tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets. Aggregation, dense granule secretion and calcium mobilisation were significantly diminished but not completely abolished in platelets from XLA patients in response to collagen and CRP. These effects were associated with a reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ 2. In contrast, aggregation and secretion stimulated by thrombin in Btk-deficient platelets were not significantly altered. Our results demonstrate that Btk is important for collagen signalling via GPVI, but is not essential for thrombin-mediated platelet activation...|$|E
