40|$|Abstract Introduction Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) {{have been}} {{intensely}} studied {{for the purpose}} of developing solutions for clinical tissue engineering. Autologous MSCs can potentially be used to replace tissue defects, but the procedure also carries risks such as immunization and <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>infection.</b> Replacement of the commonly used fetal calf serum (FCS) with human platelet lysate and plasma (PLP) to support cell growth may reduce some of these risks. Altered media could, however, influence stem cell differentiation and we address this experimentally. Methods We examined human MSC differentiation into the osteoblast lineage using in vitro two- and three-dimensional cultures with PLP or FCS as cell culture medium supplements. Differentiation was followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and alkaline phosphatase activity, matrix formation and matrix calcium content were quantified. Results Three-dimensional culture, where human MSCs were grown on collagen sponges, markedly stimulated osteoblast differentiation; a fourfold increase in calcium deposition could be observed in both PLP and FCS groups. PLP-grown cells showed robust osteogenic differentiation both in two- and three-dimensional MSC cultures. The calcium content of the matrix in the two-dimensional PLP group at day 14 was 2. 2 -fold higher in comparison to the FCS group (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), and at day 21 it was still 1. 3 -fold higher (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), suggesting earlier calcium accumulation to the matrix in the PLP group. This was supported by stronger Alizarin Red staining in the PLP group at day 14. In two-dimesional PLP cultures, cellular proliferation appeared to decrease during later stages of differentiation, while in the FCS group the number of cells increased throughout the experiment. In three-dimensional experiments, the PLP and FCS groups behaved more congruently, except for the alkaline phosphatase activity and mRNA levels which were markedly increased by PLP. Conclusions Human PLP was at least equal to FCS in supporting osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs in two- and three-dimensional conditions; however, proliferation was inferior. As PLP is free of animal components, and thus represents reduced risk for <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>infection,</b> its use for human MSC-induced bone repair in the clinic by the three-dimensional live implants presented here appears a promising therapy option...|$|E
40|$|Xeno{{transplantation}}, the transplantation {{of living}} organs, tissues, or cells from one species to another, {{is viewed as}} a potential solution to the existing shortage of human organs for transplantation. While whole-organ xenotransplantation is still in the preclinical stage, cellular xenotransplantation and extracorporeal perfusion applications are showing promise in early clinical trials. Advances in immunosuppressive therapy, gene engineering, and cloning of animals bring a broader array of xenotransplantation protocols closer to clinical trials. Despite several potential advantages over allotransplantation, xenotransplantation encompasses a number of problems. Immunologic rejection remains the primary hindrance. The potential to introduce infections across species barriers, another major concern, is the main focus of this review. Nonhuman primates are unlikely to be a main source for xenotransplantation products despite their phylogenetic proximity to humans. Genetically engineered pigs, bred under special conditions, are currently envisaged as the major source. Thus far, there has been no evidence for human infections caused by pig xenotransplantation products. However, the existence of xenotropic endogenous retroviruses and the clinical evidence of long-lasting porcine cell microchimerism indicate the potential for <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>infections.</b> Thus, further trials should continue under regulatory oversight, with close clinical and laboratory monitoring for potential <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R
40|$|Xeno{{transplant}}ation (XT), {{the transplant}} of tissues or organs from animals to humans, {{has been seen}} as a promise {{to solve the problem of}} shortage of human organs. However, XT has the potential to introduce new infections (so-called xenozoonosis or <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>infections)</b> into humans. The tension between the potential benefits to individuals and the potential risks to the population through the transmission of infectious agents from patients to the general public remains problematic. In this challenging context, moving from preclinical to clinical trials, different regulatory frameworks have been established as an attempt to normalize XT, namely to create well-defined, secure normative environments to minimise the potential risks of infections while respecting fundamental rights in democratic societies. The analysis of these different legal approaches show how science and law are mixed in the production of different regulations. Scientific and legal statements are mutually adjusted to each other to support the legitimacy of XT. Specific scientific assumptions are adopted if and when they match desirable legal outcomes, while scientific needs are used to justify legal constraints. In the US system individual rights and individual autonomy represent the unsurpassable tenets of the liberal society. In the European context the existence of a political entity such as Europe and the sovereignty of Member States are the dialectic poles for the legal framework. In Canada and Australia the tensions between the exploration of new forms of democracy and a more traditional vision of expertise and decision-making are at stake...|$|R
