40|$|Weighting or {{assessment}} {{factors of}} near-infrared photocathodes and Kodak 5424 film are determined for <b>xenon-lamp</b> illumination. These values {{are important for}} selecting detectors and determining the basic sensitivity for a given situation and instrumentation; for example, in medicine, when obtaining retinal pictures. Some other typical applications are also discussed. Charts showing the radiation from a xenon-arc lamp, with a 0. 5 mm arc length and 800 watt input, and the typical efficiency values of photocathodes and film to <b>xenon-lamp</b> radiation are presented at spectral intervals of 20 nm for the range of 400 to 1100 nm, with and without Kodak Wratten filter 89 b...|$|E
30|$|All paint {{cross-sections}} {{were examined}} under a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope, with both incident polarized light and incident UV light (from a <b>xenon-lamp</b> and a mercury short arc photo optic lamp HBO, respectively). The UV H 365 filter set used for examination in UV light {{consists of the}} following filters: excitation BP 365 / 12, beam splitter FT 395 and emission LP 397.|$|E
30|$|Previous {{laboratory}} test showed positive self-cleaning results for polysiloxane and functionalized SiO 2 nanocomposites applied on stone specimens. By monitoring rhodamine B discolouration after <b>Xenon-lamp</b> irradiation a remarkable photocatalytic {{activity of the}} nano-TiO 2 -based treatments was found [29, 30]. In order to asses also on-site the actual self-cleaning properties of the nanocomposites a prolonged monitoring of the soiling rate on treated surfaces will be necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{separate}} {{digital data}} streams were output from the Eagle, also via RCA or XLR-type audio connectors. These telemetry streams, called [...] "PosiTrak", each controlled {{up to five}} external slide projector control devices also manufactured by AVL, known as [...] "Doves". The Dove units received biphase data from the Eagle via audio cables, and interpreted the Eagle's data streams to control {{as many as three}} Kodak Ektagraphic projectors (for large screens, compatible <b>Xenon-lamped</b> projectors) and two dry-closure contacts per Dove unit. AVL also made the Raven, a device similar to the Dove, for comprehensive control of a single 16 mm film projector, as well as numerous other external control devices for lighting, sound, video projectors and sources, etc.|$|R
40|$|Manufacturers of PV-modules usually give a {{warranty}} for {{at least}} 20 years. There is still only little knowledge about the lifetime of newly developed modules, however. How do they cope with snow, desert-climate or tropical humidity? In order {{to answer this question}} the Fraunhofer-Institute for Solar Energy Systems and TUV Rheinland have installed different outdoor exposure sites where modules have to stand extreme climates: high temperatures with high differences between day and night in the Negev desert at Israel, snow, wind and changing irradiation in the German Alps, and high humidity at warm temperatures at Indonesia. Commercial modules from industrial partners as well as innovative modules with different combinations of encapsulants and back-sheets were exposed. UV-irradiation, solar-irradiation, ambient- and module temperatures, ambient humidity and wind speed is measured and collected at a central server in Germany. These data are the basis for the calculation of integral loads for the comparison of different climatic regions and for an estimation of the service life, an exciting field of work since decades(1, 2, 3). Results from the evaluation of the monitoring during the fist 12 months of exposure are compared. Fluorescent lamps are chosen for accelerated UV-testing, since they simulate the UV-irradiation of the sun well while emitting less thermal radiation than <b>Xenon-lamps.</b> The UV-source is designed for use in climatic cabinets for damp-heat testing with UV...|$|R
40|$|Several Hughes gallium {{arsenide}} (GaAs) concentrator cells {{were exposed to}} 1 -MeV electrons at fluences up to 1 x 10 to the 15 th power electrons/sq cm. Performance data were taken after several fluences, at two temperatures, and at concentration levels from 1 to approx. 150 x AMO. Data at 1 sun and 25 deg C were taken with an X- 25 <b>xenon-lamp</b> solar simulator. Data at concentration were taken using a pulsed solar simulator with the assumption of a linear relationship between short-circuit current and irradiance. The cells are 5 by 5 mm with a 4 -mm diameter illuminated area...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} avoid the {{inherent}} photo-catalysis and aggregation of TiO 2 in PPS, TiO 2 nanoparticles were coated with SiO 2 layers, which were chosen as the UV absorbent to improve the UV stability of polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) fiber. The PPSâ€“TiO 2 @SiO 2 nanocomposites fibers were prepared via melt spinning, and the nanocomposites fibers displayed different crystallization behaviors on variation of the diameters of TiO 2 @SiO 2 nanoparticles, as confirmed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The spinnability, breaking strength and UV-resistance properties of PPS nanocomposites fibers, as measured by homemade melt spinning machine, <b>Xenon-lamp</b> Weather Resistance Test Chamber and Yarn Tensile Tester, manifested the dependence on the diameters. The addition of nanoparticles with the diameter of 25 nm improved the spinnability and the mechanical performance of PPS most, which is attributed to the heterogeneous nucleation effect of nanoparticles. The UV-resistance properties of the PPS nanocomposites were improved by the addition of TiO 2 @SiO 2 nanoparticles. After aging for 180 h, PPS nanocomposites fiber still maintained a high strength...|$|E
