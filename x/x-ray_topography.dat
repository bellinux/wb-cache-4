40|$|Phase-sensitive {{synchrotron}} radiation (SR) radiography was combined with <b>x-ray</b> diffraction <b>topography</b> to study structural defects of SiC crystals.

50|$|The {{advent of}} {{synchrotron}} X-ray sources has been beneficial to <b>X-ray</b> <b>topography</b> techniques. Several {{of the properties}} of synchrtron radiation are advantageous also for topography applications: The high collimation (more precisely the small angular source size) allows to reach higher geometrical resolution in topographs, even at larger sample-to-detector distances. The continuous wavelength spectrum facilitates white-beam topography. The high beam intensities available at synchrotrons {{make it possible to}} investigate small sample volumes, to work at weaker reflections or further off Bragg-conditions (weak beam conditions), and to achieve shorter exposure times. Finally, the discrete time structure of synchrotron radiation permits topographists to use stroboscopic methods to efficiently visualize time-dependent, periodically recurrent structures (such as acoustic waves on crystal surfaces).|$|E
5000|$|He {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1975. His {{candidature}} read [...] "Dr. A. R. Lang has made valuable contributions to X-ray crystallography in general, especially in original developments of instrumental method which combine economy with precision; and {{most notably in}} developing the technique of <b>X-ray</b> <b>topography</b> which is the method of choice for observing the internal imperfections of highly perfect crystals. Being applicable to specimens of a convenient size for investigation {{by a variety of}} other means, this method is a powerful adjunct to experimental techniques in the physics and chemistry of the solid state. The same work furnishes experimental material from which Lang and his collaborators have been able to verify, extend, and place on a more directly observational basis the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction. Important innovations in this earlier work were the adaptation and development of the X-ray proportional counter with pulse-height discrimination for use with X-ray diffraction. And his methods of X-ray diffracted beam monochromatization. Among his recent achievements are the observation by X-ray diffraction of internal magnetic domains, the determination of the relative phases of distinct X-ray reflexions from one crystal, and the production of X-ray Moire fringes between separate crystal slices." ...|$|E

40|$|While quartz {{resonators}} {{have been}} the mainstay of the ultrasonics industry for some time, intricacies exist {{in the production of}} quality resonators and therefore fabrication remains somewhat of an art form. Recently the Johns Hopkins University Center for Nondestructive Evaluation has initiated a research program to investigate methods to analyze quartz single crystals for the purpose of assessing the relative crystal quality of the raw material as well as material which has been manufactured into resonators. One technique which has proven to be useful in a variety of single crystal inspection applications is <b>x-ray</b> diffraction <b>topography.</b> <b>X-ray</b> diffraction <b>topography</b> is the name given to several x-ray diffraction techniques which permit the imaging of strains and lattice misorientations associated with surface and internal defects as small as dislocations to be examined. Because the topographic techniques are based on Bragg diffraction from a periodic crystal, the images are extremely sensitive to crystal imperfections, strains, and rotations since any alteration to the interplanar position and spacing of the crystal will effect a corresponding change in the Bragg condition. The dynamical theory of interactionbetween transmitted and reflected wave fields at, or near to, the Bragg condition is intimately connected with spatial contrast in the topographic images. This paper describes experimental details of the x-ray diffraction topographic system used and shows topographic images illustrating the utility of the system as applied to quartz crystals in raw material and resonator form...|$|R

To confirm aspects of the proposed model, the behaviour of 001 slices of initially single-domain RTA, patterned with periodic Ag electrodes of spacing 38 mm, as for periodic poling in non-linear optics, were investigated using synchrotron <b>X-ray</b> section <b>topography</b> with the electric field applied in situ while under X-ray illumination at the ID 19 topography beamline of the ESRF, Grenoble. The results of white-beam section topography as both a function of crystal to film distance, and under DC voltage are reported, confirming that there is a bending of the planes in the near-surface region. The strain in the near-surface region was examined directly using high-resolution monochromatic <b>X-ray</b> section <b>topography.</b> This revealed an extensive strain of 3 (+/- 1) x 10 (- 4) at 1 kV, indicating that the electrostrictive coefficient, gamma(3333), in RTA is positive in sign. ...|$|R
