25|$|A 2007 study {{investigated}} the interaction between bisphenolA's and estrogen-related receptor γ (ERR-γ). This orphan receptor (endogenous ligand unknown) behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription. BPA seems to bind strongly to ERR-γ (dissociation constant = 5.5 nM), but only weakly to the ER. BPA binding to ERR-γ preserves its basal constitutive activity. It can also protect it from deactivation from the SERM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (afimoxifene). This may be the mechanism by which BPA acts as a <b>xenoestrogen.</b> Different expression of ERR-γ {{in different parts of}} the body may account for variations in bisphenolA effects. For instance, ERR-γ has been found in high concentration in the placenta, explaining reports of high bisphenol accumulation in this tissue. BPA has also been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30).|$|E
25|$|Toxicants {{may also}} cause {{endocrine}} disruption through {{interacting with the}} estrogen receptor. This mechanism has been well-studied with PCBs. These chemicals {{have been used as}} coolants and lubricants in transformers and other electrical equipment due to their insulating properties. A purely anthropogenic substance, PCBs are no longer in production in the United States due to the adverse health effects associated with exposure, but they are highly persistent and are still widespread in the environment. PCBs are a <b>xenoestrogen,</b> which elicit an enhancing (rather than inhibiting) response, and are mediated by the estrogen receptor. These are often referred to as estrogen mimics because they mimic the effects of estrogen. PCBs often build up in sediments and bioaccumulate in organisms. These chemicals diffuse into the nucleus and bind to the estrogen receptor. The estrogen receptor is kept in an inactive conformation through interactions with proteins such as heat shock proteins 59, 70, and 90. After the toxicant binding occurs, the estrogen receptor is activated and forms a homodimer complex which seeks out estrogen response elements in the DNA. The binding of the complex to these elements causes a rearrangement of the chromatin and transcription of the gene, resulting in production of a specific protein. In doing this, PCBs elicit an estrogenic response which can affect numerous functions within the organism. These effects are observed in various aquatic species. The levels of PCBs in marine mammals are often very high as a result of bioaccumulation. Studies have demonstrated that PCBs are responsible for reproductive impairment in the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Similar effects have been found in the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), the ringed seal (Pusa hispida) and the California sea lion (Zalophys californinus). In the grey seals and ringed seals, uterine occlusions and stenosis were found which led to sterility. If exposed to a <b>xenoestrogen</b> such as PCBs, male fish have also been seen to produce vitellogenin. Vitellogenin is an egg protein female fish normally produce but is not usually present in males except at very low concentrations. This is often used as a biomarker for EDCs.|$|E

40|$|<b>Xenoestrogens,</b> such as o,p'-DDT and octyl phenol (OP), {{have been}} {{associated}} with reproductive abnormalities in various wildlife species. <b>Xenoestrogens</b> mimic the natural estrogen 17 beta-estradiol and compete for binding to the estrogen receptor.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Xenoestrogens</b> such as alkylphenols and the {{structurally}} related plastic byproduct bisphenol A {{have recently}} been shown to act potently via nongenomic signaling pathways and the membrane version of estrogen receptor-α. Though the responses to these compounds are typically measured individually, they usually contaminate organisms that already have endogenous estrogens present. Therefore, we used quantitative medium-throughput screening assays to measure the effects of physiologic estrogens in combination with these <b>xenoestrogens.</b> Methods We studied the effects of low concentrations of endogenous estrogens (estradiol, estriol, and estrone) at 10 pM (representing pre-development levels), and 1 nM (representing higher cycle-dependent and pregnancy levels) in combinations with the same levels of <b>xenoestrogens</b> in GH 3 /B 6 /F 10 pituitary cells. These levels of <b>xenoestrogens</b> represent extremely low contamination levels. We monitored calcium entry into cells using Fura- 2 fluorescence imaging of single cells. Prolactin release was measured by radio-immunoassay. Extracellular-regulated kinase (1 and 2) phospho-activations and the levels of three estrogen receptors in the cell membrane (ERα, ERβ, and GPER) were measured using a quantitative plate immunoassay of fixed cells either permeabilized or nonpermeabilized (respectively). Results All <b>xenoestrogens</b> caused responses at these concentrations, and had disruptive effects on the actions of physiologic estrogens. <b>Xenoestrogens</b> reduced the % of cells that responded to estradiol via calcium channel opening. They also inhibited the activation (phosphorylation) of extracellular-regulated kinases at some concentrations. They either inhibited or enhanced rapid prolactin release, depending upon concentration. These latter two dose-responses were nonmonotonic, a characteristic of nongenomic estrogenic responses. Conclusions Responses mediated by endogenous estrogens representing different life stages are vulnerable to very low concentrations of these structurally related <b>xenoestrogens.</b> Because of their non-classical dose-responses, they must be studied in detail to pinpoint effective concentrations and the directions of response changes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The role {{of steroids}} in {{carcinogenesis}} {{has become a}} major concern in environmental protection, biomonitoring, and clinical research. Although historically oestrogen has been related to development of reproductive system, research over the last decade has confirmed its crucial role in the development and homeostasis of other organ systems. As a number of anthropogenic agents are <b>xenoestrogens,</b> environmental health research has focused on oestrogen receptor level disturbances and of aromatase polymorphisms. Oestrogen and <b>xenoestrogens</b> mediate critical points in carcinogenesis by binding to oestrogen receptors, whose distribution is age-, gender-, and tissue-specific. This review brings data about cancer types whose eatiology may be found in environmental exposure to <b>xenoestrogens.</b> Cancer types that have been well documented in literature to be related with environmental exposure include the reproductive system, breast, lung, kidney, pancreas, and brain. The results of our data mining show (a) a significant correlation between exposure to <b>xenoestrogens</b> and increased, gender-related, cancer risk and (b) a need to re-evaluate agents so far defined as endocrine disruptors, as they are also key molecules in carcinogenesis.

Nonylphenol has attracted attention due to its prevalence in the environment and its potential role as an endocrine disruptor and <b>xenoestrogen,</b> due to its ability to act with estrogen-like activity.

The presence of estrogen-like compounds in many plants used in traditional medicine or ingested as food ingredients, phytoestrogens, as well as the estrogenic activities of many industrial pollutants and pesticides, <b>xenoestrogens,</b> have prompted investigations into their role in human health. Phyto- and <b>xenoestrogens</b> bind to the estrogen receptors with a lower affinity than the endogenous estrogens and can compete or substitute the hormone. <b>Xenoestrogens,</b> which accumulate in the body throughout life, are believed to increase breast cancer risk, especially in cases of prenatal and prepuberal exposure whereas the role of phytoestrogens is still a matter of debate. At present, the application of phytoestrogens appears to be limited to the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms in women where the production of endogenous estrogens has ceased.
