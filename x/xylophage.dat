40|$|Fragmentation of {{habitats}} {{is a great}} {{threat to}} biodiversity. An especially vulnerable species group is saproxylic beetles. Many of these are associated with hollow oaks, which provide a unique and stable habitat. The number of hollow oak trees in Norway has declined, resulting in hollow oaks being scattered in the landscape {{with varying degrees of}} isolation. How species associated with hollow oaks respond to fragmentation depends on their life history characteristics, two of which are a subject of this thesis, namely trophic level and specialization. I investigated what variables and scales had the greatest effect on four oak specialist beetles on different trophic levels. The same variables and scales were also used to understand why two pairs of closely related saproxylic beetles, one common and one rare had different occurrence frequencies on hollow oaks. Tree, site and landscape variables representing habitat size, isolation and climate were obtained though field registrations and from map sources. These variables were analyzed in GIS and used in stepwise multiple regression to create optimal models for each species. The results for the four oak specialists showed that the species dependent on wood (<b>xylophage)</b> and the species dependent on wood and fungi (xylomycetopage) responded to small-scale tree variables representing habitat size. The predator species and the species with mixed feeding preferences responded to large-scale landscape variables representing climate and isolation, respectively. The variables and scales did, to some degree contribute to the understanding of why two species within the same family occurred at different frequencies. For instance, both of the rare species responded to dead wood. Their dependence on this substrate could have made them vulnerable to habitat change and fragmentations, and in turn rare. M-N...|$|E
40|$|A first {{analysis}} of the stability of trophic structure following tropical forest fragmentation was performed in an experimentally fragmented tropical forest landscape in Central Amazonia. A taxonomically and trophically diverse assemblage of 993 species of beetles was sampled from 920 m 2 of leaf litter at 46 sites varying in distance from forest edge and fragment area. Beetle density increased significantly towards the forest edge and showed non-linear changes with fragment area, due to the influx of numerous disturbed-area species into 10 ha and 1 ha fragments. There was a marked change in species composition with both decreasing distance from forest edge and decreasing fragment area, but surprisingly this change in composition was not accompanied by a change in species richness. Rarefied species richness did not vary significantly across any of the sites, indicating that local extinctions of deep forest species were balanced by equivalent colonization rates of disturbed-area species. The change in species composition with fragmentation was non-random across trophic groups. Proportions of predator species and <b>xylophage</b> species changed significantly with distance from forest edge, but no area-dependent changes in proportions of species in trophic groups were observed. Trophic structure was also analysed with respect to proportions of abundance in six trophic groups. Proportions of abundance of all trophic groups except xylomycetophages changed markedly with respect to both distance from forest edge and fragment area. Local extinction probabilities calculated for individual beetle species supported theoretical predictions of the differential susceptibility of higher trophic levels to extinction, and of changes in trophic structure following forest fragmentation. To reduce random effects due to sampling error, only abundant species (n = 46) were analysed for extinction probabilities, as defined by absence from samples. Of these common species, 27 % had significantly higher probabilities of local extinction following fragmentation. The majority of these species were predators; 42 % of all abundant predator species {{were significantly more likely}} to be absent from samples in forest fragments than in undisturbed forest. These figures are regarded as minimum estimates for the entire beetle assemblage because rarer species will inevitably have higher extinction probabilities. Absolute loss of biodiversity will affect ecosystem process rates, but the differential loss of species from trophic groups will have an even greater destabilizing effect on food web structure and ecosystem function...|$|E

Foram utilizados dez palmeiras, cinco com espinhos e cinco sem espinhos, de plantios da Fazenda Experimental da Universidade Federal do Amazonas, localizada no km 40 da rodovia Manaus-Boa Vista (BR 174). De cada uma das palmeiras foram cortados três discos de aproximadamente 30 cm de espessura, retirados da base, do meio e do topo. No ambiente florestal, os discos foram distribuídos aleatoriamente, em área próxima ao plantio, no espaçamento de 0, 5 m, permanecendo durante 18 meses, período no qual foram efetuadas seis inspeções trimestrais para avaliar o grau de deterioração e coleta de insetos. Para o ensaio em condição urbana, os discos foram secionados axialmente para a retirada da medula e distribuídos aleatoriamente, nas posições côncava e convexa, sobre uma estrutura de madeira, localizada no Campus do INPA em Manaus, e inspecionados bimestralmente por um ano. Os resultados do ensaio no ambiente florestal indicaram que a maioria dos discos foi deteriorada por térmitas e a vida útil da base foi em torno de 18 meses, a do meio e do topo em torno de 15. As principais espécies de cupins foram: Heterotermes tenuis (Hagen) (Rhinotermitidae) responsável pela deterioração da parte basal, mediana e o topo; Nasutitermes similis Emerson (Termitidae) que infestou a região da base e do meio; Anoplotermes sp. (Termitidae) e Nasutitermes tatarandae (Holmgren) (Termitidae) responsáveis pela infestação da parte mediana do estipe. No ambiente urbano, o {{principal}} responsável pela deterioração das amostras foi o besouro Dinoderus bifoveolatus Wollston (Bostrichidae), e em seguida, o térmita N. similis. The {{durability of}} the stipe of Bactris gasipaes Kunth (Peach palm) when {{under attack by}} <b>xylophage</b> insects, is evaluated in the present paper, through forest and urban environment field tests. Five palms with spines and five without spines from the Tabatinga population (Putumayo landrace) {{were used in the}} experiment. Disks approximately 30 cm thick were taken from the butt, middle and top portions of each palm and distributed at random in a forest area near the INPA Peach Palm Germoplasm Bane (2 º 38 'S 60 º 03 'W). The time of permanence of the samples was 18 months, and in this period the disks were checked every three months to evaluate the degree of deterioration and collection of insects. In the urban condition, the same procedure was adopted, however each disk was halved to remove the centre and each half was distributed at random, one in a concave and the other in a convex position, on a wooden framework situated in the INPA's campus, Manaus, and checked bimonthly for one year. The results in the forest condition indicated that most of the disks were deteriorated by termites, and useful life of the butt portions varied around 18 months, the middle and the top around 15. The main species of termites were: Heterotermes tenuis (Hagen) (Rhinotermitidae) attacked the butt, middle and the top parts; Nasutitermes similis Emerson (Termitidae) that infested the area of the base and of the middle; Anoplotermes sp.

40|$|During {{the last}} century the forests of Central Europe changed from open {{woodlands}} to even-aged stands with closed-canopy. This change resulted in severe decline of forest biodiversity. This study examines how, and why such change affected xylophagous insects. I have studied microhabitat preferences, i. e. distribution of xylophagous insects in canopy and understorey of closed forests, forest edges and wooded meadows. I used method of rearing insect from timber baits exposed to ovipositing females of xylophagous insects in different situations in the forest at the beginning if vegetation season. After one season of exposition,the baits were collected enclosed in fly-wire cages, where emerging insects were collected for two seasons. This thesis consists of two parts: The first part is an unpublished manuscript dealing with effect of habitat insolation, vertical stratification, forest structure and amount of dead wood on community of long-horned beetles (Cerambycidae) and jewell beetles (Buprestidae) feeding on wood of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Baits were exposed in the canopy and the understorey of forest interior, the canopy and the understorey of forest edge and on solitary trees on wooded meadows. Most insect species do prefer insoled wood for their development, and were {{more common in the}} understorey than in the canopy. Insolation of bait was thus the prime factor affecting composition of reared insects. No relation was found between dead wood volume and species composition or abundance of reared insects This shows that insolation of the dead wood is crucial to conservation of most xylophagous insects. The second part of the thesis studies effect of vertical stratification and insolation on distribution of <b>xylophages</b> feeding reared from wood of 8 tree species (Alnus glutinosa, Populus alba, P. x canadensis, Salix alba, Carpinus betulus, Quercus robur, Tilia cordata, Ulmus laevis) and host specificity of <b>xylophages.</b> Results show that: (i) community composition of <b>xylophages</b> reflects evolutionary history of their host plants; (ii) communities reared from different trees exhibit different preferences for forest strata and insolation of the habitat, probably in connection to preferred growth conditions of the host plant, (iii) many xylophagous insect species exhibit strong preferences to insoled habitats, and are thus confined to forest edges in extensively managed forests as well as in unmanaged forest reserves...|$|R

There is an inverse relationship between the activity of <b>xylophages</b> and the abun-dance of epiphytes on Ipomoea murucoides. Xylophagy may modify the branch chemical constitution, which also affects the liberation of allelochemicals with defense and allelo-pathic properties. We evaluated the bark chemical content {{and the effect of}} extracts from branches subjected to treatments of exclusion, mechanical damage and the presence/ absence of epiphytes, on the seed germination of the epiphyte Tillandsia recurvata. Princi-pal component analysis showed that branches without any treatment separate from branches subjected to treatments; damaged and excluded branches had similar chemical content but we found no evidence to relate intentional damage with allelopathy; however 1 -hexadecanol, a defense volatile compound correlated positively with principal component (PC) 1. The chemical constitution of branches subject to exclusion plus damage or plus epi-phytes was similar among them. PC 2 indicated that palmitic acid (allelopathic compound) and squalene, a triterpene that attracts herbivore enemies, correlated positively with the inhibition of seed germination of T. recurvata. Inhibition of seed germination of T. recurvata was mainly correlated with the increment of palmitic acid and this compound reached higher concentrations in excluded branches treatments.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the termite fauna of the {{different}} vegetation physiognomies in the Cerrado biome. It is suggested that the species compositions in grassland and savanna areas are closely related to each other, and quite distinct from those of forests. This study compared the species composition from five different physiognomies of Cerrado, and tested the hypothesis that the termite faunas of savannas and grasslands form a distinct group from that of forests. The study was conducted in the Parque Estadual da Serra de Jaraguá, state of Goiás, Brazil. Termites were sampled from two physiognomies of savanna, one natural grassland, one pasture, and one gallery forest. A transect with 10 parcels of 5 x 2 m was established in each physiognomy. The relative abundance was inferred by the number of encounters, termites were classified in feeding guilds, and the dissimilarity in the species composition between the physiognomies was calculated. A total of 219 encounters, of 42 species of two families were recorded. The most abundant feeding guilds were the humivores (98) and <b>xylophages</b> (55). The physiognomies with the largest number of species were rupestrian cerrado (23 species) and cerrado sensu stricto (21). The physiognomies had a similar species composition (less than 55 % dissimilarity), mainly the natural open areas. The hypothesis of a distinct fauna of termites in forest vegetation was refuted. The termite fauna of gallery forest is very different from that of pasture, but most species also occur in natural open areas.

30|$|Both {{early and}} late season {{prescribed}} burns appear to have significantly altered the feeding guild structure of the arthropod community in this forest. The reduced abundance of detritivores was likely due to fire’s consumption of the organic components of the litter and duff layers (Debano et al. 1998, Neary et al. 1999). A decrease in {{quantity and quality of}} available organic material, and an increase in ground surface exposed to sunlight would be expected to lead to fewer decomposers on the forest floor (Collett et al. 1993). The greater abundance of dead wood utilizing <b>xylophages</b> (e.g. Buprestidae and Cerambycidae) noted in burn treatments in this study was likely due to the higher number of standing dead trees. Between 2001 (preburn) and 2004 (one year after the conclusion of the sampling for this study), 6 percent of the trees in the control had died, as compared to 35 percent and 48 percent in the early- and late season burn treatments, respectively (Ferrenberg, unpublished data, Schwilk et al. 2006). Greater abundance of arthropods (particularly beetles) that utilize dead and dying wood is a widely reported trend following fires (Ehnström et al. 1995, Ganz et al. 2003, McHugh et al. 2003, Sullivan et al. 2003).|$|R

They contrast with talitrids able to feed on either wrack or driftwood, as has been established experimentally in Platorchestia platensis (Krøyer, 1845). For the best known genus of specialized driftwood talitrids, Macarorchestia, there are two zoogeographic series: Northeast Atlantic: M. microphtalma – M. roffensis –M. martini and Mediterranean: M. remyi – M. pavesiae. Both geographic series are characterized by increasing dwarfism. Experimental studies suggest that dwarfism evolved to allow talitrids to occupy the small burrows made by gribbles (Isopoda, Limnoridae) in driftwood, and/or because driftwood was a poor quality food by comparison with wrack. The phylogenetic advantages of talitrids living in driftwood are that: they are protected from shorebird predation, they are provided with a long distance dispersal mechanism, and they have a relatively long term, albeit poorer quality, food source.

40|$|Background: The pre-Jurassic {{record of}} {{terrestrial}} wood borings is poorly resolved, despite body fossil evidence of insect diversification among xylophilic clades {{starting in the}} late Paleozoic. Detailed analysis of borings in petrified wood provides direct evidence of wood utilization by invertebrate animals, which typically comprises feeding behaviors. Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe a U-shaped boring in petrified wood from the Late Triassic Chinle Formation of southern Utah that demonstrates a strong linkage between insect ontogeny and conifer wood resources. Xylokrypta durossi new ichnogenus and ichnospecies is a large excavation in wood that is backfilled with partially digested xylem, creating a secluded chamber. The tracemaker exited the chamber {{by way of a}} small vertical shaft. This sequence of behaviors is most consistent with the entrance of a larva followed by pupal quiescence and adult emergence — hallmarks of holometabolous insect ontogeny. Among the known body fossil record of Triassic insects, cupedid beetles (Coleoptera: Archostemata) are deemed the most plausible tracemakers of Xylokrypta, based on their body size and modern xylobiotic lifestyle. Conclusions/Significance: This oldest record of pupation in fossil wood provides an alternative interpretation to borings once regarded as evidence for Triassic bees.

In this study, gut microbiomes of four termite species were studied for their capacity to degrade wheat straw and produce carboxylates in controlled bioreactors. All of the gut microbiomes successfully degraded lignocellulose and up to 45 % w/w of wheat straw degradation was observed, with the Nasutitermes ephratae gut-microbiome displaying the highest levels of wheat straw degradation, carboxylate production and enzymatic activity.

40|$|International audienceThe {{majority}} of terrestrial biomass is wood, but the elemental composition {{of its potential}} consumers, <b>xylophages,</b> differs hugely from that of wood. This causes a severe nutritional imbalance. We studied the stoichiometric relationships of 11 elements (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Na) in three species of pine-xylem-feeding insects, Stictoleptura rubra, Arhopalus rusticus (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae) and Chalcophora mariana (Coleoptera, Buprestidae), to elucidate their mechanisms of tissue growth and to match their life histories to their dietary constraints. These beetles do not differ from other Coleoptera in their absolute elemental compositions, which are approximately 1000 (N), 100 (P, Cu) and 50 (K, Na) times higher than in dead but undecayed pine wood. This discrepancy diminishes along the wood decay gradient, but the elemental concentrations remain higher by {{an order of magnitude}} in beetles than in highly decayed wood. Numerical simulation of the life history of S. rubra shows that feeding on nutrient-poor undecayed wood would extend its development time to implausible values, whereas feeding on highly decomposed wood (heavily infected with fungi) would barely balance its nutritional budget during the long development period of this species. The changes in stoichiometry indicate that the relative change in the nutrient levels in decaying wood cannot be attributed solely to carbon loss resulting from decomposer respiration: the action of fungi substantially enriches the decaying wood with nutritional elements imported from the outside of the system, making it a suitable food for wood-eating invertebrates...|$|R

The body lengths of species were measure and compared within feeding guilds and families. Herbivores was the dominant guild but was not the majority of all species or individuals. Most beetle species (69 %) were less than 5 mm in length and the mean size of canopy-caught species was greater than that for ground-caught species. This was probably due to slightly more species of plant feeders (herbivores and <b>xylophages)</b> present in the canopy, which were significantly larger than saprophages, fungivores and predators. Among feeding guilds, there were few overall canopy-ground differences. These results contrast with species composition results presented elsewhere where strong differences between the canopy and the ground were evident. We suggest that our guild groupings may have been too coarse to detect fine-scale differences and that resource partitioning may have also masked faunal stratification. We propose that fine-scale differences in resources between the canopy and the ground, together with strong microclimate gradients, are likely to be important in structuring the vertical stratification of insect assemblages at the level of species, but not with respect to functional groups.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of a study on the species composition of stem pests- insects and limitation of their number, carried out in the Ile-Alatau State National Park (Kazakhstan) in 2011 – 2015. The reason for this study was a windfall, which occurred in 2011 in the National Park and followed a few years later by forest fires. These emergencies created a favourable environment for the reproduction of stem pests. The management of the Ile-Alatau National Park, together with the Institute of Zoology of the MES, has taken the necessary measures to investigate the species composition of the pests, their natural regulators and to conduct protective measures in the hotbeds of <b>xylophages</b> mass production. At the same time consultations and joint research with scientists from Kazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and the Czech Republic were held. The monitoring of the state of forests started in 2011. The composition of species and number of xylophagous pests has been carried out. In the 2011 – 2015 -surveys 48 species of stem pests, belonging to three orders of the class of insects, were found: Hemiptera, or Bugs (1 species, 1 family), Coleoptera, or Beetles (42 species, 5 families), Hymenoptera (5 species, 1 family). During all the years of research the Hauzer bark beetle Ips hauseri and the longhorn beetle ribbed ragy Rhagium inquisitor dominated numerically. Slightly less Orthotomicus suturalis and the kyrgyzstan micrograph Pityophthorus kirgisicus were found. Besides, the study of diseases of stem pests and their entomophages (predators and parasites) was carried out, which is a prerequisite for carrying out forest-pathological examinations. In total 53 species, from five classes, eleven orders and 27 families of invertebrates have been revealed. Most of them belong to the class of insects, others to spiders and centipedes. On several species of bark beetles and longhorn beetles an entomopathogenic fungus – white muscardine Beauveria bassiana was found. As the result of long-term monitoring, it was found out that due to removal and disposal of contaminated windfall wood, its natural decomposition in the field, the increasing number of entomophages and the spread of fungal epizootic among the pests there was a natural reduction of some old reproductive hotbeds of stem-pests, revealed in 2011 – 2013. However, the risk of the continued operation of some old and the emergence of new hotbeds is actual; that is why it is necessary to continue the monitoring of forest pathology and to use a number of stem pest control measures in future...|$|R
40|$|Loss of {{dead wood}} habitat and {{biodiversity}} {{has led to}} numerous excellent conservation based ecological and management studies. However, {{the structure of the}} xylophagous food web remains unclear for saproxylic xylophagous beetles and their parasitoid wasps, but fungi are believed to play an important role, both in direct and indirect nutritional acquisition and production of volatile chemicals. In the first study of its kind this thesis explores the importance of volatiles in host-searching behaviour and role of fungi in oviposition choice and larval nutrition, using three endophytic fungi, Stereum hirsutum, Stereum gausapatum and Eutypa spinosa, and two tree species Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur, in early stage decay. Newly designed traps, excluding wood visual stimuli, provided the first evidence of wood-fungal volatile attraction by saproxylic wood-boring beetles, including primary and secondary <b>xylophages,</b> and their parasitoid wasps. Expanding on these results, the importance of fungi was further demonstrated through oviposition choice in field logs by two polyphagous cerambycid species. Ovipositing within or 20 mm from their preferred fungal species plug, females chose abiotic conditions suitable for sustaining fungal growth, suggesting a larval nutritional benefit. Further investigation, using one of the cerambycid species above, corroborated, via olfactometry, that volatiles from the preferred wood-fungal combination were attractants to gravid females, and induced ovipositor probing within the olfactometer. In addition, GC-EAG found six volatile compounds provoked an antennal response, including a monoterpene, two sesquiterpenes, an alkane and a ketone. Most importantly olfactometry and GC-EAG showed gravid females were unresponsive to wood or favored fungus presented singly. The result are discussed herein. In conjunction with the volatile only field trap experiment, a novel method to promote fungal only volatiles, by autoclaving the wood prior to sub-culturing, was trialed. GC-MS comparative analysis showed disparity between agar sub-cultured, autoclaved wood and natural wood with fungi, volatiles. This suggests that genes encoding cellulases and hemicellulases are regulated according to carbohydrate source, nutritional availability, oxygen and metal ions, supporting the variations observed. These results are discussed herein with regard to xylophagous beetles and their parasitoid wasps. The principal findings of this thesis are that wood-fungal interaction volatiles of the ephemeral early decay stage provide important olfactory host resource cues for saproxylic xylophagous beetles and their parasitoid wasps. Fungi, and particular, endophytic fungi, were shown to be a key component of the early stage xylophagous food web through volatile production, and as nutritional support evidenced by oviposition choice, olfactometry, GC-EAG and GC-MS analysis. This thesis has opened a new, exciting and important area of research with the potential to radically improve conservation management and employ a more holistic approach. These insights bring together the disparate research conducted individually on wood decay fungi, saproxylic xylophagous beetles and their parasitoid waspsImperial Users onl...|$|R
