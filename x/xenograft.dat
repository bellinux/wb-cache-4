In this study, we established 27 human cell lines derived from various human tumor <b>xenografts</b> in nude mice.

25|$|Variations on {{the nerve}} {{autograft}} include the allograft and the <b>xenograft.</b> In allografts, the tissue for the graft {{is taken from}} another person, the donor, and implanted in the recipient. Xenografts involve taking donor tissue from another species. Allografts and xenografts have the same disadvantages as autografts, but in addition, tissue rejection from immune responses {{must also be taken}} into account. Often immunosuppression is required with these grafts. Disease transmission also becomes a factor when introducing tissue from another person or animal. Overall, allografts and xenografts do not match the quality of outcomes seen with autografts, but they are necessary when {{there is a lack of}} autologous nerve tissue.|$|E

25|$|The boron atom in bortezomib binds the {{catalytic}} {{site of the}} 26S proteasome with high affinity and specificity. In normal cells, the proteasome regulates protein expression and function by degradation of ubiquitylated proteins, and also cleanses the cell of abnormal or misfolded proteins. Clinical and preclinical data support a role in maintaining the immortal phenotype of myeloma cells, and cell-culture and <b>xenograft</b> data support a similar function in solid tumor cancers. While multiple mechanisms {{are likely to be}} involved, proteasome inhibition may prevent degradation of pro-apoptotic factors, thereby triggering programmed cell death in neoplastic cells. Recently, it was found that bortezomib caused a rapid and dramatic change in the levels of intracellular peptides that are produced by the proteasome.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} Compound Zhebei Granule (CZBG), a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, combined with adriamycin (ADM) on mdr 1 gene expression in tumor <b>xenografts</b> in nude mice. Methods: A tumor <b>xenografts</b> model was established by subcutaneously injecting multidrug resistance cell line K 562 /A 02 into the axillary flank of BALB/c-nu mice. Sixty tumor-bearing nude mice were divided into untreated group, ADM group and high-, medium-, and low-dose CZBG plus ADM groups. The nude mice in the CZBG plus ADM groups were intragastrically administered with CZBG once per day and intraperitoneally injected with ADM once every other day. The nude mice in the untreated group and the ADM group were administered with normal saline or ADM respectively. The course of treatment was continuous for 14 days. The weight of tumor <b>xenografts</b> was measured after treatment and the inhibition rate of tumor <b>xenografts</b> was calculated. The mdr 1 gene expression in tumor <b>xenografts</b> was tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Results: Compared with the untreated group, CZBG (high-, medium- and low-dose) plus ADM could significantly decrease the weight of tumor <b>xenografts</b> in nude mice (P< 0. 05). Compared with ADM, high- and medium-dose CZBG plus ADM could decrease the weight of tumor <b>xenografts</b> in nude mice with statistical significance (P< 0. 05). The high- and medium-dose CZBG plus ADM could also significantly decrease the mdr 1 gene expression in tumor <b>xenografts</b> as compared with ADM alone (P< 0. 05).

[...] Induced by human Kinesin-5 inhibitors, mitotic arrest results in apoptosis in some tumor cell lines and human tumor <b>xenograft</b> models. [...] With these promising preclinical studies, ispinesib (SB-715992; Cytokinetics/GSK), SB-743921 from Cytokinetics/GSK, MK-0731 from Merck, filanesib (ARRY-520) (Array BioPharma), and litronesib (LY2523355) (Eli Lilly) have entered into clinical trials.

500|$|NEDD9 binds {{directly}} to the Aurora-A mitotic kinase at the centrosome, and promotes its activity, allowing cells to enter mitosis. [...] Degradation of NEDD9 {{at the end of}} mitosis contributes to timely Aurora-A degradation. [...] Cell overexpressing NEDD9 exhibit deficient cytokinesis resulting in accumulation of multipolar mitotic spindles and abnormal numbers of centrosomes. On the other hand, cells with depleted NEDD9 have prematurely separated centrosomes and are deficient in microtubule organizing activity at mitosis leading to abundance of monopolar or asymmetric spindles, preventing cells from entering mitosis. NEDD9 also regulates Aurora-A activation at the basal body of cilia as cells resorb cilia during early G1. [...] Cilia are small organelles that protrude from the surface of adherent cells that are the obligate site of action for proteins such as Hedgehog, and the polycystins: by influencing ciliary stability, NEDD9 is positioned to affect these signaling systems. Interaction of NEDD9 with Aurora A kinase may also play a role in tumor invasion. NEDD9 binds to and regulates acetylation of cortactin (CTTN) in an Aurora A kinase (AURKA)/HDAC6–dependent manner. The knockdown of NEDD9 or AURKA results in an increase in the amount of acetylated CTTN and a decrease in the binding of CTTN to F-actin. Overexpression of the deacetylation mimicking (9KR) mutant of CTTN is sufficient to restore actin dynamics at the leading edge and migration proficiency of the tumor cells. Inhibition of AURKA and HDAC6 activity by alisertib and tubastatin A in <b>xenograft</b> models of breast cancer leads to a {{decrease in the number of}} pulmonary metastases.|$|E

To evaluate whether bovine fetal testes can mature when grafted into mouse hosts, small fragments of testes from midgestation (125 to 145 days of gestation) bovine fetuses were grafted ectopically into immunodeficient castrated male mice. At grafting, donor tissue displayed the typical seminiferous cords composed of gonocytes and primitive Sertoli cells. At 5 or 10 months after grafting, {{weight of the}} seminal vesicles in recipient mice was indicative of production of bioactive testosterone by <b>xenografts.</b> <b>Xenografts</b> showed similar development regardless of donor age. At 5 months, tubule formation occurred but germ cell differentiation had not proceeded beyond the spermatogonia stage. At 10 months, an increase in tubule size was evident and pachytene spermatocytes were observed as the most advanced type of germ cells in the <b>xenografts</b> of 2 donors. The number of tubules with germ cells was reduced in <b>xenografts</b> compared to donor tissue, but at 10 months the number of germ cells per tubule was higher than in donors. Germ cell proliferation was similar in donor tissue and <b>xenografts.</b> However, Sertoli cells showed a higher proliferation rate in <b>xenografts</b> collected at 5 months than in donor fetal testes and <b>xenografts</b> collected at 10 months. Sertoli cells in <b>xenografts</b> showed a progressive but incomplete loss of expression of Müllerian inhibiting substance and weak androgen receptor expression, indicating an incomplete Sertoli cell maturation.

40|$|The {{activities}} and {{contents of the}} lysosomal cysteine proteinases cathepsins B, H and L were examined in <b>xenografts</b> of biopsied muscles transplanted from age-matched normal subjects and Duchenne-muscular-dystrophy (DMD) patients into nude mice. The activity of cathepsin B increased 9 -fold and that of B-plus-L increased 24 -fold {{in the first week}} after transplantation in normal muscle <b>xenografts.</b> By the third week, the activity of cathepsin B increased a total of 20 -fold and B-plus-L increased to 36 -fold the original level. The activity levels of cathepsin B, B-plus-L, H and D, and acid phosphatase in normal and DMD <b>xenografts</b> were not significantly different when compared 2 weeks after transplantation. However, the protein content of cathepsin B in DMD muscle <b>xenografts</b> was more than 3 -fold that of normal <b>xenografts</b> at 2 weeks. The profile of cathepsin H activity in normal muscle <b>xenografts</b> was different than those of cathepsins B and B-plus-L. In the first week, the cathepsin H diminished sharply to about one-third of the biopsied muscle level and then, by 3 weeks after transplantation, it had increased slightly to about half the original level. The amount of endogenous cysteine-proteinase inhibitor changed in parallel with the activity of cathepsins B and B-plus-L. Cathepsins B and H, but not cathepsin L, were found immunohistochemically in regenerating muscle fibres of normal and DMD <b>xenografts</b> 2 weeks after transplantation. Staining of cathepsin B in DMD <b>xenografts</b> was slightly stronger than that in normal subjects. There was no immunostaining in degenerating or necrotic muscle fibres 2 weeks after transplantation.
