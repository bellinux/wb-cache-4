5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a <b>xenolith</b> contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E

There is a diverse rock types beneath the Potrillo volcanics, the range is from Proterozoic granites through a Phanerozoic sedimentary succession to basalt-andesite volcanics of the southern fringes of the Sierra de las Uvas volcanic field.

Clinopyroxenes show highly variable mantle normalized REE (rare earth elements) patterns but basically can be classified into three major groups: LREE-depleted, LREE-enriched and U-shaped patterns. As the REE patterns of clinopyroxenes usually reflect the REE patterns of the host peridotite, the three major REE patterns define three geochemically different groups of <b>xenoliths.</b> LREE-depleted <b>xenoliths</b> generally have undeformed protogranular textures, while the more deformed <b>xenoliths</b> with porphyroclastic and equigranular textures have LREE-enriched trace element patterns. The U-shaped pattern is very distinctive and is generally associated with poikilitic textures.
