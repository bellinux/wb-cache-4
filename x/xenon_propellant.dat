During this first interplanetary cruise phase, Dawn spent 270 days, or 85% of this phase, using its thrusters. It expended less than 72 kilograms of <b>xenon</b> <b>propellant</b> for a total change in velocity of 1.81km/s.

50|$|The 70 kg {{spacecraft}} has {{a specific}} impulse of 1000 seconds, for a delta-V budget of about 500 ms−1; the {{intention was to}} use 20% of the <b>xenon</b> <b>propellant</b> for the initial orbit correction, {{and the rest of}} the propellant between the Earth flyby and the asteroid flyby to ensure a controlled flyby distance of 30 km.|$|E

50|$|After launch {{it would}} {{accelerate}} to about 106 km/s (about 22.4 AU/year) over 10 years, using <b>xenon</b> as <b>propellant</b> and a nuclear fission reactor for power.|$|R
50|$|The propellant, such as xenon gas, is {{fed through}} the anode, which has {{numerous}} small {{holes in it}} {{to act as a}} gas distributor. <b>Xenon</b> <b>propellant</b> is used because of its high atomic weight and low ionization potential. As the neutral xenon atoms diffuse into the channel of the thruster, they are ionized by collisions with circulating high-energy electrons (typically 10-40 eV, or about 10% of the discharge voltage). Once ionized, the xenon ions typically have a charge of +1, though a small fraction (~20%) have +2.|$|E
50|$|A 4-grid ion {{thruster}} with only 0.2 m diameter {{is projected to}} absorb 250 kW power. With that energy input rate, the thruster could produce a thrust of 2.5 N. The specific impulse (a measure of fuel efficiency), could reach 19,300 s at an exhaust velocity of 210 km/s if <b>xenon</b> <b>propellant</b> were used. The potentially attainable power and thrust densities would substantially extend the power absorption of current {{ion thruster}}s to far more than 100 kW. These characteristics facilitate the development of ion thrusters that can result in extraordinary high-end velocities.|$|E

TAU would have reached 200 AU in 15 years after launch, 400 AU in 23 years, 600 AU in 32 years, 800 AU in 41 years and the full 1000 AU in half a century. Even so, it would have traversed less than 0.4% of the 4.3 light years to Alpha Centauri, the nearest star.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of large inert-gas thrusters is predicted based on present knowledge of ion optics performance and discharge chamber operation. Calculated performance data are given for argon and <b>xenon</b> <b>propellants.</b> The effect of varying propellant utilization and thruster diameter is discussed and the optimum choice of beam diameter for very large systems is indicated for low, intermediate, and high specific impulses. Optimum discharge chamber depths are also specified. Although detailed design considerations may modify the predictions, the general trends indicated {{should still be}} useful for directing future technology efforts and evaluating mission studies involving large thrusters...|$|R
40|$|The {{multipole}} thruster {{was used}} to investigate the use of argon and <b>xenon</b> <b>propellants</b> as possible alternatives to the electric thruster propellants of mercury and cesium. The multipole approach was used because of its general high performance level. The design employed, using flat and cylindrical rolled sections of sheet metal, was selected for ease of fabrication, design, assembly, and modification. All testing was conducted in a vacuum facility and the pumping was accomplished by a 0. 8 m diffusion pump together with liquid nitrogen cooled liner. Minimum discharge losses were in the 200 - 250 ev. ion range for both argon and xenon. Flatness parameters were typically in the 0. 70 - 0. 75 range...|$|R
40|$|An {{axisymmetric}} {{hydrodynamic model}} of the plasma flow within a Hall thruster channel is used to model the differences between krypton and <b>xenon</b> <b>propellants.</b> Krypton offers a higher specific impulse and lower cost than xenon, but its overall efficiency is often lower.

The model results are compared to experimental data obtained for the NASA- 173 Mv 1 Hall thruster running at 500 V and 9. 27 A. The acceleration region for krypton is observed to be wider than that for xenon in both the model and experiment which is mainly due to the differences in the magnetic field profiles...|$|R
5000|$|The 25,000 kg (gross launch mass {{including}} 10,000 kg of <b>xenon</b> <b>propellant)</b> TAU spacecraft {{would have}} been launched into a low Earth orbit by the Space Shuttle in 2005-2010. Once deployed, a central boom would have telescoped the three main units listed above to a total 40 meter length to separate the payload from the nuclear reactor. The ion propulsion/xenon propellant module {{would have been}} positioned close {{to the center of}} gravity, its 250 km/s [...] exhaust velocity ion engines providing a thrust of 0.35 millimeters per second. TAU would have attained Earth escape velocity in 250 days in a spiralling orbit, followed by Solar System escape speed 700 days later.|$|E
50|$|About 20-30% of the {{discharge}} current is an electron current, {{which does not}} produce thrust, thus limiting the energetic efficiency of the thruster; the other 70-80% of the current is in the ions. Because the majority of electrons are trapped in the Hall current, they have a long residence time inside the thruster {{and are able to}} ionize almost all of the <b>xenon</b> <b>propellant,</b> allowing mass utilizations of 90-99%. The mass utilization efficiency of the thruster is thus around 90%, while {{the discharge}} current efficiency is around 70%, for a combined thruster efficiency of around 63% (= 90% × 70%). Modern Hall thrusters have achieved efficiencies as high as 75% through advanced designs.|$|E
50|$|The {{advanced}} {{ion engine}} uses 10 times less propellant than equivalent chemical rockets, it can process {{three times the}} power of previous designs, and increase efficiency by 50%. It will use the Hall-effect, which provides low acceleration but can fire continuously {{for many years to}} thrust a large mass to high speed. Hall effect thrusters trap electrons in a magnetic field and use them to ionize the onboard xenon gas propellant. The magnetic field also generates an electric field that accelerates the charged ions creating an exhaust plume of plasma that pushes the spacecraft forward. The spacecraft concept would have a dry mass of 5.5 tons, and could store up to 13 tons of <b>xenon</b> <b>propellant.</b>|$|E
40|$|Impulse bits {{produced}} by conical theta-pinch inductive pulsed plasma thrusters possessing cone angles of 20 deg, 38 deg, and 60 deg, were quantified for 500 J/pulse operation by direct measurement using a hanging-pendulum thrust stand. All three cone angles {{were tested in}} single-pulse mode, with the 38 deg model producing the highest impulse bits at roughly 1 mN-s operating on both argon and <b>xenon</b> <b>propellants.</b> A capacitor charging system, assembled to support repetitively-pulsed thruster operation, permitted testing of the 38 deg thruster at a repetition-rate of 5 Hz at power levels of 0. 9, 1. 6, and 2. 5 kW. The average thrust measured during multiple-pulse operation exceeded the value obtained when the single-pulse impulse bit is multiplied by the repetition rate...|$|R

Final optimization results show that an argon propellant utilization efficiency of 0. 9, at 260 W of discharge power per beam ampere, was obtained with a thruster having 20 rows of magnets and 10 tubular anodes. The average ion beam current densities were as high as 13 mA/sq cm. The results are considered to be the highest yet achieved with argon propellant...|$|R

On 26 January, the probe responded to commands from ground control by changing the beacon signal. On 6 February, an ejection of <b>xenon</b> <b>propellant</b> was commanded for attitude control to improve communication. The spin axis change rate was about two degrees per day. On 25 February, telemetry data was obtained through the low-gain antenna. On 4 March, telemetry data was obtained through the medium-gain antenna. On 6 March, Hayabusas position was established at about 13,000 km ahead of Itokawa in its orbit with a relative speed of 3 m per second.|$|E
5000|$|The NEXT {{engine is}} a type of solar {{electric}} propulsion in which thruster systems use the electricity generated by the spacecraft's solar panel to accelerate the <b>xenon</b> <b>propellant</b> to speeds of up to 90,000 mph (145,000 km/h or 40 km/s). NEXT can produce 6.9 kW thruster power and 236 mN thrust. It can be throttled down to 0.5 kW power, and has a specific impulse of 4190 seconds (compared to 3120 for NSTAR). The NEXT thruster has demonstrated a total impulse of 17 MN·s; which is the highest total impulse ever demonstrated by an ion thruster. [...] A beam extraction area 1.6 times that of NSTAR allows higher thruster input power while maintaining low voltages and ion current densities, thus maintaining thruster longevity.|$|E

The thrusters used an electrostatic field to ionize the xenon and accelerate the ions to a high speed. This ion engine setup achieved a specific impulse of 16.1 kN·s/kg (1,640 seconds), {{more than three times}} the maximum for chemical rockets. Therefore, 1 kg of propellant (1/350 to 1/300 of the total mass of the spacecraft) produced a delta-v of about 45 m/s. The electric propulsion subsystem had a weight of 29 kg with a peak power consumption of 1,200 watts. [...] SMART-1 is the first in the program of ESA's Small Missions for Advanced Research and Technology.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that MPD thruster performance, as measured by thrust, specific impulse, and efficiency, is limited by a so-called 'onset' current level. Experimental results are presented which show that the onset current level varies with the radial position of mass injection. Specifically, mass injection into either of two zones results in drastically different performance for both argon and <b>xenon</b> <b>propellants.</b> This difference in performance is evidenced by the onset current levels, the onset V-J signatures, and the overall V-J characteristics. The behavior of the thruster with the total mass flow split between the two zones follows a transition between the zonal behavioral limits. The behavior of propellant mixtures also follows a transition between the behavior of the individual propellant species. The flow region between the two zones is characterized by a particle number density discontinuity, a large axial current density, and a large electron Hall parameter, suggesting a possible correlation between observed onset phenomena and a shear-flow discontinuity located in the region between the two zones...|$|R
40|$|The Krypton Large IMpulse Thruster (KLIMT) ESA/PECS project, {{which has}} been {{implemented}} in the Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser Microfusion (IPPLM) and now is approaching its final phase, was aimed at incremental development of a ~ 500 W class Hall effect thruster (HET). Xenon, predominantly used as a propellant in the state-of-the-art HETs, is extremely expensive. Krypton has been considered as a cheaper alternative since more than fifteen years; however, to the best knowledge of the authors, {{there has not been}} a HET model especially designed for this noble gas. To address this issue, KLIMT has been geared towards operation primarily with krypton. During the project, three subsequent prototype versions of the thruster were designed, manufactured and tested, aimed at gradual improvement of each next exemplar. In the current paper, the heat loads in new engine have been discussed. It has been shown that thermal equilibrium of the thruster is gained within the safety limits of the materials used.

50|$|A {{variety of}} plans were proposed, {{including}} using launch windows (not counting backups) for a Jupiter assist in 2014, 2026, 2038, and 2050about every 12 years.

With an ion drive, a speed of about 7.9 AU/yr by the time its <b>xenon</b> <b>propellant</b> was depleted could be attained, enabling that 200 AU by 2044 and perhaps 1000 AU after one hundred years from launch. Different launch times and configurations have various timelines and options. One configuration for launch saw the use of a Delta IV Heavy and for the upper stages a stack of Star 38 and Star 37 leading to various gravity assist options. Another launch stack that was considered was the Atlas 551 with a Star 48.|$|E

50|$|On 30 November, JAXA {{announced}} that control and communication with Hayabusa had been restored, but a problem remained with the craft's reaction control system, perhaps involving a frozen pipe. Mission control was working {{to resolve the}} problem before the craft's upcoming launch window for return to Earth. On December 6, Hayabusa was 550 km from Itokawa. JAXA {{held a press conference}} about the situation so far. On 27 November, the probe experienced a power outage when trying altitude correction, probably due to a fuel leakage. On 2 December, an altitude correction was attempted, but the thruster did not generate enough force. On 3 December, the probe's Z-axis was found to be 20 to 30 degrees from the Sun direction and increasing. On 4 December, as an emergency measure, <b>xenon</b> <b>propellant</b> from the ion engines was blown to correct the spin, and it was confirmed successful. Altitude control was commanded using the xenon gas. On 5 December, altitude was corrected enough to regain communication through the medium gain antenna. Telemetry was obtained and analyzed. As the result of telemetry analysis, it was found that there was a strong possibility that the sampler projectile had not penetrated when it landed on 25 November. Due to the power outage, the telemetry log data was faulty. On 8 December, a sudden altitude change was observed, and communication with Hayabusa was lost. It was thought likely that the turbulence was caused by evaporation of 8 or 10cc of leaked fuel. This forced a wait of a month or two for Hayabusa to stabilize by conversion of precession to pure rotation, after which the rotation axis needed to be directed toward the Sun and Earth within a specific angular range. The probability of achieving this was estimated at 60% by December 2006, 70% by spring 2007.|$|E

Reductions in cathode-side baffle erosion were achieved by adding nitrogen to the <b>xenon</b> <b>propellant</b> or by increasing the cathode orifice diameter. Analyses show that no significant degradation in ion engine performance should be expected at these nitrogen mass fractions. XRD, XPS and Auger analyses indicate the existence of nitrogen and nitrides in the surface of some but not all of the badges used in the tests where nitrogen was added to the xenon. Difficulty in identifying surface nitrides in the samples may be due to the existence of surface oxides and contaminants, or to the small thicknesses of the nitride layers...|$|E

A <b>xenon</b> <b>propellant</b> load of 10 metric tons represents greater than 10 % of the global annual production rate of xenon. A single procurement of this size with short-term delivery can disrupt the xenon market, driving up pricing, making the propellant costs for the mission prohibitive.

40|$|Krypton has {{recently}} {{become the focus}} of attention in the Hall thruster community because of its relatively large specific impulse compared with xenon and its potential to operate with comparable efficiencies. However, before krypton can be considered a viable propellant choice for missions, the performance gap between xenon and krypton must be reduced. A series of diagnostic measurements are taken for <b>xenon</b> and krypton <b>propellant</b> using the NASA- 173 Mv 1 Hall thruster and the results are analyzed using a phenomenological performance model. The combined use of experiments and modeling enables a direct comparison of several efficiency components for each propellant to be made. With this method, it is possible to pinpoint the exact causes for the efficiency gap between xenon and krypton. It is also possible to see the effect of themagnetic field topology onHall thruster performance and where gains are being made due to the magnetic field. Although there is a large series of competing components that differentiate krypton and xenon performance, the largest factors that dictate the efficiency difference between krypton and xenon are krypton’s inferior propellant utilization and beam divergence.

40|$|Hall thrusters, a type {{of space}} {{electric}} propulsion, offer high specific impulses attractive {{for a variety of}} space missions. As lifetime requirements desired for Hall thruster operations increase, there is a greater {{need to be able to}} predict and analyze the wear of the thruster over time. The main mechanism of Hall thruster failure is the erosion of the acceleration channel walls to the point where the magnetic circuit is exposed to the plasma flow. Experimental testing to determine the rate and extent of wall erosion is time consuming and expensive. Thus, capturing the erosion process through computational simulations is a useful means of predicting lifetime for design and analysis purposes. Two models are employed to simulate the erosion process. The first is a hydrodynamic model that is used to describe the plasma flow within the thruster and to calculate the ion fluxes to the thruster channel walls. The second method is a molecular dynamics model that is used to calculate the sputter yields for the wall material based on the incoming ion fluxes. The results of these two methods are used together to simulate the erosion of the channel walls and their evolution over time. Three test cases are analyzed. The hydrodynamic model is used to compare the differences between krypton and <b>xenon</b> <b>propellants</b> in the NASA- 173 Mv 1 Hall thruster. The molecular dynamics model is used to calculate the sputter yields of hexagonal boron nitride due to low-energy xenon ions. Both methods are used to model the erosion of the channel walls of an SPT- 100 Hall thruster over a 4000 -hour life test. The computational results are compared to available experimental results for all three cases along with additional analysis. This work represents the only known use of a fluid-based plasma model for Hall thruster erosion simulations. It also contains the only use of a molecular dynamics model without additional surface binding energy assumptions for boron nitride sputtering simulations. Results of boron nitride sputter yields for xenon ion energies below 100 eV are presented...|$|R
40|$|Hall-effect {{thrusters}} (HETs) are {{affordable and}} efficient electric propulsion devices for space exploration, with higher specific impulse than conventional chemical propulsion and higher thrust {{at a given}} power compared to ion thrusters. A detailed understanding and an accurate characterization of the physical processes occurring in HET plume are critical from both the thruster performance and spacecraft integration perspectives. Therefore, a new electron model that includes full 2 -D axisymmetric magnetic field effects is developed and incorporated {{within the framework of}} a 2 -D axisymmetric hybrid particle-fluid code. The governing equation of this new electron model consists of an electron mobility coefficient tensor. The new electron model can simulate any shape magnetic fields. The accuracy of the model is first assessed using the method of manufactured solutions and a Hall thruster test case to confirm 2 nd order accuracy. Then, the simulation results of a 6 -kW laboratory Hall thruster are directly compared with experimental measurements to validate the model. By including the magnetic field, modeling of the anomalous electron mobility is required. Since the anomalous electron mobility is still not yet well-understood, it is modeled using the Bohm coefficient. A parametric study of the Bohm coefficient is performed to examine its effect on plasma properties. Due to the concave shape of magnetic field lines, the plasma potential in the plume does not show a linear trend with the anomalous collision frequency. Comparisons with experimental data show that the new model with the magnetic field captures the detailed physics than without the magnetic field. In particular, the plasma potential profile agrees well with data by accurately capturing the strong negative gradient near the discharge channel exit of the thruster. In order to extend the capability of the plume simulation, a sputter model is also implemented. The sputter model is applied to simulate the sputtering process of <b>xenon</b> <b>propellants</b> bombarding the surface of the "keeper" for the cathode, which can be an important failure mechanism in Hall thrusters. The steady-state mean erosion rate suggests that keeper erosion is as low as the erosion rate of the discharge channel walls in magnetically-shielded Hall thrusters...|$|R
