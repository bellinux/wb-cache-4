40|$|Abstract Introduction To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this is the first report of a {{comorbidity}} between Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome and 47 (<b>XXX)</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The clinical picture of Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome is well described, while 47 (<b>XXX)</b> <b>syndrome</b> is much more rare and has a broader spectrum of possible phenotypic presentations. Case presentation An Italian Caucasian girl was referred at the age of 11 to our Rehabilitation Center for anxiety and learning difficulties. The girl had already been diagnosed as having 47 (XXX) syndrome; she had some rather typical features of the chromosomal abnormality, but she also showed a high level of anxiety and the presence of motor and vocal tics. When an accurate history was taken, a diagnosis of Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome emerged. Conclusions The possible interaction between peculiar features of these two syndromes in terms of neuropsychological and affective functioning is both interesting for the specific case and to hypothesize models of rehabilitation for patients with one or both syndromes. Executive functions are specifically reduced in both syndromes, therefore it might be hard to discriminate the contribution of each one to the general impairment; the same applies to anxiety. Moreover, mental retardation (with a significantly lower verbal cognitive functioning) poses relevant problems when suggesting cognitive behavioral or psychoeducational rehabilitative approaches. </p...|$|E

Rates of SCA diagnoses in infants and children are increasing, and {{there is a need for}} specialized interdisciplinary care to address associated risks. The eXtraordinarY Kids Clinic was established to provide comprehensive and experienced care for children and adolescents with SCA, with an interdisciplinary team composed of developmental–behavioral pediatrics, endocrinology, genetic counseling, child psychology, pediatric neuropsychology, speech–language pathology, occupational therapy, nursing, and social work. The clinic model includes an interdisciplinary approach to care, where assessment results by each discipline are integrated to develop unified diagnostic impressions and treatment plans individualized for each patient. Additional objectives of the eXtraordinarY Kids Clinic program include prenatal genetic counseling, research, education, family support, and advocacy. Methods: Satisfaction surveys were distributed to 496 patients, and responses were received from 168 unique patients. Results: Satisfaction with the overall clinic visit was ranked as “very satisfied” in 85 %, and as “satisfied” in another 9. 8 %. Results further demonstrate specific benefits from the clinic experience, the importance of a knowledgeable clinic coordinator, and support the need for similar clinics across the country. Three case examples of the interdisciplinary approach to assessment and treatment are included.

40|$|The Cytogenetic Laboratory of the Faculty of Medicine processes, on average, 300 annual {{samples of}} public and private {{healthcare}} centers by conventional cytogenetics. It is essential to implement new techniques {{to improve the quality of}} the service offered. The purpose of this work was to implement the Fluorescent in situ Hybridization technique (FISH). An observational, cross-sectional, analytical study was performed. Peripheral blood samples from patients with sex chromosomopathies diagnosed by conventional cytogenetics were analyzed. Fluorescent in situ hybridization technique was applied, comparing results with FISH and with conventional cytogenetics. The percentage of mosaicism detected by conventional cytogenetics and Fluorescent in situ Hybridization was studied: 24 samples were analyzed; 19 presented numerical alterations, 3 structural and 2 both. Numerical alterations were Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, <b>XXX</b> <b>syndrome</b> and XYY syndrome. Concordance in diagnoses was found for both techniques. For Turner syndrome, 8 of 12 samples corresponded to mosaicism, and there were no significant differences between conventional cytogenetics and the technique studied (p 0. 05). Klinefelter syndrome and XYY were both presented in a non-mosaic karyotype. For <b>XXX</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a normal line (46, XX) was observed in three of the samples, in a percentage close to the cut off. From this research, it will be possible to implement Fluorescent in situ Hybridization in this service, to extend it to other pathologies and to enable the training of human resources; consolidating this laboratory as a national academic reference center...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Turner {{syndrome}} is a chromosomal abnormality {{in which the}} majority of patients have a 45 XO karyotype, while a small number have a 45 XO/ 47 XXX karyotype. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia has been previously reported in patients with Turner syndrome. Although insulinomas {{are the most common}} type of functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and have been reported in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasias, the tumors have not been reported in patients with mosaic Turner syndrome. The present study reports the first case of an insulinoma in a patient with 45 XO/ 47 <b>XXX</b> mosaic Turner <b>syndrome.</b> The patient suffered from recurrent hypoglycemia, which was relieved following ingestion of glucose or food. A 5 -h glucose tolerance test was performed and the levels of glucose, C-Peptide and insulin were detected. In addition, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound scanning were performed to evaluate the possibility of an insulinoma. Pathological examina-tion and karyotyping were performed on a surgical specimen and a whole blood sample, respectively. The patient was found to suffer from premature ovarian failure, and a physical exami-nation was consistent with a diagnosis of Turner syndrome. An ultrasound scan demonstrated streak ovaries and the patient was found to have a 45 XO/ 47 XXX karyotype. Furthermore, a lesion was detected in the pancreas following CT scanning, which was identified as an insulinoma following surgical removal and histological examination. In conclusion, the present study reports the first case of an insulinoma in a patient with mosaic Turner syndrome. Since mosaic Turner syndrome and insuli-noma are rare diseases, an association may exist that has not been previously identified...|$|R
40|$|Background: Psychiatric {{disorders}} are common mental disorders without a pathological biomarker. Classic genetic {{studies found that}} an extra X chromosome frequently causes psychiatric symptoms in patients with either Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) or Triple X <b>syndrome</b> (<b>XXX).</b> Over-dosage of some X-linked escapee genes was suggested to cause psychiatric disorders. However, relevance of these rare genetic diseases to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders {{in the general population}} of psychiatric patients is unknown. Methods: XIST and several X-linked genes were studied in 36 lymphoblastoid cell lines from healthy females and 60 lymphoblastoid cell lines from female patients with either bipolar disorder or recurrent major depression. XIST and KDM 5 C expression was also quantified in 48 RNA samples from postmortem human brains of healthy female controls and female psychiatric patients. Findings: We found that the XIST gene, a master in control of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), is significantly over-expressed (p =  1  ×  10 − 7, corrected after multiple comparisons) in the lymphoblastoid cells of female patients with either bipolar disorder or major depression. The X-linked escapee gene KDM 5 C also displays significant up-regulation (p =  5. 3  ×  10 − 7, corrected after multiple comparisons) in the patients' cells. Expression of XIST and KDM 5 C is highly correlated (Pearson's coefficient, r =  0. 78, p =  1. 3  ×  10 − 13). Studies on human postmortem brains supported over-expression of the XIST gene in female psychiatric patients. Interpretations: We propose that over-expression of XIST may cause or result from subtle alteration of XCI, which up-regulates the expression of some X-linked escapee genes including KDM 5 C. Over-expression of X-linked genes could be a common mechanism for the development of psychiatric disorders between patients with those rare genetic diseases and the general population of female psychiatric patients with XIST over-expression. Our studies suggest that XIST and KDM 5 C expression {{could be used as a}} biological marker for diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in a significantly large subset of female patients. Research in context: Due to lack of biological markers, diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric {{disorders are}} subjective. There is utmost urgency to identify biomarkers for clinics, research, and drug development. We found that XIST and KDM 5 C gene expression may be used as a biological marker for diagnosis of major affective disorders in a significantly large subset of female patients from the general population.
