40|$|Abstract [...] X-ray phase {{analysis}} of clays {{is difficult because}} these materials generally consist of a mixture of different phases, i. e., mixed-layer minerals, individual clay minerals (non mixed-layer), and associated minerals, such as calcite and quartz. The analysis requires knowledge that presently is incorporated in a computer-based <b>xpert</b> <b>system.</b> This expert system is capable of a) identification of associated minerals; b) identification of individual clay minerals; c) identification {{of the nature of}} the mixed-layer minerals; d) approximate structural characterization of the mixed-layer minerals; and e) precise structural deter-mination of the mixed-layer minerals by comparison of experimental X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with calculated patterns for different models. Accuracy of the conclusions drawn by the expert system has been verified with literature data. Programs for the structural characterization f mixed-layer minerals must allow a) modification of the structural characteristics, abundances, and order-disorder distribution of the layers; b) modification of the distribution of the sizes of coherent scattering domains; and c) consid-eration of mixed-layer clays with more than two components.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a formalization {{of the knowledge}} domain of nondestruc-tive quality control of polymeric omposite components. The formalization scheme {{presented in this paper}} has been implemented in a prototype knowledge-based <b>xpert</b> <b>system</b> (KBES), called NICC for nondestructive inspection of composite components, to help in the quality assurance of these parts. Geometric and bonding characteristics of individual and assembled components are taken into account, as opposed to the better understood evaluation of well-behaved test specimens. The use of nondestructive tech-niques in the inspection of plastic and polymeric omposites i fairly recent and hence, the knowledge required to develop a KBES is still very scattered and not yet fully covered in the literature. This study demonstrates both the feasibility of compiling and representing this knowledge domain and the possibility oftranslating it into an efficient automated tool capable of giving reliable expert-like advice at low cost. The reasoning process is divided into three stages. In the first stage, a polymetric omposite compo-nent is completely defined according to features that re relevant for nondestructive inspection. In the second stage, all the discontinuities that may be present in the compo-nent are determined. Finally, in the third stage, appropriate nondestructive t sting procedures are identified to detect each of the possible discontinuities...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Extrapulmonary {{tuberculosis}} (EPTB) {{accounts for}} more than 20 % of tuberculosis (TB) cases. Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is a fully automated amplification system, for which excellent results in the diagnosis of pulmonary TB in highly endemic countries have been recently reported. We aimed to assess the performance of the <b>Xpert</b> <b>system</b> in diagnosing EPTB in a low incidence setting. We investigated with Xpert a large number of consecutive extrapulmonary clinical specimens (1, 476, corresponding to 1, 068 patients) including both paediatric (494) and adult samples. We found, in comparison with a reference standard consisting of combination of culture and clinical diagnosis of TB, an overall sensitivity and specificity of 81. 3 % and 99. 8 % for Xpert, while the sensitivity of microscopy was 48 %. For biopsies, urines, pus and cerebrospinal fluids the sensitivity exceeded 85 %, while it was slightly under 80 % for gastric aspirates. It was, in contrast, lower than 50 % for cavitary fluids. High sensitivity and specificity (86. 9 % and 99. 7 %, respectively) were also obtained for paediatric specimens. Although the role of culture remains central in the microbiological diagnosis of EPTB, the sensitivity of Xpert in rapidly diagnosing the disease makes it a much better choice compared to smear microscopy. The ability to rule out the disease still remains suboptimal...|$|R
40|$|Problem The World Health Organization has {{endorsed}} the Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), an automated polymerase-chain-reaction-based assay, for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, large-scale {{use of a}} new technology calls for preparation and adaptation. Approach A pilot implementation {{study was conducted in}} two Brazilian cities to explore the replacement of sputum smear microscopy with Xpert. The laboratories included covered 70 % of the tuberculosis cases diagnosed, had no overlap in population catchment areas, handled different workloads and were randomly shifted to Xpert. Sputum samples were collected through the same routine procedures. Before the study the medical information system was prepared for the recording of Xpert results. Laboratory technicians were trained to operate Xpert machines and health workers were taught how to interpret the results. Local setting The average annual tuberculosis incidence in Brazil is around 90 cases per 100 000 population. However, co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and multidrug resistance are relatively infrequent (10 % and < 2 %, respectively). Relevant changes Of the tested sputum samples, 7. 3 % were too scanty for Xpert and had to be examined microscopically. Ten per cent of Xpert equipment needed replacement, but spare parts were not readily available in the country. Absence of patient identification numbers led to the introduction of errors in the medical information system.

40|$|Current {{nucleic acid}} {{amplification}} methods to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis are complex, labor-intensive, and technically challenging. We developed and performed the first {{analysis of the}} Cepheid Gene <b>Xpert</b> <b>System's</b> MTB/RIF assay, an integrated hands-free sputum-processing and real-time PCR system with rapid on-demand, near-patient technology, to simultaneously detect M. tuberculosis and rifampin resistance. Analytic tests of M. tuberculosis DNA demonstrated a limit of detection (LOD) of 4. 5 genomes per reaction. Studies using sputum spiked with known numbers of M. tuberculosis CFU predicted a clinical LOD of 131 CFU/ml. Killing studies showed that the assay's buffer decreased M. tuberculosis viability by at least 8 logs, substantially reducing biohazards. Tests of 23 different commonly occurring rifampin resistance mutations demonstrated that all 23 (100 %) would be identified as rifampin resistant. An analysis of 20 nontuberculosis mycobacteria species confirmed high assay specificity. A small clinical validation study of 107 clinical sputum samples from suspected tuberculosis cases in Vietnam detected 29 / 29 (100 %) smear-positive culture-positive cases and 33 / 39 (84. 6 %) or 38 / 53 (71. 7 %) smear-negative culture-positive cases, as determined by growth on solid medium or on both solid and liquid media, respectively. M. tuberculosis was not detected in 25 / 25 (100 %) of the culture-negative samples. A study of 64 smear-positive culture-positive sputa from retreatment tuberculosis cases in Uganda detected 63 / 64 (98. 4 %) culture-positive cases and 9 / 9 (100 %) cases of rifampin resistance. Rifampin resistance was excluded in 54 / 55 (98. 2 %) susceptible cases. Specificity rose to 100 % after correcting for a conventional susceptibility test error. In conclusion, this highly sensitive and simple-to-use system can detect M. tuberculosis directly from sputum in less than 2 h...|$|R
40|$|Diagnosis of {{pulmonary}} (PTB) and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in smear-negative {{patients can}} be difficult. We assessed retrospectively {{the performance of}} <b>Xpert</b> MTB/RIF <b>system</b> (<b>Xpert,</b> Cepheid) in diagnosing smear-negative tuberculosis (TB), which represents {{the most common form}} of TB in a low incidence setting. Performance of Xpert was compared to acid-fast microscopic examination using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain in patients with culture-confirmed TB. 386 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) culture-positive samples were detected out of 5170 specimens tested with smear microscopy, Xpert and culture: 323 were both culture- and Xpert-positive, and 63 culture-positive only. Of these, 234 (60. 6 %) were smear-negative. In addition Xpert detected 40 probable TB cases, based on clinical findings, which were culture-negative. Compared to culture, Xpert showed an overall sensitivity of 83. 7 % and a specificity of 99. 1 %; sensitivity was higher for respiratory samples (86. 5 %) than for non-respiratory samples (76. 8 %). Xpert sensitivity for smear-negative culture-confirmed TB was 73. 1 % and was not influenced by TB localization. As sensitivity of microscopy alone was poor (39. 4 %), Xpert improved both diagnosis of pulmonary TB (Δ = 36. 5 %) and extra-pulmonary TB (Δ = 63. 4 %). Xpert MTB/RIF is a sensitive method for rapid diagnosis of TB compared to the conventional ZN staining. Xpert can serve as a sensitive and time-saving diagnostic method for microbiological diagnosis of smear-negative TB in countries with a low TB prevalence...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAim and objectiveMultidrug-resistant Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (MDR-TB) is {{an increasing}} public health problem, causing significant difficulties and costs for TB control programs. In some settings, as many as each second infectious TB case has MDR-TB. Reliable and timely detection of these cases is urgently needed. Unfortunately, globally most MDR-TB patients are not identified and will thus not receive appropriate therapy. They are clearly at risk to develop even more resistant TB and to transmit increasingly resistant M. tuberculosis strains. With today’s knowledge, available diagnostic tools and epidemiological situation, it cannot be considered acceptable to wait for 8 – 10 weeks to know if a clinical isolate is drug susceptible or not. Thus, the generally used algorithm of isolation on solid media followed by subsequent DST on solid media must today be seen as obsolete. The objective of this presentation is to discuss the possibilities and limitations of more rapid alternatives. MethodsDifferent, more rapid alternatives to the time-consuming classical laboratory tests to detect drug-resistant TB were compared. These include automated liquid culturing systems and molecular techniques. Results and discussionThe most rapid and promising techniques are based on molecular detection of resistance-related mutations, especially when the assay is used for direct testing of a smear-positive sputum sample. In this case MDR-TB patients can be detected in 1 – 2 days which makes early initiation of effective drug combinations possible. Besides a number of locally developed assays, there are today two major commercial alternatives: GeneXpert from Cepheid and the line probe assays (LPA) from Hain Life Science. The <b>Xpert</b> <b>system</b> is the most rapid technique, and it was developed {{to be easy to}} use. It offers the simultaneous detection of M. tuberculosis and resistance to rifampicin, which is seen as a proxy for MDR-TB. Rifampicin is, however, not everywhere an applicable MDR marker. For example, in Iran, the prevalence of rifampicin mono-resistant M. tuberculosis is high. The LPA investigates resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid and is thus more informative. It is, however, somewhat more time-consuming and laborious to perform. Both assays have demonstrated excellent specificity and sensitivity. An exception to the high sensitivity is, however, seen in so-called hetero-resistant TB, where phenotypic DST assays are shown to be more sensitive to detect a small proportion of drug-resistant bacteria. ConclusionsReliable and timely detection of drug-resistant TB is needed, which is best achieved with molecular assays. In this author’s opinion, rapid detection of resistance to isoniazid should be included with rifampicin resistance examination. In MDR, timely detection of the XDR defining agents and PZA is urgently needed. Development and validation of such tests should be a priority, as well as establishing QMS for the implementation and routine use of molecular rapid diagnostics. Each country should develop national diagnostic algorithms for how, when and where rapid molecular assays should be used for early detection of drug-resistant TB...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{study is}} set to {{determine}} the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Drug Resistant-Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the HIV/AIDS endemic community. Methods: A three -year retrospective study was conducted from November, 2013 to November, 2016 in Benue State University Teaching Hospital, Makurdi Nigeria. The subject criteria included all patients above 15 years, suspected of pulmonary TB, treatment naïve (new) and re-treated cases irrespective of HIV status. The procedures involved Cepheid Gene <b>Xpert</b> MTB/Rif <b>system,</b> Ziehl Nelseen staining and HIV serologic testing. Results: In a total of two thousand nine-hundred and sixty-nine patients suspected of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, only 6. 2 % (N= 183 / 2969) of patients was detected by Cepheid GeneXpert Mycobacterium/Rifampicin system, while Ziehl Nelseen staining alone detected 2. 7 % (N= 83 / 2969) (X 2 = 5. 01; df= 1; p= 0. 05). The age groups at risk were 21 - 35 years and 35 - 45 years with 54. 6 % and 27. 4 % respectively. Among the 183 patients, 12. 0 % (N= 22 / 183) of patients were Rifampicin resistant. Seventy-seven per cent (N= 17 / 22) of the Rifampicin Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis patients was for re treatment, while the remaining 23. 0 % (N= 5 / 22) was treatment naïve (X 2 = 6. 01; df= 1; p< 0. 05). Seventy –one percent (N= 130 / 183) of the patients detected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis were HIV sero-positive. All the Rifampicin Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis patients were HIV sero-positive. Among the Rifampicin sensitive patients; 68. 3 % (N= 110 / 161) had HIV sero-positive status while 31. 7 % (N= 51 / 161) was HIV sero-negative respectively.

40|$|Global {{tuberculosis}} control has been riding {{a wave of}} progress over the past decade. Mortality and incidence are now falling in all six World Health Organization (WHO) regions and the tuberculosis-related targets of the Millennium Development Goals now seem more reachable. This progress reflects important momentum on many fronts, from more systematic community engagement to increased funding availability. Improvements in tuberculosis case detection have been greatly facilitated {{by the introduction of}} new diagnostic technologies and approaches. These novel methods are beginning to address clinical, public health and technological challenges, such as diagnosing tuberculosis in people living with HIV, as well as patient barriers to accessing sophisticated technologies and diagnostic results. Prior to 2007, no new diagnostic technologies had been endorsed by WHO in decades. However, in the past 5 years, WHO has evaluated and endorsed six diagnostic technologies and methods. It has refined its specifications for sputum collection and case identification using smear microscopy, reducing the burden on patients and laboratory technicians. It has proposed diagnostic algorithms to streamline the concurrent availability of various technologies and to improve the sensitivity of screening of people living with HIV. In 2011, WHO {{went so far as to}} issue negative recommendations on serodiagnostic tests and interferon-c release assays for high-incidence countries], steering national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) away from diagnostic technologies not yet refined enough to warrant a change in practice. Two articles in a recent issue of the European Respiratory Journal focused on the most recently WHOendorsed diagnostic technology, the <b>Xpert</b> MTB/RIF <b>system</b> (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). This automated real-time nucleic acid amplification technology was initially recommended in 2010 as a rapid diagnostic test for tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance, and is suitable for use in peripheral as well as higher level laboratories. In its 2013 report, WHO noted that by end of June 2013, 1402 machines and 3. 2 million cartridges had been purchased in 88 countries; 94 000 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases were diagnosed (84 000 were culture confirmed and 10 000 were identified using the rapid technique). The aforementioned articles published in the European Respiratory Journal summarise the rapid roll-out process, and provide one of the most robust cost analyses to date for Xpert MTB/RIF. These timely reviews and economic analyses can inform efforts to retool NTPs as new drugs, diagnostics and vaccines become available. </br...|$|R

The performance was better using larger volumes of centrifuged CSF among HIV-infected persons with sensitivity of ap-proximately 80 % and excellent specific-ity for microbiologically confirmed TBM. Xpert MTB/RIF performance was less impressive using uncentrifuged CSF with a sensitivity of # 50 %, and Xpert MTB/RIF performance was neg-ligible in HIV-uninfected persons. What Is GeneXpert?
