After a brief discussion of the unique capabilities of laser application in the various fields of materials science, main emphasis is given on the three areas of materials processing, surface modification and alloying, and property measurements at high temperatures. In materials processing the operational regimes for surface hardening, drilling, welding and laser glazing are discussed. Surface modifications by laser melting, quenching and surface alloying, the formation of solid solutions, metastable phases and amorphous solids {{on the basis of}} rapid solidification, ion implantation and ion beam mixing are considered. The influence of solidificaton rates and interface velocities on the surface properties are given. The extension of property measurements up to and beyond the melting point of refractory materials into their critical region by a transient-t pe dynamic laser measurement, density and heat capacity determination in the solid and liquid phases.

We have developed a new method for measuring gas column density through its X-ray absorption. The latest data analysis software has been implemented to correct for both exposure and flat- fielding and to subtract various non-cosmic background from individual images. The ROSAT PSPC observations on the R CrA cloud have been merged into maps in three broad energy bands, with corrections for residual differential background between the observations. Individual sources have been detected and removed from these maps. We have then applied the <b>shadowing</b> <b>technique</b> to derive the first column density map based on X-ray data alone. We have conducted various tests to access systematic errors, including possible background intensity variations. We have also proposed a NRAO 12 m telescope mapping of the CO distribution in the R CrA cloud. This mapping will supplement our X-ray measurement {{to allow for a}} direct calibration of the Co-to-H 2 conversion ratio. We use a multi-energy band <b>X-ray</b> <b>shadowing</b> <b>technique</b> to measure the total column density distribution of molecular clouds...|$|R

40|$|THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SHADOWING TECHNIQUE TO IMPROVE STUDENTS’ SPEAKING PERFORMANCE Hamzar (hamzar_america@yahoo. com) Universitas Negeri Makassar ABSTRACT 	This {{research}} {{aimed at}} finding out (1) whether {{the implementation of}} <b>shadowing</b> <b>technique</b> improves students’ speaking performance, and (2) whether the implementation of <b>shadowing</b> <b>technique</b> motivates the students to speak English or not. This research employed a quasi experimental design. The sample consisted of 20 students of PIA Monginsidi Makassar in academic year 2013 / 2014. There were 10 students in power speaking one as the experimental group and 10 students in power speaking one as the control group. The research data were collected by using three kinds of instrument: speaking test for the students’ speaking performance, and motivation scale and interview for the measurement of the students’ motivation. The data on the students’ speaking performance dealing with the three criteria in assessing speaking test namely accuracy, fluency and comprehensibility were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics in terms of SPSS 17. 00, and the data on the students’ motivation were analyzed by using Likert scale while data from students’ interviews were analyzed descriptively. The results of the research indicated that (1) the implementation of <b>shadowing</b> <b>technique</b> improved the students’ speaking performance in terms of accuracy, fluency and comprehensibility, and (2) the implementation of <b>shadowing</b> <b>technique</b> motivated the students to speak English. The improvement of the students’ speaking performance proved by the mean score of the students’ pre-test to post-test {{in the experimental group}} using <b>shadowing</b> <b>technique</b> was 58. 32 to 79. 42 and the mean score of the students’ pre-test to post-test in the control group using teacher-based technique was 58. 88 to 64. 99. It means that there was higher improvement in the experimental group than the control group if it was compared with the result score in pre-test and post-test both of the groups (79. 42 > 64. 99). The students’ motivation was proved by the mean score 84. 70 and it was classified as high motivation. It was concluded that the implementation of <b>shadowing</b> <b>technique</b> was effective to be implemented in improving the students’ speaking performance, and <b>shadowing</b> <b>technique</b> motivated the students to speak English.

But integration of robust <b>shadow</b> <b>shadowing</b> <b>techniques</b> in real-time rendering {{is not an}} easy task. In this course on how shadows are incorporated in real-time rendering, attendees learn basic <b>shadowing</b> <b>techniques</b> and more advanced techniques that exploit new features of graphics hardware. The course begins with <b>shadowing</b> <b>techniques</b> using <b>shadow</b> maps. After an introduction to shadow maps and general improvements of this technique (filtering, depth bias, omnidirectional lights, etc.), the first section describes two methods for reducing sampling artifacts: perspective shadow maps and silhouette maps. Both techniques can significantly improve shadow quality, but they require careful implementation. The course continues with extensions of the shadow mapping method that allow soft shadows from linear and area light sources. The second part of the course discusses recent advances in efficient and robust implementation of shadow volumes on graphics hardware and then shows how shadow volumes can be extended to generate accurate soft shadows from area lights. Finally, the course summarizes real-time shadowing from full lighting environments using the technique of precomputed radiance transfer. The course explains the differences among these algorithms and their strengths and weaknesses. Implementation details, often omitted in technical papers, are provided. And throughout the course, the tradeoffs between quality and performance are illustrated for the different techniques...|$|R

40|$|A {{real-time}} self-shadowing {{technique is}} described. State {{of the art}} <b>shadowing</b> <b>techniques</b> that utilize modern hardware often require multiple rendering passes and introduce rendering artifacts. Combining separate ideas from earlier techniques which project geometry onto a plane and project imagery onto an object results in a new real-time technique for self-shadowing. This technique allows an artist to construct occluder textures and assign them to shadow planes for a self-shadowed model. Utilizing a graphics processing unit (GPU), a vertex program computes shadowing coordinates in real-time, while a fragment program applies the shading and shadowing in a single rendering pass. The methodology used to create shadow planes and write the vertex and fragment programs is given, {{as well as the}} relation to the previous work. This work includes implementing this technique, applying it to a small set of test models, describing the types of models for which the technique is well suited, as well as those for which it is not well suited, and comparing the technique??????s performance and image quality to other state of the art <b>shadowing</b> <b>techniques.</b> This technique performs as well as other real-time techniques and can reduce rendering artifacts in certain circumstances...|$|R
