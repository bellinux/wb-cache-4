2500|$|Styling {{changes for}} 1938 were modest, with a longer hood {{extending}} to a now nearly vertical grill, taller bumper guards and redesigned hubcaps, {{but the effect}} was striking. Important changes were made to both engine and chassis. The ride was improved by replacing the rear leaf springs with coil springs, supported by double-acting shock absorbers that were some four {{times the size of}} any others on the market. The frame <b>X-member</b> was changed from I-beam to channel construction and all wood structural elements were replaced with steel.

50|$|In 1996, {{the band}} teamed with manager Jim Hayek {{to record their}} second LP Icon Jungle in Miami, Florida. Hayek {{approached}} Warped Tour founder Kevin Lyman with the band's proposal for an Independent Artist Stage and sponsor area known as the Surf Compound. The band went on to manage, produce and perform on this independent stage throughout the 1996 tour. That year, the stage notoriously showcased the talents of several notable underground bands such as The Tom Curren Band, Donovan Frankenreiter's Sunchild, Mark McGrath's Sugar Ray, Peter King, and the <b>X-Members</b> featuring Ray Bones of the famous Bones Brigade skate posse.|$|R

5000|$|In Australia the Mainline {{name was}} applied to a locally {{developed}} 2-door coupé utility version of the Ford Customline sedan from 1952. The Mainline utilized an imported Ford V8 convertible chassis [...] with the large <b>X-member</b> for additional load carrying strength. It sold alongside the Australian built Customline sedan, with both given yearly updates until production ceased in 1959. [...] The coupe utility slot in Ford Australia's lineup was filled by the first Ford Falcon utility the following year. The Mainline Utility was powered by an Australian produced version of the Ford side-valve V8 engine [...] until {{the introduction of the}} OHV V8 in the redesigned 1955 series.|$|E

50|$|The Long And The Short Of It is {{the second}} EP {{released}} by the punk rock band Pulley in June 28, 2011. The physical EP and 7 inch vinyl record was released by Edmonton's When's Lunch Records; digital distribution was managed by Pulley's own label, <b>X-Members</b> Records. The album {{and all of its}} information (including cover art, track list and release date) were announced on Pulley's Facebook page on April 4, 2011. Matt Hyde, who produced Matters in 2004 and Time-Insensitive Material in 2009 for the band, produced this new EP. An old friend of the band, Brian Walsby (Melvins, 7Seconds, Flipside, Maximum Rock & Roll, etc.), made the cover illustration.|$|R
50|$|The Sisterhood commences a {{surprise}} {{raid on the}} X-Men's base, quickly neutralizing several of the main <b>X-members.</b> Recovering from the initial attacks, the X-Men force the Sisterhood (now including a brainwashed Psylocke) to retreat. But the battle was only a distraction, as the real purpose was for Madelyne to locate Jean Grey's gravesite. (As Madelyne's own body had been cremated after her suicide, Grey's seemed the only option available to her.) At Jean's grave, Madelyne attempts to repeat the ritual with her corpse. However, Cyclops had correctly guessed Madelyne’s goal and had arranged for Grey's body to be replaced with another, which Madelyne only learned after it was too late. With the body unsuitable for containing her vast psionic energies, Madelyne disappeared to an unknown fate.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band was}} formed upon vocalist Scott Radinsky's {{departure}} from Ten Foot Pole, {{brought about by}} that band's desire for a singer with a full-time focus on music (Radinsky was also a major-league relief pitcher and has played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, among others). Pulley's initial lineup included Strung Out drummer Jordan Burns, guitarist Jim Cherry ( [...] former bassist of Strung Out and, later, Zero Down), guitarist Mike Harder, and former Face to Face bassist Matt Riddle. Pulley's debut album, Esteem Driven Engine, was released in 1996 by Epitaph Records. Riddle later joined No Use for a Name full-time {{and was replaced by}} Tyler Rebbe. Follow-ups included 60 Cycle Hum (1997), @ !* (1999), Together Again for the First Time (2001), and Matters (2004). On July 30, 2008, Pulley announced a follow up EP to Matters, entitled Time-Insensitive Material which was released on March 24, 2009 on the band's own label, <b>X-Members.</b>|$|R
40|$|Literature is human’s expression. It {{is divided}} into drama, novel, poem, and also song. Song {{is one of the}} {{literary}} works that has beautiful words on it like figurative language, diction, and also imagery. The problems of this study are analyzing the detailed, general meaning, and also the messages of Spice Girls’ song “Goodbye”. This study used the descriptive qualitative because this research started with collecting reviewing research literature to provide the data. This research used objective approach because that is the story of Spice Girls. Thus, the object of this study was Spice Girls’ song lyrics “Goodbye” in the form of lines and sentences. The detailed meaning of the song lyrics “Goodbye” tells about the parting between Spice Girls and <b>X-member</b> of Spice Girls “Gerry Haliwell”. She leaves Spice Girls because she wants to find out her own way to be a solo career. Although they are not together anymore but Spice Girls still love her and Gerry will always be in their heart. The song also describes about their togetherness in the past both in joy and sorrow. However, although they are not together anymore but Spice Girls will always help and support Gerry’s way. The general meaning of the song tells about the parting between Spice Girls and <b>X-member</b> of Spice Girls “Gerry Haliwell”. She has gone to leave them to find out her own way because she wants to be a solo career. The messages of the song lyrics “Goodbye” reminds us not to dissolve ourselves into the pain and never regret the parting because nothing is immortal in this life. Meeting and parting, joy and sorrow are the variation of this life and believe that inside the pain there must be lessons we can get...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe basic {{chromosome}} {{complement of}} the Egyptian male locust, Anacridium aegyptium; collected from Giza Governorate, Egypt, is 2 N= 22 +XO. All autosomes and sex chromosome are telocentric. The autosomes {{can be divided}} into three size-groups; three long (L 1 –L 3), five medium (M 4 –M 8) and three short chromosomes (S 9 –S 11). The <b>X-member</b> is the longest member of all chromosomes. An extra telocentric B-chromosome was detected in two males of the collected locusts, nearly equal in size with S 10 -member and thus the chromosome complement of these males is 2 N= 22 +XO+B. The origin of this extra member is discussed through its behaviour through meiosis that studied. The B-chromosome was frequently observed neighbouring the X-chromosome through most of the meiotic stages and this behaviour reinforces the present suggested hypothesis that B-chromosome was originated from X-chromosome...|$|E
40|$|We {{report and}} provide {{justification}} for the consistently observed four experimental facts of the mass spectrometric data of carbon cluster emission from the low-energy Cs irradiated single-walled carbon nanotubes. Firstly, the diatomic carbon C(2) is the most abundant sputtered species for Cs+ in the energy range 0. 2 keV to 2. 0 keV. Secondly, monatomic carbon C(1) is emitted with the least sputtering yield. Thirdly, at low cesium energies i the emitted species are C(2), C(3) and C(4). Lastly, as the irradiating Cs+ energy increases, the normalized yield of atomic carbon monotonically increases while clusters show gradual decrease and saturation. Sputtering of clusters is proved here {{to be due to}} thermal spikes. Binary collision cascade theory does not explain cluster sputtering. A statistical thermal model is developed to explain the experimentally observed data. The probability of a cluster C(x) to be emitted is shown to be proportional to that for the creation of an <b>x-member</b> vacancy with formation energy E at temperature T as {exp(E/kT) + 1 }^(- 1). The energies of formation of single and double vacancies from DFT calculations and the ratio of normalized experimental yields have been used to estimate spike temperature. We show that by invoking thermal spikes, cluster emission from, and the multiple vacancy generation in, the Cs+-irradiated SWCNTs can be explained. We also suggest modifications to Monte Carlo type calculations of sputtering. Comment: 15 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
