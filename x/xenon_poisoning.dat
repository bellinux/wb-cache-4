50|$|If {{sufficient}} reactivity {{control authority}} is available, the reactor can be restarted, but a xenon burn-out transient {{must be carefully}} managed. As the control rods are extracted and criticality is reached, neutron flux increases many orders of magnitude and the 135Xe begins to absorb neutrons and be transmuted to 136Xe. The reactor burns off the nuclear poison. As this happens, the reactivity and neutron flux increases, and the control rods must be gradually reinserted to counter the loss of neutron absorption by the 135Xe. Otherwise, the reactor neutron flux will continue to increase, burning off even more <b>xenon</b> <b>poison,</b> on a path to runaway criticality. The time constant for this burn-off transient depends on the reactor design, power level history of the reactor {{for the past several}} days, and the new power setting. For a typical step up from 50% power to 100% power, 135Xe concentration falls for about 3 hours.|$|R
50|$|Plasma layers around {{aircraft}} {{have been}} considered for purposes other than stealth. There are many research papers {{on the use of}} plasma to reduce aerodynamic drag. In particular, electrohydrodynamic coupling can be used to accelerate air flow near an aerodynamic surface. One paper considers the use of a plasma panel for boundary layer control on a wing in a low-speed wind tunnel. This demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} produce a plasma on the skin of an aircraft. Radioactive <b>Xenon</b> nuclear <b>poison</b> or Polonium isotopes when successfully suspended in generated plasma layers or doped into vehicle hulls, may be utilized in order for a reduction in radar cross-section by generating a plasma layer on the surface. If tunable this could shield against HMP/EMP and HERF weaponry or act as optical radiation pressure actuators.|$|R
50|$|The {{increase}} in the 135Xe concentration during lowering of the reactor power can lower the reactivity enough to effectively shut down the reactor. As {{there are not enough}} neutrons to offset their absorption by 135Xe, nor to burn the built-up xenon, the reactor has to be kept in shutdown state for 1-2 days until enough of the 135Xe decays. The inability of the reactor to be restarted in such state is called xenon precluded start up or dropping into an iodine pit; the duration of this situation is known as <b>xenon</b> dead time, <b>poison</b> outage, or iodine pit depth. Due to the risk of such situations, in the early Soviet nuclear industry, many servicing operations were performed on running reactors, as downtimes longer than an hour led to xenon buildup that could keep the reactor offline for significant time, lower the production of valuable weapon 239Pu, and cause an investigation by a committee and punishment of the operators.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{types of}} {{reactors}} {{are sensitive to}} a process variously known as <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning,</b> or the iodine pit. The common fission product Xenon-135 produced in the fission process acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to destroy it by neutron absorption {{as fast as it}} is produced. Fission also produces iodine-135, which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult for a day or two, as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the [...] "iodine pit." [...] If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a [...] "xenon burnoff (power) transient".

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] As one of {{the most}} {{commonly}} used materials, magnesium oxide (also known as magnesia or MgO) has many applications in the modern world because it is light, chemically stable, and free of toxic impurities. In order to remove the remaining impurities that may affect its physical properties, a classic purification process, known as the Pattinson process, was investigated to purify low purity magnesia. The variations in the physical properties of magnesia powder purified by this process, followed by calcination at varying temperatures and times, were examined by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). The highly-purified magnesia was then tested as a gas sorbent for its high adsorption capacity, mechanical strength, and low-cost regenerability. The magnesia sorbent was found to be capable of removing neutral substances like N_ 2 and I_ 2, as confirmed using Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA). Purity tests show that different purification conditions only lead to different solubility, while the calcination conditions determine its iodine capacity values. However, the magnesia is incapable of adsorbing xenon, and it was minimally adsorbent of ? CO?_ 2, without the addition of a reaction promoter. The iodine adsorption capability gives another potential application in the field of nuclear reactor design. Due to magnesia helping regulate the location of iodine, the precursor of a well-known neutron <b>poison,</b> <b>xenon,</b> it may help diminish the xenon oscillation and shorten the shutdown time for nuclear reactors. By controlling the preparation conditions, magnesia can become a promising material for iodine contamination removal...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{thrusters}} use hollow cathodes as {{the electron}} source for generating the plasma discharge and for beam neutralization. These cathodes contain porous tungsten emitters impregnated with BaO material {{to achieve a}} lower surface work function and are operated with xenon propellant. Oxygen contaminants in the <b>xenon</b> plasma can <b>poison</b> the emitter surface, resulting in a higher work function and increased operating temperature. This could lead directly to cathode failure by preventing discharge ignition or could accelerate evaporation of the BaO material. Exposures over hundreds of hours to very high levels of oxygen can result in increased temperatures, oxidation of the tungsten substrate, {{and the formation of}} surface layers of barium tungstates. In this work, we present results of a cathode test in which impregnated tungsten and tungsten-iridium emitters were operated with 100 ppm of oxygen in the xenon plasma for several hundred hours. The chemical and morphological changes were studied using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and laser profilometry. The results provide strong evidence that high concentrations of oxygen accelerate the formation of tungstate layers in both types of emitters, a phenomenon not inherent to normal cathode operation. Deposits of pure tungsten were observed on the W-Ir emitter, indicating that tungsten is preferentially removed from the surface and transported in the insert plasma. A W-Ir cathode surface will therefore evolve to a pure W composition, eliminating the work function benefit of W-Ir. However, the W-Ir emitter exhibited less erosion and redeposition at the upstream end than the pure W emitter...|$|R

50|$|Failing to {{anticipate}} and manage <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning</b> and {{compensate for the}} subsequent burn-off properly was a contributing factor to the Chernobyl disaster; during a run-down to a lower power, a combination of operator error and xenon nuclear poisoning caused the reactor thermal power to fall to near-shutdown levels. The crew's resulting efforts to restore power, including the manual withdrawal of control rods not under the SKALA computer's automated control, placed the reactor in a highly unsafe configuration. A failed SCRAM procedure, resulting in the control rods being jammed {{at a level that}} actually increased reactivity, caused a thermal transient and a steam explosion that tore the reactor apart.|$|E
50|$|Because 135Xe is {{a potent}} nuclear poison with a large cross section for neutron absorption, the buildup of 135Xe in the fuel inside a power reactor can lower the {{reactivity}} greatly. If a power reactor is shut down or left running at a low power level, then large amounts of 135Xe can build up through decay of 135I. When the reactor is restarted or the low power level is increased significantly, 135Xe will be quickly consumed through neutron capture reactions and the reactivity of the core will increase. Under some circumstances, control systems {{may not be able}} to respond quickly enough to manage an abrupt reactivity increase as the built-up 135Xe burns off. It is thought that <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning</b> was one of the factors which led to the power surge which damaged the Chernobyl reactor core.|$|E
50|$|Xenon-135 in {{particular}} tremendously affects {{the operation of}} a nuclear reactor because it's the most powerful known neutron poison. The inability of a reactor to be restarted due to the buildup of xenon-135 (reaches a maximum after about 10 hours) is {{sometimes referred to as}} xenon precluded start-up. The period of time in which the reactor is unable to override the effects of xenon-135 is called the xenon dead time or poison outage. During periods of steady state operation, at a constant neutron flux level, the xenon-135 concentration builds up to its equilibrium value for that reactor power in about 40 to 50 hours. When the reactor power is increased, xenon-135 concentration initially decreases because the burn up is increased at the new, higher power level. Thus, the dynamics of <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning</b> are important for the stability of the flux pattern and geometrical power distribution, especially in physically large reactors.|$|E

50|$|Anatoly Dyatlov, {{the deputy}} chief engineer, {{supervised}} the test. At the moment reactor power slipped to 30MW, he insisted the operators continue the test. He overrode Akimov's and Toptunov's objections, threatening to hand the shift to Tregub (the previous shift operator who had remained on-site), intimidating them into attempting to increase the reactor power. During {{this period of time}} the reactor protection system was vetoed to prevent automatic shutdown of the reactor. The power stabilized at 200MW at around 1:00 am and did not rise further, due to continued <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning</b> of the core. Later the test was commenced, then the reactor showed power excursion and was scrammed. As the control rods dropped into the core, their design (which incorporated a graphite plug at the bottom of each rod) introduced additional moderation and hence reactivity into the reactor system. The explosion occurred as the control rods were falling, and the subsequent damage prevented insertion into the reactor. Dyatlov ordered reactor cooling with emergency speed, assuming the reactor was intact and the explosion had been caused by hydrogen accumulating in the emergency tank of the safety control system. Other employees went to the control room, reporting damage. Dyatlov went to the backup control room, pressing the AZ-5 button there and disconnecting power to the control rod servodrives; despite seeing the graphite blocks scattered on the ground outside the plant, he still believed the reactor was intact. Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov returned to report the reactor damage they had seen, but Dyatlov insisted what they had seen was the results of an explosion of the emergency tank, claiming the explosion of the 110 m³ tank at Level +71 was sufficient to destroy the central hall roof. Dyatlov reported his assumptions as reality to Bryukhanov and Fomin, the higher-level managers. In the corridor, he met Genrikh and Kurguz and sent them to the medical station. He ran to the control room of Block 3, ordered Bagdasarov to shut down Reactor 3, then returned to control room 4 and ordered Akimov to call the daytime shift and get people to the affected unit; namely Lelechenko, whose crew had to remove hydrogen from the Generator 8 electrolyzer. At 2:00, Dyatlov ordered Akimov to feed water to the reactor, and together with Gorbachenko went to survey the plant from the outside. Despite seeing the fuel and graphite scattered around, he still believed the reactor was intact. They then returned to the control room. At 5:00 am, he got sick and together with Gorbachenko went to the medical unit. Fomin replaced him at his post with Sitnikov.|$|E

However, during rapid load-following events, traditional UOX cores could be restricted by the volatile oscillation of the power distribution. Therefore, a conceptual study on stability properties of Th-MOX PWR concerning axial offset power excursion during load-following events are investigated and discussed. The study is performed in SIMULATE- 3 for a realistic PWR core (Ringhals- 3) {{at the end of}} cycle, where the largest amplitude of the axial offset oscillations is expected.

40|$|SLOWPOKE- 2 (LEU core) is a pool-type {{nuclear reactor}} {{with a maximum}} nominal thermal power of 20 kW.

The key safety features built into the reactor design are the strictly limited amount of excess reactivity and the negative reactivity feedback characteristics, which provide a demonstrably safe self-limiting power excursion response to large reactivity insertions. However, the limited amount of excess reactivity also limits continuous prolonged reactor operation at full power. With a 4 mk excess reactivity, the reactor can operate for about one day at full power, 20 kW, before criticality is lost due to temperature effects and <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning.</b> A new safety concept is proposed in this paper that enables the continuous operation to a few months by increasing the excess reactivity from 4 mk to 8 mk.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Similarly to {{but quite}} {{different}} from the <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning</b> effects resulting from fission-produced iodine during restart-up process of a fission reactor, we introduce a complete new concept of the tritium well depth and tritium well time in fusion energy research area. To show what the least required amount of tritium storage is used to start up a fusion reactor and how long a time the fusion reactor needs to be operated for achieving the tritium break-even during the initial start-up phase due to the finite tritium breeding time that is dependent on the tritium breeder, specific structure of breeding zone, layout of coolant flow pipes, tritium recovery scheme and extraction process, the tritium retention of reactor components, unrecoverable tritium fraction in breeder, leakage to the inertial gas container, and the natural decay etc, we describe this new phenomenon and answer this problem by setting up and by solving a set of equations, which express a dynamic subsystem model of the tritium inventory evolution in a fusion experimental breeder (FEB). Two different simulation models give almost the same results, It is found the tritium well depth is about 317 - 319 g and tritium well time is approximately 240 full power days for reference case of the FEB designed detail configuration and it is also found that after one-year operation the tritium storage reaches 1. 18 kg that is more than the least required amount of tritium storage to start up three of FEB-like fusion reactors...|$|E
40|$|The nuclear {{reactors}} {{used by the}} U. S. Navy for submarine propulsion are currently fueled by highly enriched uranium (HEU), but HEU brings administrative and political challenges. This issue has been studied by the Navy before, and promising new fuel technology developments, combined with new motivations, warrant {{a fresh look at}} low enriched uranium (LEU). Evidence suggests that the mission space of the submarine force might be changing in such a way to relax previous constraints that made LEU cores more challenging. Estimates show that high density fuels can produce LEU core sizes that are comparable to HEU core sizes. One of the difficult constraints will be meeting the reactivity requirements to overcome <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning</b> throughout the lifetime of the core, especially at higher burnups, where LEU cores exhibit different reactivity behavior. A new LEU design should not prove prohibitive from a thermal hydraulic perspective, unless increases in core volume or fuel-to-moderator ratio require a significant increase in pumping power. LEU designs that require increases in weight or size of the reactor compartment are not outright infeasible, and alterations to the reactor compartment might provide a necessary recovery of weight and volume. The concept of LEU redesigns resulting in unattractively large new cores that fail to meet performance standards is a thing of the past. A major investigation of advanced naval reactor technology and LEU designs should be made, and a thorough analysis should be conducted soon. by Cameron Liam McCord. Thesis: S.

40|$|Thorium is {{an element}} for {{possible}} use as nuclear fuel, because of the fertile property of Th- 232, which could convert into U- 233 after neutron capture and beta decays. However, thorium based fuels have not been successfully implemented, {{because of the high}} cost and the higher complexity compared with once-through uranium fuel. Therefore, the focus of this thesis is on thorium for use in traditional light water reactors for improving core characteristics by: achieving a more homogenous power distribution to provide larger thermal margins, high plutonium incineration efficiency to reduce the plutonium stockpile, and improved load-following capacity. The chosen methodology is similar to the one commonly used in the industry. The model is based on Ringhals- 3 PWR, and Studsvik Scandpower Ltd. codes are used to calculate the neutronics of the nuclear fuel and the reactor cores. The thesis is divided into three parts. The first part addresses the fertile absorber concept, which is achieved by adding small amounts of thorium in traditional uranium fuel pellets to improve the thermal margins. The benefits are a reduced need of traditional burnable absorbers, and a slower decrease of reactivity as function of burnup. The second part describes the use of thorium-plutonium mixed oxide fuel to reduce the plutonium stockpile, since thorium barely generates any new plutonium compared with uranium-plutonium mixed oxide fuel. However, the thorium-plutonium mixed oxide cores alter the core behavior compared with the traditional uranium core such as stronger Doppler feedback and lower fraction of delayed neutrons, which require boron (B- 10) enrichment, and increased number of control rods with improved efficiency. The third part of the thesis is focusing on improved load-following capacity by thorium-containing fuel. Th- 232 has about three times higher thermal neutron absorption cross section compared with U- 238, which hardens the neutron spectrum. This leads to less sensitivity to neutron spectrum changes, lower <b>xenon</b> <b>poisoning,</b> and lower axial power fluctuations upon load changes. Therefore, thorium-containing fuel improve the load-following capacity, and could be a positive complement to intermittent power sources, such as solar or wind power...|$|E
