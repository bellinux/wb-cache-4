There are many ongoing efforts {{to determine the}} molecular mechanisms of TCDD-mediated neurotoxicity, the signaling pathways involved and its molecular targets in neurons. In this work, we have used SHSY 5 Y human neuroblastoma cells to characterize the TCDD-induced toxicity. TCDD produces a loss of viability linked to an increased caspase- 3 activity, PARP- 1 fragmentation, DNA laddering, nuclear fragmentation and hypodiploid (apoptotic) DNA content, {{in a similar way}} than staurosporine, a prototypical molecule of apoptosis induction. In addition, TCDD produces a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase of intracellular calcium concentration (P &# 60;  0. 05). Finally, based on the high lipophilic properties of the dioxin, we test the TCDD effect on the membrane integrity using sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles as a model. TCDD produces calcium efflux through the membrane and an anisotropy decrease (P &# 60;  0. 05) that reflects an increase in membrane fluidity. Altogether these results support the hypothesis that TCDD toxicity in SHSY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells provokes the disruption of calcium homeostasis, probably affecting membrane structural integrity, leading to an apoptotic process...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was created to}} examine how xenobiotic ligands that bind to nuclear receptor proteins may affect transcriptional activation of hormone-regulated genes. The model included binding of the natural ligand (e. g. hormone) and xenobiotic ligands to the receptor, binding of the liganded receptor to receptor-specific DNA response sequences, binding of co-activator or co-repressor proteins (Rp) to the resulting complex, and the consequent transcriptional rate relative {{to that in the}} absence of the <b>xenobiotic</b> <b>agent.</b> The model predicted that the xenobiotic could act as a pure agonist, a pure antagonist, or a mixed agonist whose dose–response curve exhibits a local maximum. The response to the agent depends on the affinity of the liganded receptor–DNA complex for binding additional transcription factors (e. g. co-activator proteins). An inverted U-shaped dose–response occurred when basal levels of the natural ligand did not saturate receptor binding sites and the affinity for co-activator is weaker when the xenobiotic ligand is bound to the receptor than when the endogenous ligand is bound. The dose–response curve shape was not dependent on the affinity of the receptor for the xenobiotic agent; alteration of this value merely shifted the curve along the concentration axis. The amount of receptor, the density of DNA response sequences, and the affinity of the DNA-bound receptor for Rp determine the amplitude of the computed response with little overall change in curve shape. This model indicates that a non-monotonic dose–response is a plausible outcome for xenobiotic agents that activate nuclear receptors in the same manner as natural ligands...|$|E

Liver cells (90 mg/ml) were incubated in sealed flasks (6 ml cell suspension each) for 0, 5, 10 and 20 min after the addition of 25, 50 or 200 microl CCl(4) in the central well. 50 ml of a 6 mg/ml liver cell suspension were poured in a 120 cm(2) Petri dish and the sediment liver cell monolayer was exposed to UVB radiation for 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 min. At the given time, cells were taken and D was extracted and assayed by the HPLC procedure. D levels were remarkably higher in older than in younger cells as expected (P < 0. 001). Treatment with CCl(4) and UVB caused a highly significant decrease in D (P < 0. 001) whose percentage was larger in younger than in older cells. The conclusions are that free-radicals generated either by chemical or by physical agents cause a very rapid depletion of D in liver cells, and that the effect of the free radical attack on D decomposition may be lower percentage wise in older than in younger cells, which might account at least in part for the accumulation of D in older tissues...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Biochemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Neural tube defects (NTD) are a {{group of}} folate-responsive {{congenital}} defects that occur relatively frequently in humans. NTD display a multi-factorial aetiology, resulting from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors (i. e. dietary folate and/or vitamin B 12 deficiency, teratogenic xenobiotics, etc.). β-Hydroxynorvaline (HNV) is a proven toxic, non-protein amino acid (<b>xenobiotic</b> <b>agent),</b> structurally related to L-threonine and L-serine and able to substitute L-threonine in the primary structure of proteins. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the teratogenic potential of HNV in the chicken embryo and Hanover NMRl mouse embryo models and to elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms involved in the aetiology of NTD. HNV was dosed to chicken embryos (in ovo), 24 h post incubation (p. i.) at 37. 8 °C ± 0. 5 °C. Controls received a sterile saline solution. Chicken embryos were removed 12 days p. i., weighed, fixed in Allen's solution and investigated stereo-microscopically to assess the incidence and nature of dysmorphogenic events (i. e. NTD). Body, toe and beak lengths of the chicken embryos were measured. Chicken embryo fibroblasts were cultured and used to measure the effect of HNV on the biosynthesis of DNA in fibroblasts. Pregnant Hannover NMRl female mice were dosed with HNV or a saline solution (per os) on days 7 - 9 post coitus (p. c.). Following the last dose of HNV on day 9, the pregnant mice were placed in metabolic cages for 24 h to collect urine samples. Urinary organic acids (GC-MS), acylcarnitines and amino acids (ESI-MSMS) were quantitatively and qualitatively determined to assess the catabolic breakdown of H NV and its effects on vital metabolic processes, such as amino acid catabolism and the P-oxidation of fatty acids. Control and HNV exposed mouse embryos were removed on days 10 or 18 post coitus (p. c.). Embryos, removed from each individual mother on day 10 were pooled and either immediately used to assess the catalytic activity of the glycine cleavage system (GCS), or stored at - 75 °C until the catalytic activities of cytosolic (cSHMT), mitochondria 1 serine hydroxymethyltransferase (mSHMT) and citrate synthase (CS) could be assayed. Mouse embryos removed on day 18 p. c., weighed and stereo-microscopically investigated to assess the incidence and nature of dysmorphogenic events. Bio-indicators of the effect of HNV on the flow of one-carbon units through the folate and remethylation cycles (i. e. [3 H]-thyrnidine incorporation, DNA methylation and synthesis, polyamine synthesis, carnitine synthesis, etc.) were determined in the liver tissues of pregnant females and in pooled batches of whole embryos. HNV proved to be embryotoxic and displayed the capacity to induce a variety of congenital defects, including NTD, in both the chicken and mouse embryo models. The incidence of NTD in both models proved to be dose-dependent. Selected stereoisomers of HNV were rapidly catabolised and the main HNV derived metabolite in the urines of HNV treated pregnant mice, was identified as 2, 3 - dihydroxypentanoic acid (DHPA; GC-MS). The structure of DHPA was confirmed by chemical synthesis and subsequent GC-MS, NMR (13 c-NMR, 1 H-NMR, HETCOR and COSY) spectroscopy and IR spectrometry. HNV altered the flow of one-carbon units through the folate and remethylation cycles, causing a decrease in DNA synthesis, DNA methylation, polyarnine biosynthesis, carnitine and trimethyllysine synthesis. Free carnitine stores in HNV treated pregnant mice appeared to be depleted, probably due to a combined effect of the detoxification of vast amounts of accumulated metabolites, generated as a result of HNV toxicosis and decreased carnitine biosynthesis. HNV also appeared to have altered serinelglycine interconversion, due to an inhibition of cSHMT and to a lesser degree the inhibition of GCS. Organic acid profiles of urine samples, collected from HNV treated pregnant mice, suggested that HNV had induced a general ketothiolase defect in pregnant females by inhibiting the P-oxidation of fatty acids, isoleucine catabolism and ketone body utilisation. HNV affected the hornocysteine to cysteine transulffuration by acting as a substrate for CBS, culminating in the biosynthesis of Sethylcysteine (GC-MS). The presence of 3 -ethylcysteine in the urines of HNV treated pregnant mice was confirmed by GC-MS. following its in vitro synthesis, employing a reaction system containing mouse liver hornogenate, homocysteine, HNV and pyridoxal- 5 - phosphate. In conclusion, HNV can apparently cause multiple metabolic perturbations in pregnant mice and their developing embryos. One-carbon flux, energy metabolism {{and a number of other}} vital biochemical processes can be adversely affected, resulting in a disturbance of normal embryonic development (i. e. proper closure of the neural tube) and subsequent dysmorphogenesis in developing embryos.

The usefulness of these tests in epidemiologic studies of environmental effects on reproductive health has yet to be studied. To do so, the battery must be standardized for pregnant women, and test results must be correlated with measured adverse reproductive outcomes, such as gestational length and birthweight.

Numerous mechanisms, based on (italic) in vitro(/italic) evidence and animal models, {{have been proposed}} to explain how xenobiotics induce or accelerate autoimmunity. The majority of these {{can be divided into}} three general categories. The first is those inhibiting the processes involved in establishing tolerance by deletion. Inhibiting deletion can result in the release of newly generated autoreactive cells into the periphery. The second mechanism is the modification of gene expression in the cells participating in the immune response, permitting lymphocytes to respond to signals normally insufficient to initiate a response or allowing the antigen-presenting cells to abnormally stimulate a response. Abnormal gene expression can thus disrupt tolerance maintained by suppression or anergy, permitting activation of autoreactive cells. The third is the modification of self-molecules such that they are recognized by the immune system as foreign. Examples illustrating these concepts are presented, and related mechanisms that have the potential to similarly affect the immune system are noted. Some mechanisms appear to be common to a variety of agents, and different mechanisms appear to produce similar diseases. However, evidence that any of these mechanisms are actually responsible for xenobiotic-induced human autoimmune disease is still largely lacking, and the potential for numerous and as yet unidentified mechanisms also exists...|$|R
40|$|The {{science of}} {{toxicology}} is devoted, in large part, to understanding mechanisms of toxicity {{so that we}} can more accurately assess the risk posed by exposure to <b>xenobiotic</b> <b>agents</b> and, perhaps, intervene in the toxicologic process to mitigate harm. Dioxin-like chemicals continue to be of great concern as environmental toxicants. About 30 years ago the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) was discovered as a specific binding site for 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. This giant step led to our current view that essentially all toxic effects of dioxins are AHR-mediated. The AHR serves as the archetype for understanding toxicity mediated by other soluble receptors. The fact that toxicity is receptor-mediated has important implications, especially for dose-response relationships. In laboratory animals genetic differences in AHR gene structure lead to profound differences in responsiveness to dioxin-like chemicals. Humans, however, exhibit relatively few AHR polymorphisms and these seem to exert only modest effects on downstream events. Dioxin toxicity is fundamentally due to AHR-mediated dysregulation of gene expression. Our current challenging goal is to determine which dysregulated genes underlie specific forms of dioxin toxicity. Mapping AHR-mediated gene expression in a variety of biological systems may help explain why dramatic differences in susceptibility to dioxin toxicity exist among laboratory species and why humans appear to be relatively resistant to adverse effects of dioxins...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies using}} microarrays {{have shown that}} changes in gene {{expression}} provide information about the mechanism of toxicity induced by <b>xenobiotic</b> <b>agents.</b> Nevertheless, {{the issue of whether}} gene expression profiles are reproducible across different laboratories remains to be determined. To address this question, several members of the Hepatotoxicity Working Group of the International Life Sciences Institute Health and Environmental Sciences Institute evaluated the liver gene expression profiles of rats treated with methapyrilene (MP). Animals were treated at one facility, and RNA was distributed to five different sites for gene expression analysis. A preliminary evaluation of the number of modulated genes uncovered striking differences between the five different sites. However, additional data analysis demonstrated that these differences had an effect on the absolute gene expression results but not on the outcome of the study. For all users, unsupervised algorithms showed that gene expression allows the distinction of the high dose of MP from controls and low dose. In addition, the use of a supervised analysis method (support vector machines) made it possible to correctly classify samples. In conclusion, the results show that, despite some variability, robust gene expression changes were consistent between sites. In addition, key expression changes related to the mechanism of MP-induced hepatotoxicity were identified. These results provide critical information regarding the consistency of microarray results across different laboratories and shed light on the strengths and limitations of expression profiling in drug safety analysis...|$|R
40|$|Eighty {{cormorants}} {{from the}} area of Ostroda and Mrągowo were used for this study. The analyses were carried out between 1993 - 1996. Each year 10 two-year-old birds were shot (5 females and 5 males) in two nesting grounds. On average, the amount of concentrated DDT in cormorant liver fat was 4. 914 mg/kg and y-HCH was 0. 039 mg/kg of wet mass. The average amount of DDT in subsequent years varied and ranged from 2. 515 to 7. 252 mg/kg; however, the differences were statistically insignificant. The females accumulated higher levels of DDT than the males, on average up to 8. 796 mg/kg. The differences in DDT amounts concentrated in liver fat of both cormorant groups in different years appeared to be insignificant. Liver concentrations of γ-HCH in the observed period most frequently showed tendency to increase, from the level of 0. 012 in 1993 to 0. 106 mg/kg in 1995. This value decreased in 1996 to 0. 003 mg/kg. Higher amounts of γ-HCH in liver fat were recorded in birds originating form the Mrągowo area, excluding the individuals shot in 1995. It was shown that the males accumulated higher levels of γ-HCH in their livers than the females (years 1993, 1994 and 1996). The presented study shows the continuous threat of the analyzed <b>xenobiotic</b> <b>agents</b> to water fowl {{and the need for}} continuous monitoring of water fowl in respect of their intoxication by DDT and HCH...|$|R
40|$|Skin is {{the largest}} body organ that serves as an {{important}} environmental interface providing a protective envelope that is crucial for homeostasis. On the other hand, the skin is a major target for toxic insult by {{a broad spectrum of}} physical (i. e. UV radiation) and chemical (<b>xenobiotic)</b> <b>agents</b> that are capable of altering its structure and function. Many environmental pollutants are either themselves oxidants or catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly or indirectly. ROS are believed to activate proliferative and cell survival signaling that can alter apoptotic pathways that may be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of skin disorders including photosensitivity diseases and some types of cutaneous malignancy. ROS act largely by driving several important molecular pathways that play important roles in diverse pathologic processes including ischemia–reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory responses. The skin possesses an array of defense mechanisms that interact with toxicants to obviate their deleterious effect. These include non-enzymatic and enzymatic molecules that function as potent antioxidants or oxidant-degrading systems. Unfortunately, these homeostatic defenses, although highly effective, have limited capacity and can be overwhelmed thereby leading to increased ROS in the skin that can foster the development of dermatological diseases. One approach to preventing or treating these ROS-mediated disorders is based on the administration of various antioxidants in an effort to restore homeostasis. Although many antioxidants have shown substantive efficacy in cell culture systems and in animal models of oxidant injury, unequivocal confirmation of their beneficial effects in human populations has proven elusive...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} {{importance that}} myticulture is conquering in Santa Catarina State (South of Brazil) explains the crescent {{search for new}} coastal sites for farming. Physiological and biochemical studies of the mussel Perna perna {{are important to the}} establishment of methodologies for program assessment and environmental monitoring, allowing to infer about site quality and possible influences of <b>xenobiotic</b> <b>agents</b> on coastal areas. In order to evaluate effects caused by lead poisoning (1. 21 mumol. L- 1), the mussels were maintained at constant temperature (25 ºC) and fed with Chaetoceros gracilis for 15 days. The control group was acclimatized in sea water 30 ?. At the end of this period time, physiological measurements were carried out along with statistic analysis for filtration rates, lead assimilation and overall respiratory activity. The mechanism of multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) was particularly evaluated in standardized gill fragments using rhodamine B accumulation and its quantification under fluorescence optical microscopy. Regarding the control group, results had shown that the mussels maintenance in a lead-poisoned environment caused higher filtration rates (1. 04 and 2. 3 and L. h- 1. g- 1; p < 0. 05) and lower assimilation rates (71. 96 % and 54. 1 %, respectively). Also it was confirmed a lesser rhodamine B accumulation in the assays under influence of lead, suggesting that this metal induces the MXR mechanism expression in mussel P. perna. These results indicate that such physiological and biochemical alterations in the mussels can modify the energy fluxes of its metabolism, resulting in possible problems on the coastal systems used as cultivating sites...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Increasing {{evidence}} exists that heavy metals modulate T helper cell (Th) responses and thereby elicit various pathological manifestation. Interleukin (IL) - 12, a crucial innate cytokine, {{was found to}} be regulated by such <b>xenobiotic</b> <b>agents.</b> This study aimed at testing whether IL- 12 profiles may be indicative of heavy metals-induced immunomodulation. Methods Human immunocompetent cells, activated either by monoclonal antibodies or heat-killed Salmonella enterica, were cultured in the absence or presence of cadmium (Cd) acetate or mercuric (Hg) chloride. In vivo experiments were set up where BALB/c mice were exposed to sub-lethal doses of Cd or Hg salts for 3 or 5 weeks. Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT-reduction assay. Modulation of cytokine profiles was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), cytometric bead-based array (CBA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the relevance of these methods of cytokine quantification was explored. Results Modulation of IL- 12 profiles in Cd- or Hg-exposed human PBMC was dose-dependent and significantly related to IFN-γ levels {{as well as to the}} Th 1 - or Th 2 -polarized responses. Similarly, skewing the Th 1 /Th 2 ratios in vivo correlated significantly with up- or down-regulation of IL- 12 levels in both cases of investigated metals. Conclusion It can be inferred that: (i) IL- 12 profiles alone may represent a relevant indicator of heavy metal-induced immune modulation; (ii) evaluating cytokine profiles by CBA is relevant and can adequately replace other methods such as ELISA and RT-PCR in basic research as well as in immune diagnostics; and (iii) targeting IL- 12 in therapeutic approaches may be promising to modify Th 1 /Th 2 -associated immune disorders. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cytochrome P 4501 A 1 is a hepatic, microsomal membrane–bound {{enzyme that}} is highly induced by various <b>xenobiotic</b> <b>agents.</b> Two NH 2 -terminal {{truncated}} forms of this P 450, termed P 450 MT 2 a and MT 2 b, are also found localized in mitochondria from β-naphthoflavone–induced livers. In this paper, we demonstrate that P 4501 A 1 has a chimeric NH 2 -terminal signal that facilitates the targeting of the protein to both the ER and mitochondria. The NH 2 -terminal 30 –amino acid stretch of P 4501 A 1 is thought to provide signals for ER membrane insertion and also stop transfer. The present study provides evidence that a sequence motif immediately COOH-terminal (residues 33 – 44) to the transmembrane domain functions as a mitochondrial targeting signal under both in vivo and in vitro conditions, and that the positively charged residues at positions 34 and 39 are critical for mitochondrial targeting. Results suggest that 25 % of P 4501 A 1 nascent chains, which escape ER membrane insertion, are processed by a liver cytosolic endoprotease. We postulate that the NH 2 -terminal proteolytic cleavage activates a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that a portion of transiently expressed P 4501 A 1 is colocalized with the mitochondrial-specific marker protein cytochrome oxidase subunit I. The mitochondrial-associated MT 2 a and MT 2 b are localized within the inner membrane compartment, as tested by resistance to limited proteolysis in both intact mitochondria and mitoplasts. Our results therefore describe a novel mechanism whereby proteins with chimeric signal sequence are targeted to the ER {{as well as to}} the mitochondria...|$|R
