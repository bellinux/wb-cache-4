40|$|During {{the past}} couple of years, an {{analysis}} tool was developed by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) for the National Climate Assessment (NCA) program. The tool monitors and examines changes in lightning characteristics over the conterminous US (CONUS) on a continual basis. In this study, we have expanded the capability of the tool so that it can compute a new climate assessment variable that is called the Lightning NOx Indicator (LNI). Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO 2) are known to indirectly influence our climate, and lightning NOx is the most important source of NOx in the upper troposphere (particularly in the tropics). The LNI is derived using Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) data and is computed by summing up the product of <b>flash</b> area <b>x</b> <b>flash</b> brightness over all flashes that occur in a particular region and period. Therefore, it is suggested that the LNI is a proxy to lightning NOx production. Specifically, larger flash areas are consistent with longer channel length and/or more energetic channels, and hence more NOx production. Brighter flashes are consistent with more energetic channels, and hence more NOx production. The location of the flash within the thundercloud and the optical scattering characteristics of the thundercloud are of course complicating factors. We analyze LIS data for the years 2003 - 2013 and provide geographical plots of the time-evolution of the LNI in order to determine if there are any significant changes or trends between like seasons, or from year to year...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{dangerous}} loops when connecting equipment in complex studio setups, better adapters offer voltage protection and galvanic isolation of the units. Such adapters will ensure {{that there is no}} electrical connection of any kind between both sides of the adapter, including ground.

Their electronics cannot be powered from the flash and therefore needs a power supply in form of a small battery.As an example, Minolta offered the PC terminal adapter PCT-100 (8825-691) for this purpose, which worked as a galvanic isolator and could withstand 400 volts DC or AC.

50|$|The Mamiya C {{series is}} a line of twin-lens reflex medium-format system cameras {{manufactured}} by Mamiya between 1956 and 1994. It was developed from the Mamiyaflex series of cameras built from 1949 to 1956. The Mamiya C series was initially aimed at the professional market, but some later models were intended for amateurs. Unlike most TLR cameras, the Mamiya C has interchangeable lenses. The upper and lower lenses come off as a unit, and are available in at least seven different focal lengths. The lower lens of each unit has an aperture diaphragm {{as well as a}} leaf shutter. A <b>flash</b> sync <b>terminal</b> is part of the lens unit, and the delay can be set to M or X mode. The camera has an interlocking baffle that enables lenses to be changed without exposing the film. Focusing is done via a bellows system on the front side of the camera. Early models had separate film advance and shutter cocking mechanisms; on later models the shutter was automatically cocked. There is no metering in the camera body, so an external light meter is necessary. Viewfinders with built-in meters were available as accessories with later models.|$|R
