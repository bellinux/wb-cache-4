5|$|An Unforgettable Summer was {{especially}} {{noted for its}} depiction of oppression, nationalism and <b>xenophobia,</b> and for its investigation of violence in both interwar Romania and the Balkans. It is also connected {{with the end of}} Communist Yugoslavia and the onset of the Yugoslav wars: Lucian Pintilie once stated that he had been inspired by this outcome when filming on location, and continued to refer to it in later interviews.|$|E
5|$|Completed in {{the context}} of the Yugoslav wars, the film {{constitutes}} an investigation into the consequences of <b>xenophobia</b> and state-sanctioned repression, as well as an indictment of a failure in reaching out. It is thus often described as a verdict on the history of Romania, as well as on problems facing the Balkans at large, and occasionally described as a warning that violence could also erupt in a purely Romanian context.|$|E
5|$|Motion {{argues that}} {{aside from the}} {{sometimes}} facetious tone, the opinions expressed by Larkin in his Coleman persona, particularly the mild <b>xenophobia</b> that enters the essay, foreshadow his own mature prejudices. Bradford believes that the essay reads as a serious, well-researched paper on the genre of early twentieth century boarding school literature, worthy of inclusion in F. W. Bateson's Essays and Criticism had that journal existed in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Literature {{academic}} Jayne Ashleigh Glover {{says that}} while Zone Three on the surface {{appears to be a}} feminist utopia, Lessing shows that it is far from idyllic. The story narrators, the Chroniclers of Zone Three, question their zone's behaviour and attitudes, and warn of the dangers of stagnation. Al•Ith, upon returning to Zone Three, is shunned by its inhabitants for failing to attend to their zone's needs, and Zone Three's stasis manifests itself in <b>xenophobia</b> when Al•Ith brings back new perspectives, followed by visitors from Zone Four.|$|E
5|$|When Arusi is {{old enough}} to travel, Dabeeb and her band of women decide to take him to Zone Three to see Al•Ith. This {{cross-border}} excursion is not ordered by the Providers, and Ben Ata has grave misgivings about their decision. In Zone Three the women are shocked to find the deposed Al•Ith working in a stable near Zone Two. While Al•Ith is pleased to see her son, she too has misgivings about Dabeeb's action. The bumptious women's travels through Zone Three evoke feelings of <b>xenophobia</b> in the locals.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of judicial {{members on the}} Council may also pose additional problems. There is a possibility of conflict of interest for judges who sit {{as members of the}} Council if they find themselves having to review the very Acts of Parliament that they have either endorsed or rejected previously. This is exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} Council, in examining the legitimacy of Bills, plays a quasi-judicial role. There may be confusion as regards the legality of a piece of legislation if, for example, it was initially condemned by the Council but enacted by the Government and later endorsed by the courts upon judicial review. When the potential conflict between the Chief Justice's role as head of the judiciary and as Chairman of the Council was raised in 2010 by Githu Muigai, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination, <b>Xenophobia</b> and Related Tolerance, he was informed that the Chief Justice would recuse himself from any matter in which a conflict arose.|$|E
5|$|When {{the group}} {{arrives at the}} picturesque hotel, they find an {{energetic}} young manager Sonny (Dev Patel) but a dilapidated facility, not yet what he had promised. Overwhelmed by the cultural changes, Jean often stays inside at the hotel, while her husband Douglas explores the sights. Graham finds that the area has greatly changed since his youth and disappears on long outings every day. Muriel, despite her <b>xenophobia,</b> starts to appreciate her doctor for his skill and the hotel maid for her good service. Evelyn gets a job advising the staff of a call centre on how to interact with older British customers. Sonny struggles to raise funds to renovate the hotel and sees his girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae), despite his mother's disapproval. Madge joins the Viceroy Club seeking a spouse, where she is surprised to find Norman. She introduces him to Carol (Diana Hardcastle). He admits he is lonely and seeking a companion, and the two begin an affair.|$|E
5|$|Zajdel's early works, from 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, focuses on {{scientific}} inventions {{and their role}} in space exploration, alien contact or artificial intelligence. As his writing career continued, however, his stories evolved {{to focus on the}} social aspects and often negative consequences of those inventions. Over time, an increasingly visible theme became visible in his works - a concern over dangers inherent in attempts to control the human society. He is also condemning human ignorance, warning against <b>xenophobia,</b> and asking philosophical questions {{about the nature of the}} universe, happiness and human destiny. Zajdel's works from his second period - late 1970s and 1980s - and represent the genres of social and dystopian fiction. In his works, he envisions totalitarian states and societies leaving under extreme forms of mass surveillance.|$|E
5|$|In the Soviet times, mental {{hospitals}} were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps. Sofia Dorinskaya, {{a human rights}} activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who {{have been living in}} a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home. Deinstitutionalization has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them. In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow. Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets. The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005. Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of <b>xenophobia.</b> The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous. The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} boom resulted in drawing {{large numbers of}} aborigines out of their villages and into the unskilled or low-skilled sector of the urban workforce. Manufacturing and construction jobs were generally available for low wages. The aborigines quickly formed bonds with other communities as they all had similar political motives to protect their collective needs {{as part of the}} labor force. The aborigines became the most skilled iron-workers and construction teams on the island often selected to work on the most difficult projects. The result was a mass exodus of indigenous members from their traditional lands and the cultural alienation of young people in the villages, who could not learn their languages or customs while employed. Often, young aborigines in the cities fall into gangs aligned with the construction trade. Recent laws governing the employment of laborers from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines have also led to an increased atmosphere of <b>xenophobia</b> among urban aborigines, and encouraged the formulation of a pan-indigenous consciousness in the pursuit of political representation and protection.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue is}} {{complicated}} by allegations of antisemitism and <b>xenophobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Globalization {{tends to}} bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures. <b>Xenophobia</b> is the fear of that which is {{perceived}} to be foreign or strange. <b>Xenophobia</b> can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and perceptions of an ingroup towards an outgroup, including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.|$|E
25|$|Biphobia {{need not}} be a phobia as defined in {{clinical}} psychology (i.e., an anxiety disorder). Its meaning and use typically parallel those of <b>xenophobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2005, a United Nations special {{rapporteur}} on {{racism and}} <b>xenophobia</b> expressed concerns about deep and profound racism in Japan and insufficient government {{recognition of the}} problem.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1994, {{immigrants}} from elsewhere faced discrimination and even violence in South Africa. After majority rule in 1994, contrary to expectations, {{the incidence of}} <b>xenophobia</b> increased. Between 2000 and March 2008, at least 67 people died in what were identified as xenophobic attacks. In May 2008, a series of attacks left 62 people dead; although 21 of those killed were South African citizens. The attacks were apparently motivated by <b>xenophobia.</b> In 2015, another nationwide spike in xenophobic attacks against immigrants in general prompted a number of foreign governments to begin repatriating their citizens.|$|E
25|$|In late 2008 {{he became}} a member of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, a not-for-profit {{organization}} established to monitor tolerance in Europe and prepare recommendations on fighting <b>xenophobia</b> and intolerance on the continent.|$|E
25|$|According to the National Institute Against Discrimination, <b>Xenophobia</b> and Racism (INADI), an {{estimated}} 20,000 {{children with disabilities}} were unable to attend school in Buenos Aires City in 2008 because the buildings were not handicapped accessible.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to {{concerns about the}} rise in fascism and <b>xenophobia,</b> La Rose helped to found European Action for Racial Equality and Social Justice in 1989, bringing together anti-racists and anti-fascists from Belgium, Italy, France and Germany.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{antisemitism}} {{and increasing}} <b>xenophobia,</b> Jews {{became involved in}} most sectors of Argentine society. Many settled in cities, especially Buenos Aires. As they were prohibited from positions in the government or military, many became farmers, peddlers, artisans and shopkeepers.|$|E
25|$|Pindar, Herodotus, and Plutarch {{claimed the}} Egyptians engaged in ritual {{congress}} with goats. Such claims about other cultures {{do not necessarily}} reflect anything about which the author had evidence, but be a form of propaganda or <b>xenophobia,</b> similar to blood libel.|$|E
25|$|The war and {{economic}} pressures intensified the already present fragmentation processes and class {{conflicts between the}} social classes and within each of them. <b>Xenophobia</b> and intolerance became prevalent, different social and territorial groups stressed their separate statuses and traditions. The nation building efforts of Renaissance era reformers was undone.|$|E
25|$|Dobbs' critics, {{including}} columnist James K. Glassman, {{author of}} Dow 36,000 {{and member of}} the American Enterprise Institute think tank, have accused him of inciting <b>xenophobia.</b> Others have accused him of Hispanophobia, a charge he denies and one which he has said offends him deeply, as his wife Debi Segura is a Mexican-American.|$|E
25|$|In August 2006 Somali {{refugees}} {{appealed for}} protection after 21 Somali traders {{were killed in}} July of that year and 26 more in August. The immigrants believed the murders to be motivated by <b>xenophobia,</b> although police rejected the assertion of a concerted campaign to drive Somali traders out of townships in the Western Cape.|$|E
25|$|Antisemitism {{has been}} {{explained}} in terms of racism, <b>xenophobia,</b> projected guilt, displaced aggression, and the search for a scapegoat. Some explanations assign partial blame to the perception of Jewish people as unsociable. Such a perception may have arisen by many Jews having strictly kept to their own communities, with their own practices and laws.|$|E
25|$|Francis Jourdain said of {{the society}} in which he grew up that it was {{dominated}} by people who were highly opionated and quick to take sides. Although its members pretended to {{be in favor of}} liberty and compassion, he saw it as tainted by prejudices, <b>xenophobia</b> and extreme emotion. His father was very much typical of this society.|$|E
25|$|Cultural life rapidly developed, {{primarily}} in the Hejaz, which was the center for newspapers and radio. However, the large influx of foreign workers in Saudi Arabia {{in the oil industry}} increased the pre-existing propensity for <b>xenophobia.</b> At the same time, the government became increasingly wasteful and extravagant. By the 1950s this had led to large governmental deficits and excessive foreign borrowing.|$|E
25|$|An early {{example of}} haibutsu kishaku is the Mononobe clan's anti-Buddhist {{policies}} {{during the time}} of Buddhism's early introduction to Japan in the Kofun period. The Mononobe were opposed to the spread of Buddhism not on religious grounds, but rather because of nationalism and <b>xenophobia.</b> The Nakatomi clan, ancestors of the Fujiwara, were allies of the Mononobe in their opposition to Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|The EFA broadly {{stands on}} the left-wing of the {{political}} spectrum. The Brussels declaration emphasises the protection of human rights, sustainable development and social justice. In 2007 the EFA congress in Bilbao added several progressive principles to the declaration, including a commitment to fight against racism, antisemitism, discrimination, <b>xenophobia</b> and islamophobia, {{and a commitment to}} get full citizenship for immigrants, including voting rights.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, CNN began a {{documentary}} series titled Believer on various religious traditions in the world. The first episode was criticized by Indian Americans and American Hindus after presenter Reza Aslan ate human brains {{with members of}} the fringe Aghori sect of Hinduism. This was criticized in India for misrepresenting Indian religious traditions, as well as potentially stirring up racism and <b>xenophobia</b> against Americans of Indian origin.|$|E
25|$|As scholar Marius Turda notes, the {{objections}} were partly justified, {{since the new}} generation brought with it less credibility and more corruption. Fleva may even have been partly responsible for sacking Eminescu {{from the office of}} librarian, back when the National Liberals first began evaluating the loyalties of public servants. However, Eminescu's expanding <b>xenophobia</b> caused disquiet in Conservative circles, since many Conservative leaders were of noted Greek or other non-Romanian origin.|$|E
25|$|The European Parliament Committee of Enquiry on Racism and <b>Xenophobia</b> {{found them}} to be among the most discriminated-against ethnic groups in Ireland and yet their status remains {{insecure}} in the absence of widespread legal endorsement. Travellers are often viewed by settled people in a negative light, perceived as insular, anti-social, 'drop-outs' and 'misfits', or believed to be involved in criminal and mendicant behaviour, or settling illegally on land owned by others.|$|E
25|$|The mobilizing {{force of}} Marxism-Leninism, mated to Vietnamese nationalism. While {{in some ways}} Marxism was alien to the Vietnamese landscape, revolutionary leaders succeeded in {{blending}} it with traditional Vietnamese <b>xenophobia</b> and a growing modern sense of nationalism. Marxism also presented a sense of inevitable historical progress that enhanced mobilization, and included the key role of the Lao Dong, the Communist Party of North Vietnam. These factors helped mobilise some support within South Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Spy vs Spy's {{follow-up}} album, <b>Xenophobia</b> (Why?) {{was released}} in March 1988 peaked at No. 15 in Australia. It was produced by Karski and Guy Gray and released by WEA in 14 countries. Their 1989 album Trash the Planet peaked at No. 22 on the ARIA Charts. None of their subsequent releases reached the Australian Top 40. The band split and reformed {{a number of times}} but still developed a strong following in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{racism is}} a term used to {{describe}} and explain new racial ideologies and practices that have emerged since World War II. It {{can be defined as}} societal beliefs and customs that promote the assumption that the products of a given culture, including the language and traditions of that culture are superior to those of other cultures. It shares a great deal with <b>xenophobia,</b> which is often characterised by fear of, or aggression toward, members of an outgroup by members of an ingroup.|$|E
25|$|In {{a factor}} {{analysis}} of the latest wave of World Values Survey data, Arno Tausch (Corvinus University of Budapest) found that Protestantism emerges to be very close to combining religion and the traditions of liberalism. The Global Value Development Index, calculated by Tausch, relies on the World Values Survey dimensions such as trust in the state of law, no support for shadow economy, postmaterial activism, support for democracy, a non-acceptance of violence, <b>xenophobia</b> and racism, trust in transnational capital and Universities, confidence in the market economy, supporting gender justice, and engaging in environmental activism, etc.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Doudou Diène, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Racism, Racial Discrimination, <b>Xenophobia</b> and Related Intolerance, {{concluded}} that Canada should redress the head tax to Chinese Canadians {{in response to}} a submission by May Chiu, legal counsel to the Chinese Canadian Redress Alliance, and, in 2005, Gim Wong, an 82-year-old son of two head tax payers and a World War II veteran, conducted a cross-country Ride for Redress on his Harley Davidson motorcycle, where upon his arrival in Ottawa Prime Minister Paul Martin refused to meet him.|$|E
