5|$|In 1961, {{the studio}} {{released}} One Hundred and One Dalmatians, an animated feature which popularized {{the use of}} <b>xerography</b> {{during the process of}} inking and painting traditional animation cels. Using <b>xerography,</b> animation drawings could be photochemically transferred rather than traced from paper drawings to the clear acetate sheets ("cels") used in final animation production. The resulting art style– a scratchier line which revealed the construction lines in the animators' drawings– typified Disney films into the 1980s. The film was a success, being the tenth highest-grossing film of 1961 with rentals of $6.4 million.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the later}} Disney feature films had animators being {{responsible}} for single characters, in The Jungle Book the animators {{were in charge of}} whole sequences, since many have characters interacting with one another. The animation was done by <b>xerography,</b> with character design, led by Ken Anderson, employing rough, artistic edges in contrast to the round animals seen in productions such as Dumbo.|$|E
5|$|Since Alice Comedies in the 1920s, Walt Disney Animation Studios has {{produced}} a series of prominent short films, including the Mickey Mouse cartoons and the Silly Symphonies series. Many of these shorts provided a medium for the studio to experiment with new technologies that they would use in their filmmaking process, such as the synchronization of sound in Steamboat Willie (1928), {{the integration of the}} three-strip Technicolor process in Flowers and Trees (1932), the multiplane camera in The Old Mill (1937), the <b>xerography</b> process in Goliath II (1960), and the hand-drawn/CGI hybrid animation in Off His Rockers (1992), Paperman (2012), and Get a Horse! (2013).|$|E
5000|$|The road to Carlson's success—or {{that for}} <b>xerography's</b> success—had been long {{and filled with}} failure. He was turned down for funding by more than twenty {{companies}} between 1939 and 1944. He tried {{for some time to}} sell the invention to International Business Machines (IBM), the great vendor of office equipment, but no one at the company saw merit in the concept—it is not clear that anyone at IBM even 'understood' the concept. [...] His next-to-last attempt to garner the interest—and funds—he needed to commercialize the physics was a meeting with the Department of the Navy. The Navy had a specific interest in the production of dry copies, but they did not [...] "see" [...] what Carlson saw.|$|R
40|$|Preface (excerpt) : 'This concise {{volume is}} the result of almost a year of conversation, tests and planning. Produced on the now {{ubiquitous}} Risograph (Riso RP 3700), our intentions from the beginning of this project were to explore how the machine could be used to create original images, rather than reproduce existing one. 'The structure of this publication, and the experiments carried out within, have been greatly inspired and guided by Bruno Munari's Original <b>Xerographies.</b> Nearly all of the images used throughout Original Risographies were supplied by Robin Kirkham & Harry Blackett of An Endless Supply. These images were then treated according to the different possibilities apparent within the Risograph's mechanical operation, and its accompanying production software. The results of these tests are displayed over the following chapters, with accompanying notation from Adrian Holme that explores the theoretical context of reproduction in art, design and literature. The exception to this is the chapter entitled Nature Table, for which we commissioned Peter Nencini to develop a series of compositions as a calibration tool' Charlie Abbott, Jake Hopwood, Alex Hough, Alice Lindsay & Peter Willis Published in a limited edition of 500...|$|R
5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for <b>xerography</b> in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E

25|$|Jerry Flax {{left the}} company in 1967 to lead the Electrostatic Printing Corporation (see <b>xerography),</b> for which he {{acquired}} the rights to commercialize the patented technology developed by Stanford engineer Clyde Childress. Ultimately, the process was purchased by Monsanto Chemical. In 1974 Jerry bought {{what was once the}} biggest competitor to Flax in San Francisco, Schwabacher-Frey. He first acquired the retail store and then its commercial division two years later.|$|E
25|$|Besides the camera, {{other methods}} of forming images with light are available. For instance, a {{photocopy}} or <b>xerography</b> machine forms permanent images but uses {{the transfer of}} static electrical charges rather than photographic medium, hence the term electrophotography. Photograms are images produced by the shadows of objects cast on the photographic paper, {{without the use of}} a camera. Objects can also be placed directly on the glass of an image scanner to produce digital pictures.|$|E
25|$|Chester Carlson (1906–1968), the {{inventor}} of <b>xerography,</b> offered further financial help. Tucker writes that this allowed Stevenson to step down {{as chair of the}} psychiatry department and set up a separate division within the department, which he called the Division of Personality Studies, later renamed the Division of Perceptual Studies. When Carlson died in 1968, he left $1,000,000 to the University of Virginia to continue Stevenson's work. The bequest caused controversy within the university {{because of the nature of}} the research, but the donation was accepted, and Stevenson became the first Carlson Professor of Psychiatry.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, {{during the}} {{production}} of All Dogs Go to Heaven, founding member John Pomeroy and several original crew members left the Dublin studio {{to return to the}} US, setting up a studio in Burbank, California named West Olive, later to become Sullivan Bluth Animation Studios. The new studio handled some of the animation for All Dogs Go to Heaven, as well as some television commercials. The move helped strengthen the studio's presence in the US market, and early promotion for All Dogs Go to Heaven included a presentation at the 1989 San Diego Comic-Con and sales of animation cels from previous productions. Initially the new US studio handled only the rough animation, with the drawings then sent to the Dublin studio for cleanup, ink-and-paint and shooting. As the studio expanded, it took on {{more and more of the}} animation process, with the paper animation completed there and sent to Dublin for <b>Xerography</b> and painting.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Xerography,</b> {{which means}} [...] "dry writing" [...] in Greek, {{is a process}} of making copies. <b>Xerography</b> makes copies without using ink. In this process, static {{electricity}} charges a lighted plate; a plastic powder is applied to the areas of the page to remain white. The photocopier was invented in 1938 by Chester Floyd Carlson who marketed his revolutionary device to about 20 companies before he could interest any. The Haloid Company, later called the Xerox Corporation, marketed it, and <b>xerography</b> eventually became common and inexpensive.|$|E
