Commercially available devices can be divided into two classes: positive pressure and triggered vacuum gaps. Positive pressure triggered gaps have a limited operating voltage range (for instance, from 1/3 to 2/3 of the self breakdown voltage). Triggered vacuum gaps offer a wide operating voltage range (400 V to 90 kV is achievable). Both classes can switch higher energy levels than any thyristor, thyratron, krytron, or sprytron. Triggered gaps are popular for single-shot and low-repetition-rate applications. One such switch is known as a trigatron. The Ignitron and Crossatron could be considered triggered gaps. The latter is unique in that it can be turned back off by the control electrode after conduction begins. The <b>xenon</b> flash <b>tube</b> is another common triggered gap. Various schemes have also been devised to trigger open air gaps on command. A set of spark gaps are a key element of a Marx generator, used to generate high-voltage impulses; the spark gaps allow a chain of capacitors to be slowly charged in parallel and then rapidly discharged in series.|$|R

To lower the ionization voltage, neon-xenon or helium-xenon are used; above , helium has lower breakdown voltage than neon and vice versa. At concentrations of 1% and less of xenon, the Penning effect becomes significant in such mixtures, as most of xenon ionization occurs by collision with excited atoms of the other noble gas; at more than few percents of xenon, the discharge ionizes xenon directly due to most energy of the electrons being spent on direct ionization of xenon.|$|R
30|$|Figure 7 a {{shows the}} {{relative}} intensity {{analysis of the}} Xe peak at wavelength 172 nm for sinusoidal excitation of radiations at different applied voltages and at a fixed frequency of 30 kHz, and {{it is observed that}} that the radiation power has increased with applied voltage. Similarly, the intensity due to pulse excitation increases with applied voltage as shown in Figure 7 b at the same frequency. However, there is an interesting observation at 3 kV of applied voltage in the sinusoidal and pulse excitations of radiations. It has been observed that there is around three times increase in VUV intensity of the wavelength 172 nm at an applied voltage of 3 kV in the case of unipolar pulse excitation compared to that of sinusoidal excitation (see Figure 7 a,b for comparison). The reduced field E/N of DBDs under unipolar pulse excitation varies dramatically in comparison to sine wave excitation [16, 17, 18] and perhaps is responsible for this effect. Furthermore, the enhanced performance of the pulsed DBD is derived from a discharge in the <b>xenon</b> DBD <b>tube</b> which is notably more uniform in spatial distribution of the discharge than that achieved using ac excitation [17]. The spatial uniformity keeps current densities and ionization rates low simultaneously compared with the filamentary operation and it is considered to be an important factor in respect of efficient electrical to radiative energy conversion in the plasma. Short pulses with fast rise time terminate discharge development right after ignition, thus significantly decreasing the ion heating power deposition {{in the vicinity of the}} electrodes. This effect results in an increase in discharge efficiencies.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{have used}} newly {{developed}} metal-channel photomultipliers (PMTs) from Hamamatsu Photonics {{to detect the}} fast scintillation light from liquid xenon. The PMTs are designed to operate within the liquid and to efficiently detect the 175 nm Xe light. Their small transit time spread makes them ideal for fast timing applications. To evaluate the timing characteristics of a liquid xenon detector, we tested a gridded ionization chamber equipped with two such PMTs. Both PMTs observe the same interaction and share the detected scintillation light about equally. At zero field the measured timing resolution is 565 ps FWHM for 122 keV from 57 Co and 227 ps FWHM for 662 keV from 137 Cs. For electric fields up to 4 kV/cm drift field the timing resolution remained constant.

After 30  minutes of dark adaptation luminance response functions were obtained using flashes of increasing scotopic luminance (highest 9. 4  cd/s/m 2, lowest 5. 5  log units below it). The parameters Vmax, n, and K of the Naka-Rushton equation were computed from the measurement values based on the usual fitting procedure. These parameters, together with b-wave amplitudes and implicit times for all flash intensities, were compared interocularly and between the normal subjects and those with glaucoma. Correlations were computed between interocular differences of the mean deviation and interocular differences of Vmax, n, K, b-wave amplitudes, and implicit times between the two fellow eyes of the patients with asymmetrical glaucomatous damage.  RESULTS—Implicit times were significantly longer (p< 0. 005) in the glaucoma patients than in the normal group for flash intensities of 9. 4,  5. 3,  1. 7,  0. 53, and 0. 17  cd/s/m 2. b-Wave amplitudes {{did not differ significantly}} between the two study groups. Comparing the two fellow eyes of each patient with glaucoma, Vmax was significantly higher in the less damaged eye than in the more damaged eye. The interocular differences in the mean deviation correlated significantly with the interocular differences in the b-wave amplitudes, implicit times, and Vmax.  CONCLUSIONS—These results suggest that glaucomas can lead to electrophysiologically measurable damage of the inner nuclear layer. ...|$|R

The lamp performance is investigated {{as a function}} of filling pressure, bore size of lamp between 10 mm and 15 mm, operating voltage, energy input and circuit parameters. The lamp life has been related to input energy, flash duration and the inner wall area of the lamp. Above a given lamp wall loading, the lamp is likely to shatter in the first few discharges. Lamp efficiency, measurements show that for a fixed capacitor bank, operating voltage variation between 1. 0 and 2. 4 kV does not change the efficiency and that the efficiency is lower when a lamp is lightly loaded. Flash duration is almost independent of bank voltage and tube bore. The peak light intensity is increased and the flash duration decreased by a factor 2 when the lamp series inductance is changed from 450 μH to 100 μH. Design aspects of a laser system using ruby rods 6 ½” long x ½" diameter are studied and the output characteristics of six ruby rods of varying optical quality measured. The laser performance does not necessarily depend on the rod optical quality. Measurements of the variation of laser performance with lamp operating parameters show a linear relationship between output energy and input energy above laser threshold. For maximum efficiency, the lamp should be operated with a low bank capacity, a high bank voltage and short flash duration provided the lamp wall loading limit is not exceeded. The 10 mm bore lamp gives the highest efficiency. Measurement of the output beam divergence shows that the ruby rods giving the lowest beam divergence are of the best optical quality...|$|R
40|$|Experiments are {{described}} in this thesis on the optical bleaching at room temperature of F centres in freshly cleaved single crystal KBr, coloured by fast electron (50 KV) irradiation and illuminated with light from a focused helium-neon laser. Using a specially constructed microspectrophotometer bleaching apparatus, which is described in Chapter Two, data was obtained on optical bleaching at illuminating power densities up to 10 KW. cm- 2 in KBr having initial F centres concentrations of 10 (18) - 10 (19) centres cm. - 3. The bleaching light intensity is some 10 (6) times greater than that used in previous experiments, and the initial defect concentrations produced by electron irradiation are considerably higher than {{those found in the}} additively coloured specimens used in earlier experiments. Essentially, there have been no previous studies made on the optical bleaching of electron irradiated alkalil halide, and very little work has been done on the laser bleaching of this material coloured by any of the other methods possible. It is found that KBr which has been coloured by electron irradiation at room temperature bleaches by the random aggregation of F centres, a process which also occurs in additively coloured material. Prolonged bleaching, to absorbed doses of > 4 x 10 (8) J. oa- 3, does not result in a complete disappearance of absorption in the F band region, but leads to the formation of a residual coloration which is due to excited states of the M and R centres. A technique of optical modulation spectroscopy described in Chapter Five, showed that R+ centres are formed during illumination, which points to the importance of the F +o M+ and M+∝ -> R+ reactions in the aggregation process. In marked contrast, a vacancy interstitial recombination mechanism occurs in KBr which has been coloured by electron irradiation at 90 K warmed in the dark to room temperature for bleaching. There is a direct proportionality between the height of the V band and the total number of vacancies present in F, M and R centre throughout the optical bleaching ot KBr coloured at low temperature. Prolonged bleaching leads to the complete disappearance of the F, M, R and V bands, and the optical absorption spectrum of the crystal is similar to that seen prior to coloration. The atomic mechanisms responsible for bleaching under illumination at room temperature in KBr coloured additively, and by fast electron irradiation at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures, are discussed at length in Chapters Four and Five. Chapter Six describes investigations into the coloration and bleaching properties of the sodalites using a dark trace cathode ray tube with an aluminised chlorosodalite powder screen.

The project aimed to carry out technical research in order to develop a prototype for a mobile, modular detection system for radioactive sources and Special Nuclear Materials (SNM). The project’s main goal was to deliver a tested prototype of a modular mobile system capable of passively detecting weak or shielded radioactive sources with accuracy higher than that of currently available systems. The R&D involved in the project aimed at designing, constructing and testing robust, safe, and lightweight high pressure cells with an advanced read-out system, to be used as basic components of the modular mobile system.
