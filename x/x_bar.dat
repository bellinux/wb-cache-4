40|$|To {{provide a}} {{geometrical}} {{description of the}} classification theory and the structure theory of varieties of almost minimal degree, that is of non-degenerate irreducible projective varieties whose degree exceeds the codimension by precisely 2, a natural approach is to investigate simple projections of varieties of minimal degree. Let (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar</b> subset of P-K(r+ 1) be a variety of minimal degree and of codimension at least 2, and consider X-p = pi(p) ((<b>X)</b> over <b>bar)</b> subset of P-K(r) where p {{is an element of}} P-K(r+ 1) (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar.</b> By Brodmann and Schenzel (2007) [1], {{it turns out that the}} cohomological and local properties of X-p are governed by the secant locus Sigma(p) ((<b>X)</b> over <b>bar)</b> of (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar</b> with respect to p. Along these lines, the present paper is devoted to giving a geometric description of the secant stratification of (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar,</b> that is of the decomposition of P-K(r+ 1) via the types of secant loci. We show that there are at most six possibilities for the secant locus Sigma(p) ((<b>X)</b> over <b>bar),</b> and we precisely describe each stratum of the secant stratification of (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar,</b> each of which turns out to be a quasi-projective variety. As an application, we obtain a different geometrical description of non-normal del Pezzo varieties X subset of P-K(r). first classified by Fujita (1985) [3, Theorem 2. 1 (a) ] by providing a complete list of pairs ((<b>X)</b> over <b>bar,</b> p), where (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar</b> subset of P-K(r+ 1) is a variety of minimal degree, p is an element of P-K(r+ 1) (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar</b> and X-p = X subset of P-K(r).

40|$|The {{condition}} number kappa(p) ((<b>x)</b> under <b>bar)</b> of an ordered basis (<b>x)</b> under <b>bar</b> of a finite dimensional subspace of an L-p-space, 1 <= p <= infinity, measures {{the extent to}} which small relative changes in the basis coefficients lead to small relative changes in the function values, and vice versa. We consider an ordered basis (<b>x)</b> under <b>bar</b> of an arbitrary finite dimensional normed space and introduce numbers kappa(p,r) ((<b>x)</b> under <b>bar),</b> 1 <= p, r <= infinity, which control 'near linear dependence' of the basis elements as well as overflow/underflow during computations. These numbers are defined in terms of the norms of the basis elements and the norms of the elements of the ordered dual basis. Optimal scaling strategies are determined. Effects of matrix transformation on these numbers are explored. If (<b>x)</b> under <b>bar</b> is an ordered basis of an inner product space, then kappa(p,r) ((<b>x)</b> under <b>bar)</b> can be calculated explicitly in terms of the diagonal entries of the Gram matrix corresponding to (<b>x)</b> under <b>bar</b> and the diagonal entries of its inverse. In the last section, we define a {{condition number}} of (<b>x)</b> under <b>bar</b> relative to the problem of computing the ordered dual basis, and relate it to kappa(p,q) ((<b>x)</b> under <b>bar),</b> where (1 /p) +(1 /q) = 1.

The SDS (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar</b> chart {{has been studied}} under the assumption of known process parameters in the literature. Nevertheless, in practice, process parameters are usually unknown and are estimated from an in-control Phase I dataset. This paper investigates {{the performance of the}} SDS (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar</b> chart with estimated process parameters, in terms of the average run length (ARL), average number of observations to signal (ANOS) and standard deviation of the run length (SDRL). The performance of the SDS (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar</b> chart with estimated process parameters by minimizing the out-of-control ARL and the out-of-control ANOS is compared with the corresponding chart's performance with known process parameters. In addition, the minimum number of Phase I samples required by the SDS (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar</b> chart with estimated process parameters so that it has approximately the same in-control ARL and ANOS performances as the chart with known process parameters is studied. The ARL, ANOS and SDRL properties of the SDS (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar</b> chart with estimated process parameters differ significantly from that of the chart with known process parameters. Therefore, suitable optimal charting parameters are introduced so that the SDS (<b>X)</b> over <b>bar</b> chart with estimated process parameters has an adequate performance as its known process parameters counterpart without having to use large number of Phase I samples and sample size...|$|R

Radiometric K/Ar ages of selected muscovites {{have also been}} determined. P muscovite distinguishes from VdG muscovite because of higher FeO ((<b>x)</b> over <b>bar</b> = 2. 41 +/- 0. 21 % and 1. 23 +/- 0. 06 %, respectively), F ((<b>x)</b> over <b>bar</b> = 1. 14 +/- 0. 20 % and 0. 79 +/- 0. 14 %, respectively), TiO 2 ((<b>x)</b> over <b>bar</b> = 0. 34 +/- 0. 06 % and < microprobe detection limit, respectively), Li ((<b>x)</b> over <b>bar</b> = 1010 +/- 30 ppm and 331 +/- 18 ppm, respectively) and Rb ((<b>x)</b> over <b>bar</b> = 1941 +/- 170 ppm and 978 +/- 62 ppm, respectively) and, conversely, lower MnO ((<b>x)</b> over <b>bar</b> = 0. 04 +/- 0. 01 % and 0. 61 +/- 0. 08 %, respectively) and Cu ((<b>x)</b> over <b>bar</b> = 22 +/- 11 ppm and 145 +/- 75 ppm, respectively). P and VdG chlorites are also compositionally different, as they are brunsvigites and ripidolites, respectively; in addition, the MnO/FeO ratios of VdG chlorite are much larger ((<b>x)</b> over <b>bar</b> approximate to 0. 150) than those ((<b>x)</b> over <b>bar</b> approximate to 0. 004) of the P mineral. As the different Fe/Mn ratios of both muscovite and chlorite correlated with the different Fe/Mn ratios of wolframite and, thus, reflect to some extent the different Fe/Mn ratios of the hydrothermal solutions in the two deposits, these ratios, along, with F, Ti, Li and Rb {{contents of}} muscovite, can be useful geochemical indicators for exploration. Paragonite-muscovite solvus thermometer gives minimum temperatures for P and VdG muscovite deposition of approximate to 360 and approximate to 250 degrees C, respectively. From the proportion of phengitic substitution in muscovite, minimum pressures have been estimated to be 0. 85 and 0. 95 kbar at P and VdG, respectively. Temperature calculated {{on the basis of}} Al-IV content of P and VdG chlorite are 266 +/- 23 degrees C and 275 +/- 33 degrees C, respectively. Both muscovite and chlorite temperatures are realistic. Finally, K/Ar ages of muscovite have yielded ranges of 284 - 295 and 295 - 305 Ma, respectively for the P and VdG mineralizations. These ranges are fully consistent with the Hercynian age of the granites, which the deposits are related to, and suggest that the VdG mineralization is slightly older than the P mineralization...|$|R
