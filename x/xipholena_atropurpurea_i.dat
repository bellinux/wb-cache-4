50|$|The iris is {{currently}} only {{found in nature}} reserves, such as the 'Irises Dora Rainpool nature park' near Netanya, which has the world's largest population of <b>I.</b> <b>atropurpurea.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike other plants, {{the floral}} size of I. haynei, {{is not an}} {{advantage}} for larger flowers and taller plants in attracting pollinators, over smaller plants such Iris tuberosa, compared to Iris atropurpurea and Iris gracilipes, where the large flowers does make an advantage, and has affected the evolution of flowers in <b>I.</b> <b>atropurpurea.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{different}} germination behaviour of {{the seeds}} of two irises, Iris lorteli and <b>I.</b> <b>atropurpurea</b> {{was found to be}} due to the different mechanical resistance of the integument, at the micropylar end, to radicle protrusion. A pressure of 135 atm was necessary in l. lorteli seeds for radicle protrusion, while in <b>I.</b> <b>atropurpurea</b> 77 atm was sufficient. In contrast Pancratium maritimum required a pressure of only 10 atm. The outer integument of seeds of l. lorteti was found to contain a compound which was toxic to the germinated embryo but did not act as a germination inhibitor. Extracts of the endosperm also had a slight germination inhibiting effect. An interaction between this weak inhibitor and the effect of the testa could not be ruled out completely. A test assay for germination using excised embryos was developed. A method for germination of Iris seeds, by cutting off the outer integument at the micropylar end, was developed and is being exploited commercially...|$|R
40|$|QUESTION: What is {{the role}} of {{inbreeding}} and outbreeding depression in creating spatial patterns of reproductive isolation among populations within a species? HYPOTHESIS: A combination of inbreeding and outbreeding effects create an optimal crossing distance at which reproductive isolation is minimal. ORGANISM: Iris atropurpurea Dinsm., an endangered and endemic Israeli plant, with a fragmented distribution throughout the coastal plain. FIELD SITES: Two <b>I.</b> <b>atropurpurea</b> populations, one in the Shafdan dunes and one in the Netanya Iris Reserve, about 19 km south and north of Tel Aviv respectively, on the coastal plain in Israel. METHODS: We performed artificial cross-pollination within and between populations of <b>I.</b> <b>atropurpurea</b> at various distances and measured seed germination and seedling survivorship. RESULTS: Theoretical considerations led us to expect that inbreeding depression acts mostly at the small scale, and that higher offspring fitness is revealed at distances < 10 km. Results of the experiment show that reproductive isolation acts differently in consequent stages of the hybrid life history. he pattern of total reproductive isolation among populations along a geographical axis showed different patterns in the two natural populations; whereas in the Netanya population no pattern appeared, in Shafdan we found a pattern of intermediate distance where reproductive isolation is the highest, and at short and long distances reproductive isolation is relaxed...|$|R
50|$|Previously, {{the iris}} was widely found {{along the coast}} of Israel, but by the 1950s, the {{habitats}} of <b>I.</b> <b>atropurpurea</b> was drastically affected by citrus plantations, and urbanisation, which reduced the fragmented areas of light soils along the coast. Then by 1959, it was listed as threatened by extinction, as only a few populations of the iris were found in reduced areas. In 1964, a law was established in Israel to protect the ten species of iris endemic to the region. Then in 1963, the Nature Reserves acts was established, which was followed by the establishment of the Nature Reserves Authority (NRA) in 1964, the authority enforces the act and manages the nature reserves. In 1975, Agami and Dafni, listed the iris as 'threatened by real extinction'. Later in 1986, 9 species of iris (including <b>I.</b> <b>atropurpurea)</b> were recorded in 'Flora Palestine' by Feinbrun. In 2000, ten species of iris, were classed as 'endangered' (according to IUCN categories). A new protection law was established on 1 February 2001. Then in 2008, it was listed by Smida and Polak, in the Red Data Book (the Rare and Endangered Plants of Israel.) as 'vulnerable', it was listed in 2012 as high conservation priority.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims 'Human-red' {{flowers are}} {{traditionally}} {{considered to be}} rather unpopular with bees, yet some allogamous species in the section Oncocyclus (genus Iris, Iridaceae) have evolved specialized interactions with their pollinators, a narrow taxonomic range of male solitary bees. The dark-red, tubular flowers of these irises are nectarless but provide protective shelters (i. e. a non-nutritive form of reward) primarily to male solitary bees (Apidae, Eucerini) that pollinate the flowers while looking for a shelter. An earlier study on orchids suggested that species pollinated predominantly by male solitary bees produce significantly larger amounts and larger numbers of different n-alkenes (unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons). Whether or not this also applies to the Oncocyclus irises and whether pollinators are attracted by specific colours or scents of these flowers is unknown. Methods Using Iris atropurpurea, recording of pollinator preferences for shelters with different spatial parameters was combined with analyses of floral colours (by spectrophotometry) and scents (by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) to test the hypotheses that (a) pollinators significantly prefer floral tunnels facing the rising sun (floral heat-reward hypothesis), and that (b) flowers pollinated predominantly by male solitary bees produce significantly larger amounts and larger numbers of unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons (n-alkenes) in their floral scent (preadaptation to sexual-deception hypothesis). Key Results Male bees do not significantly prefer shelters facing the rising sun or {{with the presence of}} high absolute/relative amounts and numbers of n-alkenes in the floral scent. Conclusions The results suggest that the flowers of <b>I.</b> <b>atropurpurea</b> probably evolved by pollinator-mediated selection acting primarily on floral colours to mimic large achromatic ('bee-black') protective shelters used preferentially by male solitary bees, and that pollinator visits are presumably not the result of an odour-based sexual stimulation or motivated by an increased morning floral heat reward in tunnels facing the rising sun.
