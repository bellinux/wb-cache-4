All the irregular moons are probably captured objects that were trapped by Uranus soon after its formation. The diagram illustrates the orbits of those irregular moons discovered so far. The moons above the <b>X</b> <b>axis</b> are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|E

This enables the one-pass turning of non-circular surfaces, rope and trapezoidal threads, {{as well as the}} surfaces of rotary tools such as a gear cutting hob, etc. The paper presents and discusses the interpretation of results and the calibration effects of positioning errors in the lathe’s numerical control system. Finally, it shows the geometric characteristics of the rope thread turned at various spindle speeds, including before and after-correction of the positioning error of the <b>Xs</b> <b>axis...</b>|$|R

The invariant hyperbola illustrates events separated from the origin by a spacelike interval of 1nbsp&m. The endpoints O and B measured when nbsp&=nbsp&0 are simultaneous events in the S′ frame. But to an observer in frame S, events O and B are not simultaneous. To measure length, the observer in frame S measures the endpoints of the rod as projected onto the x-axis along their world lines.

25|$|Another way of {{plotting}} the function {{can be derived}} from symmetry over y = x. The symmetry can be seen directly from its equation (x and y can be interchanged). By applying rotation of 45° CW for example, one can plot the function symmetric over rotated <b>x</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rotations {{around the}} x, y and z axes are called {{principal}} rotations.

That is to say, any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations.|$|E

25|$|The x′ axis is also tilted {{with respect}} to the <b>x</b> <b>axis.</b> To {{determine}} the angle of this tilt, we recall that the slope of the world line of a light pulse is always±1. Fig.2‑3c presents a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O′. Event P represents the emission of a light pulse at x′=0, ct′=−a. The pulse is reflected from a mirror situated a distance a from the light source (event Q), and returns to the light source at x′=0,ct′=a (event R).|$|E
25|$|Because {{there are}} often many {{different}} possible coordinate systems for describing geometrical figures, {{it is important to}} understand how they are related. Such relations are described by coordinate transformations which give formulas for the coordinates in one system in terms of the coordinates in another system. For example, in the plane, if Cartesian coordinates (x,y) and polar coordinates (r,θ) have the same origin, and the polar axis is the positive <b>x</b> <b>axis,</b> then the coordinate transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by x=rcosθ and y=rsinθ.|$|E

25|$|In {{computer}} graphics bubble sort is popular for its capability {{to detect a}} very small error (like swap of just two elements) in almost-sorted arrays and fix it with just linear complexity (2n). For example, it is used in a polygon filling algorithm, where bounding lines are sorted by their x coordinate at a specific scan line (a line parallel to the <b>x</b> <b>axis)</b> and with incrementing y their order changes (two elements are swapped) only at intersections of two lines. Bubble sort is a stable sort algorithm, like insertion sort.|$|E
25|$|In two dimensions, {{the angular}} {{velocity}} {{is a single}} number with an orientation but no direction. The angular velocity in two dimensions is a pseudoscalar, a quantity that changes its sign under a parity inversion (for example {{if one of the}} axes is inverted or if axes are swapped). The positive direction of rotation is taken, by convention, to be in the direction towards the y axis from the <b>x</b> <b>axis.</b> If the parity is inverted, but the orientation of a rotation is not, then the sign of the angular velocity changes.|$|E
25|$|Any {{single point}} {{on such a}} diagram is known as an event.

If the object were in free fall, it would travel up the t-axis; if it accelerates, it moves across the <b>x</b> <b>axis</b> as well. The actual path an object takes through spacetime, as opposed to the ones it could take, is known as the worldline. Another definition is that the light cone represents all possible worldlines.|$|E

A beam of light perpendicular to the <b>X</b> <b>axis</b> propagates in the direction z and encounters a screen S1 with a narrow (relative to the wavelength of the ray) slit. After having passed through the slit, the wave function diffracts with an angular opening that causes it to encounter a second screen S2 with two slits. The successive propagation of the wave results {{in the formation of the}} interference figure on the final screenF.|$|E
25|$|Deeper {{analysis}} is needed {{before we can}} understand why these distinctions should result in {{a difference in the}} twins' ages. Consider the spacetime diagram of Fig.2‑11. This presents the simple case of a twin going straight out along the <b>x</b> <b>axis</b> and immediately turning back. From the standpoint of the stay-at-home twin, there is nothing puzzling about the twin paradox at all. The proper time measured along the traveling twin's world line from O to C, plus the proper time measured from C to B, is less than the stay-at-home twin's proper time measured from O to A to B. More complex trajectories require integrating the proper time between the respective events along the curve (i.e. the path integral) to calculate the total amount of proper time experienced by the traveling twin.|$|E
25|$|After the EPR paper, quantum {{mechanics}} {{was in an}} unsatisfactory position: either it was incomplete, {{in the sense that}} it failed to account for some elements of physical reality, or it violated the principle of a finite propagation speed of physical effects. In a modified version of the EPR thought experiment, two hypothetical observers, now commonly referred to as Alice and Bob, perform independent measurements of spin on a pair of electrons, prepared at a source in a special state called a spin singlet state. It is the conclusion of EPR that once Alice measures spin in one direction (e.g. on the <b>x</b> <b>axis),</b> Bob's measurement in that direction is determined with certainty, as being the opposite outcome to that of Alice, whereas immediately before Alice's measurement Bob's outcome was only statistically determined (i.e., was only a probability, not a certainty); thus, either the spin in each direction is an element of physical reality, or the effects travel from Alice to Bob instantly.|$|E
