40|$|The {{xerophilous}} vegetation {{with characteristic}} insect assemblages {{is described in}} the main agricultural regions and native landscapes of Turkey. Long term intensive investigations documented vast biotic degradation of soil and vegetation (commonly referred to as desertification) by overgrazing, construction, recreation etc. Two main types of xeric landscape are under investigation: 1) natural highly specific deserts, semi-deserts, dry mountain slopes and screes; and 2) anthropogenic, newly emerged, floristically impoverished desertified areas. The presence of a multi-species insect assemblage on a <b>xerophilous</b> <b>plant</b> in certain area testifies its indigenous nature, whereas {{the absence of the}} specific consortium suggests recent plant invasion. The examples of the first case are the consortia of 3 – 6 species of Coleoptera, mainly Buprestidae, Chrysomelidae, and Curculionoidea, on some Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Ephedraceae (Ephedra spp.) and Polygonaceae (Calligonum polygonoides L.). Extreme examples of anthropogenic vegetation are overgrazed wormwood steppe and semidesert which lack usually diversified coleopterous consortia, including the most characteristic of this landscape, e. g., tenebrionids, and orthopterans. Rapid disappearance of the xerophilous complexes from the extraordinarily diversified and largely uninventoried Turkish biota makes preservation of the endangered plant and animal assemblages in different climatic zones of Turkey an urgent task...|$|E
40|$|Spray {{planting}} engineering method {{had been}} applied {{for more than}} thirty years. The spray planting apparatus has been continuously ameliorated and the applied materials are more diversified. This method is mostly applied on cutting slope and nature sliding area. We found that spray planting method has highly economic benefit and can stabilize slope environment. In this study, ‘Tension Soil Flock’(TSF) spray planting method and the Acacia confusa、Lespedeza bicolor and Cynodon dactylon’s seeds was chosen as tested specimen. The germination rate of these species in different mulching thickness of the spray planting mixture will be determined. Two construction sites were chosen as study areas those had been vegetated using the ‘TSF’ spray planting method. The construction sites included a landslide slope and a mudstone slope where are in Ming-De Reservoir and Tian-Liao. Both sites were convinced those are difficult to recovery by using vegetation engineering method. In this study, the vegetative characteristics and the plant physiological were investigated. In the meanwhile, the physical and chemical characteristic of planting mixture were analyzed, which will provide the suggestion of the improvement and manufacture of spray planting mixture of this method. The results are summarized as the following: 1. According to the physical and chemical analysis data of the spray planting mixture, the percentage of available nutrient were apparently higher in the mixture and in the ‘Jet Soil’ material than in the Gravel Red soil or the mudstone soil. The ’Polyesters’ were treated as adhesive agent, {{it also has the}} ability to aggregate soil. As the result of the three-phase experiment of the mixture, it is the best policy to control concentration of the Polyesters within 0. 3 %. 2. The mixture has highly water holding capacity, and the field moisture arise while the consistency of the Polyesters increase. After knowing the retention ability of the mixture, the maintenance schedule could be made. Different plant species need varied soil moisture during the germination stage, so the maintenance schedule should be modified depend on plant species. 3. The germination rate of Acacia confusa、Lespedeza bicolor and Cynodon dactylon was inhibited both by mulching thickness and stickiness of the aggregate agents. Although the negative influence on the germination of Acacia confusa and Cynodon dactylon was not serious, Lespedeza bicolor’s seed cannot germinate well in mixture with heavy stickiness. Whenever to apply these species in the same time, the concentration of the mixture could be set at about 0. 2 %. 4. The physiological responses, including net photosynthesis, leaf conductance, Ci/Ca, vapor pressure differential(VPD), transportation and water use efficiency(WUE) were affected by light intensity and ambient CO 2 concentration of the same temperature and humidity circumstance. The physiological factors were apparently varied with the light intensity and CO 2 concentration. The compensation intensity of light of Acacia confusa’s and Lespedeza bicolor’s were between 0 - 100 μmolm- 2 s- 1 and the compensation concentration of CO 2 were between 30 - 50 ppm and 50 - 70 ppm respectively. The saturation intensity of light of Acacia confusa’s and Lespedeza bicolor’s were between 800 - 1200 μmolm- 2 s- 1 and 400 - 800 μmolm- 2 s- 1 respectively. The physiological responses remained in steady except the photosynthesis and water use efficiency descend while the light intensity were higher than the saturation point. 5. The water use efficiencies (WUE) of Acacia confusa’s and Lespedeza bicolor’s WUE were 0. 4 % and 0. 22 % respectively. Because Acacia confusa has higher WUE than other species, it became the main species during the drought season. The leaves of Lespedeza bicolor will fall off in order to reduce water consuming during the drought season. We suppose that Acacia confusa is a <b>xerophilous</b> <b>plant</b> and Lespedeza bicolor is a xerophobous plant. 6. After spray planting on slope treated with netting about year later, the soil samples had been taken and analyzed. The amount of Fe 2 + and Zn 2 + in the soil increased tremendously. The phenomena indicated that the plants growing at the construction sites may injured by the toxicity of absorbing excessive Fe 2 + and Zn 2 +. It is worth for further study to considerate about either change the density of the net or leave out netting. 噴植工法之引進與應用迄今有近三十年，噴植機具不斷改良，應用材料更具多樣性，在多數人為開挖坡面或自然裸露之崩塌地施行，應用噴植方法之整體經濟效益及坡面穩定效益頗佳，且噴植施工迅速安全亦能克服各種崩塌坡面環境應力，將是未來植生復育應用工法的趨勢。本研究選取連續纖維團粒噴植工法(TSF噴植工法) 應用之噴植基材，配合相思樹、胡枝子、百慕達草等三種植物種子進行材料特性分析及不同噴植設計厚度下種子之發芽試驗，並選取苗栗縣明德水庫南側崩塌地及高雄縣田寮泥岩地區作為試驗區，此二處均為植生復育困難度頗高之地點，於兩處施工地點進行植生調查及植物生理反應測定，提供此工法爾後在施工設計及種子材料應用之參考。茲將結果摘要如下： 1. 由噴植基材之特性分析結果，得知客土材料與噴植基材之養分含量比率頗高。團粒劑在基材中除充當噴植黏著劑外，對於土壤之團粒化具有明顯之效果，由基材土壤三相之試驗結果，團粒劑之使用量其重量百分率濃度控制在 0. 3 ％以內為宜。 2. 噴植基材具有良好之水分保持能力，基材含愈高之團粒劑濃度具有較高之田間容水量。由基材之保水能力訂定養護週期，但實際應用時仍須針對不同植物種子發芽生長所需之土壤水分加以修正。 3. 相思樹、胡枝子、百慕達草之發芽情形受到設計厚度之影響。團粒劑使用量增加造成基材黏滯度提高，對於相思樹及百慕達草發芽影響較小，胡枝子則不適合應用於高黏滯度之噴植基材中。同時使用此三種植物時，以將基材團粒劑濃度控制於 0. 2 ％為最適宜。 4. 在相同之溫、濕渡環境下，植物之淨光合成率、氣孔導度、Ci/Ca值、葉內外蒸汽壓差、蒸散率、用水效率等生理因子，在不同光度及CO 2 條件下具有明顯之差異，相思樹與胡枝子之光補償點在 0 - 100 μmolm- 2 s- 1 之間，CO 2 補償點分別在 30 - 50 ppm及 50 - 70 ppm之間，光飽和點隨CO 2 濃度之供應而改變，分別在 800 - 1200 μmolm- 2 s- 1 及 400 - 800 μmolm- 2 s- 1 之間，在光飽和點之後除淨光合成率及用水效率呈下降趨勢外，其他因子皆維持較穩定之情況。 5. 由植物生理試驗得知，旱季時相思樹之用水效率約為 0. 4 ％，能適應乾旱之氣候，為旱季時之優勢樹種。胡枝子在旱季時之用水效率約為 0. 22 ％，於旱季時落葉以減少水分之消耗量，推測胡枝子應屬於乾旱躲避型之植物 。 6. 採行鋪網噴植之方式，鐵絲網在鏽蝕之後滲入土壤，造成土壤中鐵、鋅含量大量增加，對於部分植物可能造成在生長上之負面影響，因此在施工安全性及坡面穩定無虞之前提下，是否改變鋪網之密度或可於立地條件較佳之緩坡省略鋪網之施工，在技術上仍須進一步探討。目錄 頁次 中文摘要…………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要…………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅲ 圖次………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅴ 表次……………………………………………………………. …….

40|$|Fagus in China {{is never}} {{dominant}} in Late Cretaceous and Tertiary floras {{although it might}} reach its highest diversity in the Miocene. The genus Fagus was more widely distributed during the Palaeogene than in the Neogene. Furthermore, the ecological requirements of Fagus in the Palaeogene seem much broader {{than those in the}} Neogene onwards. This is because the Palaeogene floras containing Fagus lived in various conditions from an arid and hot climate to a humid and warm habitat. Additionally, Fagus then coexisted with many kinds of hygrophilous, thermophilous and <b>xerophilous</b> <b>plants.</b> However, the wide distribution, broad ecological adaptation and species composition changed greatly in the Neogene. The Neogene Fagus -containing floras are slightly more similar to the modern beech forests than the Palaeogene ones, although a big difference remains.

The endemic flora and fauna of the islands were disturbed and have now remained confined mostly in the mountain peaks, steep slopes and other inaccessible areas.Vegetation in the islands is basically of the savannah or steppe type.

40|$|A regiÃo Neotropical apresenta grande riqueza de espÃcies, da qual uma importante fraÃÃo habita ambientes semiÃridos. Muitas plantas xerÃfilas evoluÃram e se proliferaram nestes {{habitats}}, como os cactos. Os ciclos climÃticos ocorridos durante o perÃodo QuaternÃrio podem ter tido grande influÃncia na evoluÃÃo e diversificaÃÃo desses vegetais. De um modo geral, as evidÃncias apontam que a evoluÃÃo de plantas xerÃfilas nos NeotrÃpicos se deu em um cenÃrio evolutivo de fragmentaÃÃo populacional em ârefÃgiosâ Ãridos, com conservaÃÃo de nicho e diversificaÃÃo in-situ de pares ou pequenos clados de espÃcies. Este mecanismo de diversificaÃÃo tem sido observado para alguns tÃxons xerÃfilos, como Pilosocereus Byles & G. D. Rowley (Cactaceae), nas regiÃes sudeste e centro-oeste do Brasil; e tem sido associado aos ciclos climÃticos do QuaternÃrio. No entanto, evidÃncias tambÃm indicam que a histÃria climÃtica da regiÃo semiÃrida do nordeste brasileiro foi significativamente diferente do resto do continente. Este trabalho tem como objetivo verificar se a diversificaÃÃo de espÃcies xerÃfilas como Pilosocereus se deu por este mesmo mecanismo no nordeste do Brasil. Estudou-se filogeografia, variaÃÃo de padrÃes morfolÃgicos e modelos de nicho ecolÃgico de trÃs tÃxons do grupo Arrabidae: Pilosocereus arrabidae, P. catingicola subesp. catingicola e P. catingicola subesp. salvadorensis â grupo indicado como mais primitivo do subgÃnero Pilosocereus. Constatou-se menor diversidade genÃtica do que o esperado para um grupo tido com o mais antigo do gÃnero. A estimativa de origem do grupo, relativamente recente, remonta ao Pleistoceno mÃdio-tardio. Rios de maior porte (rio SÃo Francisco, rio Jequitinhonha e rio Doce) parecem constituir importantes barreiras ao fluxo gÃnico (sementes) do grupo em questÃo. A variaÃÃo de traÃos morfolÃgicos vegetativos (espinhos e costelas) entre diferentes linhagens e tÃxons guarda maior relaÃÃo com fatores ambientais (precipitaÃÃo e latitude) do que com a distÃncia genÃtica. Alguns traÃos da morfologia floral tambÃm apresentaram correlaÃÃo com as mesmas variÃveis ambientais. AnÃlises de nicho ecolÃgico apontam para a conservaÃÃo de nicho entre as espÃcies. O conjunto de resultados obtidos indica uma diferenciaÃÃo morfolÃgica e ecolÃgica incipiente entre membros do grupo Arrabidae, bem como uma origem recente, aparentemente relacionada com a irradiaÃÃo adaptativa, i. e. a uma rÃpida colonizaÃÃo de novos habitats durante oscilaÃÃes do nÃvel do mar e mudanÃas climÃticas pleistocÃnicas. The Neotropical region {{exhibits a}} huge species richness, from which an important fraction inhabits semiarid environments. Many <b>xerophilous</b> <b>plants</b> evolved and proliferated in these habitats, as the cacti. The climatic cycles {{that occurred during}} the Quaternary period may have had great influence in the evolution and diversification of these plants. In general, the evidence indicate that the evolution of <b>xerophilous</b> <b>plants</b> in the Neotropics took place in an evolutionary scenario of population fragmentation in arid "refuges", with niche conservationism and diversification of pairs or small clades of species in-situ. This diversification mechanism has been observed for some xerophilous taxa, as Pilosocereus Byles & GD Rowley (Cactaceae), in the southeast and midwest regions of Brazil; and has been linked to climatic cycles of the Quaternary. However, evidence also indicates that the climate history of the semiarid region of northeastern Brazil was significantly {{different from the rest of}} the continent. This study aims to verify that the diversification of xerophilous species like Pilosocereus occurred by this same mechanism in northeastern Brazil. We studied phylogeography, variation of morphological patterns and ecological niche models of three taxa of Arrabidae group: Pilosocereus arrabidae, P. catingicola subsp. catingicola and P. catingicola subsp. salvadorensis â a group that is considered the most primitive of the genus. We found that genetic diversity was lower than expected for a group that is the most ancient. The estimated origin time for the group, which is relatively recent, dates back to mid-late Pleistocene. Major rivers (SÃo Francisco, Jequitinhonha and Doce) seem to be important barriers to the gene flow of this group. The variation of vegetative morphological traits (spines and ribs) among different lineages and taxa are more related to environmental factors (rainfall and latitude) than to genetic distance. Some flower morphological traits also exhibited correlation to the same environmental variables. Ecological niche analysis point to niche conservationism among the species. The data set indicates an incipient morphological and genetic differentiation among members of the Arrabidae group, as well as a recent origin, apparently related to and adaptative radiation, with colonization of new habitats during Pleistocenic sea-level oscillations and climate changes...|$|R
40|$|Ordinary lawns are {{difficult}} to maintain financially and can be time consuming, especialy {{if we try to}} cultivate lawn in places where the grass does not grow naturaly. The use of flowers as a subsitute to lawn brings forward new possibilities for otherwise neglected surface. Applying these alternatives are based on natural principles that initially cost higher but benefit far better in the long run. The chapter Introduction deals with issues of lawn versus flowers. This chapter focuses on typical habitats, groups of plants and works of experts. The chapter Literature Review focuses on different possibilities of ground covers with herbaceous vegetation in five subheads. Subhead Explanation of Basic Terms contains explanations of terms for lawn, flower - blooming plant and lawn substitutes from the perspective of different authors. Subhead Lawns briefly describes the history of the current lawns, mentions their function, types, methods of growing and its maintenance. The important idea is the negative effect of monocultures on the environment and how to reduce it. Subhead Groups of Flowers Used as Temporary Substitutes describes the topic of annuals and biennials in further details. It brings definition and characteristics of these flowers. Their use in different conditions either separately, as perennial plantings or as semi-wild structures are mentioned there. Subhead Groups of Flowers Used as Permanent Substitutes deals with perennials in detail. Flowering plants are divided according to the place of habitat. Describes the growing of flowers as a lawn substitute and its features such as visual similarity with lawn; resistance to pedestrian traffic, height, foliage, flowering time, etc. It focuses on the use of bulbs, alpine <b>plants,</b> <b>xerophilous</b> <b>plants,</b> flowers from the woods, hygrophilous plants, aromatic plants and other groups. The last subhead, Specific Groups of Flowers as a Lawn Substitute, discusses the flower meadows, extensive perennial flower bed and roof gardens.

The chapter Conclusion evaluates if the objectives of the work have been achieved - giving the overview of flowers as a lawn substitute and the comparision with a lawn...|$|R
40|$|Palynological and {{geological}} studies {{carried out}} at Gobero allowed to reconstruct the main palaeoenvironmental and climatic changes {{that occurred in the}} early and middle Holocene. The geological data of the area surrounding the perilacustrine ar- chaeological sites showed that four aeolian (arid) sedimentary units (from the earliest to the latest aeolian unit, a. u. 2, 3, 4 and 5) alternated with four lacustrine (wet) sedimentary units (lacustrine units, l. u. 3, 4, 5 and 6). The earliest Holocene lacustrine unit, l. u. 3, dated 10, 000 – 8160 cal BP, represents the time when the Gobero lake reached its maximum expansion and depth. The pollen data showed a complex environmental scenario including <b>xerophilous</b> and hygrophilous <b>plant</b> associations. The floristic changes and the lacustrine units in the Gobero basin match the general wet and dry climate oscillations. The early Holocene humid phase was interrupted by a dry spell ca 8200 BP. Then, a major dry phase, which was also evident in many other lake records, took place at, or just after, 6000 BP with a shift towards more permanent aridity. Nevertheless, the persistence of well-developed wet environments, even in the most recent l. u. 6 (ca 3800 cal BP), suggested that a grassland-type of vegetation continued to develop during late Holocene wet oscillations, following the increase of a lacustrine level...|$|R
40|$|The Arctic {{was exposed}} to {{dramatic}} environmental changes during the Quaternary. It is possible to detect the biological effects of these changes in terrestrial arctic ecosystems using bioindication by vascular plants. The results of studies about changes of structure and dynamic of plant communities in arctic Siberia during the Late Quaternary are introduced. We reconstructed the composition of plant communities in different time slots from botanical macrofossil assemblages preserved in permafrost sequences in Northern Siberia. The studies {{have been carried out}} at the Bykovsky Peninsula southeast of the Lena-Delta. The study area is situated directly at the Laptev-Sea coast today. But the location was far inland during the last glaciation of the northern hemisphere due to the marine regression. The Laptev-Sea level fell down to 120 - 135 m beneath its present-day level. Its coast shifted consequently northward several hundred km. The permafrost sequence investigated is outcroped along a cliff line, which is up to 40 m high. It was made accessible for sampling by thermal erosion and wave action. The outcrop consists of several subprofils. These so called thermokarst mounds represent the sediments, which were accumulated in the former polygonal depressions after the thawing of the ice wedges walling them. The sediment-blocks are very rich in fossil seeds. Due to the freezing of the plant remains simultaneous with their accumulation they are normally very well preserved. The Thermokarst mounds were sampled for several studies, which were carried out within the multidisciplinary project, named Palaeoclimatic signals from ice rich Permafrost. A detailed age model was constituted based on radiocarbon data both conventional and AMS. According to this the investigated permafrost sequence was deposited continuously since about 60 000 years bp and is hence an excellent archive of the Late Quaternary history of vegetation and climate. 18 samples from different thermokarst mounds were sieved. Plant remains were picked and identified to the lowest taxonomical level possible and counted. The palaeoecological interpretation of the species spectra obtained from each sample based on the ecological requirements of the species, which are represented by habitat descriptions {{on the one hand and}} by a classification into a plant community on the other hand. The composition of late Pleistocene species spectra was significantly different from the Holocene one. Thus it was possible to distinguish two vegetation complexes. The late Pleistocene vegetation complex includes 6 different plant communities, which are introduced in order of their spatial appearance, beginning in the depressions and ending at the topof slopes. Freshwater aquatic vegetation: All aquatic species found in the section occur at shallow freshwater sites, which are characterized firstly by frequent disturbances and secondly by fluctuating salt concentrations. Both phenomena appear at impermanent waters, frequently drying out during the summer under arid climate conditions. The most important indication of the aquatics concerning the palaeoclimate is made by their temperature requirements. The northernmost distribution of most species listed here is situated within the boreal zone today. They thus require relatively high water temperature. The littoral vegetation consists of pioneer species, which colonize moist soils in the range of fluctuating water levels at shores of shallow, contracting lakes and depressions in the landscape, uncovered by perennial plants in arid climates. Its occurrence indicates temporary running dry of the small, shallow polygonal melting water pools in the course of summer. Some of the proven species are more or less salt-tolerant. Salt accumulation at the surface due to groundwater evaporation under arid conditions is therefore indicated. Saline meadows occur in floodplains of river valleys and lake basins with a strongly changing groundwater table and salt accumulation at the surface due to the evaporation of the groundwater. This community develops under regularly recurring grazing in Mongolia and Central Siberia. In these regions the highly productive community is one of the most important pastures especially in mountain regions. The frequently proven Carex duriuscula is indicative of a degraded facies of that community. It leads over to steppe vegetation where it is also representative of the degradation facies of northeast Asian steppes. In Mongolia this rather species-poor facies indicates degradation of steppe by overgrazing or trampling. Kobresia meadows represent the perennial vegetation at dry, exposed, snow less sites in kontinental regions of the Arctic and the alpine belt of mountains. They are extremely frost resistant and are adapted to extreme seasonal temperature fluctuations. The most species proved in the late Pleistocene part of the sequence belong to communities of open pioneer communities of the Arctic and the alpine belt of mountains on dry, immature mineral soils. They occur at sites, which are characterized by frequent disturbances caused by deflation. This plant grouping appears under dry conditions and a strong exposition in winter due to a lacking snow cover. The northernmost vascular plants occurring in arctic deserts today are species of this class. The following plant communities dominated the Holocene vegetation. Vegetation of bogs can be divided into two different plant sociological classes. The arctic bog communities, dominated by sedges appear at mineral soils, those dominated by dwarf shrubs occur after peat accumulation and acidification of the substrate. The latter one is therefore characteristic of the stage of humidification and acidification, characteristic of the 2 nd half of Holocene. Both constitute the perennial vegetation of permanently wet habitats in swamps and at the shores of waterbodies in the Arctic. Only a few vascular plants are able to tolerate the environmental conditions close to snow accumulation sites. Species of the class Salicitea herbaceae are adapted to a shortened growing season due to a late beginning of snow-melt and a continuous supply of melting water. The soil-temperature has distinctly reduced by melting water. The soil is waterlogged causing a reductive environment. When we compare both vegetation complexes, at first the relatively high number of different plant communities occurring during the late Pleistocene is conspicuous, reflecting a high diversity of local site conditions. Holocene vegetation in contrast is rather uniform. A differentiating environmental gradient is scarcely distinct. Seasonal fluctuation of groundwater is indicated by the vegetation of Late Pleistocene, proven by the pioneer character of aquatic and littoral vegetation as well as by the evidence of several salt indicators. This result indicates a high evaporation under arid climatic conditions, what is confirmed by the finding of steppe elements and arctic dryness indicators as well. Plant communities of permanently wet habitats like bog communities occurred only sporadicly during Late Pleistocene. Species of Kobresia meadows and arctic pioneer communities show very low winter temperatures. In contrast steppe plants and boreal aquatics indicate relatively high summer temperatures. Thus, a very distinct seasonal temperature gradient and a low precipitation is reflected by the vegetation of Late Pleistocene. Both phenomena are characteristic of continental climates. Indicators of alternating moisture and <b>xerophilous</b> <b>plants</b> disappeared widely in the course of Holocene. Species of permanently wet habitats predominated the vegetation, plants characteristic of snow accumulation sites occurred. They show the existence of a thick snow cover. Humid conditions hence established during the Holocene. Thermophilous plants disappeared and indicators of extreme coldness in winter decreased conspicuously. The seasonal temperature gradient hence decreased distinctly in Holocene. A low seasonal gradient of air temperature as well as humid conditions are characteristic of maritime climate. Is it possible to specify the extent of temperature during the growing season in late Pleistocene? We tried to make quantitative reconstructions by means of the indicator species approach. According to the palaeobotanical record the mean July temperatures during some stages of Pleistocene were temporarily higher than today especially during the middle Weichselian interstadial. As we could see the arctic environment depends on the general character of climate, continental or maritime, which is influenced by intruding marine air masses rather than on global trends of temperature changes. The influence of moisture is stronger than changes of global annual mean temperature. This is explainable as follows: Moisture in the form of clouds hinders radiation to hit the ground directly. The Albedo of clouds is up to 80 % of the incoming radiation. Clouds cause a loss of energy by reflection of radiation back to the universe. Consequently soil and air near the ground are heated insufficiently. This problem is aggravated by increased precipitation and water logging of the soil. The greatest part of heat supply is used to melt the snow and evaporate the water. In consequence of a thicker snow cover the growing season is shortened by prolonged snow melt...|$|R
