40|$|We {{describe}} a Bayesian motion estimation algorithm {{which is part}} of a temporally recursive noise reduction filter for <b>X-ray</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> images. Our algorithm draws its robustness against high quantum noise levels from a statistical regularization, where a priori expectations about the spatial and temporal smoothness of motion vector fields are modelled by generalized Gauss-Markov random fields. We show that by using generalized Gauss-Markov random fields both smoothness and motion edges can be captured, without the need to specify an often critical edge detection threshold. Instead, our algorithm controls edges by a single parameter by means of which the regularization can be tuned from a median-filter like behaviour to a linear-filter like one.

Respiratory motion in different regions of the heart was analyzed in 10 volunteers, and it was shown that the use of dynamic roadmaps can reduce misalignment errors from more than 10 down to less than 1. 5 mm. Further-more, the results suggest that reliable motion information can be obtained from highly undersampled images due to the ad-vantageous undersampling properties of the radial phase encoding trajectory.

The principal component analysis (PCA) statistical method is used {{in combination with other}} image processing operations to make our proposed masked-PCA technique suitable for cardiorespiratory gating.

40|$|<b>X-ray</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> {{systems that}} are {{invariably}} utilised in modern interventional radiological procedures are responsible for delivering radiation doses that are of measurable detriment to both patients and clinical staff. The central tenet of the research detailed in this thesis is that a significant degree of spatial and temporal x-ray photon redundancy exists in the <b>x-ray</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> systems used to guide interventional radiological procedures. If this redundancy were reduced, significant reductions in the radiation dose delivered during interventional radiological procedures would be possible, without compromising {{the integrity of the}} image data that modern <b>x-ray</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> systems produce. An image driven system control paradigm is proposed whereby photon redundancy can be reduced by dynamically configuring a <b>fluoroscopy</b> system's <b>x-ray</b> tube and collimation unit, based upon information extracted from the image data that the system produces. This thesis details the design of a demonstrator system that is capable of routinely simulating the image data that would be produced if image driven system control techniques were integrated into existing fluoroscopy system designs. A sixth order autoregressive time series prediction algorithm uses therapeutic device positional data extracted from images derived from interventional neuroradiological procedures, to predict the future behaviour of therapeutic devices in the image plane. This prediction data is used by high level system control algorithms to configure the fluoroscopy system on a frame-by-frame basis, according to the criterion of reducing photon redundancy. Image sequences generated by the simulation system have been submitted to a practising interventional neuroradiologist for subjective assessment, to determine the reduction in procedural dose that can be achieved without compromising the integrity of the clinically relevant data that they contain. The results of these assessments indicate that procedural dose can be reduced by a factor in excess of 7 using the image driven system control techniques proposed.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{aimed to}} {{construct}} an augmented reality-based visualization system to support intravascular neurosurgery and evaluate it in clinical environments. Three-dimensional (3 D) vascular models are overlaid on motion pictures from <b>X-ray</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> by 2 D/ 3 D registration using fiducial markers. The models are reconstructed from 3 D data obtained from X-ray computed tomographic angiography or from magnetic resonance angiography using the marching-cube algorithm. Intraop-erative X-ray images are mapped as texture patterns on a screen object which is displayed with the vascular models. Distortion of <b>X-ray</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> is eliminated by a new technique of screen mesh deformation. A quantity called reprojection distance was introduced to evaluate {{the reliability of the}} displayed images. It predicts the maximum registration error around the registered objects. Analyses of reprojection distances were performed using synthetic data consisting of marker coordinates with 2 D or 3 D errors. The tolerance of reprojection distance for the clinical environment was determined to be 3. 0 mm. The system was tested in two clinical cases in which reprojection distances of 2. 6 and 2. 09 mm were obtained. Construction and evaluation of our prototype system were successfully carried out.

40|$|In current {{clinical}} practice, {{medical imaging}} {{plays a key}} role in diagnosis, therapy planning and therapy monitoring. Some of these modalities, such as CT, MRI, and 3 D ultrasound, provide high resolution volumetric anatomical information, and more recently, 3 D imaging in time. In certain practical situations, however, limitations with respect to imaging time, space, radiation dose, or ergonomics make it impossible to acquire such rich data. In such cases, imaging may be performed that is of lower dimensionality than the desired information, or is sparse in at least one of the dimensions. This type of sparse imaging is investigated in this thesis. Sparse imaging is typically employed in image guided interventions and surgeries, where high speed, high image resolution and an open acquisition setup are of major importance. The 3 D position of the surgical instruments with respect to the 3 D patient anatomy is then assessed through 2 D imaging such as <b>X-ray</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> or Ultra-soun. For similar reasons mono- and biplane <b>X-ray</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> became the standard for kinematic analysis of joints, allowing the acquisition of a wide range of motions, such as running and jumping.

Also, assessment of organ motion, such as cardiac or respiratory motion, can occur from temporally sparse CT images...|$|R
