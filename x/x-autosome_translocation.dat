50|$|In Montana, Opitz {{continued}} {{research in}} genetic syndromes, often collaborating with Phil D. Pallister, {{leading to the}} discovery of several syndromes including the Pallister-Hall, KBG, and Pallister-Killian syndrome. This collaboration also led {{to the discovery of}} the first human <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation</b> which, according to McKusick, was a jumping off point for the era of chromosome mapping.|$|E
50|$|Its {{karyotype}} has 2n = 18 and FN = 32 {{in females}} but has 2n = 19 in males. Due to an <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation,</b> S. delicatus has an XY1Y2 sex chromosome system, rare in mammals. During meiotic prophase, a male's X and two Y chromosomes form a trivalent. The female value of 18 {{is the lowest}} diploid number of any species in the tribe Phyllotini. Given that close relative Andalgalomys pearsoni has the highest known diploid number (78) of the tribe, it appears that major chromosome restructuring occurred during {{the evolution of the}} Andalgalomys-Salinomys clade.|$|E
50|$|The {{content of}} a {{chromosome}} would be changed mainly by mutation after duplication of the chromosome and translocation with other chromosomes. However, in mammals, since the chromosomal sex-determination mechanism would have been established in their earlier stages of evolution, polyploidy would have not occurred due to its incompatibility with the sex-determining mechanism. Moreover, <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation</b> would have been prohibited because it might have resulted in detrimental effects for survival to the organism. Thus in mammals, the content of X chromosomes has been conserved after typical 2 round duplication events at early ancestral stages of evolution, at the fish or amphibia (2R hypothesis).|$|E
40|$|To further an {{understanding}} of the mechanism of constitutional chromosomal rearrangement, the translocation breakpoints of two <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations</b> carried by females with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy have been mapped, cloned and sequenced. Breakpoints were mapped to specific introns within the dystrophin gene and intron sequences spanning the two breakpoints were cloned and used as probes to identify DNA fragments containing the translocation junctions. The junction-containing fragments were cloned after amplification by inverse PCR or single-specific-primer PCR. Sequence through the junctions and the autosomal regions spanning the breakpoints identified the mechanism of rearrangement as non-homologous exchange with minor additions or deletions (0 - 8 nucleotides) at the breakpoints. Paternal origin of these <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations,</b> coupled with evidence for non-transmission of <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations</b> through male meiosis suggested that the translocations were the result of a post-meiotic rearrangement in spermiogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{evidence}} {{had shown}} that, when a mammalian X-chromosome is {{broken by a}} translocation, {{only one of the}} two X-chromosome segments shows cytological signs of X-inactivation in the form of late replication or Kanda staining. In the two mouse <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations</b> T(X; 4) 37 H and T(X; 11) 38 H the X-chromosome break is in the A 1 -A 2 bands; in both, the shorter translocation product fails to exhibit Kanda staining. By in situ hybridization, the locus of ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OCT) was shown to be proximal to the breakpoint (i. e. on the short product) in T 37 H and distal to the breakpoint in T 38 H. Histochemical staining for OCT showed that in T 38 H the locus of OCT undergoes random inactivation, as in a chromosomally normal animal, whereas in T 37 H the OCT locus remains active in all cells. The interpretation is that, when a segment of X-chromosome is physically separated from the X-inactivation centre, it fails to undergo inactivation. This point is important for the under-standing of the mechanism of X-inactivation, since it implies that inactivation is a positive process, brought about by some event that travels along the chromosome. It is also relevant to the interpretation of the harmful effects of <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations</b> and the abnormalities seen in individuals carrying such translocations...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} unique and complex karyotypic {{rearrangement}} involving chromosomes X, 3, 7, and 21. Blood cells and fibroblasts from the proband do not express the maternal allele for glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD), providing biochemical evidence for nonrandom expression of X-linked genes in balanced <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations.</b> The break point on the X chromosome, at the junction of Xq 27 -Xq 28, separates the loci for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and G 6 PD. Studies of mouse-human hybrids derived from the proband's cells indicate that G 6 PD, at q 28, is clearly distal to all other X loci now assigned. From these and previous studies, we can localize HPRT to that segment between Xq 26 and Xq 27. The studies also provide further evidence for {{the stability of the}} inactive X phenotype in hybrid cells...|$|R

Thus, we {{confirmed that the}} recently suggested EdU approach can be simply adapted for routine diagnostic use. The latter is important, as only by knowing the real pattern of the skewed X-chromosome inactivation, correct interpretation of obtained results and subsequent reliable genetic counseling, can be done...|$|E
40|$|Reported {{cases with}} a {{structurally}} abnormal X chromosome were compiled. These included 17 balanced and 26 unbalanced <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations,</b> each with inactivation of either a derivative X or a derivative {{of any of}} the autosomes. A further 52 cases with various structural rearrangements were studied. The shortest late-replicating segment in each arm pter leads to p 21 and q 13 leads to qter. In both cases, they were detected in all or most metaphases, thus making the results convincing. In one case, the distal part of Xq, q 25 or 26 leads to qter was probably inactivated in a small proportion of the cells. It appears reasonable to assume that the former two segments and probably also the third include an "inactivation center(s).

40|$|The {{frequencies}} of newly induced male-sterilizing lesions {{on both the}} X and Y chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster were determined after either 4000 r of γ-irradiation or adult feeding of ethyl methanesulfonate. The Y chromosome is approximately twice as sensitive as the X chromosome to newly induced male-sterilizing lesions after γ-irradiation, but slightly less sensitive after ethyl methanesulfonate treatment. A {{large proportion of the}} radiation-induced lesions are associated with Y-autosome or <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations,</b> with the Y chromosome recovered in translocations far in excess of the frequency expected from metaphase lengths. Although translocations between the X and Y chromosomes or between autosomes do not appear to sterilize heterozygous males, interchanges between sex chromosomes and autosomes often sterilize males carrying them in a dominant manner, suggesting that the organization of the genome is critical for normal spermatogenesis. Complementation tests between recessive Y-linked male-sterilizing mutants do not reveal the existence of any additional fertility loci beyond the six previously defined...|$|R
40|$|Meiotic sex {{chromosome}} inactivation (MSCI) {{is an essential}} epigenetic process, which transcriptionally silences X and Y chromosomes during spermatogenesis. It is accompanied by substantial chromatin remodeling resulting in a formation of so called sex or XY body, which is a characteristic of male pachytene spermatocytes. In spite of MSCI indispensability for male fertility, its biological role and molecular nature still remain rather unclear. However, the described link between chromosomal asynapsis and transcriptional silencing demonstrated that MSCI is tightly associated with the asynapsis of largely non-homologous {{sex chromosome}}s and is a specific form of more general mechanism called meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC). The essential role of MSCI was demonstrated using mouse models, such as carriers of X- autosome translocations, where anomalous synapsis of sex chromosomes leads to impairment of MSCI and male sterility. Intriguingly, the exclusive spermatogenic arrest is a hallmark of not only <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations</b> but even various autosomal rearrangements, including autosomal translocations, inversions, or other structural mutations.

40|$|We {{report on}} a 2 -year-old girl with situs ambiguus {{comprising}} right-sided stomach and spleen, left-sided liver and complex cardiac defect. Psychomotor development of this patient was normal, and no other major abnormalities were present. Chromosome analysis revealed a de novo balanced chromosome translocation t(X; 1) (q 26;p 13. 1). Molecular cytogenetic investigations identified a breakpoint spanning BAC clone on the X-chromosome containing the ZIC 3 gene. Mutations in ZIC 3 are associated with situs ambiguus and cardiac defects predominantly in males.

40|$|A {{young female}} was {{diagnosed}} as having X-linked muscular dystrophy of the Duchenne type. Chromosome studies, including trypsin-Giemsa banding, Quinacrine fluorescence, and nucleolus organizer region (NOR) silver staining revealed an X-autosome reciprocal translocation t(X; 21) (p 21;p 12). Utilizing both [3 H] thymidine autoradiography and the BrdU-Hoechst 33258 -Giemsa technique, lymphocytes and fibroblasts were found to show a preferential inactivation of the normal X suggesting {{the presence of a}} single mutant gene on the translocated X.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo present {{perinatal}} findings, {{modes of}} ascertainment and parental decision in balanced reciprocal translocations detected at amniocentesis. Materials and MethodsBetween January 1987 and August 2010, 82 cases {{with a simple}} reciprocal translocation, two cases with two separate simple reciprocal translocations and three cases with a complex chromosome rearrangement (CCR) were diagnosed by amniocentesis at Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. The 87 cases originated from 76 families; 65 families with one case and 11 families with two cases. ResultsIn the 76 families, the main modes of ascertainment included advanced maternal age (n= 38), a previous child with an unbalanced reciprocal translocation (n= 11), recurrent miscarriage (n = 9), abnormal maternal serum screening results (n = 9), elective causes (n = 5), a previous child with congenital anomalies (n = 2) and abnormal ultrasound findings (n = 2). In these families, there were 17 (22. 4 %) de novo cases including 14 simple translocations and three CCRs. Of 14 de novo cases with a simple translocation, one (7. 1 %) manifested a congenital malformation, which was related to an <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation,</b> and four (28. 6 %) were terminated. Of three de novo CCRs, two manifested congenital anomalies and one was terminated. In 87 cases, additional aneuploidy was noted in two cases including one inherited simple translocation with Turner syndrome, and one de novo CCR with concomitant deletions and duplication. ConclusionBalanced reciprocal translocations detected at amniocentesis {{may be associated with}} fetal anomalies in cases of concomitant aneuploidy, de novo <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation</b> or de novo CCR. Genetic counseling of a de novo simple reciprocal translocation at amniocentesis remains difficult because approximately one-fourth of the parents opt for termination of the pregnancy, and detailed ultrasonography and array comparative genomic hybridization are helpful for parental counseling under such circumstances...|$|E
40|$|Balanced <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations</b> are rare, {{and female}} {{carriers}} are a clinically heterogeneous group of patients, with phenotypically normal women, history of recurrent miscarriage, gonadal dysfunction, X-linked disorders or congenital abnormalities, and/or developmental delay. We investigated {{a patient with}} a de novo X; 19 translocation. The six-year-old girl has been evaluated due to hyperactivity, social interaction impairment, stereotypic and repetitive use of language with echolalia, failure to follow parents/caretakers orders, inconsolable outbursts, and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. The girl has normal cognitive function. Her measurements are within normal range, and no other abnormalities were found during physical, neurological, or dysmorphological examinations. Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed a de novo balanced translocation, with the karyotype 46,X,t(X; 19) (p 21. 2;q 13. 4). Replication banding showed a clear preference for inactivation of the normal X chromosome. The translocation was confirmed by FISH and Spectral Karyotyping (SKY). Although abnormal phenotypes associated with de novo balanced chromosomal rearrangements {{may be the result}} of disruption of a gene at one of the breakpoints, submicroscopic deletion or duplication, or a position effect, X; autosomal translocations are associated with additional unique risk factors including X-linked disorders, functional autosomal monosomy, or functional X chromosome disomy resulting from the complex X-inactivation process...|$|R
40|$|The African pygmy mice, {{subgenus}} Nannomys, {{constitute the}} most speciose lineage {{of the genus}} Mus with 19 recognized species. Although morphologically very similar, they exhibit considerable chromosomal diversity which is here confirmed and extended by the G-banding analysis of 65 mice from West and South Africa. On {{the basis of their}} karyotype and distribution area, the specimens were assigned to at least five species. Extensive differentiation both within and between species was observed that involved almost exclusively Robertsonian translocations, 23 of which are newly described. Two of the rearrangements were sex chromosome-autosome translocations, associated in some cases with partial deletions of the X or Y chromosomes. Several authors have predicted that the highly deleterious effect of this rearrangement would be reduced if the sex and autosomal segments were insulated by a block of centromeric heterochromatin. The C-banding analyses performed showed that among the species carrying <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations,</b> one followed the expected pattern, while the other did not. In this case, functional isolation of the sex and autosome compartments must involve other repetitive sequences or genomic traits that require further molecular characterization.

40|$|An {{examination}} of synaptic {{data from a}} series of <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations</b> and crossover data from an extensive series of autosome-autosome translocations and autosomal inversions in mice has lead {{to the development of a}} hypothesis which predicts synaptic and recombinational behavior of chromosomal aberrations during meiosis. This hypothesis predicts that in heterozygotes for chromosomal rearrangements that meiotically align G-light chromatin with G-light chromatin lack of homology will be recognized. If homologous synapsis cannot proceed, synaptonemal complex formation will cease and there will be no physical suppression of crossing over in such rearrangements. However, if a chromosomal rearrangement aligns G-light chromatin with G-dark chromatin at the time of synapsis, lack of homology will not be recognized and synaptonemal complex formation will proceed nonhomologously through the G-dark chromatin. Crossing over will be physically suppressed in this region and this suppression of crossing over will be confined to the chromosome in which the G-light chromatin is nonhomologously synapsed with G-dark chromatin. When G-light chromatin is once again aligned with G-light chromatin, lack of homology again will be recognized and either homologous synapsis will be reinitiated (as in an inversion loop), or will cease altogether (as in some translocations). Unlike the previously described ``synaptic adjustment,'' this nonhomologous synapsis of G-light with G-dark chromatin appears to compete with homologous synapsis during early pachynema...|$|R
40|$|Drosophila nasuta albomicans (with 2 n = 6), {{contains}} {{a pair of}} metacentric neo-sex chromosomes. Phylogenetically these are products, of centric fusion between ancestral sex (X, Y) chromosomes and an autosome (chromosome 3). The polytene chromosome complement of males with a neo-X- and neo-Y-chromosomes has revealed asynchrony in replication between the two arms of the neo-sex chromosomes. The arm which represents the ancestral X-chromosome is faster replicating than the arm which represents ancestral autosome. The latter arm of the neo-sex chromosome is synchronous with other autosomes of the complement. We conclude that one arm of the neo-X/Y is still mimicking the features of an autosome while the other arm has the features of a classical X/Y-chromosome, This <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation</b> differs from the other evolutionary X-autosome translocations known in certain species of Drosophila...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of the Giemsa-banding patterns of the X chromosomes in various mammalian species including man indicates that two major bands (A and B), which are resistant to trypsin and urea-treatments, are always present irrespective of the gross morphology of the X chromosomes. This is true in all mammalian species with the "original or standard type" X chromosomes (5 – 6 % of the haploid genome) thus far analyzed. In the unusually large-sized X chromosomes the extra chromosomal material may be due either to the addition of genetically inert constitutive heterochromatin or to an <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation.</b> In these X chromosomes two major bands {{are present in the}} actual X-chromosome segment.

40|$|Abstract. Meiosis I {{in males}} of the Dipteran $ciara coprophila {{results in the}} nonrandom {{distribution}} of maternally and paternally derived chromosome sets to the two division products. Based on an earlier study (Kubai, D. E 1982. J.

40|$|BACKGROUND: One of the {{frequent}} reasons for unsuccessful conception is premature ovarian failure/primary ovarian insufficiency (POF/POI) that {{is defined as}} the loss of functional follicles below the age of 40 years. Among the genetic causes the most common one involves the X chromosome, as in Turner syndrome, partial X deletion and <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations.</b> Here we report a case of a 27 -year-old female patient referred to genetic counselling because of premature ovarian failure. The aim of this case study to perform molecular genetic and cytogenetic analyses in order to identify the exact genetic background of the pathogenic phenotype. RESULTS: For premature ovarian failure disease diagnostics we performed the Fragile mental retardation 1 gene analysis using Southern blot technique and Repeat Primed PCR in order to identify the relationship between the Fragile mental retardation 1 gene premutation status and the premature ovarion failure disease. At this early onset, the premature ovarian failure affected patient we detected one normal allele of Fragile mental retardation 1 gene and we couldn't verify the methylated allele, therefore we performed the cytogenetic analyses using G-banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization methods and a high resolution molecular cytogenetic method, the array comparative genomic hybridization technique. For this patient applying the G-banding, we identified a large deletion on the X chromosome at the critical region (ChrX q 21. 31 -q 28) which is associated with the premature ovarian failure phenotype. In order to detect the exact breakpoints, we used a special cytogenetic array ISCA plus CGH array and we verified a 67. 355 Mb size loss at the critical region which include total 795 genes. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude for this case study that the karyotyping is definitely helpful in the evaluation of premature ovarian failure patients, to identify the non submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangement, and using the array CGH technique we can contribute to the most efficient detection and mapping of exact deletion breakpoints of the deleted Xq region...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To map the X-chromosome and {{autosome}} breakpoints {{in women}} with balanced X-autosome translocations and primary amenorrhea, searching candidate genomic loci for female infertility. Design: Retrospective and case-control study. Setting: University-based research laboratory. Patient(s) : Three women with balanced <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation</b> and primary amenorrhea. Intervention(s) : Conventional cytogenetic methods, genomic array, array painting, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Karyotype, copy number variation, breakpoint mapping, and gene expression levels. Result(s) : All patients presented with breakpoints in the Xq 13 q 21 region. in two patients, the X-chromosome breakpoint disrupted coding sequences (KIAA 2022 and ZDHHC 15 genes). Although both gene disruptions caused absence of transcription in peripheral blood, {{there is no evidence}} that supports the involvement of these genes with ovarian function. the ZDHHC 15 gene belongs to a conserved syntenic region that encompasses the FGF 16 gene, which plays a role in female germ line development. the break in the FGF 16 syntenic block may have disrupted the interaction between the FGF 16 promoter and its cis-regulatory element. in the third patient, although both breakpoints are intergenic, a gene that plays a role in the DAX 1 pathway (FHL 2 gene) flanks distally the autosome breakpoint. the FHL 2 gene may be subject to position effect due to the attachment of an autosome segment in Xq 21 region. Conclusion(s) : the etiology of primary amenorrhea in balanced <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation</b> patients may underlie more complex mechanisms than interruption of specific X-linked candidate genes, such as position effect. the fine mapping of the rearrangement breakpoints may be a tool for identifying genetic pathogenic mechanisms for primary amenorrhea.

They present with short stature, cardiac and skeletal abnormalities and hearing loss. Variants of unknown significance in AMMECR 1 in four male patients from two families with partially overlapping phenotypes were previously reported. AMMECR 1 is co-expressed with genes implicated in cell cycle regulation, five of which were previously associated with growth and bone alterations. Our knockdown of the zebrafish orthologous gene resulted in phenotypes reminiscent of patients’ features. The increased transcript and encoded protein levels of AMMECR 1 L, an AMMECR 1 paralog, in the t(X; 9) patient's cells indicate a possible partial compensatory mechanism. AMMECR 1 and AMMECR 1 L proteins dimerize and localize to the nucleus as suggested by their nucleic acid-binding RAGNYA folds.

At this stage there is no simple explanation to account for all types of inactivation patterns encountered in the 14 balanced and 15 unbalanced cases of X-autosome translocations reported to date. Selection of X inactivation is not an inherent characteristic of the X chromosome per se, and it is not dependent on the direction of chromosomal exchange, as was suggested previously.

40|$|Eight {{dominant}} X-chromosome nondisjunction mutants {{have been}} identified and characterized. Hermaphrodites (XX) heterozygous for {{any one of the}} mutations produce 20 – 35 % male (XO) self-progeny compared with the wild-type frequency of 0. 2 %. Seven of the eight mutants carry <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations.</b> Three of these, represented by mnT 2, involve linkage group (LG) II and show severe crossover suppression for X-linked markers. The two half-translocations comprising mnT 2 are separable and of very unequal size. The smaller one includes the left tip of X and the right end of LGII and can exist as a free duplication, being present in addition to the normal chromosome complement, in either hermaphrodites or males; it has no effect on X nondisjunction. The reciprocal half-translocation of mnT 2 includes the bulk of both LGII and X chromosomes; it disjoins regularly from a normal LGII and confers the property of X-chromosome nondisjunction. A fourth translocation, mnT 10 (V;X), is also reciprocal and consists of half-translocations that recombine with V and X, respectively. Either half-translocation of mnT 10 can exist in heterozygous form {{in the absence of the}} other to give heterozygous duplication-deficiency animals; the property of X-chromosome nondisjunction is conferred, in homozygotes as well as heterozygotes, solely by one of the half-translocations, which is deficient for the left tip of the X. The final three translocations have X breakpoints near the right end of X and autosomal breakpoints near the right end of LGIV, the left end of LGV and the right end of LGI, respectively. All three are homozygous inviable. Males hemizygous for the X portion of any of the seven translocations are viable and fertile. The final mutant, mn 164, maps as a point at or near the left tip of the X and causes X-chromosome nondisjunction in both heterozygotes and homozygotes. In heterozygotes, mn 164 promotes equational nondisjunction of itself but not its wild-type allele. The mutants are discussed in light of the holocentric nature of the C. elegans chromosomes. It is proposed that the left end of the X chromosome plays a critical structural role in the segregation of X chromosomes during meiosis in XX animals...|$|R
40|$|Histological and cytological {{analyses}} of the testes were carried out in 42 sterile sons of males treated in the spermatozoal or spermatid stage with 250 mg/kg ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) alone or after prefeeding with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT); or treated with 200 R X-rays. Of the 42 sterile males, 17 had some mature spermatids, nine were blocked at diakinesis, 15 were blocked in pachytene, and one lacked spermatogenic cells altogether, having Sertoli cells only. Mitotic (spermatogonial) metaphases could therefore be analyzed in 41 of the males and meiotic configurations in 26. —(1) None of the males showed abnormalities in chromosome number, such as monosomy, trisomy, or mosaicism for either of these conditions. Certain classes of chromosome abnormalities {{that have been found}} associated with male sterility in other investigations, namely trisomies, XXY's, and <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocations,</b> are not expected from treatment of 19 A + Y cells when F 1 males are studied. (2) A very high percentage of the sterile males carried translocations. Direct meiotic evidence for this was found in 22 of the animals. In addition, 11 of the 16 that were blocked (or virtually blocked) in pachytene, and thus could be analyzed in mitosis only, consistently showed one abnormally short chromosome (or, one short plus one long), which presumably had resulted from unequal exchange (or sizable deficiency). Of the meiotically detected translocation males, 1 carried a T(A;Y), 17 had single autosomal translocations, and 4 had multiple autosomal rearrangements involving three, four, four, and six breaks, respectively. In addition, three males showed failure of X-Y pairing. (3) Translocations that cause sterility, rather than partial sterility, in males appear to be those in which {{at least one of the}} breaks occurs close to one end of a chromosome. The mitotic and meiotic evidences for this were found to be correlated. (4) It is proposed that many cases of induced F 1 male sterility may be the result of position effects produced when paracentromeric regions are translocated to euchromatic regions of certain other chromosomes. Since many translocations that produce partial sterility in the female cause complete sterility in the male, the male must be assumed to be more susceptible to disturbances of fertility by the postulated mechanism. (5) There is evidence that EMS, especially in the lower dose range, more often breaks chromosomes near one of their ends than does X-irradiation...|$|R
40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{characteristic of}} human reproduction {{is the very}} high prevalence of spontaneous abortion, which frequently {{has been associated with}} major chromosomal abnormalities. The various forms of maternal–fetal red cell incompatibility and their potentially adverse effects on human fertility are well understood, and during the last 15 years of the twentieth century there was vigorous debate as to whether couples who share HLA-DR and/or HLA-B alleles are subfertile. The most common genetic disorders associated with primary infertility in females are the chromosome abnormality Turner Syndrome (monosomy X), and Stein–Leventhal Syndrome (poly-cystic ovarian disease) which has a more complex and somewhat poorly defined genetic aetiology. A much wider spectrum of genetic defects can cause infertility in males, including Klinefelter Syndrome, <b>X-autosome</b> reciprocal <b>translocation,</b> Y-chromosome micro-deletions, congenital absence of the vas deferens, most commonly observed as part of the cystic fibrosis phenotype, and obstructive azoospermia in patients with Young Syndrome. Successful pregnancies can be initiated in the majority of individuals with these disorders; for example, using donated oocytes or embryos in women with Turner Syndrome, and intracytoplasmic injection of sperm (ICSI) collected from men with Klinefelter Syndrome or congenital absence of the vas deferens. In some disorders, such as Y-linked microdeletions, there may be a high risk of transmission to progeny following fertilization via ICSI, which has caused concerns on dysgenic grounds. Preimplantation diagnosis has been used to monitor such embryos...|$|R
40|$|Robertsonian and {{reciprocal}} chromosomal trans-locations are {{the most}} frequent type of structural chro-mosomal aberrations in the human population. We report the frequency and type of detected transloca-tions in 10 years of prenatal diagnosis of 3800 prenatal samples. The materials came from amniocentesis and chorionic villus samples (CVS). We detected seven Robertsonian translocations (0. 18 %), eight autosomal reciprocal translocations (0. 21 %) and one sex chro-mosome translocation (0. 03 %). The overall frequency of all translocations was 0. 42 %. Balanced state trans-locations were 0. 29 % {{and the frequency of}} translo-cations in an unbalanced state was 0. 13 %. There was one balanced de novo <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation</b> [46,X,t(X; 10) (p 11. 23;q 22. 3) ] and one balanced dou-ble translocation [46,XX,t(1; 21);t(7; 16) (1 p 21; 21 q 11) (7 q 31; 16 q 23) ] inherited from the mother. Most of the detected translocations were the result of unknown familial translocations, but some of them had been previously detected in one of the parents. In order to detect the recurrence risk for future pregnancies, we proposed genetic counseling in each of the cases and we established whether the parents were heterozygous for the same translocation. Histopatological findings for some unbalanced translocations correlated with phenotypes of detected unbalanced karyotypes...|$|E

All three human X-linked markers studied, i. e., hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyl transferase (EC 2. 4. 2. 8), glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 49), and phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2. 7. 2. 3), were present together, or absent together, {{in most of these}} clones and sublines. However, loss or retention of only phosphoglycerate kinase was occasionally observed, {{even in the absence of}} selective growth, while no evidence of separation of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase from glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase occurred. Cytological examination of eight man-hamster clonal lines by the quinacrine fluorescent technique showed that human phosphoglycerate kinase was only present when the translocation chromosome carrying most of the long arm of the X chromosome was present. The presence of human glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase was not related to the presence or absence of this chromosome, but appeared to be correlated with the presence of the other translocation chromosome...|$|E
40|$|Chromosomal translocations {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} important, yet uncommon, causes of primary amenorrhea and gonadal dysgenesis. Although X-autosome translocations are frequently associated with streak gonads and clinical features of the Turner syndrome, the majority of X-autosome carriers may present with a variable phenotype, developmental delay, and recognizable X-linked syndrome due to nonrandom X-inactivation. In this article, we describe a healthy 15. 5 -year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, gonadal dysgenesis, and tall stature without other manifestations of the Turner syndrome. Relevant clinical, biochemical, endocrinological, and cytogenetical evaluations were performed. Initial investigations revealed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (FSH= 134  mIU/mL [normal= 10 – 15  mIU/mL], LH= 47. 5 [normal= 10 – 15  mIU/mL], and estradiol= 24. 3 pmol/L). On ultrasound examination of the pelvis, streak ovaries with a hypoplastic uterus were noted. Chromosome study, performed according to routine procedures, revealed an apparently balanced reciprocal translocation involving the short arm of chromosome 1 (p 2) and the long arm of the X chromosome (q 2) in all the cells with the following karyotype: 46,X,t(1;X) (p 13;q 22). She was placed on hormone replacement therapy. In our patient, <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation</b> was associated with gonadal dysgenesis and tall stature. We conclude that t(X; 1) may be associated with gonadal dysgenesis without other congenital abnormalities. To our knowledge, normal phenotype with gonadal dysgenesis and tall stature in association with t(X; 1) translocation has not been previously reported...|$|E
40|$|There {{are marked}} {{qualitative}} and quantitative differences in the patterns of chromosomal damage observed after irradiation of spermatogonia, spermatozoa and oocytes of mice. These differences often result from reduced or zero transmission of particular classes of abberration arising in pre-meiotic germ cells. Probably {{this is the reason}} why the level of X-chromosomal and autosomal monosomy is not increased after spermatogonial irradiation. Similarly, the reduced transmission of certain d–se deficiencies may help to explain their low F 1 frequency after pre-meiotic as compared with later irradiation. Spermatozoal irradiation has revealed no Robertsonian translocations, but has produced some types of reciprocal translocations which apparently are not transmitted to the F 1 after spermatogonial treatment because they prevent maturation of the male pre-meiotic germ cell. Thus they cause sterility in males, but not in females. They include <b>X-autosome</b> and Y-autosome <b>translocations,</b> those giving a metacentric or sub-metacentric chromosome (with reciprocal product present) and those in which one break-point is in or near the centromeric heterochromatin while the other is more distally placed. This last group (which grades into male sub-fertile conditions) gives a preponderance of chain configurations (often with one separate univalent) in heterozygotes of both sexes at meiosis and a high incidence of somatic marker chromosomes. Nondisjunction associated with the univalent generates tertiary trisomics, which are usually male-sterile also and may show phenotypic abnormalities. Sterile males with complete separation of X and Y chromosomes have also been reported after mutagenic treatment of meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells. Such separation seems to prevent a primary spermatocyte from forming a secondary one. The usual derivation (in mouse and man) of tertiary trisomics from mothers rather than from fathers may be due to a similar block, together with a general tendency for male heterozygotes for the parental balanced translocation to be sterile or sub-fertile. Mature oocytes tend to resemble spermatoza in the types of aberration produced by irradiation, which include the male-sterile translocation, but more data are needed. Many of the aberrations described contribute to the human cytogenetic load and can be studied in the mouse from this point of view...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{construction}} of a comparative chromosome map between the emblematic laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus (RNO), and Delacour's Marmoset rat, Hapalomys delacouri (HDE), based on cross-species fluorescence in situ hybridization with R. norvegicus painting probes. Sixteen R. norvegicus chromosomes (RNO 3 - 6, 8, 10 - 15, 17 - 20, and X) were retained in their entirety (as a conserved block or as a single chromosome) in the H. delacouri genome. The remaining 5 R. norvegicus chromosomes (RNO 1, 2, 7, 9, and 16) produced 2 signals in the H. delacouri karyotype. Our analysis allowed the detection of an <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation</b> between RNO X and 11 that occurred convergently in an unrelated species, Bandicota savilei, and a single B chromosome that accounts for the 2 n = 48 karyotype observed in this specimen. In total, the rat chromosome paints revealed 27 segments of conserved synteny in H. delacouri. The analysis showed 7 NOR bearing pairs in H. delacouri (HDE 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 13) and the occurrence of an interstitial telomeric signal at the centromeric regions of 8 H. delacouri chromosomes (HDE 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, and 22). These data, together with published comparative maps, enabled a revision of the previously postulated murine ancestral condition suggesting that it probably comprised a wholly acrocentric karyotype with 2 n = 46 - 50.

40|$|Published reports {{show that}} male {{carriers}} of an <b>X-autosome</b> <b>translocation,</b> which is either inherited {{from their mother}} or is de novo, are generally sterile, regardless {{of the position of}} the breakpoint in the X chromosome. We report a three-generation propagation of such a translocation in a family with a case of male factor infertility. Due to the condition of severe oligozoospermia, the proband and his wife underwent ICSI, which resulted in the birth of a normal healthy female. Cytogenetic (chromosome) analyses and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) assays were done on the family. The cytogenetic analysis of the proband, a man with severe oligozoospermia, revealed an X-autosomal translocation, 46,Y,t(X; 20) (q 10;q 10), which was inherited from his mother. His brother had the same translocation. Amniocentesis and post-natal umbilical cord analyses revealed that the female infant carried the same translocation as her father. XCI studies showed highly skewed inactivation of the normal X chromosome in the female infant, her paternal grandmother, and her mother who had a normal karyotype. In contrast to the data from the literature, our study suggests that men with a certain type of X-autosomal translocation could conceive children through ICSI in conditions in which a few spermatogonia are able to complete meiosis II. The literature involving X-autosomal translocation in males is also reviewed and the importance of the study of X-chromosomal inactivation in female infants discussed.
