5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name <b>Xanax,</b> is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E
5|$|The benzodiazepines {{diazepam}} (Valium) and oxazepam (Serepax) {{have been}} found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than alprazolam (<b>Xanax),</b> temazepam (Restoril/Normison), or lorazepam (Temesta/Ativan). Factors that determine the risk of psychological dependence or physical dependence and the severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during dose reduction of alprazolam include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross-dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines, and method of discontinuation.|$|E
5|$|Following the reconciliation, a USA Today story {{detailed}} White's situation. Although White endured 20 flights {{for travel}} during his season at Iowa State, the Rockets' NBA schedule called for 98 flights. White {{had attempted to}} cope with travel in college through use of Benadryl and <b>Xanax,</b> but found both reduced his energy level, although it never showed in his statistical output. White cited that his concern for the increased number of flights and long term use {{of these types of}} medication could lead to dependence and addiction (which is common concern and a point of consensus concern regarding benzodiazepines in the medical community. White likened mental health conditions to a day-to-day physical injury in which symptoms can be dynamic and unclear, but support and policy should be adequately proactive).|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{was first}} {{released}} by Upjohn (now {{a part of}} Pfizer) in 1981. The first approved use was of panic disorder, and within two years of its original marketing, <b>Xanax</b> became a blockbuster drug in the US. As of 2010, alprazolam is the most prescribed and the most misused benzodiazepine in the US. The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and {{similar to that of}} other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the high affinity binding, high potency, short elimination half-life, and rapid onset of action may increase the misuse potential of alprazolam. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. Alprazolam is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).|$|E

25|$|Toxicology reports {{confirmed}} Sandra's {{statement that}} she had given Travis Xanax-laced tea {{the day of the}} attack, which could have exacerbated his aggression. <b>Xanax</b> is a short acting potent anti-anxiety drug that can cause disinhibition and disorientation and occasionally paradoxical reactions of hallucination, aggression, rage and mania.|$|E
25|$|Primidone is not {{the only}} {{anticonvulsant}} used for essential tremor; the others include topiramate (Topamax) and gabapentin (Neurontin). Other pharmacological agents include alprazolam (<b>Xanax),</b> clonazepam (Klonopin), atenolol, sotalol, nadolol, clozapine, nimodipine, and botilinum toxin A. Many of these drugs were less effective (according to Table 1), but a few were not. Only propranolol has been compared to primidone in a clinical trial.|$|E
25|$|<b>Xanax</b> and {{hydrocodone}} {{were also}} found in Chris Benoit's system, at levels investigators called consistent with therapeutic use. Elevated levels of synthetic anabolic steroid testosterone cypionate were found in his urine; investigators believed that the level found suggested it had been taken recently. While the synthetic anabolic steroid testosterone cypionate was found in his urine, {{there was no evidence}} of GHB contrary to speculation. Benoit also tested negative for blood alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Silverman {{became a}} {{vegetarian}} {{at the age}} of ten. She is open about her lifelong battle with clinical depression, which at one point led to her developing an addiction to <b>Xanax.</b> She credited her subsequent emotional health to taking the prescription drug Zoloft. She struggled with bedwetting {{from the time she was}} young until well into her teens and stated in a 2007 interview that she had wet the bed recently.|$|E
25|$|Several large {{quantities}} of illicitly produced fentanyl have been seized by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In June 2006, 945 grams (2.08 lbs) of 83 %-pure fentanyl powder was seized by Border Patrol agents in California from a vehicle that had entered from Mexico. Mexico {{is the source of}} much of the illicit fentanyl for sale in the U.S. However, in April 2006, there was one domestic fentanyl lab discovered by law enforcement in Azusa, California. The lab was a source of counterfeit 80mg OxyContin tablets containing fentanyl instead of oxycodone, as well as bulk fentanyl and other drugs. In November 2016, the DEA uncovered an operation making counterfeit oxycodone and <b>Xanax</b> from a home in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. They found about 70,000 pills in the appearance of oxycodone and more than 25,000 in the appearance of <b>Xanax.</b> The DEA reported that millions of pills could have been distributed from this location over the course of time. The accused owned a pill press and ordered fentanyl in powder form from China.|$|E
25|$|Daniel was suffocated {{and killed}} in his bedroom, {{and a copy of}} the Bible was left by his body. Daniel had {{internal}} injuries to the throat area, showing no bruises. Daniel's exact time of death is unknown. The reports determined Daniel was sedated with <b>Xanax</b> and likely unconscious when he was killed. Daniel's body had also just started to show signs of decomposition but was not as far along as his mother's body.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with standard procedure, Travis' head {{was taken to}} the state laboratory for a rabies test, and the body {{was taken to the}} University of Connecticut for a necropsy. The head tested negative for rabies, but there was <b>Xanax</b> (Alprazolam) remaining in his system. Necropsy results in May 2009 confirmed the chimp was overweight and had been stabbed. The remains were cremated at All Pets Crematory in Stamford on February 25, 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{risk factors}} for {{benzodiazepine}} dependence are long-term use beyond four weeks, use of high doses, use of potent short-acting benzodiazepines, dependent personalities, and proclivity for drug abuse. Use of short-acting benzodiazepines leads to repeated withdrawal effects that are alleviated by the next dose, which reinforce in the individual the dependence. A physical dependence develops more quickly with higher potency benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (<b>Xanax)</b> than with lower potency benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide (Librium).|$|E
25|$|<b>Xanax</b> {{was found}} in Daniel Benoit's system. District Attorney Scott Ballard noted {{this was not a}} drug that would be given to a child under normal circumstances. It is {{believed}} that Daniel was sedated prior to being murdered, with Sperry ruling out that Daniel died of a drug overdose. The GBI, however, said in the press conference that it could not perform tests for steroids or human growth hormones on Daniel {{because of a lack of}} urine.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, an {{attorney}} for Charla Nash's family filed a $50 million lawsuit against Sandra Herold. On May 6, a Stamford judge froze Herold's assets, valued at US$10 million. Other potential defendants included the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, the city of Stamford, and the veterinarian who prescribed the <b>Xanax.</b> The defense claimed the chimp had no violent behavior before the attack, and the two accusations in the 1990s attacks were untrue because the chimp had no teeth at the time.|$|E
25|$|On May 1, 2003, Hulette {{died in the}} townhouse {{they shared}} in Marietta, after mixing pills of hydrocodone, and Alprazolam (<b>Xanax)</b> with vodka. Luger was arrested after {{a search of the}} {{residence}} revealed a number of illicit controlled substances, including anabolic steroids, OxyContin, synthetic growth hormone, testosterone, and Alprazolam. He was charged with 13 felony counts of drug possession. He was released the following day on $27,500 bail. Hulette's death was eventually ruled accidental. Luger pleaded guilty to the charges and was fined $1,000, sentenced to five years probation, and ordered to undergo periodic drug tests.|$|E
25|$|At {{the press}} conference held by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on July 17, 2007, it was {{announced}} that three different drugs were found in Nancy Benoit's system: hydrocodone, hydromorphone and <b>Xanax.</b> All three drugs were found to be at levels investigators considered normal for therapeutic treatment (as opposed to recreational use or abuse.) A blood-alcohol level was found at 0.184. Dr. Kris Sperry, the medical examiner, added it was impossible to say whether any of the blood findings was due to ingestion of alcohol or the post-mortem process. It was also ruled out that Nancy was sedated by Chris before she was murdered.|$|E
25|$|King's addictions {{to alcohol}} and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he {{acknowledged}} in On Writing in 2000, he can barely remember writing Cujo. Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the rug {{in front of him}} evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of cocaine, <b>Xanax,</b> Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since. The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was Needful Things.|$|E
25|$|Flair's son David is a semi-retired {{professional}} wrestler. Flair's {{younger son}} Reid, {{who signed a}} developmental contract with WWE {{near the end of}} 2007, was an accomplished high school wrestler and made several appearances on WCW television along with his sister Ashley and half-sister Megan. In 2004, Flair became a grandfather at the age of 55, when his older daughter, Megan Fliehr Ketzner, gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Morgan Lee Ketzner on May 9. On May 17, 2012, it was reported that Flair's daughter Ashley had signed with WWE adopting the ring name, Charlotte (which was later changed to include the Flair surname). On March 29, 2013, Reid died from an accidental overdose of heroin, <b>Xanax</b> and a muscle relaxer.|$|E
25|$|As of 2014, Jameson has {{undergone}} extensive tattooing, almost completely covering {{both of her}} arms in sleeve tattoos. In 2013, self-proclaimed socialite and writer Britney Markham became Jameson's personal assistant after having met on Twitter. In a 2014 interview with LA Weekly, Markham claimed that Jameson would make requests for drugs. Markham posited that the pills of choice were <b>Xanax,</b> Ambien and Suboxone along with alcohol. At the same time, Markham denied that Jameson had been taking Oxycodone, in spite of previous rumors. Markham stated that she was assaulted and battered by Jameson following an incident in a hair salon in Los Angeles in 2013 when Jameson punched Markham in the stomach with a brass knuckles iPhone case. The blow was so severe, Markham claims she vomited blood and was hospitalized.|$|E
25|$|Bieber {{had several}} run-ins {{with the law}} around the world before his first arrest in 2014, {{including}} when {{he was accused of}} reckless driving in his neighbourhood in 2012, and charged in Brazil with vandalism in 2013. One of his neighbours in Calabasas, California, accused Bieber of throwing eggs at his home on January 9, 2014, and causing thousands of dollars of damage. On January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, together with singer Khalil on suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), driving with an over six month expired license, and resisting arrest without violence. Police said that Bieber told authorities he had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana, and taken prescription drugs. He has been released from these charges on a $2,500 bond, and lack of evidence beyond reasonable doubt as dictated in the United States court of law. A toxicology report revealed that Bieber had THC (a principal constituent of cannabis) and the anti-anxiety medication <b>Xanax</b> in his system {{at the time of his}} arrest.|$|E
500|$|The singer {{began taking}} painkillers, Valium, <b>Xanax</b> and Ativan {{to deal with}} the stress of the {{allegations}} made against him. Jackson's health had deteriorated {{to the extent that he}} canceled the remainder of his tour and went into rehabilitation. Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of a clinic and was put on Valium IV to wean him from painkillers. A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson had lost approximately 10lb (4.5kg) in weight and had stopped eating. The singer's spokesperson told reporters that Jackson was [...] "barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level". While in the clinic, Jackson took part in group and one-on-one therapy sessions.|$|E
500|$|He {{died of a}} self-inflicted {{gunshot wound}} after the {{shooting}} ended. ABC News reports that his behavior seemed to become more erratic in {{the weeks leading up}} to the shooting, and that it is believed he stopped taking medication beforehand. His girlfriend, Jessica Baty, confirmed that Kazmierczak was taking <b>Xanax</b> (anti-anxiety), Ambien (sleep aid), and Prozac (antidepressant), all of which were prescribed to him by a psychiatrist. She said that he stopped taking Prozac about three weeks prior to the February 14 shooting. She also said that, during their two-year courtship, she had never seen him display violent tendencies and she expressed bewilderment over the cause of the rampage. [...] "He was anything but a monster," [...] Baty said. [...] "He was probably the nicest, most caring person ever." ...|$|E
500|$|A biographer {{states that}} in 1993, the {{entertainer}} admitted taking Valium, <b>Xanax,</b> and Ativan {{to deal with}} the stress of the child sexual abuse allegations made against him. While Jackson himself does not mention sedatives, he stated that painkillers were prescribed to soothe excruciating pain that he was suffering after recent reconstructive surgery on his scalp resulting from his accident in 1984. A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson had lost approximately [...] in weight and had stopped eating. In a court deposition unrelated to alleged child abuse, Jackson was visibly drowsy, lacked concentration, and repeatedly slurred while speaking. He could not remember the dates of his prior album releases or names of people he had worked with. It took him several minutes to name some of his recent albums.|$|E

500|$|In August 1993, the {{relationship}} between Jackson and the press reached a boiling point when {{he was accused of}} child sexual abuse. Although never charged with a crime, Jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place. Complaints about the coverage included the media using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, accepting leaked material from the police investigation and of Jackson's alleged criminal activity in return for money, a lack of objectivity and using headlines that strongly implied Jackson's guilt. At the time, Jackson said of the media coverage, [...] "I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions." [...] Jackson began taking painkillers, Valium, <b>Xanax</b> and Ativan to deal with the stress of the allegations made against him. When he left the United States to go into rehabilitation, the media showed him little sympathy.|$|E

Soon after, Jackson's health deteriorated {{to the extent that he}} cancelled the remainder of his tour and went into rehabilitation. Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of a clinic and was put on Valium IV to wean him from painkillers. The media showed Jackson little sympathy. In 1993, The Daily Mirror held a [...] "Spot the Jacko" [...] contest, offering readers a trip to Disney World if they could correctly predict where Jackson would appear next. The same year, a Daily Express headline read [...] "Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run", while a News of the World headline accused Jackson of being a fugitive; these tabloids also falsely alleged that Jackson had travelled to Europe to have cosmetic surgery that would make him unrecognisable on his return. In early November 1993, talk show host Geraldo Rivera set up a mock trial with a jury of audience members, though Jackson had not been charged with a crime.|$|E
500|$|Krusty is a hard-living {{entertainment}} veteran, sometimes {{depicted as}} a jaded, burned-out has-been, who has been down and out several times and remains addicted to gambling, cigarettes, alcohol, pornography, Percodan, Pepto-Bismol, and <b>Xanax.</b> He instantly becomes depressed {{as soon as the}} cameras stop rolling; Marge states in [...] "The Sweetest Apu", that, [...] "off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man". Krusty appeared to have used cocaine, one time emerging from a restaurant bathroom with white powder under his nose, but he explained that he was simply researching a part for a film, in which he played himself. In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Krusty as [...] "the wizened veteran, the total pro" [...] who lives the celebrity life. He is miserable but he needs his celebrity status. In [...] "Bart the Fink", Bart inadvertently reported Krusty for tax fraud to the Internal Revenue Service and as a result Krusty lost most of his money. Bart soon discovered that Krusty had faked his death and was living as Rory B. Bellows on a boat. Krusty declared that he was finished with the life of a celebrity and was unconvinced when Bart reminded him of his fans and his entourage. Finally, Bart told Krusty that leaving show business would mean losing his celebrity status, which convinced Krusty to return. Krusty has been described as [...] "the consummate showman who can't bear the possibility of not being on the air and not entertaining people." ...|$|E

A few months after the allegations became news, he had lost approximately 10pounds in weight and had stopped eating. According to Jackson, he had a tendency to stop eating when [...] "really upset or hurt" [...] and Elizabeth Taylor had to make him eat during this ordeal; [...] "She took the spoon and would put it into my mouth." [...] He said that he eventually became unconscious and had to be fed intravenously.

500|$|AbsolutePunk writer Ryan Dennehy remarked in {{his review}} that [...] "ethereal echoes" [...] of the singer's voice [...] "elevate it above just a post-Weeknd, dark update to staid topics". Philip Matusavage of musicOMH {{described}} the sound of [...] "Ghost" [...] as [...] "sleek ambient" [...] dubstep, adding that it sounded typical for the singer {{and served as a}} [...] "Beyoncé manifesto". He concluded his review by stating that if the references to disagreements Beyoncé talked about in the song were real, [...] "the result proves to be the most sonically adventurous album of Beyoncé's career." [...] Julia Leconte writing for Now praised Beyoncé's vocals as [...] "perfect". Exclaim! Ryan B. Patrick felt that the song's minimalistic sound allowed the singer to [...] "ironically champion artistic integrity and proclaim her thoughts on the industry". Chris Bosman from the website Consequence of Sound who felt that the song was the record's [...] "mood setter" [...] and contained [...] "ghostly vibes", wrote that it [...] "dabbles in R, Evian Christ's drag-influenced codeine hip-hop, and Nothing Was the Same's <b>Xanax</b> club rap". He felt that during the lines [...] "Slap me, I'm pinned to the doorway / Kiss, bite, foreplay", Beyoncé [...] "slides" [...] the last word, making the song sound [...] "even less radio friendly". Bosman further stated that [...] "Haunted" [...] along with [...] "Partition" [...] and [...] "Mine", [...] "are confident enough to take one, two, three left turns while maintaining thematic cohesion." [...] The Guardian journalist Michael Cragg compared the song with works by Janelle Monáe and described its sound as [...] "doom-laden". Ryan E.C. Hamm from Under the Radar magazine felt that [...] "It's remarkable to hear a pop star at the height of her arena-tour powers taking chances like 'Haunted,' a dirge of a song that behaves more as spoken word until it's 'Vogue'-y breakdown".|$|E

2500|$|Toxicology reports {{released}} on July 17, 2007, revealed that at their time of death, Nancy had three different drugs in her system: <b>Xanax,</b> hydrocodone, and hydromorphone, {{all of which}} were found at the therapeutic rather than toxic levels. Daniel was found to have <b>Xanax</b> in his system, which led the chief medical examiner to believe that he was sedated before he was murdered. Benoit was found to have <b>Xanax,</b> hydrocodone, and an elevated level of testosterone, caused by a synthetic form of the hormone, in his system. The chief medical examiner attributed the testosterone level to Benoit possibly being treated for a deficiency caused by previous steroid abuse or testicular insufficiency. There was no indication that anything in Benoit's body contributed to his violent behaviour that led to the murder–suicide, concluding that there was no [...] "roid-rage" [...] involved. Prior to the murder–suicide, Benoit had been given illegal steroids not in compliance with WWE's Talent Wellness Program in February 2006. Benoit received nandrolone and anastrozole. During the investigation into steroid abuse, it was revealed that other wrestlers had also been given steroids.|$|E
