5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the <b>x-axis</b> is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the <b>x-axis</b> of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The {{affinity}} of an antagonist for its {{binding site}} (Ki), i.e. {{its ability to}} bind to a receptor, will determine the duration of inhibition of agonist activity. The affinity of an antagonist can be determined experimentally using Schild regression or for competitive antagonists in radioligand binding studies using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Schild regression {{can be used to}} determine the nature of antagonism as beginning either competitive or non-competitive and Ki determination is independent of the affinity, efficacy or concentration of the agonist used. However, it is important that equilibrium has been reached. The effects of receptor desensitization on reaching equilibrium must also be taken into account. The affinity constant of antagonists exhibiting two or more effects, such as in competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents that also block ion channels as well as antagonising agonist binding, cannot be analyzed using Schild regression. Schild regression involves comparing the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC50 of an agonist alone compared to the EC50 {{in the presence of a}} competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve. Altering the amount of antagonist used in the assay can alter the dose ratio. In Schild regression, a plot is made of the log (dose ratio-1) versus the log concentration of antagonist for a range of antagonist concentrations. The affinity or Ki is where the line cuts the <b>x-axis</b> on the regression plot. Whereas, with Schild regression, antagonist concentration is varied in experiments used to derive Ki values from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, agonist concentrations are varied. Affinity for competitive agonists and antagonists is related by the Cheng-Prusoff factor used to calculate the Ki (affinity constant for an antagonist) from the shift in IC50 that occurs during competitive inhibition. The Cheng-Prusoff factor takes into account the effect of altering agonist concentration and agonist affinity for the receptor on inhibition produced by competitive antagonists.|$|E
25|$|More generally, a (topological) {{surface with}} {{boundary}} is a Hausdorff topological {{space in which}} every point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic to some open subset of {{the closure of the}} upper half-plane H2 in C. These homeomorphisms are also known as (coordinate) charts. The boundary of the upper half-plane is the <b>x-axis.</b> A point on the surface mapped via a chart to the <b>x-axis</b> is termed a boundary point. The collection of such points is known as the boundary of the surface which is necessarily a one-manifold, that is, the union of closed curves. On the other hand, a point mapped to above the <b>x-axis</b> is an interior point. The collection of interior points is the interior of the surface which is always non-empty. The closed disk is a simple example of a surface with boundary. The boundary of the disc is a circle.|$|E

25|$|Other {{types of}} mass {{spectrometry}} data are well {{represented as a}} three-dimensional contour map. In this form, the mass-to-charge, m/z is on the <b>x-axis,</b> intensity the y-axis, and an additional experimental parameter, such as time, is recorded on the z-axis.|$|E
25|$|Professional seismic {{observatories}} {{usually have}} instruments measuring three axes: north-south (y-axis), east-west (<b>x-axis),</b> and the vertical (z-axis). If only one axis is measured, {{this is usually}} the vertical because it is less noisy and gives better records of some seismic waves.|$|E
25|$|For ease of {{measuring}} the amplitudes and intervals, an EKG is printed on graph paper at a standard scale: each 1nbsp&mm (one small {{box on the}} standard EKG paper) represents 40 milliseconds {{of time on the}} <b>x-axis,</b> and 0.1 millivolts on the y-axis.|$|E

25|$|The {{definite}} integral inputs a function and outputs a number, {{which gives the}} algebraic sum of areas between the graph of the input and the <b>x-axis.</b> The technical definition of the {{definite integral}} involves the limit of a sum of areas of rectangles, called a Riemann sum.|$|E
25|$|The {{parameter}} σ decides {{the spatial}} {{spread of the}} Gaussian along the <b>x-axis,</b> while the Fourier transform shows a spread in wave vector k determined by 1/σ. That is, the smaller the extent in space, the larger the extent in k, and hence in λ = 2π/k.|$|E

25|$|Let r(t) be a vector that {{describes}} {{the position of a}} point mass as a function of time. Since we are assuming circular motion, let r(t) = R·ur, where R is a constant (the radius of the circle) and ur is the unit vector pointing from the origin to the point mass. The direction of ur is described by θ, the angle between the <b>x-axis</b> and the unit vector, measured counterclockwise from the <b>x-axis.</b> The other unit vector for polar coordinates, uθ is perpendicular to ur and points in the direction of increasing θ. These polar unit vectors can be expressed in terms of Cartesian unit vectors in the x and y directions, denoted i and j respectively: and uθ depend on θ, and so in general have non-zero time derivatives.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{practical}} instruments, oscilloscopes {{do not respond}} equally to all possible input frequencies. The range of frequencies an oscilloscope can usefully display {{is referred to as}} its bandwidth.

Because of this rotation, {{the projection of}} a primed meter-stick onto the unprimed <b>x-axis</b> is foreshortened, while the projection of an unprimed meter-stick onto the primed x′-axis is likewise foreshortened.|$|E
25|$|Plotted on the <b>x-axis</b> is the {{retention}} time and plotted on the y-axis a signal (for example obtained by a spectrophotometer, mass spectrometer or {{a variety of}} other detectors) corresponding to the response created by the analytes exiting the system.

Note that Figure 2 plots the independent and response variables in the opposite axes to those normally used, so that it may be superimposed onto the previous graph, to show the Nash equilibria at the points where the two player's best responses agree in Figure 3.|$|E
25|$|Figure 3 {{shows the}} crystal {{structure}} of YAlB14 viewed along the <b>x-axis.</b> The large black spheres are Y atoms, the small blue spheres are Al atoms {{and the small}} green spheres are the bridging boron sites; B12 clusters are depicted as the green icosahedra. Boron framework of YAlB14 {{is one of the}} simplest among icosahedron-based borides – it consists of only one kind of icosahedra and one bridging boron site. The bridging boron site is tetrahedrally coordinated by four boron atoms. Those atoms are another boron atom in the counter bridge site and three equatorial boron atoms of one of three B12 icosahedra. Aluminium atoms are separated by 0.2911nm and are arranged in lines parallel to the <b>x-axis,</b> whereas yttrium atoms are separated by 0.3405nm. Both the Y atoms and B12 icosahedra form zigzags along the <b>x-axis.</b> The bridging boron atoms connect three equatorial boron atoms of three icosahedra and those icosahedra make up a network parallel to the (101) crystal plane (x-z plane in the figure). The bonding distance between the bridging boron and the equatorial boron atoms is 0.1755nm, which is typical for the strong covalent B-B bond (bond length 0.17–0.18nm); thus, the bridging boron atoms strengthen the individual network planes. On the other hand, the large distance between the boron atoms within the bridge (0.2041nm) suggests weaker interaction, and thus the bridging sites contribute little to the bonding between the network planes.|$|E
25|$|For various formulaic purposes, {{physicists}} divide rotation {{into three}} components, assigning portions to x, y and z axis that are mutually perpendicular. For bowling, the <b>x-axis</b> {{can be assigned}} to a line that {{is parallel to the}} foul line, the y-axis to the line parallel to the boards, and the z-axis to the vertical. Forward-roll is rotation about the <b>x-axis,</b> side-roll is rotation about the y-axis and mid-roll (or spin) is rotation about the z-axis. The pure full-roller delivery is a combination of forward- and side-roll only. Semi-rollers include spin. Spinners may have very little side roll. In a very strict physics sense, a ball may be delivered with rotation, but usually not in a roll, because that would imply complete traction. The technique of the great majority of bowlers involves a delivery that starts the ball in a skid that evolves into a roll that hooks into the pins.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{the complex}} plane or z-plane is a {{geometric}} {{representation of the}} complex numbers established by the real axis and the perpendicular imaginary axis. It {{can be thought of}} as a modified Cartesian plane, with the real part of a complex number represented by a displacement along the <b>x-axis,</b> and the imaginary part by a displacement along the y-axis.|$|E
25|$|FPSs {{naturally}} {{lend themselves}} to separate and simultaneous control of the player's movement and aim, and on computers this has traditionally been achieved {{with a combination of}} keyboard and mouse. Players use the <b>X-axis</b> of the mouse for looking (or turning) left and right, and the Y-axis for looking up and down; the keyboard is used for movement and supplemental inputs.|$|E
25|$|In Cartesian {{coordinates}} a free vector may {{be thought}} of {{in terms of a}} corresponding bound vector, in this sense, whose initial point has the coordinates of the origin O = (0,0,0). It is then determined by the coordinates of that bound vector's terminal point. Thus the free vector represented by (1,0,0) is a vector of unit length pointing along the direction of the positive <b>x-axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|This is {{a special}} case of the {{standard}} form where A = 0 and B = 1, or of the slope-intercept form where the slope m = 0. The graph is a horizontal line with y-intercept equal to b. There is no x-intercept, unless b = 0, {{in which case the}} graph of the line is the <b>x-axis,</b> and so every real number is an x-intercept.|$|E
25|$|Histograms give a rough {{sense of}} {{the density of the}} {{underlying}} distribution of the data, and often for density estimation: estimating the probability density function of the underlying variable. The total area of a histogram used for probability density is always normalized to 1. If the length of the intervals on the <b>x-axis</b> are all 1, then a histogram is identical to a relative frequency plot.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{it can be}} {{more useful}} {{to look at a}} {{specific}} region of the ROC Curve rather than at the whole curve. It is possible to compute partial AUC. For example, one could focus on the region of the curve with low false positive rate, which is often of prime interest for population screening tests. Another common approach for classification problems in which P ≪ N (common in bioinformatics applications) is to use a logarithmic scale for the <b>x-axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|One method Tufte {{encourages}} {{to allow}} quick visual comparison of multiple series {{is the small}} multiple, a chart with many series shown on {{a single pair of}} axes that can often be easier to read when displayed as several separate pairs of axes placed next to each other. He suggests this is particularly helpful when the series are measured on quite different vertical (y-axis) scales, but over the same range on the horizontal <b>x-axis</b> (usually time).|$|E
25|$|The {{potential}} transmembrane {{portions of}} a protein {{can be detected}} by hydropathy analysis. A hydropathy analysis uses an algorithm that quantifies the hydrophobic character at each position along the polypeptide chain. One of the accepted hydropathy scales is that of Kyte and Doolittle which relies on the generation of hydropathy plots. In these plots, the negative numbers represent hydrophilic regions and the positive numbers represent hydrophobic regions on the y-axis. A potential transmembrane domain is about 20 amino acids long on the <b>x-axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Knowing {{the points}} of {{intersection}} of a curve with a given line is frequently useful. The intersection with the axes of coordinates and the asymptotes are useful to draw the curve. Intersecting with a line parallel to the axes allows one to find at least a point in each branch of the curve. If an efficient root-finding algorithm is available, this allows to draw the curve by plotting the intersection point with all the lines parallel to the y-axis and passing through each pixel on the <b>x-axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Raster hydrographs are pixel-based plots for {{visualizing}} {{and identifying}} variations {{and changes in}} large multidimensional data sets. Originally developed by Keim (2000) they were first applied in hydrology by Koehler (2004) {{as a means of}} highlighting inter-annual and intra-annual changes in streamflow. The raster hydrographs in WaterWatch, like those developed by Koehler, depict years on the y-axis and days along the <b>x-axis.</b> Users can choose to plot streamflow (actual values or log values), streamflow percentile, or streamflow class (from 1, for low flow, to 7 for high flow), for Daily, 7-Day, 14-Day, and 28-Day streamflow. For a more comprehensive description of raster hydrographs, see Strandhagen et al. (2006).|$|E
25|$|The {{dihedral}} group D4 is {{the group}} of symmetries (symmetry group) of a square. This group contains four rotations and four reflections. It is generated by alternating reflections about the <b>x-axis</b> and about a diagonal. One free polyomino corresponds to at most 8 fixed polyominoes, which are its images under the symmetries of D4. However, those images are not necessarily distinct: the more symmetry a free polyomino has, the fewer distinct fixed counterparts it has. Therefore, a free polyomino that is invariant under some or all non-trivial symmetries of D4 may correspond to only 4, 2 or 1 fixed polyominoes. Mathematically, free polyominoes are equivalence classes of fixed polyominoes under the group D4.|$|E
25|$|Fig. 2-9 {{illustrates}} {{the motions of}} a 1nbsp&m rod that is traveling at 0.5nbsp&c along the x axis. The edges of the blue band represent the world lines of the rod's two endpoints. The invariant hyperbola illustrates events separated from the origin by a spacelike interval of 1nbsp&m. The endpoints O and B measured when nbsp&=nbsp&0 are simultaneous events in the S′ frame. But to an observer in frame S, events O and B are not simultaneous. To measure length, the observer in frame S measures the endpoints of the rod as projected onto the <b>x-axis</b> along their world lines. The projection of the rod's world sheet onto the x axis yields the foreshortened length OC.|$|E
25|$|The <b>X-axis</b> of {{the system}} was fed by a time base {{generator}} that pulled the beam {{from left to right}} across the screen. Normally a time base is triggered to start its sweep as soon as the signal from the transmitter is seen, but as noted above, this would not provide the accuracy required for this role. Instead, the time base was set to span the screen at a much faster rate, representing only a portion of the signal's overall flight time. Triggering the time base was accomplished using a very accurate oil-filled potentiometer which exponentially increased the charge in a capacitor bank until it reached a trigger value. A very complex grounding system was needed to ensure the accuracy of the voltages leaving the potentiometer system, as any stray voltages could overwhelm the signal.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{filtering}} is {{the removal}} of frequencies of no interest from the signal. A voxel's intensity change over time can be represented as the sum {{of a number of}} different repeating waves with differing periods and heights. A plot with these periods on the <b>x-axis</b> and the heights on the y-axis is called a power spectrum, and this plot is created with the Fourier transform technique. Temporal filtering amounts to removing the periodic waves not of interest to us from the power spectrum, and then summing the waves back again, using the inverse Fourier transform to create a new timecourse for the voxel. A high-pass filter removes the lower frequencies, and the lowest frequency that can be identified with this technique is the reciprocal of twice the TR. A low-pass filter removes the higher frequencies, while a band-pass filter removes all frequencies except the particular range of interest.|$|E
