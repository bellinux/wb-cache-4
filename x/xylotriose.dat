A study by Soo-min Lim showed that adding 10 % of xylobiose to mouse diets effectively suppressed fat accumulation in the mesenteric (29 %), subcutaneous (22 %), and perirenal (16 %) deposits (Lim et al. 2018).

The Cellvibrio family 10 (GH 10) xylanases display considerable sequence identity but exhibit significant differences in thermostability; thus, these enzymes represent excellent models to examine the structural basis for the variation in stability displayed by these glycoside hydrolases. Here, we have subjected the intracellular Cellvibrio mixtus xylanase CmXyn 10 B to forced protein evolution. Error-prone PCR and selection identified a double mutant, A 334 V/G 348 D, which confers an increase in thermostability. The mutant has a Tm 8 Â°C higher than the wild-type enzyme and, at 55 Â Â°C, the first-order rate constant for thermal inactivation of A 334 V/G 348 D is 4. 1 Ã� 10 - 4 min- 1, compared to a value of 1. 6 Ã� 10 - 1 min- 1 for the wild-type enzyme. The introduction of the N to C-terminal disulphide bridge into A 334 V/G 348 D, which increases the thermostability of wild-type CmXyn 10 B, conferred a further â�¼ 2 Â°C increase in the Tm of the double mutant. The crystal structure of A 334 V/G 348 D showed that the introduction of Val 334 fills a cavity within the hydrophobic core of the xylanase, {{increasing the number of}} van der Waals interactions with the surrounding aromatic residues, while OÎ´ 1 of Asp 348 makes an additional hydrogen bond with the amide of Gly 344 and OÎ´ 2 interacts with the arabinofuranose side-chain of the xylose moiety at the - 2 subsite.

40|$|The {{production}} of value-added, bio-based industrial commodity chemicals {{is an important}} area in science right now and this study provides an initial step in the recovery of bio-based chemicals from hemicellulose. Hemicellulose is a long chain polymer mostly consisting of xylose, which is a five-carbon sugar, {{and a variety of}} other compounds that are ubiquitous in plant life. The hemicellulose polymer chain can be depolymerized into smaller components, called xylooligosaccharides (XOS) with different chain lengths of xylose linked by beta- 1 - 4 glycosidic bonds, using either hot water, or dilute sulfuric acid. The xylooligosaccharides can then be purified from one another from one another using a variety of separation techniques, one such being centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC). The individual XOS components can be accumulated from successive separations for analysis to determine their best use as a value-added product. ^ The initial step in isolating xylooligosaccharides is to determine a method to theoretically calculate the partition coefficient, KD, of a CPC solvent system. Currently, solvent systems are determined by a series of trial and error experiments. This research builds on a theoretical method to determine the activity coefficient of a solute in a solvent system. The method used is called the Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS) and was used to calculate the partition coefficients of xylose and two major functional xylooligosaccharides – xylobiose and <b>xylotriose,</b> based on the structure of the compounds and the composition of solvents in two phases of the solvent system. The COSMO-RS calculation allows for a faster and more economical approach to hone in on the best solvent system for a CPC separation. The experimental partition coefficient determination requires high purity standards which are not always readily available or affordable. For this work, the two XOS compounds studied, xylobiose and <b>xylotriose,</b> were relatively costly but available for purchase. The COSMO-RS method developed in this work can alleviate the requirement for such pure standards and allows a user to determine the partition coefficient based solely on the structure of the compound. ^ The results of experimental solubility of xylose were in relative agreement with COSMO-RS predicted capacity in different chemical groups except for water and ketones groups; in this case when choosing potential solvents for making ternary biphasic solvent systems, water and ketones will not be considered, which means only non-aqueous solvent systems were tested. The comparison of the experimental results and predicted data for xylose in 12 non-aqueous solvent systems demonstrated the potential of using the COSMO-RS method as a tool for solvent system selection. Furthermore, for xylose and xylobiose, a close match between experimental results and the COSMO-RS estimated data in three heptane/n-butanol/acetonitrile systems were obtained. The results for <b>xylotriose</b> predicted a lower partition coefficient than the experimental findings. Considering the partition coefficients of the three target compounds – xylose, xylobiose, and <b>xylotriose</b> – the upper/lower phase ratio and also the separation factors between three compounds, the solvent system containing heptane/n-butanol/acetonitrile with volume ratio of 9 : 4 : 5 was deemed to be the most appropriate solvent system for purifying the xylooligosaccharides in a CPC separation. ...|$|E

After cooling, the hydrolysate was fermented to ethanol with the same organism (30 degrees C), thereby replenishing the supply of xylanase for a subsequent saccharification. Recombinant E. coli metabolized only xylose, while recombinant K. oxytoca M 5 A 1 metabolized xylose, xylobiose, and <b>xylotriose</b> but not xylotetrose. Derivatives of this latter organism produced large amounts of intracellular xylosidase, and the organism is presumed to transport both xylobiose and <b>xylotriose</b> for intracellular hydrolysis. By using recombinant M 5 A 1, approximately 34 % of the maximal theoretical yield of ethanol was obtained from xylan by this two-stage process. The yield appeared to be limited by the digestibility of commercial xylan rather than by a lack of sufficient xylanase or by ethanol toxicity. In general form, this two-stage process, which uses a single, genetically engineered microorganism, should be applicable for the production of useful chemicals {{from a wide range of}} biomass polymers...|$|E
30|$|To {{identify}} {{the final product}} (Xβ) appearing at an unusual position in TLC analysis, MALDI-TOF-MS analysis was performed. The MALDI mass spectra obtained from the product Xβ showed more abundant ions at m/z 627 and 649. These ions {{could be attributed to}} <b>xylotriose</b> substituted with a 4 -o-methylglucuronic acid residue (X 3 MeGlcA), corresponding to a 23 and 22 Da increase that could be attributed to a single- or double-sodiated ion (m/z). The ions observed at m/z 649 resulted from the substitution of one hydrogen atom by a second sodium atom (Reis et al. 2003). In conclusion, we identified the final reaction products Xα and Xβ as X 3 MeGlcA {{based on the results of}} TLC and MALDI-TOF-MS analyses.|$|E
30|$|Four xylanases of Cellulomonas flavigena were cloned, {{expressed}} in Escherichia coli and purified. Three enzymes (CFXyl 1, CFXyl 2, and CFXyl 4) {{were from the}} GH 10 family, while CFXyl 3 was from the GH 11 family. The enzymes possessed moderate temperature stability and a neutral pH optimum. The enzymes were more stable at alkaline pH values. CFXyl 1 and CFXyl 2 hydrolyzed xylan to form xylobiose, <b>xylotriose,</b> xylohexaose, xylopentaose, and xylose, which is typical for GH 10. CFXyl 3 (GH 11) and CFXyl 4 (GH 10) formed the same xylooligosaccharides, but xylose was formed in small amounts. The xylanases made efficient saccharification of rye, wheat and oat, common components of animal feed, which indicates their high biotechnological potential.|$|E
40|$|We cloned a novel β- 1, 3 -xylanase gene, {{consisting}} of a 1728 -bp open reading frame encoding 576 amino acid residues, from a marine bacterium, Vibrio sp. strain AX- 4. Sequence analysis revealed that the β- 1, 3 -xylanase is a modular enzyme composed of a putative catalytic module belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 26 and two putative carbohydrate-binding modules belonging to family 31. The recombinant enzyme hydrolysed β- 1, 3 -xylan to yield xylo-oligosaccharides with different numbers of xylose units, mainly xylobiose, <b>xylotriose</b> and xylotetraose. However, the enzyme did not hydrolyse β- 1, 4 -xylan, β- 1, 4 -mannan, β- 1, 4 -glucan, β- 1, 3 -xylobiose or p-nitrophenyl-β-xyloside. When β- 1, 3 -xylo-oligosaccharides were used as the substrate, the kcat value of the enzyme for xylopentaose {{was found to be}} 40  times higher than that for xylotetraose, and <b>xylotriose</b> was extremely resistant to hydrolysis by the enzyme. A PSI-BLAST search revealed two possible catalytic Glu residues (Glu- 138 as an acid/base catalyst and Glu- 234 as a nucleophile), both of which are generally conserved in glycoside hydrolase superfamily A. Replacement of these two conserved Glu residues with Asp and Gln resulted in a significant decrease and complete loss of enzyme activity respectively, without a change in their CD spectra, suggesting that these Glu residues are the catalytic residues of β- 1, 3 -xylanase. The present study also clearly shows that the non-catalytic putative carbohydrate-binding modules {{play an important role in}} the hydrolysis of insoluble β- 1, 3 -xylan, but not that of soluble glycol-β- 1, 3 -xylan. Furthermore, repeating a putative carbohydrate-binding module strongly enhanced the hydrolysis of the insoluble substrate...|$|E
40|$|Xylanases are {{generally}} classified into glycosyl hydro-lase families 10 and 11 and {{are found to}} frequently have an inverse relationship between their pI and molecular mass values. However, we have isolated a psychrophilic xylanase that belongs to family 8 and which has both a high pI and high molecular mass. This novel xylanase, isolated from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromo-nas haloplanktis, is not homologous to family 10 or 11 enzymes but has 20 – 30 % identity with family 8 members. NMR analysis shows that this enzyme hydrolyzes with inversion of anomeric configuration, in contrast to other known xylanases which are retaining. No cellu-lase, chitosanase or lichenase activity was detected. It appears to be functionally similar to family 11 xyla-nases. It hydrolyzes xylan to principally <b>xylotriose</b> an...|$|E

40|$|Two xylanases (I and II) out {{of several}} {{extracellular}} xylanases {{produced by the}} thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophile var. coprophile were purified to homogeneity {{by a combination of}} ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographic procedures. They had molecular weights of 26 000 (xylanase I) and 7000 (xylanase II). The temperature optima for xylanase I and II were 70 and 60 °C, and they were optimally active at pH 4. 8 – 6. 4 and 5. 4 – 6. 0, respectively. Xylanase I was found to be comparatively more stable than xylanase II at higher temperatures. Amino acid composition indicated that xylanase I contained high amounts of glycine, threonine, and low amounts of histidine and sulphur-containing amino acids.
