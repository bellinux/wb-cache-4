50|$|An ankle {{fracture}} is a {{break of}} the ankle bones. It is typically diagnosed by <b>X-ray.</b> <b>Treatment</b> is with splinting, casting or surgery. In children ankle fractures occur in about 1 per 1000 per year.|$|E
50|$|Although Stadler's initial {{research}} was on field plot technique and agronomy, his main research interest became genetics, concentrated upon {{the study of}} mutation in corn. In 1925, he won a National Research Council Fellowship in Biology for a study in variation in linkage values in maize. He did much work {{on the effects of}} <b>X-ray</b> <b>treatments,</b> and did comparative studies of mutation caused by X-rays and by ultraviolet rays. His work earned him an international reputation.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>X-ray</b> <b>treatments</b> {{are usually}} done with {{multiple}} exposures from opposite sides, each section of skin {{is exposed to}} both entering and exiting X-rays. In proton therapy, skin exposure at the entrance point is higher, but tissues {{on the opposite side}} of the body to the tumor receive no radiation. Thus, X-ray therapy causes slightly less damage to the skin and surface tissues, and proton therapy causes less damage to deeper tissues in front of and beyond the target.|$|R
50|$|Horkheimer {{was born}} with a {{congenital}} degenerative lung disease known as bronchiectasis and, as a result, suffered from chronic pain. His ailment was not diagnosed until he was 18 years old. During this time, he suffered from radiation sickness and lost his hair as the result of medical <b>X-Ray</b> <b>treatments.</b> In 1957, he had to leave the Honolulu Academy of Fine Arts because it was suspected that he had tuberculosis. His health issues caused him to move to Miami in 1964 for the humid warm climate.|$|R
50|$|Inspired by this, other {{physicians}} tried using X-rays {{to treat}} numerous human ailments from acne to breast cancer. Malignancies {{were found to}} be the most amenable to <b>X-ray</b> <b>treatment.</b> They also found out the side effects.|$|E
5000|$|The scalp ringworm, {{also known}} as tinea capitis, mycosis, thrichophytia, and favus, {{was one of the}} most common fungal {{diseases}} in children in the Jewish communities in Israel and abroad since the 19th century. This <b>X-ray</b> <b>treatment</b> for ringworm has been used around the world as early as 1897. An estimated 200,000 children worldwide received <b>X-ray</b> <b>treatment</b> for tinea capitis in accordance with the standard Adamson-Kienbock procedure between 1910 and 1959, until griseofulvin, the first effective antifungal agent for ringworm, was introduced. [...] At the beginning of the 20th century, Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem treated ringworm disease among the religious Jewish community in Jerusalem using irradiation and the disease almost disappeared.|$|E
50|$|In {{the setting}} of an ankle {{fracture}} the talus can become unstable and subluxate or dislocate. People may complain of ecchymosis (bruising), or {{there may be an}} abnormal position, abnormal motion, or lack of motion.

During her treatments, two samples were taken from Lacks's cervix without her permission or knowledge; one sample was of healthy tissue and the other was cancerous. These samples were given to George Otto Gey, a physician and cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins. The cells from the cancerous sample eventually became known as the HeLa immortal cell line, a commonly used cell line in contemporary biomedical research.|$|R

50|$|A 52-year-old {{man with}} an epigastric tumor {{presented}} to Despeignes. The tumor was {{about the size of}} the head of an eight-month-old fetus. Despeignes believed that cancer was caused by parasites, and that perhaps he could kill the parasite with radiation. On 4 July 1896 he commenced the <b>X-ray</b> <b>treatments.</b> Two half-hour treatments were given each day. Other treatments given to the patient were opium for pain relief, morphine and chloroform. A diet of condurango and milk was prescribed, with injections of artificial serum. The patient experienced pain relief, but died on 24 July. The cancer had shrunk by about 50%. Despeignes' equipment consisted of a Crookes' tube and six Radiguet battery elements.|$|R

50|$|In 1906, Regaud {{discovered}} {{that one of the}} effects of <b>X-ray</b> <b>treatment</b> is sterility. He deduced that X-rays could also be used against rapidly growing cells other than gametes and, thus, against cancerous tumors. He proceeded to conduct the first experiments in this area. In 1912, at the Curie Institute, he was given responsibility for the Pasteur Laboratory, with the mission to study the biological and medical effects of radioactivity. The Curie laboratory, in contrast, dealt with research in the fields of physics and chemistry.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is claimed}} in the {{documentary}} that the X-ray radiation used on the children was thousands of times beyond the maximum recommended dose [...] and {{it is suggested that}} the program was funded by the United States in order to test the effects of large radiation doses on humans. In fact, the treatment in Israel was the same as that used elsewhere in the world. The documented dosages given to the Israeli children were similar to (if not less than) those administered to about 2000 children treated for ringworm at New York University Hospital between 1940 and 1959. A study from the early 1950s found <b>X-ray</b> <b>treatment</b> effective in almost all cases of ringworm.|$|E
50|$|Radiation {{therapeutic}} {{physics is}} also known as radiotherapy physics or radiation oncology physics.The majority of medical physicists currently working in the US, Canada, and some western countries are of this group. A Radiation Therapy physicist typically deals with linear accelerator (Linac) systems and kilovoltage <b>x-ray</b> <b>treatment</b> units on a daily basis, as well as more advanced modalities such as TomoTherapy, gamma knife, cyberknife, proton therapy, and brachytherapy.The academic and research side of therapeutic physics may encompass fields such as boron neutron capture therapy, sealed source radiotherapy, terahertz radiation, high-intensity focused ultrasound (including lithotripsy), optical radiation lasers, ultraviolet etc. including photodynamic therapy, as well as nuclear medicine including unsealed source radiotherapy, and photomedicine, which is the use of light to treat and diagnose disease.|$|E

25|$|GH {{treatment}} {{is not recommended}} {{for children who are}} not growing despite having normal levels of growth hormone, and in the UK it is not licensed for this use. Children requiring treatment usually receive daily injections of growth hormone. Most pediatric endocrinologists monitor growth and adjust dose every 3–6 months and many of these visits involve blood tests and <b>x-rays.</b> <b>Treatment</b> is usually extended as long as the child is growing, and lifelong continuation may be recommended for those most severely deficient. Nearly painless insulin syringes, pen injectors, or a needle-free delivery system reduce the discomfort. Injection sites include the biceps, thigh, buttocks, and stomach. Injection sites should be rotated daily to avoid lipoatrophy. Treatment is expensive, costing as much as US $10,000 to $40,000 a year in the USA.|$|R

50|$|The newborn {{suffered}} from scrofula of the breast, neck and face, and nearly went blind. From {{the age of}} three, the child at regular intervals contracted pneumonia and physicians treated her as nonviable; nevertheless she was enrolled in primary school (Volksschule) in 1921. During a hospitalisation in Klagenfurt, the chief physician noted Lavant's literary interest and presented her an edition of Rainer Maria Rilke's works, which she carried on her 60 km walk home. In 1927 her health again declined and she was only able to finish primary school with continual interruptions two years later, after being exposed to a risky <b>X-ray</b> <b>treatment.</b> She had to abandon the subsequent attendance at the lower secondary school (Hauptschule) as the way was too long for the feeble child.|$|E

In 1931 he became radium officer at the Middlesex Hospital and officer in charge of the Meyerstein Institute of Radiotherapy formed in 1936. This was at a time when radium and <b>x-ray</b> <b>treatment</b> were carried out by different clinical teams. In World War II he was director in the emergency medical service of Mount Vernon Hospital in Northwood, Middlesex. In 1942 he became the first professor of therapeutic radiology at the Middlesex.

50|$|The first {{attempted}} <b>x-ray</b> <b>treatment</b> was by Victor Despeignes, a French {{physician who}} used {{them on a}} patient with stomach cancer. In 1896, he published a paper with the results: a week-long treatment {{was followed by a}} diminution of pain and reduction {{in the size of the}} tumor, though the case was ultimately fatal. The results were inconclusive, because the patient was concurrently being given other treatments. Freund's first experiment was a tragic failure; he applied x-rays to a naevus in order to induce epilation and a deep ulcer resulted, which resisted further treatment by radiation. The first successful treatment was by Schiff, working with Freund, in a case of lupus vulgaris. A year later, in 1897, the two published a report of their success and this provoked further experimentation in x-ray therapies. Thereafter they did a successful treatment of lupus erythematosus in 1898. The lesion took a common form of a 'butterfly-patch' which appeared on both sides of the face, and Schiff applied the irradiation to one side only, in order to compare the effects.|$|E

40|$|Three induced, {{heritable}} {{mutations in}} the mouse cause alpha-thalassemias. The adult alpha-globin genes on each mutant chromosome {{are no longer}} expressed. Embryos heterozygous for one normal and {{any of the three}} mutant chromosomes also seem to be deficient in embryonic alpha-globin-like x-globin, suggesting that the x-globin gene is nearby and also inactivated. A normal genetic polymorphism for a specific EcoRI site in or around the mouse alpha-globin gene complex has been used here to show that each of the three mutated chromosomes has a deletion that includes the segment of a 12 -kilobase EcoRI band which normally carries one of the two adult alpha-globin genes. The deletion of the comparable part of the second alpha-globin gene site is also inferred. Nonetheless, a 4. 7 -kilobase EcoRI segment which carries a characterized alpha-globin-like pseudogene is still present in each mutant.
