50|$|Like lidocaine, {{bupivacaine}} is an amino-amide anesthetic; the aromatic {{head and}} the hydrocarbon chain are linked by an amide bond rather than an ester as in earlier local anesthetics.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the possibilities of utilizing the high-performance characteristics of triptane and <b>xylidines</b> blended with 28 -R fuel {{in order to increase}} fuel economy by the use of high compression ratios and maximum-economy spark setting. Full-scale single-cylinder knock tests were run with 20 deg B. T. C. and maximum-economy spark settings at compression ratios of 6. 9, 8. 0, and 10. 0, and with two inlet-air temperatures. The fuels tested consisted of triptane, four triptane and one <b>xylidines</b> blend with 28 -R, and 28 -R fuel alone. Indicated specific fuel consumption at lean mixtures was decreased approximately 17 percent at a compression ratio of 10. 0 and maximum-economy spark setting, as compared to that obtained with a compression ratio of 6. 9 and normal spark setting. When compression ratio was increased from 6. 9 to 10. 0 at an inlet-air temperature of 150 F, normal spark setting, and a fuel-air ratio of 0. 065, 55 -percent triptane was required with 28 -R fuel to maintain the knock-limited brake power level obtained with 28 -R fuel at a compression ratio of 6. 9. Brake specific fuel consumption was decreased 17. 5 percent at a compression ratio of 10. 0 relative to that obtained at a compression ratio of 6. 9. Approximately similar results were noted at an inlet-air temperature of 250 F. For concentrations up through at least 20 percent, triptane can be more efficiently used at normal than at maximum-economy spark setting to maintain a constant knock-limited power output over the range of compression ratios tested...|$|R
50|$|The Taifun {{proposal}} {{was developed by}} a small team at Peenemünde along with the Electromechanische Werke in Karlshagen.

The rocket was driven by a liquid fuelled engine using Tonka 250, a hypergolic mixture comprising 57 percent of raw <b>xylidine</b> and 43 of triethylamine fed into the combustion chamber under pressure. The pressure was provided by small cordite charges fired into the fuel tanks, in the process bursting a pair of thin diaphragms to allow the fuel and oxidizer to flow into the combustion chamber, and launched the rocket. The burn was 2.5 seconds, by which time the rocket had achieved a speed of 2237 mph. Nominal range {{was to have been}} about 15 km, with a maximum altitude of 12 km.

50|$|Each missile is {{launched}} by 4 solid-fueled strap-on rocket boosters. After they burn out and drop away (between 3 and 5.1 seconds from launch) it fires a 5D67 liquid fueled sustainer rocket engine (for 51-150 seconds) which burns a fuel called TG-02 Samin (50% <b>xylidine</b> and 50% triethylamine), oxidized by an agent called AK-27P Melange (fuming nitric acid enriched with nitrogen oxides, phosphoric acid and hydrofluoric acid). Maximum range is between 150 km and 300 km, {{depending on the}} model. The missile uses radio illumination mid-course correction to fly towards the target with a terminal semi-active radar homing phase. Maximum target speed is around Mach 4. Effective altitude is 300 m to 20000 m for early models and up to 35000 m for later models. The warhead is either 217 kg high-explosive fragmentation (16,000 × 2 g fragmentation pellets and 21,000 × 3.5 g pellets) triggered by radar proximity fuse or command signal, or a 25 kt nuclear warhead triggered by command signal only.

40|$|The ^(15) N {{chemical}} {{shifts of}} aniline, the toluidines, <b>xylidines,</b> and several halogen and oxygen substituted anilines have been {{measured at the}} natural abundance level of ^(15) N.

The chemical shifts correlate reasonably well with ^(19) F shifts of similarly substituted fluorobenzenes, with C- 1 of the anilines themselves and with Hammett sigma values. While the shifts of C-methyl substituted anilines do not correlate with the methyl resonances of corresponding polymethylbenzenes, those of the halo- and alkoxyanilines show a reasonable parallelism with corresponding ^(13) C-methyl shifts. The results are interpreted in terms of possible modes of transmission of electron density in an alternating and additive manner through the sigma framework...|$|R
