Little {{was known about}} the flight characteristics of the prototype atom bomb designs and how the fusing mechanism would work. In February 1945, a Flight Test Section was created within the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to carry out testing with prototype bombs {{in the shape of}} the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The Flight Test Section carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two thirds of the June tests were with Fat Man shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were with Fat Man shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, and at the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station. Testing continued up to the last minute, with the Fat Man firing unit, known as the <b>X-unit,</b> only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the <b>X-unit</b> was carried out six days later.|$|E
5|$|The Mark III Mod 0 Fat Man {{was ordered}} {{to be put into}} {{production}} in mid-1946. High explosives were manufactured by the Salt Wells Pilot Plant, which had been established by the Manhattan Project as part of Project Camel. A new plant was established at the Iowa Army Ordnance Plant. Mechanical components were made or procured by the Rock Island Arsenal. Electrical and mechanical components for about 50 bombs were stockpiled at Kirtland Army Air Field by August 1946, but only nine plutonium cores were available. Production of the Mod 0 ended in December 1948, by which time there were still only 53 cores available. It was replaced by improved versions, known as Mods 1 and 2, which contained a number of minor changes, the most important of which was that they did not charge the <b>X-Unit</b> firing system's capacitors until released from the aircraft. The Mod 0s were withdrawn from service between March and July 1949, and by October they had all been rebuilt as Mods 1 and 2. Some 120 Mark III Fat Man units were added to the stockpile between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Mark III Fat Man was retired in 1950.|$|E

40|$|A {{precision}} bent-crystal gamma-ray monochromator with {{stationary source}} has been built. The instrument {{consists of three}} physically independent units: The line source (a radioactive source or the anode of an x-ray tube), the two-meter-radius bent-diffraction-crystal with its pivot and sine-motion mechanism, and the heavy-duty curved-track framework which supports the collimator, detector, and shielding. The motions of the crystal-pivot unit and of the detector-carriage unit are linked together {{in such a way}} that the reflection condition is satisfied. Results are presented showing that the precision of the monochromator for measurement of gamma-ray wavelengths is 0. 003 <b>x-units.</b> The line width at half-maximum observed when the (800) planes of a bent germanium-crystal are used is 0. 080 <b>x-units.</b> The resolution which has been attained with the germanium crystal is illustrated by a measurement of the 244. 264 kev, 246. 056 kev, and the previously unobserved 245. 237 kev gamma line in the decay of W^(183). Nuclear-resonance scattering from the first-excited states in F^(19) and Mn^(55) has been observed with the bent-diffraction-crystal monochromator. The experiment was performed by observing the scattered radiation from nuclei exposed to nearly monoenergetic x-rays selected by crystal diffraction from the bremsstrahlung spectrum of an x-ray tube. Gamma rays scattered at 135 ° from samples of lithium fluoride and manganese placed in the diffracted beam were observed as a function of the incident photon wavelength. With the lithium fluoride sample three measurements were made under different experimental conditions. In each case pronounced resonance peaks 10 to 15 percent above background were observed. A least-square analysis of the data gives 109. 894 ± 0. 005 kev for the energy position of the first-excited level in F^(19). From the observed yield the width of this level was deduced to be (5. 1 ± 0. 7) 10 ^(- 7) ev. Measurements with a Mn^(55) scattering sample gave 125. 95 ± 0. 01 kev for the position of the first-excited level and (1. 1 ± 0. 3) 10 ^(- 6) ev for the resonance width. ...|$|R
40|$|The first {{experimental}} {{evidence of the}} isotopic shift of electronic K x-rays has been found. A two-meter focal length curved-crystal diffraction spectrometer {{was used to measure}} the wavelengths of fluorescent K(alpha 1) x-rays from isotopically pure U 233 and U 238 samples. The difference in wavelengths was found to be 0. 00228 +/- 0. 00022 <b>x-units.</b> This corresponds to a 1. 8 +/- 0. 2 eV energy difference, the U 233 x-ray being higher in energy. The result is discussed in terms of 1) the pure volume effect, 2) the even-odd staggering contributions, 3) the change of intrinsic quadrupole moments, and 4) the nuclear compressibility factor. Good agreement between the experimental result and theory is obtained by considering either the pure volume effect, or by considering the contributions of all four effects choosing the parameter for the nuclear compressibility somewhat higher than inferred from the optical isotope shift measurements...|$|R

40|$|The memory {{intensive}} {{nature of}} object-oriented languages such as C++ and Java {{has created the}} need of a high-performance dynamic memory management. Object-oriented applications often generate higher memory intensity in the heap region. Thus, high-performance memory manager is needed to cope with such applications. As today’s VLSI technology advances, it {{becomes more and more}} attractive to map basic software algorithms such as malloc(), free(), and realloc() into hardware. This paper presents a hardware design of realloc function that fully utilizes the advantage of combinational logic. There are two steps needed to complete a reallocation process: (a) try to reallocate on the original memory block and (b) if (a) failed, allocate another memory block and copy the contents of the original block to this new location. In our scheme, (a) can be done in constant time. For (b), the allocation of new memory block and the deallocation of original block are done in constant time. The hardware complexity of proposed scheme (i. e. <b>X-unit,</b> RS-unit, and ESG-unit) is O(n), where n represents the size of bit-map.

40|$|The {{development}} of eukaryotic transfection technologies has been rapid in recent years, providing {{the opportunity to}} better analyze cell-autonomous mechanisms influencing various cellular processes, including cell-intrinsic regulators of regenerative neurite growth and survival. Electroporation {{is one of the}} more effective methodologies for transfection of post-mitotic neurons demonstrating sufficient neuronal survival and transfection efficiency. To further maximize the number of transfected neurons especially with large plasmids, to limit the cellular exposure to serum, and to minimize the number of animals required for cell isolation per experiment, we compared two state-of-the-art electroporation devices for in vitro transfection of adult rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron cultures. By refining different parameters, transfection efficiencies of 35 - 40 % of adult DRG neurons could be achieved using the Lonza 4 D-Nucleofector <b>X-unit</b> system, 1. 5 - 2 -fold higher rates than those that have been previously published using smaller plasmid sizes. Our protocol further limits the number of cells required to 3 x 10 e 5 cells per 20 &# 181;l reaction using only 2 &# 181;g DNA/reaction and allows for the complete omission of serum post-transfection. This method can also be adapted to embryonic DRG neurons and postnatal cerebellar granule neurons. Application of this optimized protocol will contribute to furthering the study of neuronal intrinsic mechanisms responsible for growth and survival under physiological and pathophysiological conditions...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown by Lindh [1] and others [2] that the shift in the K {{absorption}} edges for various compounds of sulfur, chlorine, phosphorous, iron, and some other substances, depends chiefly on the valence of the element in a given compound. With increasing valence in a given element the wave-length of the edge shifts to smaller values. Stelling [3] has explained the effect of valence as being due to the screening effect of electrons in external parts of atoms. To be sure, other factors influence {{the position of the}} edges, such as other elements occurring in the compounds, and lattice structure, but these factors produce in general only minor fluctuations around a mean value, whereas the mean values for the several valences show rather wide divergences. For example, the wave-lengths of the principal K edge {{of a large number of}} 4 - and 6 -valent inorganic sulfur compounds practically all lie within half an <b>X-unit</b> of the means of their respective groups, whereas the means themselves are separated by 8 X. U. A similar state of affairs is observed in the 2 -valent compounds. The edges do not lie quite so close to the mean, but the mean is 13 X. U. from that of the 4 -valent compounds. All the substances thus far investigated bear out the general statements above. In view of the rather large body of facts now before us, it seems legitimate to try to use x-ray absorption data to obtain information on the valence state of an element in a compound. The substance used in the present investigation was potassium dithionate, the object being to determine the state of the two sulfur atoms in K 2 S 2 O 6. Lindh [4] has already shown that for Na 2 S 2 O 3 and some other thiosulfates there is not just a simple absorption edge, but two edges, corresponding in position to the valence states SII and probably Siv, which states are generally assumed by chemists for the two sulfur atoms in the thiosulfates. Now if valence is calculated in the usual way, then on the assumption that the sulfur atoms of the dithionates are in the same state we get for them a valence of V, and we would expect to find the K absorption edge corresponding to a single state, rather than the two edges shown by the thiosulfates...|$|E
