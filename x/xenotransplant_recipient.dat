40|$|Baboon {{bone marrow}} was grafted into human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 -infected patients {{in the course of}} recent trials for AIDS treatment. Since the baboon genome harbors multiple copies of an endogenous oncovirus, chimeric lenti-oncoviruses could emerge in the <b>xenotransplant</b> <b>recipient.</b> To analyze the potential replication competence of hybrid viruses between different genera of retroviruses, we replaced most of the env gene of simian immunodeficiency virus with the env gene of an amphotropic murine leukemia virus. The hybrid virus could be propagated in human T-cell lines, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of rhesus macaques, and in CD 4 - B-cell lines. Because of the expanded cell tropism, the hybrid virus might have a selective advantage in comparison to parental viruses. Therefore, emerging chimeric viruses may be considered a serious risk of xenotransplantation. A note of caution is also suggested for the use of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors for human gene therapy...|$|E
40|$|Swine {{hepatitis}} E {{virus is}} a newly identified potentially zoonotic virus from pigs {{of particular concern}} for possible direct transmission to a human <b>xenotransplant</b> <b>recipient</b> by organ transplantation. In the present study, prevalence of serum antibodies to hepatitis E virus was examined in Canadian swine herds. A total of 998 serum samples collected from 6 -month-old healthy slaughter hogs were examined by enzyme immunoassay and Western blot analysis for antibodies to the recombinant open reading frame 3 (ORF 3) protein of hepatitis E virus expressed in Escherichia coli. These samples represented more than 80 different swine production units from five major swine-producing provinces across Canada. From this study, 594 samples (59. 4 %) {{were found to be}} positive for hepatitis E virus antibody. The seroprevalence was higher in Quebec (88. 8 %) and Ontario (80. 1 %) than in Alberta and Saskatchewan (38. 3 %). By PCR using a pair of oligonucleotide primers deduced from the ORF 2 sequence of human hepatitis E virus, a specific hepatitis E virus sequence was recovered from feces of pigs. The nucleotide sequence identity between the U. S. swine hepatitis E virus and the Canadia...|$|E
40|$|Rejection of renal and cardiac xenografts is {{initiated}} when natural antibodies of {{the recipient}} bind to donor endothelium, activating complement {{on the surface of}} endothelial cells. Pulmonary xenotransplants, however, reveal less evidence of antibody binding and complement activation and, in contrast to other xenografts, fare worse when the complement of the graft recipient is depleted. Accordingly, we asked whether distinct immunochemical reactions might occur after xenotransplantation of the lung and what implications such reactions might have for pulmonary pathophysiology. Analysis of serum from baboons after transplantation with porcine lungs revealed complexes containing baboon IgM and porcine von Willebrand factor. The baboon IgM in these complexes was specific for Galα 1 - 3 Gal. Immune complexes were also seen, albeit to a lesser extent, in the serum of kidney and heart <b>xenotransplant</b> <b>recipients.</b> Deposits of porcine von Willebrand factor and baboon C 3 were detected in livers and spleens of transplanted baboons. These results indicate pulmonary xenotransplantation eventuates in formation of immune complexes and in the deposition of those complexes at distant sites. Immune complex formation could explain the peculiar fate of xenoreactive antibodies after pulmonary xenotransplantation and might contribute to the pathophysiology of the lung and systemic changes not previously considered a complication of xenotransplantation...|$|R
40|$|Porcine xenografts {{may offer}} a {{solution}} to the shortage of human donor allografts. However, all pigs contain the porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), raising concerns regarding the transmission of PERV and the possible development of disease in <b>xenotransplant</b> <b>recipients.</b> We evaluated 11 antiretroviral drugs licensed for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) therapy for their activities against PERV to assess their potential for clinical use. Fifty and 90 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s and IC 90 s, respectively) of five nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) were determined enzymatically for PERV and for wild-type (WT) and RTI-resistant HIV- 1 reference isolates. In a comparison of IC 50 s, the susceptibilities of PERV RT to lamivudine, stavudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, and zidovudine were reduced > 20 -fold, 26 -fold, 6 -fold, 4 -fold, and 3 -fold, respectively, compared to those of WT HIV- 1. PERV was also resistant to nevirapine. Tissue culture-based, single-round infection assays using replication-competent virus confirmed the relative sensitivity of PERV to zidovudine and its resistance to all other RTIs. A Gag polyprotein-processing inhibition assay was developed and used to assess the activities of protease inhibitors against PERV. No inhibition of PERV protease was seen with saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, or amprenavir at concentrations > 200 -fold the IC 50 s for WT HIV- 1. Thus, following screening of many antiretroviral agents, our findings support only the potential clinical use of zidovudine...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveIt {{has been}} {{reported}} that unmatched adult bone marrow stromal cells could be tolerated by immune-competent allotransplant or <b>xenotransplant</b> <b>recipients</b> under various conditions. This study examined whether xenogeneic bone marrow stromal cells implanted immediately after myocardial infarction can survive and differentiate, attenuating deterioration in left ventricular function. MethodsIn groups I and II (n = 34), myocardial infarctions were created in immunocompetent adult Lewis rats by proximal left coronary artery ligation. In group I, 3 × 106 lacZ-labeled mouse bone marrow stromal cells were immediately injected into the peri-infarct area of the left ventricle, whereas in group II, only culture medium was injected. There were 10 early and 4 late deaths. At 4 weeks after injection, hearts were stained for β-galactosidase and troponin IC. In groups IIIA and IIIB, lacZ-labeled mouse skin fibroblasts were implanted into rat myocardium (n = 10 each) with and without left coronary artery ligation, respectively, and the rats were killed serially. In group IV, animals underwent sham surgery (n = 5, no deaths). At 4 weeks, surviving rats in groups I, II, and IV (n = 10, n = 10, and n = 5, respectively) underwent blinded transthoracic echocardiography for ventricular function studies. ResultsIn group I, labeled mouse-derived bone marrow stromal cells were found within rat myocardium that stained positively for troponin IC 4 weeks after implantation. Functionally, mean left ventricular ejection fraction (P =. 007), stroke volume (P =. 03), and fractional shortening (P =. 02) were all significantly higher in group I than in group II. In groups IIIA and IIIB, mouse fibroblasts induced cellular infiltration with rapid loss of donor cells. No labeled cells were found after 4 days. In group IV, there was no change in cardiac function. ConclusionXenogeneic bone marrow stromal cells implanted into acutely ischemic myocardium induced by coronary artery ligation were immunologically tolerated, survived and differentiated, resulting in a cardiac chimera which improved left ventricular function. This unique immunologic tolerance may suggest the feasibility of using bone marrow stromal cells as universal donor cells...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Human post-tranplant {{lymphoproliferative}} disorder (PTLD) {{has been shown}} to be strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Sporadic cases of PTLD associated with the presence of EBV with a B cell phenotype have also been reported in transplanted non-human primates. In our centre, only 1 primate in 50 renal <b>xenotransplant</b> <b>recipients,</b> developed PTLD. In the present study we evaluated the morphological characteristics, immunophenotype and the possible association with EBV of the PTLD observed in this transplanted primate. Material and Methods: Nephrectomized primates were transplanted with hDAF transgenic porcine kidney and received different regimens of immunosuppression. At euthanasia, samples from all tissues and organs were collected and prepared for H&E staining and immunohistochemical analyses for T cells, B cells and EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA 2). Results: Macroscopic evaluation of the primate specimens showed a moderate diffuse lymphoadenomegaly. The microscopical analysis demonstrated the presence of a monomorphous atypical lymphoid population, densely arranged in sheets, which altered the lymph node architecture and infiltrated lungs, stomach and liver. Dense cellular lymphoid aggregates were also frequently observed in small arteries and lymphatic vessels. The cells showed a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and scant to moderate homogeneous eosinophilic cytoplasm with indistinct cell boundaries. The nucleus (10 - 14 microns in diameter) was central, round, with hyperchromatic clumped chromatin and one prominent eosinophilic central nucleolus. There was mild anisocytosis, moderate anisokaryosis and scattered apoptotic lymphoid cells. Between 2 to 6 lymphoid mitotic cells were present per high power field. The immunohistochemical analysis of neoplastic cells showed diffuse and intense specific reactivity with the anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Scattered reactive lymphocytes and occasional pseudo-follicular aggregates were moderately positive to anti-CD 3, CD 5 and CD 79 αcy mAbs. There was a diffuse specific nuclear reaction to the anti-EBNA 2 mAb. Conclusion: In our series of transplanted primates, only one case of multiorgan monomorphic B-cell PTLD, associated with an EBV-related herpesvirus could be observed. This study demonstrated that PTLD is an uncommon event following the transplantation of pig organs into immunosuppressed cynomolgus monkeys...|$|R
40|$|Transgenic pigs {{have been}} {{engineered}} to express human CD 59 (hCD 59) {{in order to}} suppress hyperacute rejection of <b>xenotransplants</b> in human <b>recipients.</b> In this study, porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) was produced in a porcine cell line expressing hCD 59 {{in order to examine}} the effect of this complement control protein on PERV neutralization by human sera. hCD 59 was found to be incorporated into PERV particles produced from engineered ST-IOWA cells. PERV incorporation of hCD 59 resulted in a dramatic inhibition of complement-mediated virolysis by human serum. However, incorporation of hCD 59 had no effect on neutralization of PERV by human serum, as measured in infectivity assays. Our results suggest that the use of organs from hCD 59 transgenic pigs will inhibit complement-mediated virolysis, but will not compromise the protective effects of human sera on the neutralization of PERV particles...|$|R
