5|$|The first {{published}} reports of A-DNA <b>X-ray</b> <b>diffraction</b> patterns—and also B-DNA—used analyses based on Patterson transforms that provided {{only a limited}} amount of structural information for oriented fibers of DNA. An alternative analysis was then proposed by Wilkins et al., in 1953, for the in vivo B-DNA X-ray diffraction-scattering patterns of highly hydrated DNA fibers in terms of squares of Bessel functions. In the same journal, James Watson and Francis Crick presented their molecular modeling analysis of the DNA <b>X-ray</b> <b>diffraction</b> patterns to suggest that the structure was a double-helix.|$|E

5|$|These {{scattering}} methods generally use monochromatic X-rays, {{which are}} restricted to a single wavelength with minor deviations. A broad spectrum of X-rays (that is, a blend of X-rays with different wavelengths) {{can also be used}} to carry out <b>X-ray</b> <b>diffraction,</b> a technique known as the Laue method. This is the method used in the original discovery of <b>X-ray</b> <b>diffraction.</b> Laue scattering provides much structural information with only a short exposure to the X-ray beam, and is therefore used in structural studies of very rapid events (Time resolved crystallography). However, it is not as well-suited as monochromatic scattering for determining the full atomic structure of a crystal and therefore works better with crystals with relatively simple atomic arrangements.|$|E

5|$|For {{all above}} {{mentioned}} <b>X-ray</b> <b>diffraction</b> methods, the scattering is elastic; the scattered X-rays {{have the same}} wavelength as the incoming X-ray. By contrast, inelastic X-ray scattering methods are useful in studying excitations of the sample, rather than the distribution of its atoms.|$|E
5|$|Other {{forms of}} elastic X-ray {{scattering}} include powder diffraction, Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and {{several types of}} X-ray fiber diffraction, which was used by Rosalind Franklin in determining the double-helix structure of DNA. In general, single-crystal <b>X-ray</b> <b>diffraction</b> offers more structural information than these other techniques; however, it requires a sufficiently large and regular crystal, which is not always available.|$|E

5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is single-crystal <b>X-ray</b> <b>diffraction,</b> in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, <b>X-ray</b> <b>diffraction</b> data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E

Each of these drugs has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E

To obtain the phases, full sets of reflections are collected with known alterations to the scattering, either by modulating the wavelength past a certain absorption edge or by adding strongly scattering (i.e., electron-dense) metal atoms such as mercury. Combining the magnitudes and phases yields the full Fourier transform F(q), which may be inverted to obtain the electron density f(r).|$|E
