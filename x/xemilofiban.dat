40|$|Background—Inhibition of {{platelet}} aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen to glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa on activated platelets results in antithrombotic activity. We {{report on the}} antithrombotic effect of <b>xemilofiban</b> (SC- 54684 A), an oral GP IIb/IIIa antagonist, administered alone or with aspirin (ASA) in an acute thrombosis model. Methods and Results—Conscious dogs were treated with <b>xemilofiban</b> (1. 25, 2. 5, 5. 0, or 6 mg/kg, n 56); low-dose (LD, 81 mg) ASA, n 57; high-dose (HD, 162 mg) ASA, n 56; xemilofibran 1. 25 mg/kg plus LD ASA, n 56; xemilofibran 1. 25 mg/kg plus HD ASA, n 56; or placebo, n 57. Dogs were anesthetized 60 minutes later, {{and the effects of}} the treatments were evaluated after electrolytic injury (250 mA for 180 minutes) in the left circumflex coronary artery. Bleeding time (BT) was assessed in a separate study. Incidence of thrombosis was reduced (P, 0. 05) by <b>xemilofiban</b> $ 2. 5 mg/kg, HD ASA, or <b>xemilofiban</b> 1. 25 mg/kg plus HD ASA compared with placebo. <b>Xemilofiban</b> $ 2. 5 mg/kg or <b>xemilofiban</b> 1. 25 mg/kg plus HD ASA significantly increased time to occlusion, inhibited ex vivo {{platelet aggregation}} to collagen. 90 %, and prevented or decreased (P, 0. 05) cyclic flow variations (CFVs) compared with placebo. BT was increased (P, 0. 05) with <b>xemilofiban</b> $ 2. 5 mg/kg but not with <b>xemilofiban</b> 1. 25 mg/kg plus HD ASA. Conclusions—Xemilofiban $ 2. 5 mg/kg, HD ASA, or <b>xemilofiban</b> 1. 25 mg/kg plus HD ASA significantly reduced the incidence of thrombosis. These doses of <b>xemilofiban</b> or <b>xemilofiban</b> 1. 25 mg/kg plus HD ASA increased time to occlusion, inhibited ex vivo platelet aggregation by. 90 %, and prevented or reduced CFVs. <b>Xemilofiban</b> $ 2. 5 mg/k...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{administered}} intravenously at {{the time}} of percutaneous coronary revascularization, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists decrease the incidence of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction and the need for urgent revascularization. We hypothesized that long-term administration of oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, which block the aggregation of platelets, might stabilize intravascular plaque and prevent additional ischemic cardiac events. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, double-blind trial in which 7232 patients were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg of oral <b>xemilofiban</b> or placebo 30 to 90 minutes before undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization, with maintenance doses of 10 or 20 mg of <b>xemilofiban</b> or placebo administered three times daily for up to 182 days. There were two primary composite end points: one was death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization at 182 days, and the other was death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 182 days. RESULTS: Death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization occurred within 182 days in 324 patients who received placebo (Kaplan-Meier cumulative event rate, 13. 5 percent), 332 who received 10 mg of <b>xemilofiban</b> (13. 9 percent, P= 0. 82 for the comparison with placebo), and 306 who received 20 mg of <b>xemilofiban</b> (12. 7 percent, P= 0. 36 for the comparison with placebo). The incidence of death or myocardial infarction was also similar in all three groups. Clinically significant hemorrhagic complications and thrombocytopenia were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist <b>xemilofiban</b> before percutaneous coronary revascularization and for up to six months thereafter does not significantly reduce the incidence of important clinical end points...|$|E
40|$|While {{deployment}} of intracoronary stents {{has been shown}} to reduce restenosis, stenting can also damage the endothelial monolayer lining the vessel wall, leading to possible in-stent thrombosis. Local drug delivery from stent surfaces represents a means of delivering therapeutic doses of drug directly to the target site. The aim {{of this study was to}} elute fluvastatin, which can inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and <b>xemilofiban,</b> which prevents platelet adhesion and aggregation, together in bioactive concentrations from the same copolymer system. Combined elution from thermoresponsive N-isopropylacrylamide (NiPAAm) /N-tert-butylacrylamide (NtBAAm) -derived copolymer systems was achieved using microgels (NiPAAm/NtBAAm 65 / 35 wt/wt) randomly dispersed in 85 / 15 matrices. Fluvastatin elution from 5 mm films over a 14 -day period showed initial burst release, which leveled off. Of the total incorporated (8. 33 ± 0. 21 nmol, n= 4), 68. 5 % was eluted during this period. <b>Xemilofiban</b> release was measured in terms of its ability to inhibit platelet adhesion, using a microfluidic system.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The primary {{mechanism}} of action of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonists is inhibition of the final common pathway of platelet aggregation: fibrinogen binding to the GP IIb/IIIa complex. However, {{it has been reported}} that induction of fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation is an intrinsic prothrombotic property of low-dose GP IIb/IIIa antagonists. These apparently paradoxical results have been extensively referenced in the cardiology literature. METHODS AND RESULTS: By platelet aggregation and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that (1) dissociation of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists (abciximab, tirofiban, eptifibatide, or <b>xemilofiban)</b> from platelets does not result in platelet aggregation; (2) tirofiban and eptifibatide can induce a fibrinogen-binding-competent conformation of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, but stable fibrinogen binding does not occur without fixation; (3) the slow off-rate of abciximab exposes only a small proportion of unblocked GP IIb/IIIa receptors at any time, and these also fail to stably bind fibrinogen; and (4) the GP IIb/IIIa antagonist-induced fibrinogen binding in some previously reported experiments was probably the result of artifactual thrombin generation. CONCLUSIONS: Under physiological conditions, GP IIb/IIIa antagonists currently in clinical use do not have an intrinsic activating property that results in platelet aggregation or stable fibrinogen binding to GP IIb/IIIa...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{platelets}} in {{the process}} of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention is not fully understood. After vascular injury there is extensive platelet activation, adhesion, aggregation and secretion. Through the liberation of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, and surface expression of cell adhesion molecules, such as the glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa integrin, platelets appear to be a pivotal mediator of the vascular injury response. Experimental models have demonstrated that profound, prolonged thrombocytopenia, or blockade of the Ilb/IIIa receptor, may reduce neointimal hyperplasia after arterial balloon injury. However, multiple clinical trials testing conventional or new platelet agents have not yielded any salutary effects. The recent finding that abciximab, a monoclonal antibody fragment directed against Ilb/IIIa, reduced clinical restenosis after coronary angioplasty by 26 % in patients raises questions about the mechanism of benefit. The αvβ 3 vitronectin receptor is responsible for binding endothelial cells to platelets, and it also has a key role in modulating smooth muscle cell migration. It is possible that the antibody fragment exerts its effect on restenosis by means of αvβ 3, because abciximab fully cross-reacts to this integrin owing to the shared β 3 subunit. To date, the other platelet glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa inhibitors, including Integrelin, Tirofiban, Lamifiban and <b>Xemilofiban,</b> are specific in binding to this particular integrin. Considerable further study is necessary to unravel the effects of platelets on the restenosis process...|$|E
40|$|As the {{glycoprotein}} GPIIb/IIIa receptor is {{the final}} common pathway in platelet aggregation, antagonists of this receptor cause a profound inhibition of aggregation induced by any agonist. The short-term efficacy and safety of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty was demonstrated with murine 7 E 3 Fab, but this antibody was immunogenic. Abciximab is a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody that is less immunogenic. The first major trial with a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist was the EPIC trial with abciximab, which showed that abciximab reduced the ischemic complications of coronary balloon angioplasty and atherectomy in high-risk patients, but increased the risk of bleeding. Subsequent studies showed that using less concurrent heparin reduced bleeding. Abciximab also reduced the rate of revascularization. Further {{studies have shown that}} the benefits of abciximab extended to all patients undergoing angioplasty (EPILOG), including patients with unstable angina (CAPTURE) and acute myocardial infarction (RAPPORT). Clinical trials with eptifibatide and tirofiban have failed to demonstrate benefit, at the doses used, in angioplasty. Abciximab and eptifibatide, but not oral <b>xemilofiban,</b> improve the safety of the coronary stenting procedure. Shortterm intravenous treatment with lamifiban, eptifibatide or tirofiban is beneficial in acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, non-Q wave myocardial infarction). Orally active GPIIb/IIIa antagonists are being developed for use in acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction. However, no benefit has been shown with lefradafiban in acute coronary syndromes and sibrafiban and orbofiban are harmful. Eptifibatide, lamifiban and abciximab improve coronary patency in myocardial infarction, and long-term trials of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists are being conducted in acute myocardial infarction. Abciximab can cause thrombocytopenia, and all the GPIIb/IIIa antagonists increase the incidence of bleeding, but there is no excess of intracranial hemorrhage. (C) 2001 Prous Science.
