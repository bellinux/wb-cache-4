40|$|AIM: To {{repair the}} partial {{esophagus}} defect with a chitosan stent, a new esophageal prosthesis made of pulmonary tissue with vascular pedicle. METHODS: Fifteen Japanese big ear white rabbits {{were divided into}} experimental group (n = 10) and control group (n = 5). Esophagus defect in rabbits of experimental group was repaired using lung tissue flap with a chitosan tube stent, gross and histological appearance was observed at week 2, 4 and 8 after operation, and barium sulphate <b>X-ray</b> <b>screen</b> was performed at week 10 after operation. Esophagus defect of rabbits in control group was repaired using lung tissue flap with no chitosan tube stent, gross and histological appearance was observed at week 2, 4 and 8 after operation, and barium sulphate <b>X-ray</b> <b>screen</b> was performed at week 10 after operation. RESULTS: In the experimental group, 6 rabbits survived for over two weeks, the lung tissue flap healed esophageal defection, and squamous metaplasia occurred {{on the surface of}} lung tissue flap. At week 10 after operation, barium sulphate examination found that barium was fluent through the esophagus with no stricture or back stream, the creeping was good. In the control group, 4 rabbits survived for two weeks, the lung tissue flap healed esophageal defection with fibrous tissue hyperplasia, barium sulphate examination found that barium was fluent through the esophagus with a slight stricture or back stream, and the creeping was not good at week 10 after operation.

40|$|Fine resolution, bright X-ray screens {{are needed}} for digital {{radiography}} and material characterization at the Y- 12 National Security Complex (Y- 12). Current technology is simply not adequate for transferring high-energy X-ray images to visible light for demanding digital applications. Low energy radiography and especially emerging tomographic technologies are severely hampered for Y- 12 nondestructive evaluation (NDE) applications by dim screens with poor resolution. Also, {{the development of more}} advanced materials characterization techniques, such as electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), is driven by a design agency desire for tighter specifications and more uniform materials. Brighter screens would allow us to probe materials on a finer scale, leading {{to a better understanding of}} material behavior. A number of <b>X-ray</b> <b>screen</b> materials were studied that would be suitable for direct replacement in existing digital imaging systems. Spectroscopic evaluations were first made for a several candidates and indicated that lutetium orthosilicate (LSO) would be a promising candidate for MeV images. A relative comparison of brightness at various energies was then completed which showed that cesium iodide (CsI) could increase brightness by over an order of magnitude. Since image quality is also important for better screens, the resolving capabilities of candidate materials were measured. Resolution measurements were completed at X-ray peak energies up to 420 KeV with magnified optical imaging systems, and indicated that LSO and Industrial Quality Incorporated glass (IQI) exhibited higher resolution than the CsI screen. The results give a choice of materials that can be tailored to the particular test under consideration. If high-speed images are necessary and some resolution can be sacrificed, the CsI screen will be a good choice. The screen can be replaced by an IQI or LSO unit if higher resolution is needed later, for instance to focus in on a region of interest. A number of significant findings were obtained from this study. Most important of the findings was that materials are commercially available that are much brighter than screens currently in use. This finding meets the original objective of the project. Two objectives of the study; however, were not met. We hoped to evaluate a &#x 27;quantum dot&#x 27; (nanometer-sized particles of semiconductor material) wavelength conversion screen, but the manufacturer ceased production of the screen shortly before the project was started. The dot screen could be efficient in converting ultraviolet light to visible light which would have proved important for utilizing a Cherenkov screen. Since this was a very new, cutting-edge technology, an alternative supplier was not found during the study. Also, high-energy testing of a Cherenkov light screen was not performed due to difficulties in obtaining appropriate approvals for locating test equipment in the high-energy X-ray vault at Y- 12. The test is still important, and is being pursued through follow-on funding sources. Although many film shots will be eliminated by the availability of high quality digital images, the largest potential gains result from the availability of clearer images that show fine detail in the parts under analysis. Digital radiographic data also offers the possibility of easily sharing data with other sites. This could prove invaluable when critical material, placement, assembly, or quality issues are pressing. Also, increased throughput in the NDE facility allows statistically significant numbers of units to be analyzed. Digital technologies may in fact be needed just to meet minimum requirements of future demands. Increased brightness screens allow for such innovations as 3 -D tomographic images to be acquired in a reasonable time. Much of the skill required to interpret &#x 27;flattened&#x 27; X-ray images is not needed to maneuver around the reconstructed tomogram. This study showed that several commercially available materials are much brighter than screens currently in use. The study also showed that materials other than the brightest may be preferred for the best resolution. Since the X-ray conversion screen can be designed for easy exchange, a combination of materials will ultimately be the best approach for the broad range of radiography analysis performed at Y- 12...|$|E

40|$|Fluorescent <b>x-ray</b> <b>screens</b> {{are used}} in medical x-ray {{diagnostics}} to absorb x-ray photons and convert these x-ray photons to visible light. The light distribution from these screens are then registered on photographic film to give an x-ray image. Both the sensitivity and the resolution characteristics of these systems are dependent on the x-ray photon energy. To enable a study of these and some other energy dependent characteristics of <b>x-ray</b> <b>screens</b> a number of almost monoener-getic radiation sources were constructed, tested {{with regard to their}} purity and calibrated. Both film and a photo-multiplier tube were used as light detectors. The sensitivity of screens with three different screen phosphors were studied {{as a function of the}} photon energy and large variations in sensitivity was found for different photon energies and screen phosphors. The light from the screens has been compared to the absorbed energy in the screens and this comparison shows that the energy dependence of the screens can approximately be predicted by calculations of the absorbed energy, except at low photon energies where other effects like increased light absorption in the screens is present. The modulation transfer factor (MTF) was studied both experimentally and theoretically as a function of photon energy. Two effects were shown to influence the energy dependence of the MTF. At low energies an increased light diffusion will destroy the MTF and at energies above the K-edge of the high-Z elements in the screens the production and re-absorption of K-radiation will deteriorate the MTF. Both the energy dependence of the screen-film sensitivity and the MTF have been calculated for some normally used spectral distributions from x-ray tubes and significant changes due to choice of kV and filtration of the beam were found. Other effects such as the number of interacting photons in the screens per unit area, contribution of K-radiation from one screen to the other, and light contribution to the front emulsion of the film compared to the back emulsion have also been investigated as a function of photon energy. Optimization of x-ray systems and clinical routines to give the lowest possible radiation dose to the patient with an acceptable image quality is an important task to carry out. The energy dependent characteristi es of <b>x-ray</b> <b>screens</b> studied in this work is a lead in the optimizing of the system with regard to choice of <b>x-ray</b> <b>screens,</b> film and radiation quality. digitalisering@um...|$|R
