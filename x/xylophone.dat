5|$|Early {{forms of}} <b>xylophone</b> {{such as the}} atranatrana are found {{throughout}} the island and {{are believed to have}} come across with the original Indonesian settlers. The earliest of these is played uniquely by a pair of women, one of whom sits with her legs outstretched together and the bars of the <b>xylophone</b> resting across her legs rather than on a separate resonator box. Each woman strikes the atranatrana with a pair of sticks, one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody. The <b>xylophone</b> bars range from five to seven in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot-resistant wood called hazomalagny. A similar <b>xylophone</b> called katiboky is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups.|$|E
5|$|Ghosts I–IV {{features}} a wide assortment of musical instruments, including piano, guitar, bass, synthesizer, marimba, tambourine, banjo, dulcimer, and <b>xylophone,</b> {{many of which}} were sampled and distorted electronically. Percussion instruments, contributed primarily by Brian Viglione, were constructed largely out of found objects and household items.|$|E
5|$|Idiophones, {{which produce}} sound by {{vibrating}} the primary {{body of the}} instrument itself; they are sorted into concussion, percussion, shaken, scraped, split, and plucked idiophones, such as claves, <b>xylophone,</b> guiro, slit drum, mbira, and rattle.|$|E

There are {{differences}} from the original AB part, including new bitonal passage (m530) and miniature round (m622) between <b>xylophones</b> and pianolas. The pentatonic melody, hinted in part B, returns (m649) and gets developed {{in the context of}} the round.|$|R

5|$|Until {{forced to}} give up because of arthritis, Moore was a keen pianist and {{accomplished}} <b>xylophone</b> player, having first played the instrument {{at the age of}} 13. He composed a substantial corpus of works, including two operettas. Moore had a ballet, Lyra's Dream, written to his music. He performed at a Royal Command Performance, and performed a duet with Evelyn Glennie.|$|E

5|$|Higgins' song writing {{grew out}} of a desire to express her {{emotions}} when she was at school and her lyrics describe her feelings about her own life and relationships. The piano was the first instrument she learned to play, and she continues to use it as well as digital pianos including a Roland RD-300SX, RD-700 and KR-15. She also uses guitars extensively in her music particularly when touring, due to their portable nature and favours the Australian brand, Maton. On occasion she plays keytar, <b>xylophone</b> and melodica during performances.|$|E
5|$|The album {{prominently}} features flute, acoustic {{and electric}} guitars and Hammond organ, {{which had been}} used previously, but the instrumentation includes harpsichord, <b>xylophone,</b> timpani, violin, lute, trumpet, saxophone, and a string section—all uncommon in the band's earlier blues-inspired rock. Anderson later said that the lyrics were partly derived from experiences his own childhood, though the overall theme was showing Bostock's attempt {{to make sense of}} life from his point of view.|$|E
5|$|Bangui’s artisans’ {{market has}} {{traditional}} wares representing the art products from {{different regions of}} the country. Handicrafts include woven mats and baskets, wooden utensils of simple design, carved stools, pottery, musical instruments, tanned skins, and wood products. The balafon, similar to a <b>xylophone,</b> is made out of the horns of animals. Innovative designs include butterfly wings stuck with gum on paper, and ebony and hardwood carvings of wood from the tropical region. Artwork also covers carved animals and human figures. The crafts center in Bangui provides training to about 100 students in artistic crafting in leather, ivory and ebony wares.|$|E

5000|$|Concert <b>xylophones</b> have tube {{resonators}} {{below the}} bars {{to enhance the}} tone and sustain. Frames are made of wood or cheap steel tubing: more expensive <b>xylophones</b> feature height adjustment and more stability in the stand. In other music cultures some versions have gourds that act as Helmholtz resonators. Others are [...] "trough" [...] <b>xylophones</b> with a single hollow body {{that acts as a}} resonator for all the bars. Old methods consisted of arranging the bars on tied bundles of straw, and, as still practiced today, placing the bars adjacent to each other in a ladder-like layout. Ancient mallets were made of willow wood with spoon-like bowls on the beaten ends.|$|R

5|$|Messiaen's {{music was}} {{by this time}} championed by, among others, Pierre Boulez, who {{programmed}} first performances at his Domaine musical concerts and the Donaueschingen festival. Works performed included Réveil des oiseaux, Chronochromie (commissioned for the 1960 festival) and Couleurs de la cité céleste. The latter piece {{was the result of}} a commission for a composition for three trombones and three xylophones; Messiaen added to this more brass, wind, percussion and piano, and specified a <b>xylophone,</b> xylorimba and marimba rather than three xylophones. Another work of this period, Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum, was commissioned as a commemoration of the dead of the two World Wars and was performed first semi-privately in the Sainte-Chapelle, then publicly in Chartres Cathedral with Charles de Gaulle in the audience.|$|E
5|$|The game's story {{revolves}} around creatures known as Tikis, which {{are new to}} the series. The different types of Tikis fill {{the role of the}} antagonists in the story, replacing the Kremlings from Donkey Kong Country. Cranky Kong, who owns shops throughout the island, is the only Kong family member that appears other than Donkey and Diddy. The story begins when a group of evil Tikis known as the Tiki Tak Tribe arrive on Donkey Kong Island after being awoken by a volcanic eruption, and play music to hypnotize the animals on the island into stealing Donkey Kong's bananas. Since Donkey Kong is resistant to the Tikis' music, he works with Diddy Kong to retrieve his hoard of bananas from the Tikis. Throughout the game, the pair travel through eight worlds to recover their stolen bananas: the Jungle, the Beach, the Ruins, the Cave, the Forest, the Cliff, the Factory, and the Volcano. In each world, they must defeat a Tiki Tak Tribe leader: Kalimba, the Maraca Triplets, Gong, Banjo, Panflute, <b>Xylophone,</b> Accordion (who hypnotizes other animals in the jungle to fight the Kongs), and Tiki Tong, the king of the Tiki Tak Tribe. After Tiki Tong is defeated, the Kongs are launched into space where they punch down on the Moon, crushing Tiki Tong's base and sending bananas flying everywhere.|$|E

50|$|The Cambodian ensemble—which has {{traditionally}} accompanied court dance, masked plays, and shadow plays and ceremonies—is composed of vocalists and instruments: gong chimes, reed instruments, metallophones, <b>xylophones,</b> drums, and ching. A Thai ensemble consists of stringed fiddles, flutes, zither, <b>xylophones,</b> gong circles, drums, and ching. Melody in both Thai and Khmer musics is regulated by cyclic patterns realized on the drums and ching.|$|R
50|$|The term is also popularly used {{to refer}} to similar {{instruments}} of the lithophone and metallophone types. For example, the Pixiphone and many similar toys described by the makers as <b>xylophones</b> have bars of metal rather than of wood, and so are in organology regarded as glockenspiels rather than as <b>xylophones.</b> The bars of metal sound more high pitched than the wooden ones.|$|R
