Lead artist Keiji Inafune (credited as a planner as Inemuryar) recounted {{that the development of}} Mega Man <b>X</b> <b>required</b> a lot of brainstorming for its storyline and content where the team's goal was to branch out from original Mega Man games while still maintaining their fundamentals. In the original Mega Man series, Inafune typically designed the protagonist while his protégé Hayato Kaji handled the supporting characters. However, their roles were reversed for Mega Man X. Kaji (credited as Rippa H.K) illustrated the protagonist X, but had a difficult time with the initial design. He was presented with much more freedom than he was accustomed with the SNES's larger palette of colors when compared to the NES. Inafune and Kaji worked simultaneously on the various designs for X with different pieces of armor attached. The idea for the armor parts came about because the game was planned during a time when role-playing video games were becoming extremely popular. Inafune felt that Mega Man had always represented a classic action game formula in which the hero earns his defeated enemies' abilities; the armor parts were added to supplement this concept.|$|E

40|$|We generalize {{the theory}} of Koszul {{complexes}} and Koszul algebras (in particular, Koszul duality between symmetric and exterior algebras) to symmetric tensor categories. In characteristic p> 5, this theory exhibits peculiar effects, not observed in the classical theory. In particular, we show that the symmetric and exterior algebras of a non-invertible simple object in the Verlinde category Ver_p are almost Koszul (although not Koszul), and show how this gives examples of (r,s) -Koszul algebras with any r,s> 2. We also develop a theory of Lie algebras in symmetric tensor categories. We show that the PBW theorem may fail in Ver_p, but it holds if one assumes a certain identity of degree p which we call the p-Jacobi identity. This identity is a generalization to p> 5 of the identity [x,x]= 0 required for Lie algebras in characteristic 2 and the identity [[x,x],x]= 0 for odd <b>x</b> <b>required</b> for Lie superalgebras in characteristic 3.

40|$|Objective: To screen, isolate and {{optimize}} anti-white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) drug {{derived from}} various marine floral ecosystems and {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of the same in host–pathogen interaction model. Methods: Thirty species of marine plants were subjected to Soxhlet extraction using water, ethanol, methanol and hexane as solvents. The 120 plant isolates thus obtained were screened for their in vivo anti-WSSV property in Litopenaeus vannamei. By means of chemical processes, the purified anti-WSSV plant isolate, MP 07 X was derived. The drug was optimized at various concentrations. Viral and immune genes were analysed using reverse transcriptase PCR to confirm the potency of the drug. Results: Nine plant isolates exhibited significant survivability in host. The drug MP 07 X thus formulated showing 85 % survivability in host. The surviving shrimps were nested PCR negative {{at the end of the}} 15 d experimentation. The lowest concentration of MP 07 <b>X</b> <b>required</b> intramuscularly for virucidal property was 10 mg/mL. The oral dosage of 1 [*] 000 mg/kg body weight/day survived at the rate of 85 %.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the following rate distortion problem: given a source X and correlated, decoder side information Y, find the minimum encoding rate for <b>X</b> <b>required</b> to compute f(X, Y) at the decoder within distortion D. This is a generalization of the classical Wyner-Ziv setup and was resolved by Yamamoto (1982). However, this result involved an auxiliary random variable that lacks explicit meaning. To provide a more direct link between this variable and the function f, Orlitsky and Roche (2001) established the minimal rate required in the zero-distortion case {{as an extension of}} Körner’s graph entropy. Recently, we (with Jaggi) showed that the zero-distortion rate can be achieved by minimum entropy graph coloring of an appropriate product graph. This leads to a modular architecture for functional source coding with a preprocessing “functional coding ” scheme operating on top of a classical Slepian-Wolf source coding scheme. In this paper, we give a characterization of Yamamoto’s rate distortion function in terms of a reconstruction function. This (non-single-letter) characterization is an extension of our previous results as well as Orlitsky and Roche’s results. We obtain a modular scheme operating with Slepian-Wolf’s scheme for the problem of functional rate distortion. Further, we give an achievable rate (with single-letter characterization) utilizing this scheme that intuitively extends our previous results...|$|E
