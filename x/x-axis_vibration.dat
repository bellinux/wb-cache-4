40|$|Ten {{subjects}} {{performed a}} numeral reading task under five levels of sinusoidal whole-body vibralion at various frequencies {{in each of}} the three translational axes. In the z-axis the vibration frequencies were spaced at half octaves between 2 - 8 and 63 Hz, and in the x and y-axes at half octaves between 2 - 8 and 32 Hz. All of the vibration conditions were presented with two sealing conditions: hard flat seat with fixed footrcst and a simulated helicopter seat with moving footrest. With both seats the effect of vibration level on reading accuracy was found to be significant at all but the highest frequencies of z-axis vibration. It was also significant for <b>x-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> with the simulated helicopter seat, but not for x-axis vibralion with the flat seat or for y-axis vibration with either seat. Results are presented in the form of equal performance contours. Measures of translational and rotational head motion were also made for each vibration axis and seat. Very little vibration was found to be transmitted to the head during <b>x-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> with the flat seat or y-axis vibration with either seat, in agreement with the small effect of vibration on reading performance in these cases. These results were combined with performance data to investigate the feasibilily of predicting performance decrements directly from head motions. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Ergonomics [© Taylor & Francis] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] people are exposed to whole-body vibration in many environments. This paper investigates the effects of horizontal whole-body vibration and standing posture on task performance. Sixteen participants were exposed to random vibration (up to 4 Hz), whilst performing a timed pegboard task in two standing postures. Objective and subjective indicators of performance were used. Time taken to complete the task increased progressively with increases in vibration magnitude; the fore-and-aft posture generally showed greater performance decrements and postural interruptions (> 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.) than the lateral. For both postures, performance was better during y-axis vibration than during <b>x-axis</b> <b>vibration.</b> Subjective ratings showed similar trends to time data. Impairments due to dual axis exposure were well predicted using r. s. s. summation calculations based on single axis components. These results indicate that best performance for those standing in moving environments will be achieved if individuals adopt a lateral posture with the most severe vibration in the y-axis...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} a miniature magnetic-force-based, three-axis, AC magnetic sensor with piezoelectric/vibrational energy-harvesting functions. For magnetic sensing, the sensor employs a magnetic–mechanical–piezoelectric configuration (which uses magnetic force and torque, a compact, single, mechanical mechanism, and the piezoelectric effect) to convert x-axis and y-axis in-plane and z-axis magnetic fields into piezoelectric voltage outputs. Under the x-axis magnetic field (sine-wave, 100 Hz, 0. 2 – 3. 2 gauss) and the z-axis magnetic field (sine-wave, 142 Hz, 0. 2 – 3. 2 gauss), the voltage output with {{the sensitivity of}} the sensor are 1. 13 – 26. 15 mV with 8. 79 mV/gauss and 1. 31 – 8. 92 mV with 2. 63 mV/gauss, respectively. In addition, through this configuration, the sensor can harness ambient vibrational energy, i. e., possessing piezoelectric/vibrational energy-harvesting functions. Under <b>x-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> (sine-wave, 100 Hz, 3. 5 g) and z-axis vibration (sine-wave, 142 Hz, 3. 8 g), the root-mean-square voltage output with power output of the sensor is 439 mV with 0. 333 μW and 138 mV with 0. 051 μW, respectively. These results show that the sensor, using this configuration, successfully achieves three-axis magnetic field sensing and three-axis vibration energy-harvesting. Due to these features, the three-axis AC magnetic sensor could be an important design reference in order to develop future three-axis AC magnetic sensors, which possess energy-harvesting functions, for practical industrial applications, such as intelligent vehicle/traffic monitoring, processes monitoring, security systems, and so on...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to present a {{qualification}} level vibration testing performed on the S/N 202, EOS AMSU-A 1 Instrument was vibration tested to qualification levels per the Ref. 1 shop order. The instrument withstood the 8 g sine sweep test, the 7. 5 Grms random vibration test, and the 18. 75 g sine burst test {{in each of the}} three orthogonal axes. Some loss of transmissibility, however, is seen in the lower reflector after Z-axis random vibration. The test sequence was not without incidence. Failure of Channel 7 in the Limited Performance Test (LPT) performed after completion of the 1 st (<b>X-axis)</b> axis <b>vibration</b> sequence, required replacement of the DRO and subsequent re-testing of the instrument. The post-vibration comprehensive performance test (CPT) was successfully run after completion of the three axes of vibration with the replacement component installed in the instrument. Passing the CPT signified the successful completion of the S/N 202 A 1 qualification vibration testing...|$|R
40|$|Robots are {{important}} technology that greatly increases the productivity. In robotics a manipulator is a device used to manipulate materials without direct contact {{for dealing with}} radioactive or bio-hazardous materials, or they were used in inaccessible places. In this project, a single link flexible manipulator is used. It will {{be attached to the}} DC motor. When DC motor is rotated to certain angle, the single link also will rotate on <b>x-axis.</b> The <b>vibration</b> amplitude is produce directly from the speed of the rotation of the dc motor when it stops. A study to counter this problem had been made to control and maintains the accurate position of the single flexible manipulator. Matlab is software that will be use to conduct the study. The objective of this project to control vibration on the single link flexible manipulator using Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) Controller. Active Force Control (AFC) controller also will be used with PID Controller to compensate the vibration. The system without controller will be compare with the system with controller by the graph. The combination of AFC and PID give the best result in rise time, settling time and steady state error.

40|$|Vibration of {{the back}} is a {{potential}} source of discomfort for car passengers, with vibration in the x-axis (i. e. fore-and-aft with an upright backrest) often dominant. This study investigated how vibration discomfort depends on both the frequency of x-axis backrest vibration and the inclination {{of the back}}rest. Twelve subjects seated with a rigid backrest inclined by 0, 30, 60, or 90 degrees rated the discomfort caused by x-axis backrest vibration at 11 frequencies (between 2. 5 and 25 Hz) at 9 levels (from about 3 to 24 dB above the absolute threshold in 3 dB steps) relative to the discomfort caused by 0. 15 ms- 2 r. m. s. 8 -Hz x-axis backrest vibration. The subjects also rated the discomfort caused by 9 levels of 8 -Hz x-axis backrest vibration relative to the discomfort caused by 2. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s. 8 -Hz x-axis (i. e. vertical) vibration of the hand. The vibration acceleration of the backrest required to cause discomfort tended to be least at 8 Hz with the upright backrest and at 10 or 12. 5 Hz with the backrest inclined by 30 ?, 60 ?, or 90 ?. At frequencies from 4 to 8 Hz, about 30 to 40 % less acceleration was required to cause discomfort with the upright backrest than with the inclined backrests. It is concluded that frequency weighting Wc is appropriate for predicting vibration discomfort caused by <b>x-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> of an upright backrest, but that another frequency weighting (e. g. Wb) would be more appropriate for inclined backrests...|$|E
40|$|Reclined {{seats in}} {{transport}} suggest luxury and comfort, but {{a review of}} the literature revealed little study of how backrest inclination influences the discomfort caused by vibration of a seat or a backrest. This thesis seeks to advance understanding of the influence of backrest inclination on vibration discomfort and provides a model for evaluating vibration discomfort and metrics for optimising seats with different backrest inclinations. Vibration discomfort depends on the direction and location of vibration input to the body. Subjects used magnitude estimation to judge vibration magnitudes from thresholds of perception up to 2 ms- 2 r. m. s. at the 11 preferred 1 / 3 -octave centre frequencies from 2. 5 to 25 Hz. The first two experiments determined absolute thresholds and discomfort with x-axis backrest vibration (Experiment 1) and z-axis backrest vibration (Experiment 2) with four backrest inclinations (0 °, 30 °, 60 °, and 90 ° from vertical). The third experiment investigated discomfort with vertical seat pan vibration and five backrest conditions (no backrest and backrest inclined to 0 °, 30 °, 60 °, and 90 °). With <b>x-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> of the back, inclining the backrest had similar effects on thresholds and equivalent comfort contours. Thresholds increased at frequencies from 4 to 8 Hz with increasing inclination of the backrest. With inclined backrests, 40 % greater magnitudes of vibration were required from 4 to 8 Hz, to cause discomfort equivalent to that with the upright backrest. Frequency weighting Wc in current standards predicted discomfort and perception of <b>x-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> of the upright backrest (0 °) but weighting Wb was more appropriate for inclined backrests. Frequency weighting Wd was appropriate for both discomfort and perception of z-axis vibration of the back at all backrest inclinations. With vertical seat acceleration, the frequency of greatest sensitivity decreased with increasing vibration magnitude. Compared to an upright backrest, around the main resonance of the body the vibration magnitudes required to cause similar discomfort were 100 % greater with 60 ° and 90 ° backrest inclinations and 50 % greater with a 30 ° backrest inclination. The fourth experiment investigated whole-body vertical vibration on a rigid seat with no backrest and with four backrest inclinations. With an inclined backrest, discomfort caused by high frequency vibration increased at the head or neck but discomfort at the head or neck caused by low frequencies (5 and 6. 3 Hz) reduced. With inclined backrests, the procedures in current standards overestimate overall discomfort at frequencies around 5 and 6. 3 Hz but underestimate discomfort caused by frequencies greater than about 8 Hz. The final experiment investigated a model for predicting vibration discomfort with three compliant reclined seats. At each frequency, the measured seat dynamic discomfort, MSDD (the ratio of the vibration acceleration required to cause similar discomfort with a compliant seat and a rigid reference seat), was compared with seat effective amplitude transmissibility, SEAT value (the ratio of overall ride values with a compliant seat and a rigid reference seat using the weightings in current standards). The compliant seats increased vibration discomfort at frequencies around the 4 -Hz resonance but reduced vibration discomfort at frequencies greater than about 6. 3 Hz. The SEAT values provided appropriate indications of how the foam increased vibration discomfort at some frequencies but decreased vibration discomfort at other frequencies. Differences between the SEAT values and the measured seat dynamic discomfort are consistent with the need for different frequency weightings when the body is supported by an inclined backrest. An empirical model was evolved from the experiments for predicting vibration discomfort with reclined seats. It is concluded that reclining a backrest will tend to be detrimental at frequencies greater than about 10 Hz with greater discomfort in the head or neck induced by vibration of the backrest. At frequencies around 5 and 6. 3 Hz, reclining a backrest can reduce discomfort. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{engineering}} {{analyses of}} the integrated Ares-Orion stack show that vibration levels for Orion crews {{have the potential to}} be much higher than those experienced in Gemini, Apollo, and Shuttle vehicles. Of particular concern to the Constellation Program (CxP) is the 12 Hz thrust oscillation (TO) that the Ares-I rocket develops during the final ~ 20 seconds preceding first-stage separation, at maximum G-loading. While the structural-dynamic mitigations being considered can assure that vibration due to TO is reduced to below the CxP crew health limit, it remains to be determined how far below this limit vibration must be reduced to enable effective crew performance during launch. Moreover, this "performance" vibration limit will inform the operations concepts (and crew-system interface designs) for this critical phase of flight. While Gemini and Apollo studies provide preliminary guidance, the data supporting the historical limits were obtained using less advanced interface technologies and very different operations concepts. In this study, supported by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) Human Research Program, we investigated display readability-a fundamental prerequisite for any interaction with electronic crew-vehicle interfaces-while observers were subjected to 12 Hz vibration superimposed on the 3. 8 G loading expected for the TO period of ascent. Two age-matched groups of participants (16 general population and 13 Crew Office) performed a numerical display reading task while undergoing sustained 3. 8 G loading and whole-body vibration at 0, 0. 15, 0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 7 g in the eyeballs in/out (x-axis) direction. The time-constrained reading task used an Orion-like display with 10 - and 14 -pt non-proportional sans-serif fonts, and was designed to emulate the visual acquisition and processing essential for crew system monitoring. Compared to the no-vibration baseline, we found no significant effect of vibration at 0. 15 and 0. 3 g on task error rates (ER) or response times (RT). Significant degradations in both ER and RT, however, were observed at 0. 5 and 0. 7 g for 10 -pt, and at 0. 7 g for 14 -pt font displays. These objective performance measures were mirrored by participants' subjective ratings. Interestingly, we found that the impact of vibration on ER increased with distance {{from the center of the}} display, but only for vertical displacements. Furthermore, no significant ER or RT aftereffects were detected immediately following vibration, regardless of amplitude. Lastly, given that our reading task required no specialized spaceflight expertise, our finding that effects were not statistically distinct between our two groups is not surprising. The results from this empirical study provide initial guidance for evaluating the display readability trade-space between text-font size and vibration amplitude. However, the outcome of this work should be considered preliminary in nature for a number of reasons: 1. The single 12 Hz <b>x-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> employed was based on earlier load-cycle models of the induced TO environment at the end of Ares-I first stage flight. Recent analyses of TO mitigation designs suggest that significant concurrent off-axis vibration may also occur. 2. The shirtsleeve environment in which we tested fails to capture the full kinematic and dynamic complexity of the physical interface between crewmember and the still-to-bematured helmet-suit-seat designs, and the impact these will have for vibration transmission and consequent performance. 3. By examining performance in this reading and number processing task, we are only assessing readability, a first and necessary step that in itself does not directly address the performance of more sophisticated operational tasks such as vehicle-health monitoring or manual control of the vehicle...|$|E
