We give an exact formula for the intrinsic volume of this set and as n goes to infinity its asymptotic (with an explicit constant) is of the order n^(1 / 2). As a second application we consider the problem of computing Betti numbers of an intersection of k random Kostlan quadrics in RP^n. We show that the i-th Betti number is asymptotically expected to be one (for i sufficiently away from n/ 2). In the case k= 2 the the sum of all Betti numbers was recently shown by the first author to equal n+o(n). Here we sharpen this asymptotic proving an asymptotic with two orders of precision and explicit constants...|$|R

For such a system, {{the states are}} governed by the recursive equation <b>X</b> <b>n</b> = <b>A</b> <b>X</b> <b>n</b> 01 8 U n with the initial condition X 0 = x 0. By transforming the linear system under the max-plus algebra into a sublinear system under the usual algebra, we establish various exponential upper bounds for the tail distributions of the states <b>X</b> <b>n</b> under the i. i. d. assumption on f(A n; U n); <b>n</b> 1 g and <b>a</b> couple of regularity conditions on (A 1; U 1) and the initial condition x 0. These upper bounds {{are related to the}} spectral radius (or the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue) of the nonnegative matrix in which each element is the moment generating function of the corresponding element in the state-feedback matrix A 1. In particular, we have Kingman's upper bound for GI/GI/ 1 queue when the system is one-dimensional. We also show that some of these upper bounds can be achieved if A 1 is lower triangular. These bounds are applied to some commonly used systems to derive new results or strengthen known results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{determination}} of the eigenenergies of a quantum anharmonic oscillator consists merely in finding the zeros of {{a function of the}} energy, namely the Wronskian of two solutions of the Schrödinger equation which are regular respectively at the origin and at infinity. We show in this paper how to evaluate that Wronskian exactly, except for numerical rounding errors. The procedure is illustrated by application to the gx 2 + <b>x</b> 2 <b>N</b> (<b>N</b> <b>a</b> positive integer) oscillator. PACS number: 03. 65. Ge Submitted to: J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. Anharmonic oscillators 2 Quantum anharmonic oscillators have been frequently used in different branches of Physics to simulate a great variety of situations and to explain multitude of phenomena. Apart from this, since the publication of the seminal papers by Bender and Wu [1] and by Simon and Dicke [2] showing the failure of the Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation method, they have served to test plenty of approximate methods of solution of the Schrödinger equation. Papers dealing with the most recently proposed methods [3] contain references to older ones, that we omit for brevity. It seems, however, to hav...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} shown that if <b>X</b> is <b>an</b> <b>n</b> × N matrix whose entries are i. i. d. standard complex Gaussian and l 1 {{is the largest}} eigenvalue of X ∗ X, there exist sequences mn,N and sn,N such that (l 1 − mn,N) /sn,N converges in distribution to W 2, the Tracy–Widom law appearing {{in the study of}} the Gaussian unitary ensemble. This probability law has a density which is known and computable. The cumulative distribution function of W 2 is denoted F 2. In this paper we show that, under the assumption that n/N → γ ∈ (0, ∞), we can find a function M, continuous and nonincreasing, and sequences ˜µn,N and ˜σn,N such that, for all real s 0, there exists <b>an</b> integer <b>N(s</b> 0,γ) for which, if (n ∧ N) ≥ N(s 0,γ), we have, with ln,N = (l 1 −˜µn,N) / ˜σn,N, ∀ s ≥ s 0 (n ∧ N) 2 / 3 |P(ln,N ≤ s) − F 2 (s) |≤M(s 0) exp(−s). The surprisingly good 2 / 3 rate and qualitative properties of the bounding function help explain the fact that the limiting distribution W 2 is a good approximation to the empirical distribution of ln,N in simulations, an important fact from the point of view of (e. g., statistical) applications...|$|R
40|$|Two well studied Ramsey-theoretic {{problems}} consider subsets of {{the natural}} numbers which either contain no three elements in arithmetic progression, or in geometric progression. We study generalizations of this problem, by varying the kinds of progressions to be avoided and the metrics {{used to evaluate the}} density of the resulting subsets. One can view a 3 -term arithmetic progression as a sequence x, f_n(x), f_n(f_n(x)), where f_n(x) = <b>x</b> + <b>n,</b> <b>n</b> <b>a</b> nonzero integer. Thus avoiding three-term arithmetic progressions is equivalent to containing no three elements of the form x, f_n(x), f_n(f_n(x)) with f_n ∈F_ t, the set of integer translations. One can similarly construct related progressions using different families of functions. We investigate several such families, including geometric progressions (f_n(x) = nx with <b>n</b> > 1 <b>a</b> natural number) and exponential progressions (f_n(x) = x^n). Progression-free sets are often constructed "greedily," including every number so long as it is not in progression with any of the previous elements. Rankin characterized the greedy geometric-progression-free set in terms of the greedy arithmetic set. We characterize the greedy exponential set and prove that it has asymptotic density 1, and then discuss how the optimality of the greedy set depends on the family of functions used to define progressions. Traditionally, the size of a progression-free set is measured using the (upper) asymptotic density, however we consider several different notions of density, including the uniform and exponential densities.

Theorem 1. 1. Let <b>X</b> be <b>a</b> <b>n</b> × n Hermitian matrix with rank(X) =r and let Qk be <b>an</b> <b>n</b> × k matrix, k ≤ r, withkorthonormal columns. Then, for given X, tr(Q ∗ k XQk) is maximized when Qk = Vk, whereVk = [v 1,v 2, [...] .,vk] denotes a matrix of k orthonormal eigenvectors of X corresponding to the k largest eigenvalues. Proof. Let X = VDV ∗ be a spectral decomposition of X with V unitary and D = diag[λ 1,λ 2, [...] .,λn], the diagonal matrix of (real) eigenvalues ordered so that λ 1 ≥ λ 2 ≥···≥λn. (1. 1) Then, tr(Q ∗ kXQk) =tr(Z ∗ kDZk) =tr(ZkZ ∗ kD) =tr(PD), (1. 2) where Zk = V ∗ Qk and P = ZkZ ∗ k is a projection matrix with rank(P) =k. Clearly, the n × k matrix Zk has orthonormal columns if and only if Qk has orthonormal columns. Now tr(PD) = n...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} theorem in {{linear algebra}} {{tells us that}} every symmetric matrix <b>A</b> (<b>n</b> <b>x</b> <b>n)</b> can be factored as A = P DP T, where P is an orthogonal matrix and D is a diagonal matrix comprising of the eigenvalues of A. Such a diagonalization is possible only when A is symmetric. What if A is just a square matrix but not symmetric? We know that every square matrix A (symmetric or not) is diagonalizable as long there is a diagonal matrix D such that A is similar to D. When there exists such a matrix D, the relation between A and D is given by D = P − 1 AP, where D {{is the same as}} in the case of symmetric matrices, but P is now simply an invertible matrix. However, such a decomposition is possible only when the columns of P are the n linearly independent eigenvectors of <b>A.</b> Not every square (<b>n</b> <b>x</b> <b>n)</b> matrix is guaranteed to have n linearly independent eigenvectors. Thus, not every square matrix can be diagonalized in this fashion. Given these restrictions, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is especially important, in that it allows us to diagonalize any matrix (symmetric or not, square or not). In fact the SVD has a factorization of the form A = P DQ T, where P and Q are orthogonal and D is diagonal. This factorization is widely used in several branches of engineering and sciences. In the remainder of this report we shall: (1) Verify that such a factorization is indeed possible (2) Consider an algorithm that yields the factors (3) Look at the results of applying the algorithm in (2) to image compression/reconstruction (4) Discuss the MATLAB software that was used in implementing (2) and applying it to (3). 2.
