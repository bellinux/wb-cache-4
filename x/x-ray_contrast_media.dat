40|$|Purpose {{of review}} : Iodinated <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> are {{frequently}} administered in ICU patients. Recent studies challenge {{the relevance of}} <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> toxicity in ICU patients and relate occurrence of acute kidney injury to baseline characteristics and severity of illness. Recent findings : Various findings in studies with kidney biomarkers indicate the causal relationship between <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> exposure and kidney damage. <b>Contrast</b> <b>media</b> exposure not only causes direct tubular damage and renal hypoperfusion but also initiates the formation of reactive oxygen species in its turn causing tissue damage. The route of administration determines the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury with a higher incidence when <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> are administered by intra-arterial route versus intravenous route. The impact of contrast-associated acute kidney injury on hospital length of stay, the need for renal replacement therapy and survival remains {{a matter of debate}} because of discrepancies between observational versus case-matched studies and limitations of the individual studies. Summary : There are diverse pathophysiologic mechanisms explaining the causal relationship between the administration of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> and the development of acute kidney injury.

40|$|Depending on {{the size}} and equipment, the water {{consumption}} in hospitals averages between 130 and 1, 200 liters per bed and day. The contamination of hospital wastewater with chemical and physical standard parameters is comparable to municipal wastewater. However, heightened AOX-concentrations have been measured, which are mainly caused by the application and excretion of iodinated <b>X-ray</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> The concentrations of antibiotics and <b>X-ray</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> in hospital wastewater are about 10 to 100 times higher than in municipal wastewater, whereas other mainly domestically used pharmaceuticals are partially measured in higher concentrations in municipal wastewater. The literature generally considers hospitals as a main point source for the emission of multidrug resistant bacteria into the aquatic environment. Furthermore, hospital wastewater causes toxic and mutagenic effects. In {{the context of this}} dissertation, different technical and economic aspects of the separate collection and treatment of hospital wastewater have been investigated using the example of the Waldbröl county hospital. It has been demonstrated that the fraction of the overall pharmaceutical load in the inlet of the local municipal wastewater treatment plant that originates from the hospital, reaches a maximum of 8 % for Carbamazepine, Diclofenac and Ibuprofen, whereas fractions from 20 % to 94 % have been measured for the investigated antibiotics. These relatively high values as compared to what is found in the literature may be explained by the high number of hospital beds per 1, 000 P. E. (33. 9 in Waldbröl compared to 6. 2 in the nation-wide average). The full-scale wastewater treatment plant of the Waldbröl hospital proves that a combination of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and subsequent ozonation can eliminate all pharmaceuticals in the wastewater except for the <b>X-ray</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> to below a threshold value of 100 ng/l. The biological treatment in the MBR at the hospital, which was operated at a high solids retention time, shows a better elimination of antibiotics than the treatment in the central municipal wastewater treatment plant. Furthermore, the combination of MBR and ozonation largely ensures disinfection and greatly reduces the toxic and mutagenic potential. The specific energy consumption of the treatment plant after optimization measures averages 5. 0 kWh/m³. 80 % of the energy are used in the MBR while 20 % are used for ozonation. The specific treatment costs for the Waldbröl county hospital with its 342 beds amount to 4. 92 €/m³. The major part of the costs is allotted to the investment and operational costs of the MBR. If these costs are transferred to hospitals with different sizes, scaling effects have to be taken into account. Based on data for the development of specific costs of small decentralized MBR the cost range for the separate treatment of hospital wastewater can be estimated between 3 €/m³ for large hospitals with more than 1, 200 beds and 8 €/m³ for small hospitals with less than 100 beds. The costs depend on local circumstances and can differ from case to case. An economic comparison of a separate treatment of hospital wastewater with a refitting of central wastewater treatment plants with an ozonation, in order to find the most cost-effective option for eliminating pharmaceuticals, is affected by the number of beds in the respective hospital {{and the size of the}} municipal wastewater treatment plant. In case of the Waldbröl county hospital, which is connected to a small municipal wastewater treatment plant, the separate treatment is cost-effective if the concentration of pharmaceuticals in the hospital wastewater is about 40 times higher than in the municipal wastewater. As for selected antibiotics, the separate treatment of the wastewater of the Waldbröl county hospital can be assessed as cost-effective...|$|E
40|$|A {{reliable}} assessment of relevant substance flows {{is very important}} for environmental risk assessments and efficiency analysis of measures to reduce or avoid emissions of micropollutants like drugs to water systems. Accordingly, a detailed preparation of monitoring campaigns should include an accuracy check for the sampling configuration to prove the reliability of the monitoring results and the subsequent data processing. The accuracy of substance flow analyses is expected to be particularly weak for substances having high short-term variations of concentrations in sewage. This is especially the case linked to the observation of substance flows close to source in waste water systems. The verification of a monitoring configuration in a hospital sewer in Luxembourg is in the centre of interest of the case study presented here.

The expression of kidney injury molecule 1 (Kim- 1) and Heme Oxygenase I (HO- 1) was measured in healthy Han Wistar rats by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR). The protein syntheses with Multiplex ELISA was also tested on Han Wistar rats.

The perfusion time of the kidney after <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> application was determined using contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Results: CT and RFA in the kidneys of animals treated with Iodixanol revealed prolonged retention of iodine in the kidney as compared to animals treated with Iopromide. This difference was even more pronounced in renally impaired rats. 24 hours after Iodixanol treatment, significantly increased levels of Kim- 1 and HO- 1 transcript levels were observed compared to the saline and Iopromide treatment. When evaluating the proteins in the renal tissue {{that can be used for}} the early detection of renal deficiencies, for the dimeric <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> there have been found elevated values for some proteins in comparison to the values found in the proband animal group treated with monomeric <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> The MTT and ATP concentration show a concentration dependent decrease. Conclusion: A prolonged retention of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> in the kidney was observed after administration of high-viscous, iso-osmolar <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> One possible explanation for this effect could be the high viscosity of high-viscous, iso-osmolar dimeric <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> and the lack of dilution by osmotic diuresis. This prolonged exposure is possibly associated with higher renal toxicity as indicated by the elevated expression of biomarkers for hypoxia and renal injury...|$|R
40|$|Iodinated <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> (ICM) are {{commonly}} administered pharmaceutical agents. Most {{often they are}} used intravenously and intraarterially. Although iodinated contrast agents are relatively safe and widely used, adverse events occur and questions remain about their use, safety, and interactions. The most important adverse effects of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> include hypersensitivity reactions, thyroid dysfunction, and contrast-induced nephropathy. Radiologists {{must be aware of}} the risk factors for reactions to <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> Nonionic iodinated <b>contrast</b> agents can be divided into monomeric, low-osmolar, and dimeric, iso-osmolar classes. The osmotic characteristics of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> have been a significant focus in many investigations of contrast-induced nephropathy...|$|R
