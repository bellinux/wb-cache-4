50|$|Graves {{containing}} up to 3000 {{years old}} textiles {{have been found}} in the autonomous Uygur region of <b>Xinjiang,</b> <b>located</b> in the Turpan oasis in northwestern China. At that time, nomadic pastoral farming was spreading out in Asia. Increasing extreme aridity ensured natural conservation. A pair of woven wool trousers some 3,200 years old, consisting of two legs and a stepped gusset, has since early 2014 been officially declared the world’s oldest trousers. Researchers have determined that the material was not cut to size but woven custom fit for each individual. Based on the other grave relics like typical weapons and bridles, the assumption is that these trousers were worn by horseback riders. This is also suggested by the wide crotch gusset, which allows the rider to easily sit astride a horse.|$|E

40|$|By {{comparing}} of the multi-year mean monthly rainfall in {{the study}} area, {{the results showed that}} water resources of oasis in the arid area of Northwest China and Central Asia varied a lot. In Central Asia the annual average rainfall of the oasis was 313. 2 mm and 24. 3 mm showed up during June to September. The average precipitation coefficient value was 8. 07 %. And water and heat were intensively not in the same period but winter and spring was contrary to summer. In the west of River Corridor and so on the average annual rainfall was 110. 6 mm, the average value from June to September was 79. 8 mm and the average precipitation coefficient was 72. 14 %, where water and heat were in-tensively in the same period. However, the situation in winter and spring was totally different to summer. <b>Xinjiang</b> <b>located</b> between Central A-sia and the west of River Corridor so did the rainfall and precipitation coefficient the same. The precipitation of the subsystems of the moun-tain-desert-oasis system {{in the study}} area was quite different from each other. But the precipitation coefficients of each subsystem in the same season were very similar. These characteristics of water resource deeply influenced the decisions on water usage and agricultural pro-duction in different areas. As far as the Southern Xinjiang was concerned, more importance should be attached to modern science and tech-nology, increase the investment in water conservancy project construction, combining with the water-saving agricultural technologies, to im-prove the efficiency of water usage from the connotation aspect. It would be also conducive to enlarge the irrigation area, increase the per cul-tivated area, promote agricultural development, alleviate poverty in a wider range and benefit the social stability...|$|E

40|$|It is only {{by using}} the first {{collection}} of intelligence satellite imagery acquired by CORONA, that time series of NDVI imagery can go back for a time period of nearly 50 years, based on diachronic mapping. This is an exceptionally long time period if not the longest, for which remote sensing imagery is available to estimate land use change for specific regions on the globe. The P. R. of China and the former USSR can be documented to nearly 50 years back in time, using CORONA satellite imagery. Typically – for many regions of the globe – is that a 50 year time span represents the principal time period in which many anthropogenic land use changes have taken place. In this paper, an account is given of the land use change which took place over the last 44 years in the Chinese province of <b>Xinjiang,</b> <b>located</b> in the North-west of the country. Declassified CORONA imagery was used, as well as LANDSAT MSS and ETM+ imagery. The Xinjiang province {{has one of the}} largest inland water basins on the globe, e. g. that of the Tarim river. Moreover, the province has grown into a major cotton and fruit producer in China. Based on diachronic mapping with CORONA and LANDSAT imagery, we can illustrate that over the last 44 years the Tarim river basin has undergone drastic land use changes, e. g., from nonfragmented landscapes of natural vegetation to fragmented mosaics of agrcicultural plots and desert. The region of interest in this study is the downstream area of the Tarim basin in the province of Xinjiang in the P. R. of China. A transfer function was established between canopy panchromatic reflectance (pc,pan) and canopy NDVI (NDVIc). This allows to reach the objective to increase the back casting time period of land use change observations based on satellite observations. To this end, a coupled PROSPECT-SAIL radiative transfer modelling approach was applied. Our approach elicited that the relationship between NDVI and ppan at leaf level, converges to a single relationship depending on leaf structure. The canopy level transfer function used to convert pc,pan into NDVIc was established using different chlorophyll contents, LAI values and a bright soil in the PROSPECT/SAIL radiative transfer models. A main result is that for a time lapse of 44 years, a drastic change in land use took place in the downstream reaches of the Tarim river basin. In many places natural vegetation has converted into high productivity irrigated agricultural plots. On the other hand natural vegetation also degraded into desert and semi-desert areas of very low to zero level productivity. A relatively small area (13 %) of the Tarim downstream area has remained unchanged during the course of 44 years. Typically, the radiation regime and especially the hydrology of the the Xinjiang province has changed significantly over the last 44 years due to this drastic land use change. During this period the Tarim river retracted upstream, several hundreds of km, leaving behind desert land inapt for agricultural production and hence inapt to sustain human life...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Xinjiang</b> is <b>located</b> on the {{northwest}} border of China, which is an important agricultural production and export base. In order to establish integrated management of agricultural products and service information system, China put forward the "Golden Agriculture Project " program in 1994, whose construction development is still insufficient because of the backward informatization level in Xinjiang. This article uses the management theory to analyze the shortcomings of the current three information platforms for agricultural products，based on the current situation of the Xinjiang’s informationization and the different demand for information of each node on the supply chain of agricultural products. Proposing an interactive platform for integrated information of agricultural products which combines farm production, supply and marketing of Xinjiang agricultural products. This will help the information platform {{to play the role}} of information collection and distribution, and to improve the efficiency of the circulation of Xinjiang agricultural products...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn China, KSHV {{seroprevalence}} varies considerably {{among different}} regions and ethnicities. But in <b>Xinjiang</b> province, <b>located</b> {{in the northwestern}} China, {{there is a very}} high seroprevalence of KSHV in adults of Kazak and Ughur ethnicities. However, KSHV prevalence in children and the risk factors associated with the acquisition of infection are currently not known. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the prevalence of KSHV infection and identify associated socioeconomic or behavioural risk factors and the humoral immune response among children in this population. This is a cross-sectional study (N = 178) to screen children and their caregivers from Xinjiang for total KSHV antibodies, KSHV neutralizing antibodies and HIV infection. Structured questionnaires were utilized to investigate risk factors associated with KSHV prevalence. KSHV seroprevalence in children and caregivers in Xinjiang was 48. 3 % and 64. 7 %, respectively. Neutralizing antibody was detected in most seropositive caregivers (93. 8 %) but was detected in only 5. 8 % of the infected children. A significant association was observed between child KSHV seroprevalence and sharing of food among family members. These results suggest that similar to other endemic areas in Africa, KSHV infection in the minority populations of Xinjiang is likely to be occurring during early childhood, probably via horizontal transmission through saliva, and results in high seroprevalence in the adult population...|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of June3-4, 1864, the Dungans of Kucha, one of the cities south of Tianshan, rose up and were soon joined by the local Turkic people. The Han fort, which, unlike many other <b>Xinjiang</b> locations, was <b>located</b> inside the town rather than outside it, fell within a few days. Government {{buildings}} were burnt and some 1000 Hans and 150 Mongols killed. As neither the Dungan nor Turkic leaders of the rebellion had sufficient authority over the entire community to become commonly recognized as a leader, the rebels instead choose {{a person who had}} not participated in the rebellion, but was known for his spiritual role: Rashidin (Rashīdīn) Khoja, a dervish and the custodian of the grave of his ancestor of saintly fame, Arshad-al-Din (? - 1364 or 65). Over the next three years, he sent military expeditions east and west in an attempt to bring the entire Tarim Basin under his control; however, his expansion plans were frustrated by Yaqub Beg.|$|R
40|$|The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (<b>Xinjiang)</b> is <b>located</b> {{near the}} western border of China. Xinjiang {{has a high}} {{frequency}} of dust storms, especially in late winter and early spring. Geostationary satellite remote sensing offers an ideal way to monitor the regional distribution and intensity of dust storms, which can impact the regional climate. In this study observations from the Indian National Satellite (INSAT) 3 D are used for dust storm detection in Xinjiang because of the frequent 30 -min observations with six bands. An analysis of the optical properties of dust and its quantitative relationship with dust storms in Xinjiang is presented for dust events in April 2014. The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) derived using six predefined aerosol types shows great potential to identify dust events. Cross validation between INSAT- 3 D retrieved AOD and MODIS AOD shows a high coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0. 92). Ground validation using AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) AOD also shows a good correlation with R 2 of 0. 77. We combined the apparent reflectance (top-of-atmospheric reflectance) of visible and shortwave infrared bands, brightness temperature of infrared bands and retrieved AOD into a new Enhanced Dust Index (EDI). EDI reveals not only dust extent but also the intensity. EDI performed very well in measuring the intensity of dust storms between 22 and 24 April 2014. A visual comparison between EDI and Feng Yun- 2 E (FY- 2 E) Infrared Difference Dust Index (IDDI) also shows {{a high level of}} similarity. A good linear correlation (R 2 of 0. 78) between EDI and visibility on the ground demonstrates good performance of EDI in estimating dust intensity. A simple threshold method was found to have a good performance in delineating the extent of the dust plumes but inadequate for providing information on dust plume intensity...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum can {{be grown}} on {{marginal}} and waste lands as a versatile feedstock for biofuel production in the vast areas of north-west China. Fifty-six sorghum accessions were grown in 2009 at the experimental station of <b>Xinjiang</b> Agricultural University, <b>located</b> at Urumchi, <b>Xinjiang,</b> China. A total of 31 agronomic, crop descriptors and chemical composition traits were investigated and analyzed. Among these accessions, significant variability was identified in grain yield (0. 2 - 11. 4 t/ha), stem weight (2. 1 - 21. 8 t/ha) and total biomass (13. 8 - 34. 4 t/ha) {{with an average of}} 6. 5, 8. 6 and 22. 6 t/ha, respectively. Significant differences in chemical composition (including soluble sugar, starch, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) of grain, leaf blade, leaf sheath and stem were identified. The stems of sweet sorghum contained a significantly higher amount of sugars and lower amounts of cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin than in other two sorghum types. Highly significant correlations were detected among the investigated traits. Cluster and principal component analyses classified these 56 accessions into two main groups. Accessions : X 041, X 125, and X 057 were identified as good parental materials for breeding high yield cultivars of grain, sweet and biomass sorghum, respectively. In order to reconfirm and identify useful breeding materials for this arid region, further experimental research needs to be conducted...|$|R
