30|$|Comparing the {{two kinds}} of wooden guardrail, the GHG {{emissions}} of <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 3 were less than those of <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 1, being 52  % for the painted case and 53  % for the pressure-injected case. The main reason for such a difference occurring between the wooden types is that <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 1 has steel beams along with the wooden beams, while <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 3 has wooden beams alone. The GHG emissions from the raw material procurement and production process for the steel beams used in <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 1 were 33.08  kg-CO 2 -eq/m, accounting for more than 50  % of the total GHG emissions of <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 1 (59  % for the painted case, 53  % for the pressure-injected case). This process is the predominant source of emissions.|$|R
40|$|Adults of {{alveolar}} Echinococcus {{species with}} different uterine structures {{were collected from}} Vulpes corsac in the Hulunbeier Pasture of Northeastern China in 2001. They were Echinococcus multilocularis Leuckart, 1863 (<b>type</b> <b>No.</b> 3, similar to E. in. multilocularis), with vaselike uterus; Echinococcus cf. sibiricensis Rausch et Schiller, 1954 (<b>type</b> <b>No.</b> 1), with pyriform uterus: and Echinococcus sp. (<b>type</b> <b>No.</b> 2) with spherical uterus at segment top. The metacestode development in rodents also differed among those 3 parasites. In the case of L multilocularis (<b>type</b> <b>No.</b> 3), many germinal cells grew on the inner surface of early cysts, most of which metastasized into host tissue to form brood vesicles or from the germinal cell layer on the inner surface of the vesicle wall. Cells also had an appearance of proliferating by means of alveolar buds from alveolar tissue that developed outward to form new alveolar foci. In Echinococcus cf. sibiricensis (<b>type</b> <b>No.</b> 1), the formation of alveolar vesicles {{was due to the}} metastasizing of germinal tissue into host tissue; protoscoleces grew in the center of alveolar vesicles. In <b>type</b> <b>No.</b> 2 (Echinococcus sp.), the formation of the alveolar vesicle was by multiplication of germinal cell layers on the inner surface of alveolar cysts; protoscoleces grew from the germinal cell layer and mesh in the vesicles. On the basis of uterine structure and on differences in development of metacestodes in experimental rodents, we propose that the 3 types of Echinococcus represent 3 independent species: E. multilocularis, Echinococcus sibiricensis, and Echinococcus sp.

30|$|Greenhouse gas (GHG: {{specifically}} CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O) emissions {{over the}} life cycles of <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 1 and no. 3 wooden guardrails widely used in Nagano Prefecture were evaluated. A comparison with steel (guardrail and guard pipe) types was conducted to investigate the GHG emission reduction effect of wooden guardrails. It was shown that the greatest GHG emissions {{for all types of}} guardrails occur during the raw material procurement and production process. The amount of total (life cycle) GHG emissions for pressure-injected wooden <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 3 guardrails (92  % of steel guardrails and 72  % of steel guard pipes) shows that replacing steel with this type of wooden guardrail can reduce GHG emissions. On the other hand, comparison of the GHG emissions for pressure-injected <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 1 guardrails with steel (175  % of guardrail; 138  % of guard pipe) shows that no reduction is achieved. When the disposed wooden beams (painted <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 1; painted and pressure-injected <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 3) are chipped and used for energy as a substitute for Type-A heavy oil, the volume of the GHG emission reduction significantly exceeds the GHG emission volume, and GHG emissions can be reduced by up to a maximum of 117.67  kg-CO 2 -eq/m.|$|R

As a result, a GHG emission reduction effect from substituting steel types with wooden types of up to 117.67  kg-CO 2 -eq/m can be obtained (replacing steel guard pipe with painted wooden <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 3). Whether or not the wood is used as an energy source in the disposal process, it has an extremely large effect on the overall life cycle GHG emissions.|$|R

30|$|Comparing {{the wooden}} {{guardrails}} with the steel guardrail and guard pipe, {{we found that}} the GHG emission reduction effect of replacing the steel items with wooden ones could be a maximum of 117.67  kg-CO 2 -eq/m when replacing steel guard pipe with painted wooden <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 3. However, there would not be any reduction if replacing steel guardrail with pressure-injected wooden <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 1. On the other hand, as explained in “Method of evaluating life cycle GHG emissions” in this study, the target for evaluation is the emission and reduction of GHGs originating from fossil fuel consumption, and the carbon reserve and CO 2 (other than CH 4 and N 2 O) emissions of the wood itself are not evaluated. Therefore, considering the CO 2 balance of the wood itself could change the GHG balance in wooden <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 1 and No. 3 guardrails, and the GHG emission reduction amount due from substitution of steel types. Examination of this possibility is a topic for future study.|$|R

The beams were made from Japanese cedar wood (including the pith) grown in Nagano Prefecture, machined into φ 180  mm round poles, and split in half. These are attached in two horizontal tiers to a 3.2 -mm-thick steel plate, beneath which a steel supporting pipe is provided. The wooden <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 3 has square supporting posts of steel reinforced concrete, with a 2  m span. The beams are Japanese larch wood (including the pith) grown in Nagano Prefecture, machined into φ 180  mm round poles, and arranged in two horizontal tiers. Twelve types of wooden guardrails, made from either Japanese cedar wood or Japanese larch wood, have been developed and installed in Japan [13]. They can be broadly classified into two types. In one type, the beam is made of wood and steel materials, and the supporting posts are made of steel materials (e.g., the wooden <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 1 in this study). In the second type, the beam is made only of wood and the supporting posts are made of steel reinforced concrete (e.g., the wooden <b>type</b> <b>no.</b> 3 in this study). Therefore, the two types evaluated in this study can be considered representative of all 12 types of wooden guardrails used in Japan.|$|R

Therefore, more recently newly installed or renewed guardrails are pressure injected with a preservative (ACQ) rather than a surface coating. As of April 2015, both surface-coated and pressure-injected cases are in existence. For wooden guardrails, we therefore investigated both the surface-coated case (hereafter “painted”) and the pressure-injected case (hereafter “pressure-injected”).|$|R
