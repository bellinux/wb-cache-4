5|$|NYU has 470,000 living alumni as of 2015. At least 37 Nobel Prize {{winners are}} {{affiliated}} with NYU. NYU {{is associated with}} a great number of important inventions and discoveries. For example, cardiac defibrillator and artificial cardiac pacemaker (Barouh Berkovits), closed-chest cardiac defibrillator (William B. Kouwenhoven), laser (Gordon Gould), atom bomb (Frederick Reines), polio vaccine (Albert Sabin), RFID (Mario Cardullo), telephone handset (Robert G. Brown), wireless microphone (Hung-Chang Lin), first digital image scanner (Russell A. Kirsch), television (Benjamin Adler), light beer (Joseph Owades), non-stick cookware (John Gilbert), black hole thermodynamics (Jacob Bekenstein), polymer science (Herman Francis Mark), microwave (Ernst Weber), X-ray crystallography (Paul Peter Ewald), barcode (Jerome Swartz), structure of the DNA (Francis Crick), tau lepton (Martin Lewis Perl), processes for creating food coloring, decaffeination and sugar substitute (Torunn Atteraas Garin), processes for the mass production of penicillin (Jasper H. Kane), <b>X-ray</b> <b>generator</b> and rotational radiation therapy (John G. Trump), nuclear reactor and hydrogen bomb (John Archibald Wheeler), and contact lenses (Norman Gaylord), among many others. Alumnus Fred Waller who invented Cinerama and the Waller Gunnery Trainer, also obtained the first patent for a water ski. The first patents for touch screen cash machine (Richard J. Orford), and zoom lens (Leonard Bergstein), were also obtained by NYU alumni. Some of the most prolific inventors in American history are NYU alumni, for example Jerome H. Lemelson whose 605 patents involved the cordless telephone, fax machine, videocassette recorder and camcorder, among others; Samuel Ruben whose inventions include electric battery; James Wood who invented cable-lift elevator, fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge and contributed to the development of lockmaking, submarine, electric generator, electric motor, transformer and the design of the refrigerator; and Albert Macovski whose innovations include the single-tube color camera and real-time phased array imaging for ultrasound. NYU is the birthplace of the tractor beam and 5G. Before and during World War II, NYU's Tandon School of Engineering worked on problems whose solution {{led to the development of}} radar, and later broke ground in electromagnetic theory, electronics in general, and solved re-entry problems of the manned space capsules, as well as helped develop and design the NASDAQ Automated Quote System and trading floors. Developer of the early telephone systems in the United States Bancroft Gherardi Jr., developer of the submarine communications facilities Jack M. Sipress, inventor of Italy's first computer Mario Tchou, designer of the Panama Canal locks Henry C. Goldmark, designer of the Pentagon Hugh John Casey, designer of the Apollo Lunar Module Thomas J. Kelly, as well as the designer of virtually every major bridge in New York City from the George Washington to the Verrazano, Leopold Just, are also NYU alumni.|$|E

25|$|X-rays: high-energy X-rays (produced by bremsstrahlung) allow {{irradiation}} {{of large}} packages and pallet loads of medical devices. They are sufficiently penetrating to treat multiple pallet loads of low-density packages with very good dose uniformity ratios. X-ray sterilization {{does not require}} chemical or radioactive material: high-energy X-rays are generated at high intensity by an <b>X-ray</b> <b>generator</b> that does not require shielding when not in use. X-rays are generated by bombarding a dense material (target) such as tantalum or tungsten with high-energy electrons in {{a process known as}} bremsstrahlung conversion. These systems are energy-inefficient, requiring much more electrical energy than other systems for the same result.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the most {{relevant}} developments in the realisation of portable Energy-Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) equipments are discussed. In particular, the latest advances in non-cryogenic (Peltier cooled) X-ray detectors and miniaturised <b>X-ray</b> <b>generators</b> are shown. The energy resolution of the new detection systems is adequate to resolve the characteristic X-ray emission lines of contiguous elements. This small size and low power make the system ideal for portable instrumentation and have stimulated the development of small- and low-power <b>X-ray</b> <b>generators</b> {{which can be used}} for the excitation of fluorescence radiation in a broad energy range (5 - 40 keV). Finally, the use of EDXRF related to archaeometric research (pigments in ancient paintings and major elements in the metal alloys) is emphasised. Recent results obtained with new HgI 2 and silicon PIN detector systems combined with miniaturised highly stable air-cooled <b>X-ray</b> <b>generators</b> are described...|$|R

The outer surfaces are defined by algorithms from the input parameters.

2500|$|Dental {{radiography}} uses a small {{radiation dose}} with high penetration to view teeth, which are relatively dense. [...] A dentist may examine a painful tooth and gum using X-ray equipment. The machines used are typically single-phase pulsating DC, {{the oldest and}} simplest sort. [...] Dental technicians or the dentist may run these machines; radiographers are not {{required by law to}} be present. An derivative technique from projectional radiography used in dental radiography is orthopantomography. This is a panoramic imaging technique of the upper and lower jaw using focal plane tomography, where the <b>X-ray</b> <b>generator</b> and X-ray detector are simultaneously moved so as to keep a consistent exposure of only the plane of interest during image acquisition.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} excite the atoms, {{a source of}} {{radiation}} is required, with sufficient energy to expel tightly held inner electrons. Conventional <b>X-ray</b> <b>generators</b> are most commonly used, because their output can readily be [...] "tuned" [...] for the application, and because higher power can be deployed relative to other techniques. However, gamma ray sources can be used {{without the need for}} an elaborate power supply, allowing an easier use in small portable instruments. When the energy source is a synchrotron or the X-rays are focused by an optic like a polycapillary, the X-ray beam can be very small and very intense. As a result, atomic information on the sub-micrometre scale can be obtained. <b>X-ray</b> <b>generators</b> in the range 20–60 kV are used, which allow excitation of a broad range of atoms. The continuous spectrum consists of [...] "bremsstrahlung" [...] radiation: radiation produced when high-energy electrons passing through the tube are progressively decelerated by the material of the tube anode (the [...] "target"). A typical tube output spectrum is shown in Figure 3.|$|R
