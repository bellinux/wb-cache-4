25|$|The {{time period}} for <b>X-chromosome</b> {{inactivation}} explains this disparity. Inactivation {{occurs in the}} epiblast during gastrulation, which {{gives rise to the}} embryo. Inactivation occurs on a cellular level, resulting in a mosaic expression, in which patches of cells have an inactive maternal <b>X-chromosome,</b> while other patches have an inactive paternal <b>X-chromosome.</b> For example, a female heterozygous for haemophilia (an X-linked disease) would have about half of her liver cells functioning properly, which is typically enough to ensure normal blood clotting. Chance could result in significantly more dysfunctional cells; however, such statistical extremes are unlikely. Genetic differences on the chromosome may also render one <b>X-chromosome</b> more likely to undergo inactivation. Also, if one <b>X-chromosome</b> has a mutation hindering its growth or rendering it non viable, cells which randomly inactivated that X will have a selective advantage over cells which randomly inactivated the normal allele. Thus, although inactivation is initially random, cells that inactivate a normal allele (leaving the mutated allele active) will eventually be overgrown and replaced by functionally normal cells in which nearly all have the same <b>X-chromosome</b> activated.|$|E
25|$|It is {{understood}} that <b>X-chromosome</b> inactivation is a random process, occurring {{at about the}} time of gastrulation in the epiblast (cells that will give rise to the embryo). The maternal and paternal X chromosomes have an equal probability of inactivation. This would suggest that women would be expected to suffer from X-linked disorders approximately 50% as often as men (because women have two X chromosomes, while men have only one); however, in actuality, the occurrence of these disorders in females is much lower than that. One explanation for this disparity is that over 25% of genes on the inactivated X chromosome remain expressed, thus providing women with added protection against defective genes coded by the <b>X-chromosome.</b> Some suggest that this disparity must be proof of preferential (non-random) inactivation. Preferential inactivation of the paternal <b>X-chromosome</b> occurs in both marsupials and in cell lineages that form the membranes surrounding the embryo, whereas in placental mammals either the maternally or the paternally derived <b>X-chromosome</b> may be inactivated in different cell lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{control of}} {{expression}} of specific genes by genomic imprinting {{is unique to}} therian mammals (placental mammals and marsupials) and flowering plants. Imprinting of whole chromosomes {{has been reported in}} mealybugs (Genus: Pseudococcus). and a fungus gnat (Sciara). It has also been established that <b>X-chromosome</b> inactivation occurs in an imprinted manner in the extra-embryonic tissues of mice and all tissues in marsupials, where it is always the paternal <b>X-chromosome</b> which is silenced.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} use of slot blot {{hybridization}} {{as a method of}} prenatal quantication of the number of <b>X-chromosomes</b> in chorionic villi samples. METHOD: DNA of chorionic villi from fetuses with karyotypes of 46,XY; 45,XO; 47,XXX; 69,XXX and 48,XXXX were extracted, slot blotted and hybridized to the following radioactive probes: β 0. 9, FVIII, pY 3. 4 and pBLUR. DNA of chorionic villi from five other fetuses with unknown karytypes were similarly blotted and hybridized. Autoradiography with pre-exposed films was carried out and the density of each of the hybridized bands was scanned by a laser densitomer. RESULTS: It was found that with increasing amounts of DNA in the samples, the intensity of the bands hybridized with FVIII and β 0. 9 probes increased proportionately. However, the intensity of the bands obtained with the probes pY 3. 4 and pBLUR (probes containing multiple repeat sequences) varied little with increasing DNA concentrations. The ratios of radioactivity obtained for the two probes FVIII/β 0. 9 were well correlated with the number of <b>X-chromosomes</b> in the samples. Calculations of the FVIII/β 0. 9 ratio for the five samples with the unknown karyotypes gave a correct prediction of the number of <b>X-chromosomes</b> in each case. CONCLUSION: Slot blot hybridization {{can be used as a}} method of prenatal quantitation of the number of <b>X-chromosomes</b> in chorionic villi samples.

25|$|In {{the fruit}} fly, Drosophila, one X {{chromosome}} {{in the male}} is almost the same as two X chromosomes in the female {{in terms of the}} gene product produced.

25|$|The {{differentiation}} of phenotype in heterozygous females is furthered {{by the presence}} of X-inactivation skewing. Typically, each <b>X-chromosome</b> is silenced in half of the cells, but this process is skewed when preferential inactivation of a chromosome occurs.

2500|$|In 1959 Susumu Ohno {{showed that}} the two <b>X-chromosomes</b> of mammals were different: [...] one {{appeared}} similar to the autosomes; the other was condensed and heterochromatic. [...] This finding suggested, independently to two groups of investigators, {{that one of the}} <b>X-chromosomes</b> underwent inactivation. [...] In 1961, Mary Lyon proposed the random inactivation of one female X chromosome to explain the mottled phenotype of female mice heterozygous for coat color genes. The Lyon hypothesis also accounted for the findings that one copy of the X chromosome in female cells was highly condensed, and that mice with only one copy of the X chromosome developed as infertile females. [...] This suggested to Ernest Beutler, studying heterozygous females for Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, that there were two red cell populations of erythrocytes in such heterozygotes: deficient cells and normal cells, depending on whether the inactivated X chromosome contains the normal or defective G6PD allele.|$|R

25|$|Symptomatic {{patients}} are almost exclusively male, {{due to the}} X-linked pattern of inheritance, but female carriers can be clinically affected due to unfavorable lyonization, where random inactivation of an <b>X-chromosome</b> in certain cells creates a population of G6PD-deficient red blood cells coexisting with unaffected red blood cells. A non-intersex female with one affected X chromosome will show the deficiency in approximately half of her red blood cells.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{the concept of}} an 'autism spectrum' was {{introduced}} by Lorna Wing and Gillberg. Gillberg has done extensive research into autism throughout his academic career. In 2003, a French and Swedish research team at the Institut Pasteur and the psychiatric departments at Gothenburg University and University of Paris, led by Thomas Bourgeron, Marion Leboyer and Gillberg, discovered the first precisely identified genetic mutations in individuals with autism. The team identified mutations altering two genes on the X chromosome which seem to be implicated in the formation of synapses (communication spaces between neurons), in two families where several members are affected. Previous studies, such as the Paris Autism Research International Sib-Pair Study (PARIS), coordinated by Gillberg and Marion Leboyer, have more generally associated the <b>X-chromosome</b> regions with autism. The 2003 breakthrough indicated the location of the mutation to be on the NLGN4 gene and the NGLN3 gene. The mutation prevents a complete protein from forming and is inherited from the mother.|$|E

25|$|This {{question}} has been studied in isolated populations where antimalarial drugs were not used in Tanzania, East Africa and in the Republic of the Gambia, West Africa, following children during the period when they are most susceptible to falciparum malaria. In both cases parasite counts were significantly lower in G6PD-deficient persons than in those with normal red cell enzymes. The association has also been studied in individuals, which is possible because the enzyme deficiency is sex-linked and female heterozygotes are mosaics due to lyonization, where random inactivation of an <b>X-chromosome</b> in certain cells creates a population of G6PD deficient red blood cells coexisting with normal red blood cells. Malaria parasites were significantly more often observed in normal red cells than in enzyme-deficient cells. An evolutionary genetic analysis of malarial selection of G6PD deficiency genes has been published by Tishkoff and Verelli. The enzyme deficiency is common in many countries that are, or were formerly, malarious, but not elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Though all of {{the above}} {{mentioned}} XSEs act to reduce xol-1 expression, experimentally reducing expression levels of these individual XSEs has been shown to have a minimal effect on sex determination and successful dosage compensation. This could be in part because these genes encode different proteins that act cooperatively rather than in an isolated fashion; for example, SEX-1 is a nuclear hormone receptor, while FOX-1 is an RNA-binding protein with properties capable of inducing post-transcriptional modifications in the xol-1 target. However, reducing the level of more than one XSE in different combinational permutations seems to have an additive effect on ensuring proper sex determination and resultant dosage compensation mechanics. This supports the hypothesis that these XSEs act together to achieve the desired sex determination and dosage compensation fate. Thus, in this model organism, the achieved level of <b>X-chromosome</b> expression is directly correlated to the activation of multiple XSEs that ultimately function to repress xol-1 expression in a developing worm embryo. A summary of this C. elegans mechanism of dosage compensation is illustrated below.|$|E
