Minkaohan Uyghur are educated in the Chinese language at Han Chinese schools and take their college entrance exams in Mandarin Chinese.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTo decrease ethnic instability in Xinjiang, the Chinese government’s {{plan is to}} economically develop the region. Xinjiang is rich in natural resources, is geographically significant and has a special economic zone. China is also investing in Central Asia to further meet its energy demand. A network of pipelines and major rail systems connect sources from China to Central Asia and beyond. Xinjiang’s economy {{will benefit from the}} network because it is the gateway and corridor to Central Asia and a hub for the Silk Road traffic. This study suggests that Xinjiang’s economic development led to a few destabilizing elements, including Han migration, income disparity and employment discrimination. All of this is taking place while the government is also dealing with other cultural issues, such as religion and education.

40|$|This paper, {{through the}} {{analysis}} of the state of bilingual education in <b>Xinjiang</b> <b>Uyghur</b> <b>Autonomous</b> Province of China, illuminates the specifics of bilingual education of ethnic minorities in present day China from the perspective of multilingual co-existence. With recent emphasis on multilingual and multicultural coexistence, in the multilingual and multicultural state of China the attainment of a “language harmony” or a harmonious linguistic relation between the Han language of the majority and the languages of the ethnic minorities has been planned. However, this “language harmony” has stopped at the level of academic harmonizing of Han and ethnic minorities` languages, or of constitutional or regional regulations regarding the use of ethnic languages and the freedom of linguistic choice, and the presence of a gap between principles and reality has surfaced. The present paper, in the first place, summarizes the definition, contents and function of what has been conducted under the name of “ethnic education”, and considers what “true ethnic education” constitutes. Then, after re-confirming the “linguistic rights” delineated in constitutional and regional regulations, and on the basis of concrete instances from Xinjiang, it makes clear that the bilingual education which was aimed at the leveling of ethnic and Han languages according to the original concept of “Min-Han Jian-Tong” has escalated to become a “New bilingual education” biased towards Han language education. At the end, it considers the future of bilingual education in present day China, and offers an inquiry into the role of education and language in identity formation. The illumination of the specifics of bilingual education in <b>Xinjiang</b> <b>Uyghur</b> is believed to contribute to a more subtle comprehension of the present state of ethnic education and minority languages education {{as well as to the}} future developments of ethnic education in modern Chinese society...|$|R
25|$|The Uyghurs {{are one of}} the 56 {{recognized}} {{ethnic groups}} in China, and Uyghur is an official language of <b>Xinjiang</b> <b>Uyghur</b> <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Region,</b> along with Standard Chinese. As a result, Uyghur can be heard in most social domains in Xinjiang, and also in schools, government and courts. Of the other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, those populous enough to have their own autonomous prefectures, such as the Kazakhs and the Kyrgyz, have access to schools and government services in their native language. Smaller minorities, however, do not have a choice and must attend Uyghur-medium schools. These include the Xibe, Tajiks, Daurs, and Russians. In some instances Uyghur parents decide to enroll their children at Mandarin schools over Uyghur schools because of the better quality education offered, leading to many Uyghur children having more trouble learning their native language over Mandarin. However, in 2017, Xinjiang's Hotan government have issued a directive completely banning the use of the Uyghur language at all education levels up to and including secondary school.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{continue}} nineteen years of observations on minority education in China with a focus in three remote areas-Xinjiang <b>Uyghur</b> <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Region</b> and Heilongjiang and Hainan Provinces. Instruction for the first three years of primary school in these areas is generally in the native ethnic tongue after which instruction is in Mandarin Chinese. The vast majority of primary schools in these areas are in rural settings where the quality of education is generally much poorer than in urban settings. A nine-year compulsory education is being strongly promoted. A national examination is administered to students wishing to attend postsecondary institutions is generally adjusted downward for minority students. Until the mid 1990 's students paid no tuition; now tuition accounts for 20 to 30 % of operating costs. In most of the tertiary institutions studied, a year of preparatory study is required of minority students, the emphasis being on Mandarin Chinese, which is the language of instruction beyond the preparatory year. There are numerous postsecondary opportunities in the Xinjiang and Heilongjiang but only baccalaureate degrees in Hainan. As of 1998, instead of the government assigning all students to positions, graduates now have the opportunity to seek out their own position. Research in postsecondary institutions is commensurate with the institution’s mission (e. g., preservation of minority language, agriculture, Chinese medicine).

40|$|SummaryBackgroundProgress in {{tuberculosis}} control in China {{has been the}} slowest in western areas, which have the highest prevalence. We assessed the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis in the Xinjiang province, China, 10 years after introduction of a control programme based on directly observed treatment, short course. MethodsIn this population-based, cross-sectional survey, we used a multistage stratified random cluster sample design to estimate the prevalence of smear-positive and bacteriologically confirmed (either smear positive or culture positive, or both) pulmonary tuberculosis among adults (aged ≥ 15 years) in Xinjiang who had been resident in their household for the last 6 months. The screening strategy and diagnosis followed WHO guidelines. We estimated prevalence by combining inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation of missing data. We compared our prevalence survey estimates with the ones from the 2010 China national pulmonary tuberculosis survey and the ones from a provincial pulmonary survey done in Xinjiang in 2000. The new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis notification rate in 2011 in Xinjiang was obtained to allow the calculation of patient diagnosis rate (PDR). FindingsBetween Sept 1, 2010, and July 31, 2011, 31   081 individuals were eligible, of whom 29   835 (96 · 0 %) participated in the survey. We identified 50 (0 · 2 %) smear-positive and 101 (0 · 3 %) bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis cases. The weighted prevalence of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis was 170 (95 % CI 103 – 233) per 100   000 people and of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis was 430 (249 – 611) per 100   000 people. Compared with 2000 Xinjiang survey estimates, the prevalence of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis has decreased by 26 · 4 % (from 231 [95 % CI 148 – 314] per 100   000 people), whereas the prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis has increased by 17 · 8 % (from 365 [237 – 493] per 100   000 people). In each age group and sex, the pulmonary tuberculosis prevalence was higher in the 2010 – 11 Xinjiang survey than in the 2010 national survey. The PDR in 2011 was 0 · 34 (95 % CI 0 · 25 – 0 · 44). InterpretationDespite progress {{in other parts of}} China, the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis in Xinjiang remains high. The very low PDR suggests poor access to diagnosis and care. Further studies are needed to understand the barriers to diagnosis and care of this population, and efforts are urgently needed to enhance tuberculosis screening in this area.
