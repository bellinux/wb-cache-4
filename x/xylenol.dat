2500|$|In aquatic sediments, {{a number}} of {{reactions}} can transform the chemicals released by the creosote preservatives into more dangerous chemicals. Most creosote preservative compounds have hazards associated with them before they are transformed. Cresol (m-, p-, and o-), phenol, guaiacol, and <b>xylenol</b> (1,3,4- and 1,3,5-) all are acute aquatic hazards prior to going through chemical reactions with the sediments. Alkylation reactions allows for the compounds to transition into more toxic compounds {{with the addition of}} R-groups to the major compounds found in creosote preservatives. Compounds formed through alkylation include: 3,4-dimethylphenol, 2,3-dimethylphenol, and 2,5-dimethylphenol, which are all listed as acute environmental hazards. [...] Biodegradation controls {{the rate at which the}} sediment holds the chemicals, and the amount of reactions that are able to take place. The biodegradation process can take place under many different conditions, and vary depending on the compounds that are released. Oxidation-reduction reactions allow for the compounds to be broken down into new forms of more toxic molecules. Studies have shown oxidation-reduction reactions of creosote preservative compounds included compounds that are listed as environmental hazards, such as p-benzoquinone in the oxidation of phenol. Not only are the initial compounds in creosote hazardous to the environment, but the byproducts of the chemical reactions are environmental hazardous as well.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 223 - 232. Alkylphenols are {{intermediates}} used in {{the synthesis}} of many important substances. The most signiﬁcant of the commercially important lower alkylphenols are cresols (methyl phenols) and <b>xylenols</b> (dimethyl phenols). The main markets for alkylphenol products are nonionic detergents, phenolic resins, polymer additives and agrochemicals. Of the western world cresol market, 55 % originates from synthetic cresols whereas 45 % originates from so-called “natural” cresols obtained from coal tars and reﬁnery caustics. The methylation of phenol is the only process speciﬁcally developed to produce cresols and <b>xylenols.</b> There are three cresol isomers, namely ortho, para and meta. It is possible to produce a high selectivity to o-cresol by alkylation of phenol with methanol over a basic or a Al 2 O 3 catalyst or a Fe/V catalyst. A mixture of the cresol isomers can be obtained over aluminium oxides with strong acid sites, silica alumina, zeolites, aluminium phosphates and phosphoric acid-Kieselguhr catalysts. However, direct synthesis of high purity m-cresol and p-cresol is desirable due to {{the high costs of}} separating these two isomers. Thus to synthesize p-cresol, a m-cresol free or very low m-cresol concentration in the product is desirable for puriﬁcation reasons and a high p/o-cresol ratio is also desirable in the product for yield reasons since separation of the p- and the o-cresols is economically possible...|$|R

As part of this programme, the heats of combustion of phenol and the three cresols (methylphenols) have been accurately determined and are here reported; the heats of combustion of the six <b>xylenols</b> (dimethylphenols) will be reported elsewhere. The combustion calorimetry of the phenols involves the difficulty that these compounds are somewhat hygroscopic and are prone to oxidation by air or oxygen.

40|$|Fixed-bed {{hydropyrolysis}} {{has been}} investigated by treating 100 g coal up to 900 °C and 10 MPa. The devolatilization rate of Beringen coal (32. 8 wt% volatile matter) treated on a fixed bed approximates to that obtained by flash hydropyrolysis. However, the oil yield is smaller because of the slower heating of the coal and the rather longer residence time of the primary volatile matter in the reaction space. The product gas is mainly methane. The oil composition depends on the temperature of pyrolysis. The benzene content of the oil rises with temperature. At constant temperature, the influence of hydrogen partial pressure is important between 0 - 1 MPa. At higher pressure, the yields and compositions vary only slightly with pressure. It {{has also been shown}} that from 580 °C pyrolysis under hydrogen yields an additional quantity of water, when compared with pyrolysis under inert atmospheres or under atmospheric pressure. This additional water comes from the hydrogenation reactions of the hydroxyl functions of heavy phenols and <b>xylenols.</b> This implies a hydrogen consumption (from 0. 2 - 0. 3 wt% of the coal), varying with the pyrolysis temperature. © 1981.
