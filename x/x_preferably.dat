40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device (and a corresponding method) for the interference structuring of a planar sample (P), comprising a laser (1), a focusing element (3, 3 a, 3 b), which is arranged in the beam {{path of the}} laser and by means of which the laser radiation can be focused in a first spatial direction (y), a first prism (4), in particular a biprism, which is arranged in the beam path of the laser and by means of which the laser radiation can be directed at a sample volume (5) in a second spatial direction (<b>x)</b> <b>preferably</b> perpendicular to the first spatial direction by means of two beams (2 a, 2 b), {{in such a way}} that the two beams interfere within the sample volume in an interference area (6), the sample volume, in which the planar sample is or can be placed in the interference area, and a moving unit (7), by means of which the beam(s); of the laser radiation can be moved in the first, the second, or the first and second spatial directions (x, y) and/or by means of which a/the sample can be moved in the sample volume in the first, the second, or the first and second spatial directions (x, y) ...|$|E
5000|$|For example, a bit-wise IEEE floating-point {{standard}} {{single precision}} (32-bit) NaN would be: s111 1111 1xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx where s is the sign (most often ignored in applications) and the x sequence represents a non-zero number (the value zero encodes infinities). Some bits from <b>x</b> (usually and <b>preferably</b> the first one) {{are used to}} determine the type of NaN: [...] "quiet NaN" [...] or [...] "signaling NaN". The remaining bits encode a payload (most often ignored in applications).|$|R
40|$|The {{neonatal}} Fc receptor, FcRn, {{is responsible}} for the long half-life of IgG molecules in vivo and is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. A family of peptides comprising the consensus motif GHFGGXY, where <b>X</b> is <b>preferably</b> a hydrophobic amino acid, was shown previously to inhibit the human IgG:human FcRn protein-protein interaction (Mezo, A. R., McDonnell, K. A., Tan Hehir, C. A., Low, S. C., Palombella, V. J., Stattel, J. M., Kamphaus, G. D., Fraley, C., Zhang, Y., Dumont, J. A., and Bitonti, A. J. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 105, 2337 – 2342). Herein, the x-ray crystal structure of a representative monomeric peptide in complex with human FcRn was solved to 2. 6 Å resolution. The structure shows that the peptide binds to human FcRn at the same general binding site as does the Fc domain of IgG. The data correlate well with structure-activity relationship data relating to how the peptide family binds to human FcRn. In addition, the x-ray crystal structure of a representative dimeric peptide in complex with human FcRn shows how the bivalent ligand can bridge two FcRn molecules, which may be relevant to the mechanism by which the dimeric peptides inhibit FcRn and increase IgG catabolism in vivo. Modeling of the peptide:FcRn structure as compared with available structural data on Fc and FcRn suggest that the His- 6 and Phe- 7 (peptide) partially mimic the interaction of His- 310 and Ile- 253 (Fc) in binding to FcRn, but using a different backbone topology...|$|R

Preparing an organic-inorganic hybrid material of formula M-O-P-R comprises heat treatment of an inorganic substrate at 20 - 300 [deg]C at an absolute gas pressure of 0. 01 Pa to 0. 2 MPa for 1 - 20 hours, contacting the pretreated substrate with an anhydrous organic solution to form a covalent bond between the organic-inorganic phases, filtering and washing the obtained solid and heat treatment of the obtained solid at 25 - 500 [deg]C under an absolute air pressure of 0. 01 Pa to 0. 2 MPa.
