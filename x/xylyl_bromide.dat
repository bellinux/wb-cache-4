However, instead of vaporizing, the chemical froze and failed to have the desired effect.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{extensive}} use of <b>xylyl</b> <b>bromide</b> was the firing by German forces of 18,000 [...] "T-shells" [...] at Russian positions in the Battle of Bolimów in January 1915. The shells were modified 15 cm (6 inch) artillery shells containing an explosive charge and c. 3 kg (7 lb) <b>xylyl</b> <b>bromide.</b> The attack was a complete failure because the winter weather was too cold to permit an effective aerosol, and the agent was either blown back towards the German lines, fell harmlessly to the ground, or was insufficiently concentrated to cause damage. A similar attack at Nieuwpoort in March 1915 was also unsuccessful. Nevertheless, because of its ease of manufacture <b>xylyl</b> <b>bromide</b> was widely used in World War I, in particular {{as a component of}} the Germans' Weisskreuz (white cross) mixture.|$|E
50|$|White Cross (Weisskreuz) is a World War I {{chemical}} warfare agent consisting {{of one or}} more lachrymatory agents: bromoacetone (BA), bromobenzyl cyanide (Camite), bromomethyl ethyl ketone (homomartonite, Bn-stoff), chloroacetone (Tonite, A-stoff), ethyl bromoacetate, and/or <b>xylyl</b> <b>bromide.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{failure of}} the <b>xylyl</b> <b>bromide</b> caused the German commanders to call off their attack. In response, the Russians sent 11 divisions, led by Vasily Gurko to launch a counterattack; German {{artillery}} repelled the Russian troops, who suffered 40,000 casualties.|$|E
50|$|Although {{conversion}} to terephthalic acid {{is the dominant}} chemical conversion, xylenes are precursors to other chemical compounds. For instance chlorination of both methyl groups gives the corresponding xylene dichlorides (bis(chloromethyl)benzenes) whilst mono-bromination yields <b>xylyl</b> <b>bromide,</b> a tear gas agent used in World War I.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xylyl</b> <b>bromide,</b> {{also known}} as methylbenzyl bromide or T-stoff, is any member or a mixture of organic {{chemical}} compounds with the molecular formula C6H4(CH3)(CH2Br). The mixture was formerly used as a tear gas. All members and the mixture are colourless liquids, although commercial or older samples appear yellowish.|$|E

50|$|The Battle of Bolimów was {{the first}} attempt by the Germans at a {{large-scale}} use of poison gas; the eighteen thousand gas shells they fired proved unsuccessful when the <b>xylyl</b> <b>bromide</b> - a type of tear gas - was blown back at their own lines. The gas caused few, if any, casualties, however, since the cold weather caused it to freeze, rendering it ineffective.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Xylyl</b> <b>bromide</b> is an {{irritant}} and lachrymatory agent. It {{has been}} incorporated in chemical weapons {{since the early}} months of World War I. Some commentators say the first use was in August 1914, when the French attacked German soldiers with tear gas grenades, but the agent used in that incident was more likely to be ethyl bromoacetate, which the French had tested before the war.|$|E
50|$|Use of {{tear gas}} in warfare (as with all other {{chemical}} weapons) is prohibited by various international treaties that most states have signed. Police and private self-defense use is not banned in the same manner. Armed forces can legally use tear gas for drills (practicing with gas masks) and for riot control. First used in 1914, <b>xylyl</b> <b>bromide</b> was a popular tearing agent since it was easily prepared.|$|E
50|$|The Germans on {{the other}} hand tried to {{increase}} the effect of 10.5 cm shrapnel shells by adding an irritant - dianisidine chlorosulfonate. Its use went unnoticed by the British when it was used against them at Neuve Chapelle in October 1914. Hans Tappen, a chemist in the Heavy Artillery Department of the War Ministry, suggested to his brother, the Chief of the Operations Branch at German General Headquarters, the use of the tear-gases benzyl bromide or <b>xylyl</b> <b>bromide.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tear gas, {{formally}} {{known as}} a lachrymator agent or lachrymator (from the Latin lacrima, meaning [...] "tear"), sometimes colloquially known as mace, is a chemical weapon that causes severe eye, respiratory, and skin irritation, pain, bleeding, and even blindness. In the eye, it stimulates the nerves of the lacrimal gland to produce tears. Common lachrymators include pepper spray (OC gas), CS gas, CR gas, CN gas (phenacyl chloride), nonivamide, bromoacetone, <b>xylyl</b> <b>bromide,</b> syn-propanethial-S-oxide (from onions), and Mace (a branded mixture).|$|E
50|$|Certain lachrymatory {{agents are}} often used by police to force compliance, most notably tear gas. In some {{countries}} (e.g., Finland, Australia, and the United States), another common substance is mace. The self-defense weapon form of mace is based on pepper spray, and comes in small spray cans, and versions including CS are manufactured for police use. <b>Xylyl</b> <b>bromide,</b> CN and CS are the oldest of these agents, and CS is the most widely used. CN has the most recorded toxicity.Tear gas exposure is a standard in Australia for military, police and prison officer training programs.|$|E
5000|$|One of Germany's {{earliest}} uses {{of chemical}} weapons occurred on October 27, 1914, when shells containing the irritant dianisidine chlorosulfonate were fired at British troops near Neuve-Chapelle, France. Germany used another irritant, <b>xylyl</b> <b>bromide,</b> in artillery shells that were fired in January 1915 at the Russians near Bolimów, in present-day Poland. [...] The first full-scale deployment of deadly chemical warfare agents during World War I was at the Second Battle of Ypres, on April 22, 1915, when the Germans attacked French, Canadian and Algerian troops with chlorine gas.|$|E
5000|$|During World War I in August 1914 France, not Germany as {{commonly}} believed, {{was actually}} {{the first to use}} chemical weapons though this was only a nonlethal tear gas attack (<b>xylyl</b> <b>bromide).</b> Once the war had slowed to trench warfare and new methods to attain an advantage were sought the German Army initiated a chlorine gas attack against the French Army at Ypres on 15 April 1915 opening a new type of warfare but failing that day to exploit the break in the French line. In time, the more potent phosgene replaced chlorine in use by armies on the western front including France leading to massive casualties {{on both sides of the}} conflict though later the effects were mitigated by development of protective clothing and masks.|$|E
