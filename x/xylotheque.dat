50|$|A <b>xylotheque</b> is {{something}} more than just collection of wood just as a library is more than merely a collection of books. Almost all rather developed countries with worries about their flora have at least one <b>xylotheque</b> with their flora and one with flora from other places in the world.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>xylotheque</b> (from the Greek xylon for [...] "wood" [...] and [...] "theque" [...] meaning [...] "repository") is a wood collection.|$|E
50|$|The <b>xylotheque</b> with a {{largest number}} of samples is the Samuel James Record Collection {{formerly}} housed at the Forestry School of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and {{was transferred to the}} U.S. Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory in 1969, which houses 60,000 samples. The second largest <b>xylotheque</b> belongs to the Royal Museum of Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium. As of September 2004, it had 57,165 samples. The Thünen Institute of Wood Research in Hamburg has more than 37,000 samples.|$|E
50|$|A <b>xylotheque</b> becomes really {{interesting}} {{and its use}} is essential as a study tool and a reference to investigations about identification, use and substitution of woods in real state and movable of our cultural patrimony, {{as well as in}} preservation and restoration.|$|E
50|$|Even {{a modest}} wood {{collection}} has value, as {{each of its}} samples is a compendium or monography that encloses a vast information. They are very important in museums, schools and universities for didactic and docent value. For example, there is a ludic <b>xylotheque</b> in the Arboretum de Pézanin,with more of 200 samples, whose weight the visitor is able to compare.|$|E
50|$|A <b>xylotheque</b> {{is useful}} to {{understand}} the scientific and economic value of the existing woods. At the same time, their samples are used to study the xylotomy, physical and mechanical wood properties, such as durability and preservation. The existence of xylotheques has also immediate applications for anyone who needs to make a morphological-visual analysis of wood. These include technicians, specialists and woodworkers, and also those involved in industry and commerce.|$|E
50|$|It {{may also}} be useful in {{forestry}} studies. Identifying the species {{of a piece of}} wood is not always easy, in which case a <b>xylotheque</b> may provide samples with which the xylotomist can compare his own. Xylotomy may be carried out by a forensic biologist. People who specialize in xylotomy are rare. The public have been known to confuse it with someone who plays the xylophone and they do not tend to take much interest in the subject.|$|E
50|$|Ferns, {{flowering}} plants, {{mushrooms and}} mosses-dried, pressed, stretched and packed in paper capsules. The {{core of the}} botanical collection consists of {{more than half a}} million well-preserved plants. Special collections of fruits and seeds as well as models of fruits and an extensive <b>xylotheque</b> (library of woods) complement the herbarium, which shows a comprehensive archive of Styrian flora and the base for research projects on local vegetation. Franz Unger did some of his early teaching and research in this department while he resided in Graz.|$|E
5000|$|The {{collections}} of botany represent numerically the greatest {{heritage of the}} Muséum d'Angers, {{with more than half}} of the total number of samples, all field together. The herbaria contain more than [...] samples, mainly dating from the nineteenth century. They are organized around three important collections : the general herbarium, that of Alexandre Boreau and that of James Lloyd, the three herbaria making up about 80% of the total samples. The general herbarium contains several type-specimens, including types of the island of Reunion, {{collections of}} Commerson (journey of Bougainville), La Billardière (expedition of Entrecasteaux), Poiteau (Santo Domingo) and even some rare samples from the seventeenth century). The Boreau herbarium contains probably more than [...] samples, material used for the writing of the flora of the center of France, the most famous regional flora of its time. The Lloyd herbarium (100,000 collections) contains [...] species, the basis of the flora of western France; it is accompanied by an imposing library. There are also herbaria of mosses (Bouvet, Bruneau), lichens (Decuillé, Thuillier), mushrooms (Gaillard, Guépin, Rabenhorst) and algae (Lloyd, Bory, Corillion). Specialized botany is preserved in Angers, where one of the most important bathology collections (herbaria of the genus Rubus) in Europe is housed. A seed library is made up of, on the one hand, pedagogical samples (about [...] French and 200 tropical species) and, on the other hand, a Vilmorin collection of early 20th century tree seeds, with additions from the National Museum and Roland Bonaparte (approximately 1,100 samples). The <b>xylotheque,</b> also made up of two parts, gwthers harvested trees from the Jardin des Plantes d'Angers and the Gaston-Allard Arboretum, as well as a collection of 69 samples of French Guyanese precious woods collected in 1802.|$|E

40|$|This brief {{review of}} the <b>xylotheque</b> as {{important}} reference collection aims to bring the true purpose and characteristics of these collections, its configuration and rigorous collection, recording, curation and preservation of specimens, {{as well as its}} importance cultural and scientific heritage of humanity. It has a bit of history and situation of xylotheques in the world and national scene and proposes a documented analysis of the benefits and relevance, which aims to encourage the creation of other collections and generate a change in their wrong conception and its forgotten and poor vision of these and the researchers associated with them. Analyzes its immediate and most urgent needs in Colombia, with an approach that aims to ensure and strengthen their support by related institutions, the joint development of specimens acquisition strategies closely with botanical and herbariums and conducting research to support the advancement of conservation policies of our forests, to enable identification of the species being transported and marketed, to help combat illegal logging and improve the use of this valuable material in the country...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Digitization {{of a part}} of CIRAD's' <b>xylotheque,</b> one of {{the most}} {{important}} collections of tropical timber in the world, now allows researchers, experts in the field, trainers and archaeologists to have a new source of homogenized information. This corpus constitutes a unique database on the botanical characteristics of many species of Madagascar and could feed the research in both ecological and systematic fields by the possibility to define traits and criteria usable for example in phylogeny or functional ecology. The island of Madagascar presents a remarkable floristic diversity, with a very high rate of endemism, making it a permanent laboratory for the study of the mechanisms governing evolution. The digitization project was conducted in close coordination with other projects currently underway involving the same partners. 995 species are concerned by the ArchiWood project: 3 planes of anatomical sections for each species, associated with a total of 100 field notebooks (architectural sketches) and 20, 000 slides. Contents This dataset is composed of digitized legacy documents, all related to Madagascar biodiversity: 	More than 2, 300 illustrations and notes taken from field notebooks 	More than 1, 200 anatomical cuts 	More than 70 photographs of plants and landscapes Methods Digitization of anatomical cuts For each species, there are 3 anatomical cuts associated with the 3 planes of symmetry of the material: radial, tangential and longitudinal. Each cut was scanned using an Olympus DP 71 digital camera fitted on an Olympus BX 60 microscope. The shooting software that drives the camera is Archimed from Microvision Instruments. The image format is 24 bits colored TIFF. Each image is 1600 x 1200 pixels for 3 different magnifications of the microscope: x 40 (overview of the cut), x 200 (main features anatomical from IAWA), x 400 (highlighting fine lines such as punctuations). Digitization of sketches (from field notebooks) The digitized information in the field notebooks is made up of architectural sketches (with descriptive notes). The slides include additional remarkable visual information of field sketches (flowers, fruits, overview, geographical implantation conditions…). The sketches were scanned using a resolution of 300 dpi, 24 bits colors in JPEG format. Digitization of photographs (24 x 36 mm) The photographs were scanned at 600 dpi, 24 bits colors in JPEG format. File management and data quality control Controlling images and adding metadata operations were carried out by the researchers concerned in their field of activity (anatomy, botany, architecture). The homogenization and final harmonization of the metadata and data was carried out by the data manager...|$|E
