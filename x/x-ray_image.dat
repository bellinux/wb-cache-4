40|$|Nowadays, various medical X-ray imaging {{methods such as}} digital radiography, {{computed}} tomography and fluoroscopy are used as important tools in diagnostic and operative processes especially in the computer and robotic assisted surgeries. The procedures of extracting information from these images require appropriate deblurring and denoising processes on the pre- and intra-operative images {{in order to obtain}} more accurate information. This issue becomes more considerable when the <b>X-ray</b> <b>images</b> are planned to be employed in the photogrammetric processes for 3 D reconstruction from multi-view <b>X-ray</b> <b>images</b> since, accurate data should be extracted from images for 3 D modelling and the quality of <b>X-ray</b> <b>images</b> affects directly on the results of the algorithms. For restoration of <b>X-ray</b> <b>images,</b> it is essential to consider the nature and characteristics of these kinds of <b>images.</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>images</b> exhibit severe quantum noise due to limited X-ray photons involved. The assumptions of Gaussian modelling are not appropriate for photon-limited <b>images</b> such as <b>X-ray</b> <b>images,</b> {{because of the nature of}} signal-dependant quantum noise. These images are generally modelled by Poisson distribution which is the most common model for low-intensity imaging. In this paper, existing methods are evaluated. For this purpose, after demonstrating the properties of medical <b>X-ray</b> <b>images,</b> the more efficient and recommended methods for restoration of <b>X-ray</b> <b>images</b> would be described and assessed. After explaining these approaches, they are implemented on samples from different kinds of <b>X-ray</b> <b>images.</b> By considering the results, it is concluded that using PURE-LET, provides more effective and efficient denoising than other examined methods in this research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel method to {{generate}} panoramic <b>X-ray</b> <b>images</b> intra-operatively {{by using the}} previously introduced camera augmented mobile C-arm by Navab et al.

This advanced mobile C-arm system acquires registered <b>X-ray</b> and optical <b>images</b> by construction, which facilitates the generation of panoramic <b>X-ray</b> <b>images</b> based on the motion estimation of the X-ray source. Visual marker tracking is employed to estimate the camera motion and this estimated motion is also applied to the X-ray source. Our proposed method is suitable and practical for intra-operative usage generating panoramic <b>X-ray</b> <b>images</b> without the requirement of a fronto-parallel setup and overlapping <b>X-ray</b> <b>images.</b> The {{results show that the}} panoramic <b>X-ray</b> <b>images</b> generated by our method are accurate enough (errors less than 1 %) for metric measurements and promise suitability for intra-operative clinical applications in trauma surgery. ...|$|R

However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an <b>X-ray</b> <b>image</b> intensifier and CCD video camera allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor.

They operate by converting photons of light into electrons, amplifying the electrons (usually with a microchannel plate), and then converting the amplified electrons back into photons for viewing. They are used in devices such as night vision goggles.|$|E

The two reclining figures—one {{at the front of}} the image, the other with the straw hat toward the rear—are revealed by the <b>X-ray</b> <b>image</b> to have been among the later concerns for Seurat. The reclining man at the front has had the position of his legs moved to a position more horizontal than that in which they were when first painted. The reclining figure toward the rear is not visible in the <b>X-ray</b> <b>image</b> at all, showing he is a late addition. His posture reflects the altered position of the man in the foreground, raising the suggestion that he was painted in as a compositional response to the alteration made to the man at the front.
