5|$|According to legend, the Christian apostle and martyr Saint Andrew, {{the patron}} saint of Scotland, was crucified on an <b>X-shaped</b> <b>cross.</b> Use of the {{familiar}} iconography of his martyrdom, showing the apostle bound to an <b>X-shaped</b> <b>cross,</b> first appears in the Kingdom of Scotland in 1180 during the reign of William I. It was again depicted on seals used during the late 13th century, including on one used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286.|$|E
5|$|The heraldic {{term for}} an <b>X-shaped</b> <b>cross</b> is a 'saltire', {{from the old}} French word saultoir or salteur (itself derived from the Latin saltatorium), a word for both a type of stile {{constructed}} from two cross pieces and a type of cross-shaped stirrup-cord. In heraldic language, it may be blazoned azure, a saltire argent. The tincture of the Saltire can appear as either silver (argent) or white, however the term azure does not refer to a particular shade of blue.|$|E
5|$|The legend {{surrounding}} Scotland's {{association with}} the Saint Andrew's Cross was related by Walter Bower and George Buchanan, who claimed that the flag originated in a 9th-century battle, where Óengus II led a combined force of Picts and Scots to victory over the Angles, led by Æthelstan. Supposedly, a miraculous white saltire appeared in the blue sky and Óengus' troops were roused to victory by the omen. Consisting of a blue background over which is placed a white representation of an <b>X-shaped</b> <b>cross,</b> the Saltire is one of Scotland's most recognisable symbols.|$|E
50|$|To the southwest, an <b>X-shaped</b> <b>crossing</b> (scissors crossing) links both tracks {{before the}} two tracks separate, the {{westbound}} track leading to Plärrer's -2 Level and the eastbound track leading to Plärrer's -3 level. Consequently, the signals at the southwest platform end can show the aspect Hp2 (Proceed at 40 km/h) in addition to Hp0, Hp1 and Hp5 which is used when a train crosses from one track to the other via the <b>X-shaped</b> <b>crossing.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{additional}} Spanish missionaries were sacrificed at Nojpetén. In February 1696 Franciscan friar Juan de San Buenaventura and an unspecified Franciscan companion {{were taken to}} Nojpetén during a skirmish between the Yucatec Spanish and the Itza on the west shore of Lake Petén Itzá. The Itza high priest AjKin Kan Ek' later related {{that he had the}} Franciscans bound in the form of crosses and then cut out their hearts. About a month later a Guatemalan Spanish expedition was ambushed and slaughtered; Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas were taken across to the island of Nojpetén and were similarly bound to <b>X-shaped</b> <b>crosses</b> before having their hearts cut out.|$|R
50|$|The {{day after}} M-Day, the Leper Queen {{attacked}} the Xavier Institute with the Sapien League. She was first seen attacking Mammomax, Erg, and Peepers who were racing to Xavier's mansion for sanctuary. The Sapien League tied them to <b>X-shaped</b> <b>crosses</b> {{and attempted to}} burn them to death. They were stopped by Wolverine and Colossus who had seen the smoke from their attacks. After this failure, she led {{an attack on the}} mansion itself. It was only by the combined efforts of the X-Men and the Sentinel Squad O*N*E that the Sapien League were stopped. During the fight, Iceman was captured. When the Leper Queen tried to execute him, his sudden regaining of his powers caused her arm to freeze, and she fled, encountering both Outlaw and Peepers as she escapes.|$|R
5|$|It was in {{this period}} that the {{national}} flag emerged as a common symbol. The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an <b>X-shaped</b> <b>cross,</b> {{first appeared in the}} Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of William I and was again depicted on seals used during the late 13th century; including on one particular example used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late 14th century; the Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on their person, both in front and behind, for the purpose of identification. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century.

5|$|The {{image of}} St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an <b>X-shaped</b> <b>cross,</b> first {{appeared}} in the Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of William I. Following the death of King Alexander III in 1286 an image of Andrew was used on the seal of the Guardians of Scotland who assumed control of the kingdom during the subsequent interregnum. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late 14th century; the Parliament of Scotland decreeing in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on the front and back of their tunics. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century. Since 1606 the saltire has also formed part of the design of the Union Flag. There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the thistle, the nation's floral emblem (celebrated in the song, The Thistle o' Scotland), the Declaration of Arbroath, incorporating a statement of political independence made on 6 April 1320, the textile pattern tartan that often signifies a particular Scottish clan and the royal Lion Rampant flag. Highlanders can thank James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, for the repeal in 1782 of the Act of 1747 prohibiting the wearing of tartans.|$|E
5|$|The {{adoption}} of Middle Scots by the aristocracy {{has been seen}} as building a shared sense of national solidarity and culture between rulers and ruled, although the fact that north of the Tay Gaelic still dominated may have helped widen the cultural divide between highlands and lowlands. The national literature of Scotland created in the late medieval period employed legend and history {{in the service of the}} crown and nationalism, helping to foster a sense of national identity, at least within its elite audience. The epic poetic history of the Brus and Wallace helped outline a narrative of united struggle against the English enemy. Arthurian literature differed from conventional versions of the legend by treating Arthur as a villain and Mordred, the son of the king of the Picts, as a hero. The origin myth of the Scots, systematised by John of Fordun (c. 1320-c. 1384), traced their beginnings from the Greek prince Gathelus and his Egyptian wife Scota, allowing them to argue superiority over the English, who claimed their descent from the Trojans, who had been defeated by the Greeks. The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an <b>X-shaped</b> <b>cross,</b> first appeared in the Scotland during the reign of William I and was again depicted on seals used during the late thirteenth century; including on one particular example used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late fourteenth century; the Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on their person, both in front and behind, for the purpose of identification. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the fifteenth century. The earliest reference to the Saint Andrew's Cross as a flag is to be found in the Vienna Book of Hours, circa 1503.|$|E
5|$|Once on {{the lake}} the Itza {{overturned}} some of the canoes and killed some of Díaz's men; others were wounded and dragged ashore to be killed. Díaz, the Dominicans and two other men were in a large canoe that was not overturned and were taken to Nojpetén where a fierce struggle ensued as Díaz attempted to defend himself with his sword, killing several Itzas. The two other men were immediately killed while the friars were beaten and tied to <b>X-shaped</b> <b>crosses</b> before having their hearts cut out. Across the lake, the Itza attacked the porters guarding the expedition supplies and killed all of them. The Itza killed a total of 87 expedition members, including 50 soldiers, two Dominicans and about 35 Maya helpers. The remains of the small group that were killed on Nojpetén were later retrieved by the Spanish {{after the fall of}} the city and were taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala for burial.|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the issue of barter trade in the North Western Siberia by the local peoples who used {{different}} fishing and hunting products such as fish and animal fur by way of cash equivalent up to the end of 19 th century. Particularly, squirrel fur was a most popular hunting product used as money equivalent in trade in the 19 th century. The author notes that due to the spread of the Russian population and development of railways {{in the second half of}} the 19 th century the situation gradually changed. As a result, by the beginning of the 20 th century natural barter was completely replaced by monetized trade with the use of bills and coins. The article describes a system of notes used by the local indigenous population to record the sums of money in trade, such as solar signs (hundreds), squares (tens), <b>x-shaped</b> <b>crosses</b> (units), vertical lines (hundredth parts of the main value). The article also indicates that during the Civil War and the transition to the NEP (New Economic Policy) an abrupt rise in prices for fishing products occurred, with the following revival of barter, when squirrel fur and fish regained their roles as cost units and universal money equivalents. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{international}} prototype metre and kilogram {{were both}} {{made from a}} 90%platinum, 10%iridium alloy which is exceptionally hard and which has good electrical and thermal conductivity properties. The prototype had a special <b>X-shaped</b> (Tresca) <b>cross</b> section to minimise the effects of torsional strain during length comparisons. and the prototype kilograms were cylindrical in shape. The London firm Johnson Matthey delivered 30 prototype metres and 40 prototype kilograms.

500|$|Architectural experts {{sometimes}} {{differ in}} their interpretations of Kahn's design. [...] Why, for example, are the cross beams at the clerestory windows above the atrium so massive? Carter Wiseman says, [...] "While they appear to be—and indeed are—structural, they are far deeper than necessary; their no-less-important role was to diffuse the sunlight {{coming in from the}} surrounding clerestory windows and reflect it down into the atrium." [...] Sarah Goldhagen thinks there is more to the story, asserting that [...] "the concrete <b>X-shaped</b> <b>cross</b> below the skylit ceiling at the Exeter Library is grossly exaggerated for dramatic effect." [...] Kathleen James-Chakraborty goes even further: [...] "Above, in the most sublime gesture of all, floats a concrete cross brace, illuminated by clerestory windows. [...] Its weight, which appears ready to come crashing down upon the onlooker, revives the sense of threat dissipated elsewhere by the reassuring familiarity of the brick skin and wood details." [...] Kahn similarly floated a massive concrete structure above the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which he designed a few years earlier.|$|E
40|$|The {{calcareous}} nannofossil genus Eiffellithus is {{an important}} taxon of mid- to Upper Cretaceous marine sediments in biostratigraphy and paleoceanography. The definition of species within Eiffellithus have been both broadly interpreted and variably applied by nannofossil workers. This is particularly true for the Eiffellithus eximius plexus. While the taxonomy of mid-Cretaceous Eiffellithus species has recently been well-defined, the remaining 35 m. y. history of the genus has not been closely examined. Our investigation of Cenomanian to Maastrichtian sediments from the Western Interior Seaway, Gulf of Mexico, and Western Atlantic gives rise to six new species of Eiffellithus that can be reliably differentiated. In this paper the hitherto used biostratigraphic markers (E. turriseiffelii and E. eximius) have been redefined in a more restricted sense to increase their utility. These refinements in taxonomy reveal an obvious shift in abundance both within the genus and within the nannofossil assemblage as a whole through the Late Cretaceous. In the Cenomanian and Maastrichtian the genus is composed exclusively of coccoliths bearing an <b>X-shaped</b> central <b>cross,</b> such as E. turriseiffelii, while in the Coniacian through Campanian axial-cross forms such as E. eximius comprise more than 60...|$|R
40|$|There {{has long}} been {{qualitative}} evidence that humans can pursue an object defined only by the motion of its parts. We explored this quantitatively using an occluded diamond stimulus. Four subjects (one naive) tracked a line-figure diamond moving along an elliptical path (0. 9 Hz) either clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) behind either an <b>X-shaped</b> aperture (<b>CROSS)</b> or two vertical rectangular apertures (BARS), which obscured the corners. Although the stimulus consisted of only four line segments (108 cd/square m) moving within a visible aperture (0. 2 cd/square m) behind a foreground (38 cd/square m), it is largely perceived as a coherently moving diamond. The inter-saccadic portions of eye-position traces were fit with sinusoids. All subjects tracked object motion with considerable temporal accuracy. The mean phase lag was 5 deg/ 6 deg (CROSS/BARS) and the mean relative phase between the horizontal and vertical components was + 95 deg/+ 92 deg (CW) and - 85 deg/- 75 deg (CCW), which is close to perfect. Furthermore, a chi-square analysis showed that 56 % of BARS trials were consistent with tracking the correct elliptical shape (p is less than 0. 05), although segment motion was purely vertical. These data disprove the main tenet of most models of pursuit: {{that it is a}} system that seeks to minimize retinal image motion through negative feedback. Rather, the main drive must be a visual signal which has already integrated spatiotemporal retinal information into an object-motion signal...|$|R
2500|$|The {{figures on}} the next two tiers turn {{slightly}} towards Christ's large icon in the central axis of the iconostasis. The third tier, above the Feasts is called the Apostles' tier. As this row has 12 paintings like the Feasts tier, it would be logical to suppose each icon displayed one of Jesus' disciples. But {{that is not the}} case here, in fact only eight of the twelve apostles appear on this tier. From the left, the first icon depicts apostle Thomas. The [...] "doubting" [...] disciple was originally a carpenter. He holds a spear in his right hand, symbolizing his martyrdom in India. Bartholomew is the next in the row. Originally he was a peasant, and according to the Christian legend, he died in Armenia, flayed alive and crucified, head downward. Bartholomew holds his own flayed skin in his hand as a symbol of his death. The next apostle is Andrew, Peter's brother. Legend says that he was crucified in Patras, Greece on a Crux decussata (<b>X-shaped</b> <b>cross),</b> now commonly known as a Saint Andrew's Cross. He is portrayed with this cross. Andrew is followed by Mark the Evangelist. He was painted with a quill in his right hand, and his own gospel in his left. Close to him is the icon of Matthew the Evangelist, who was painted in a rather similar way to Mark. Red and white shades dominate his garment too, and he also holds a quill and his gospel. The last icon on the left side of the Apostles tier, the closest to Jesus' central image, portrays Peter. He was the leader of the apostles, and though he died as a martyr in Rome, he is not associated with his martyrdom on the icon. He holds the Keys of Heaven in his hands.|$|E
