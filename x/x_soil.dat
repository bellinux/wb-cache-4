The research {{was carried out in}} Makawanpur district, central mid hill, Nepal for the early rice (Chaite season) cropping season 2000. Data on land and land use aspects and yield record were collected through interview and field observation. Data entry, coding and normalization procedure were followed by stepwise regression analysis. In step one, the general regression model for causes of actual yield variations was derived; it included some land and management parameters that satisfactorily explained the variability of actual yields (adjusted R 2 of 65 %). This model was used to calculate the adjusted yields by removing the impacts of non-fertilizer related variables from the actual yield data. In order to evaluate aspects of fertilizer use efficiency (step two), a stepwise regression produced a highly significant (adjusted R 2 of 45 %) result. The important factors defining FUE were the relationship between many parameters such as quantity of 1 st N topdressing <b>x</b> <b>soil</b> pH, basal N x FYM, 1 st N top dressing x good drainage condition, 2 nd N top dressing x insect attack during tillering-flowering stage, 2 nd N topdressing <b>x</b> <b>soil</b> pH, basal N <b>x</b> <b>soil</b> pH, FYM <b>x</b> <b>soil</b> pH, 1 st N topdressing x FYM and 2 nd N topdressing x zinc deficiency.

40|$|Since Ellison (1947) {{described}} {{the process of}} erosion as comprising a) the detachment of soil particles from the soil mass by raindrop impact, b) detachment by runoff, c) the transport of the detached particles by raindrop impact, and d) transport by runoff, research has been directed into the mechanics {{of each of these}} four phases and how the phases might be linked together {{in the form of a}} soil erosion model, such as the Meyer-Wischmeier (1969) model. From a literature review, it became evident that in spite of this work, gaps in knowledge still exist and that i) most studies on soil erosion tend to lump the processes together; ii) whilst a considerable amount of investigation has been carried out on splash erosion, the other processes have received very little attention; iii) there is no explicit study on the effects of factor-interactions on the processes and the role of the laboratory as a place for studying interactions by controlling factors has not attracted much attention; iv) equipment and techniques for the separate evaluation of the detachment and transport of soil particles by overland flow are not available; and v) studies on the hydraulic characteristics of overland flow in relation to the detachment and transport of soil particles in such flows are scarce. This study was therefore specifically aimed at establishing a sounder research base for modelling the subprocesses and ultimate~ for soil conservation design b,y: i) evaluating separate~ each of the above subprocesses; ii) assessing the influence of the factors affecting the processes, particular~ their interactioDS; and iii) examining the hydraulics of soil particle detachment and transport by overland flow with and without rain. As a means to achieve these objectives, a factorial experiment vas set up in the laboratory to examine both the individual effects of rainfall intensity (50, 80, 110, 140 mm h- 1), soil ~ (standard sand, ISIUld, clay loam and clay) and slope steep: 1. 8 Ss (3. 5, 7. 0, 10. 5 and 14. 0 per cent) and their interactions on each of the above subprocesses. Additionally, the effects of four rates of runoff (1. 0, 1. 6, 2. 2 and 2. 8 ~min) on the hydraulic characteristics of flow such as velocity, depth, Reyuolds number, Froude number and friction factor were examined and used in characterizing the detachment and transport of soil particles in these flows. For each subprocess, these variables were replicated four times. Splash detachment and transport were determined by simulating rainfall from a nozzle simulator over a target soil placed in a rectangular soil tray (10 x 20 x 4 cm) which being set in the centre of a catching tray (90 x 80 x 30 cm) allows for the separate determination of ups lope and downslope splash. The separate measurement of the detachment and transport of soil particles by overland flow with and without rain was carried out b,y using a specially designed rainfall simulator - bed flume facility with runoff and sediment input and measuring devices. The results were analysed by analysis of variance to show the Significance of soil type, rainfall in tensi ty, flow rate t slope steepness and their first and second order interactions in influencing the processes studied. Multiple correlation techniques were used to search for the best associations between the erosion influencing variables and soil loss. RegreSSion analySis was used for establishing predictive equations for detachment and transport rates. Detachment of the test soils by splash can be placed in rank order of standard sand, sand, clay and clay loam with increasing resistance. For splash transport the order is standard sand) clay > sand > clay loam. For each soil type there are significant increases in splash detachment and transport with increasing rain intensity and slope steepness. The most significant interactions influencing the two splash processes are soil x intensity and slope x intensity for detachment and transport respectivel,J. Significant interactions show that the factors are not independent of each other; the simple effects of a factor differ, and the magnitude of any simple effect varies according to the level of the other factors of the interaction term. The factors influencing detachment by flow without rain rank in ~ order of importance as soil type, slope steepness and discharge. The corresponding order for flow with rain is discharge, slope steepness and soil type. The order of soil detachability for both flow with and without rain is standard sand, sand ~ clay loam> clay. There are also significant increases in detachment rate as slope steepness and flow rate increase. It is further shown that the first and second order interactions of the above factors Significantly influence detachment by flow. On a relative basis, the second order interaction is small and the importance of the first order interactions can be placed in an increasing order of slope <b>x</b> <b>soil,</b> slope x discharge t and discharge <b>x</b> <b>soil</b> for flow without rain. For flow with rain, they rank as slope <b>x</b> <b>soil,</b> discharge <b>x</b> <b>soil,</b> and slope x discharge. The slope <b>x</b> <b>soil</b> interaction showed that as slope steepens the influence of each Boil on detachment rates increases with the proportionate increase being greater for sand and standard sand than for clay and clay loam. The slope x discharge interaction revealed significant increases in detachment rate for all slopes as discharge increased. The magnitude of the response is however greater at the lower than higher slopes. As slope steepness increases, detachment rates by flow with and without rain are also enhanced. The increase was proportionately more for the 1. 0 and 1. 6 J/min than 2. 2 and 2. 8 J/min flows. The Boil x discharge interactiC?n also indicated that, for flow without rain, detachability increases more for clay and clay loam than for the sand and standal'd sand as discharge increases. In the presence of rain however, the response of the soils did not differ much. Detachment by flow without rain is predominantly by rilling. In the presence of rain, detacbment rates by flow are increased about three fold and relatively even removal of soil particles from the eroding bed is characteristic. Raindrop impact thus appears to inhibit rill formation by overland flow especially on small slope steepnesses. There is a critical slope steepness at which both raindrop impact and overland flow contribute equally to total detachment. At slopes lower than the critical value, raindrop impact is the main detaching agent whilst flow predominates the detachment process at steeper slopes. The critical slope steepness is soil specific and decreases in the order of clay ~ clay loam) sand ~ standard sand. The transport of soil particles by combined flow and rain is significantly influenced by soil type, slope steepness, flow rate and their first and second order interactions. Transport rates decreased in the order of sand > standard sand) clay) clay loam. Increases in discharge and slope steepness significantly increased transport capacity. For a discharge range of 1. 0 - 2. 8 l/min, transport capacity increased four fold. The most significant interaction that influences transport capacity is slope <b>x</b> <b>soil.</b> Where factors interact significantly, interpretation of results based solely on the main effects of the influencing factors m& 1 result in loss of vital information and lead to wrong conclusions. For example, examination of the slope <b>x</b> <b>soil</b> interaction showed that at lower slopes (3. 5 and 7. 0 per cent) combined flow and rain has a greater transport capacity for the larger clay and clay loam aggregates than for the fine grains of sand and standard sand. This is obscured when effects are averaged over all the slopes as is the case when only main effects are considered...|$|E

More than 600 species including 54 endemics are distributed along a copper gradient (up to 10 000 mg kg- 1 available Cu) and the populations are isolated on more than 100 copper hills scattered in miombo forest. In order to improve restoration strategies of threatened species, we aimed to identify intraspecific copper tolerance of 4 endemic plant species from katangan copper outcrops: Crotalaria cobalticola, Diplolophium marthozianum, Gladiolus ledoctei and Triumfetta welwitschii. Seeds were collected in 3 different populations in the katangan Copperbelt and sown according three soil contamination modalities: control (no addition of Cu), 100 mg kg- 1 and 1000 mg kg- 1 of Cu concentration using hydrated copper (II) sulfate. For each combination (species <b>x</b> populations <b>x</b> <b>soils),</b> we had 10 repetitions. For each population, sample of 5 seeds was weighed before seedling in pot in November 2013.

Plant invaders, such as the hybrid cattail Typha x glauca, threaten wetlands, as they can cause shifts in ecosystem structure and function and modify biogeochemical cycles and nutrient availability. Cheboygan Marsh on the coast of Lake Huron is currently undergoing invasion by T. <b>x</b> glauca, and <b>soils</b> in T. <b>x</b> glauca-dominated areas of the marsh have greater soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations than in areas dominated by native vegetation. This study investigated whether T. x glauca is affecting the accumulation of carbon and nitrogen in Cheboygan Marsh soils. A pollen study revealed that T. x glauca became the dominant species in Cheboygan Marsh by the late 1950 s, and approximately two decades later, soil organic matter rose dramatically and reached current levels by the 1980 s. A field study to test whether increased nitrogen fixation was responsible for increases in soil nitrogen found significantly higher nitrogen fixation rates in T. <b>x</b> glauca <b>soils</b> than in native or newly-invaded soils. A controlled mesocosm experiment designed to test the effects of water level on nitrogen fixation rates were inconclusive, because soil carbon, which fuels microbial-mediated nitrogen fixation, remains relatively low in the mesocosms and may take several years to decades to accumulate to field levels...|$|R

Two experiments were carried out at UTFPR, Câmpus Dois Vizinhos, with hardwoods cuttings from Roxo de Valinhos fig tree. The first experiment used a randomized block design, in 3 x 3 x 2 factorial (substrate x environment x collection time), with four replications of 10 cuttings per plot. The cuttings were collected in the first fifteen days of July and August. The substrates were sand, soil and the mixture of these [1 : 1 (v / v) ]. The environments used were open sky, tunnel with plastic cover and tunnel with half-shade black net cover. The second experiment used a randomized block design, 2 x 2 x 3 factorial (shoot cutting position <b>x</b> <b>soil</b> cover x shoot cutting depth), with four replications of 12 cuttings per plot. In the factor position, the vertically (0 º inclination) and inclined (45 º inclination) shoot cuttings were evaluated. Soil cover was tested with mulching plastic cover or not. The tested depths were 1 / 3, 1 / 2 and 2 / 3 in relation to the total length of the shoot cutting. In both experiments, the following were analyzed: rooting and mortality indices, number of leaves and primary shoots, length of the three largest roots per cutting. It was conclude that, the protected environment with plastic cover on sand as substrate must recommended for the rooting of fig estaca, collecting them in the first half of July. The inclination position and cutting depth of the estaca and the substrate coverage with plastic mulching did not influence the results...|$|E
40|$|Ecologists {{have long}} {{classified}} Midwestern prairies based on compositional variation assumed to reflect local gradients in moisture availability. The best known classification {{is based on}} Curtis' continuum index (CI), calculated using the presence of indicator species thought centered on different portions of an underlying moisture gradient. Direct evidence {{of the extent to}} which CI reflects differences in moisture availability has been lacking, however. Many factors that increase moisture availability (e. g., soil depth, silt content) also increase nutrient supply and decrease soil mechanical impedance; the ecological effects of the last have rarely been considered in any ecosystem. Decreased soil mechanical impedance should increase the availability of soil moisture and nutrients by reducing the root costs of retrieving both. Here we assess the relative importance of soil moisture, nutrient supply, and mechanical impedance in determining prairie composition and structure. We used leaf δ 13 C of C 3 plants as a measure of growing-season moisture availability, cation exchange capacity (CEC) <b>x</b> <b>soil</b> depth as a measure of mineral nutrient availability, and penetrometer data as a measure of soil mechanical impedance. Community composition and structure were assessed in 17 remnant prairies in Wisconsin which vary little in annual precipitation. Ordination and regression analyses showed that δ 13 C increased with CI toward "drier" sites, and decreased with soil depth and % silt content. Variation in δ 13 C among remnants was 2. 0 ‰, comparable to that along continental gradients from ca. 500 - 1500 mm annual rainfall. As predicted, LAI and average leaf height increased significantly toward "wetter" sites. CI accounted for 54 % of compositional variance but δ 13 C accounted for only 6. 2 %, despite the strong relationships of δ 13 C to CI and CI to composition. Compositional variation reflects soil fertility and mechanical impedance more than moisture availability. This study is the first to quantify the effects of soil mechanical impedance on community ecology...|$|E

The purpose was to determine if some of the variability found in the growth performance of this species may be related to differential concentrations of required nutrients in the plant tissue. The ten provenances were grown in the two soils in three split plots. Two plots were unfertilized and the third was fertilized. Nutrient content of seed and plant tissue was obtained for the five elements. Exchangeable K, Ca and Mg and available P were determined for the two soils. The concentrations of nutrients in the seed of the ten provenances are similar except for calcium which was double in the basic provenances. This appears to be luxury consumption. No relationship was apparent between the concentrations of nutrients in the seed and the produced tissue. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences in concentrations of nutrients in the tissue between the soils (P, K, Ca and Mg) and with fertilization (P and K). The interaction of tree type <b>X</b> <b>soil</b> was highly significant for K. The well known K Ca and K - Mg interactions are prominent. However, the basic provenances contain more K when grown on the basic soil than did the acid provenances. These same basic provenances contain less K on the acid soil than did the acid provenances. It appears that the basic provenance possesses an inherited ability to obtain required quantities of this element in the face of possible adverse quantities of Ca and Mg. Ca, Mg and P concentrations in the tissue appear to reflect the supply available in the soil. Growth of the ten provenances was generally poor on the basic soil. Further study with a range of soils is required to confirm if the apparent variation between acid and basic soil origin provenances was of genetic or soil origin...|$|E

The distribution of manganese in different fractions was evaluated. A completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement 3 x 6 <b>x</b> 3 (<b>soil</b> <b>x</b> rate x Mn source) was used. The soils were classified as Typic Quartzipsamment (soil 1), clayey Typic Haplustox (soil 2) and sandy clay loam Typic Haplustox (soil 3). Mn rates were 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 e 60 mg kg- 1 using single superphosphate + Mn (micronutrient incorporated in ordinary superphosphate granulation), Fritted Mn and manganese sulphate. The available Mn was determined with Mehlich- 1 (M- 1) and DTPA. The extractants used to evaluate Mn solubility in fertilizers were: water, 20 g L- 1 citric acid and neutral ammonium citrate solutions. The agronomic effectiveness of the manganese sources was calculated using manganese sulphate as reference. Using sequential extraction, the soil Mn was partitioned into exchangeable, organic, amorphous Fe and Al oxides, crystalline Fe and Al oxides and residual forms. Mn fertilization increased Mn content in soybean shoot, regardless to soil and source considered. Dry matter yield depended of Mn initial in soils. In soils 1 and 2, which had low Mn content, occured an increase in soybean dry matter yield. The DTPA and M- 1 extractants were efficient to evaluate the Mn availability to soybean.

The determination of the most probable number of denitrifying bacteria was carried out by the multiple tube technique using Allen’s culture medium, in anaerobic conditions. The test was performed on samples of fertilized and unfertilized soils collected from different depths (i. e. 7 - 10 cm and 15 - 25 cm). The denitrification process was found to manifest in all the soil types, with variations depending on the soil sample, fertilizers, type of tillage operations, and the period during which the microbiological determinations were performed.

40|$|RONO: 2470 3013 Sustainability in UK {{dairy farming}} {{is no longer}} secured by {{traditional}} management focused on production of commodities. Society awareness, legislations and competing markets demand farming systems which can deliver multiple attributes such as: clean environment, high biodiversity, picturesque landscapes, good animal welfare and high quality of product and soil. Changes in management and introduction of new animal and plant varieties {{are likely to be}} the key elements to improve the sustainability of dairy farming systems. Although the effect of farm management on some attributes of sustainability (e. g. effect of fertiliser rates and timing on environmental losses) has already been studied, the impacts and scope for realising goals of agricultural multifunctionality through genetic changes in either plants or animals are still to be tested. Moreover, {{there is a need to}} develop approaches that can integrate these concepts to practical actions and decisions. SIMSDAIRY is a new farm level modelling framework which brings all of this complexity into an operational and scientific modus operandi. This paper provides a brief description of the SIMSDAIRYs structure and an example of how SIMSDAIRY can be used to compare the scope to improve the overall sustainability of a dairy farm by: (i) future system changes aimed at improving genetic characteristics of plant and animal with (ii) current system structural changes aimed at improving nutrient management efficiency. In order to do this comparison management factors and new genetic traits from plants or/and animals, acting singly, or in combination, are evaluated against a baseline dairy farm scenario. Sustainability is measured in terms of targets associated to: (i) Nitrates Directive, (ii) P threshold for eutrophication, (iii) Kyoto Protocol (iv) Gothenburg Protocol, (v) an adequate net farm income for standard living and acceptable standards of (vi) quality of milk, (vii) animal welfare, (viii) level of biodiversity, (ix) landscape aesthetics and (<b>x)</b> <b>soil</b> quality. Results suggest that genetic-based changes offer greater scope than management-based ones to improve sustainability up to an acceptable level. Costs associated to management changes are often too high within current socio-economics circumstances. Optimising N mineral fertiliser rate and timing was the only management-based measure that, while improving most of the environmental and biodiversity indices, resulted in improved economic results. Some genetic-based changes offered substantial scope for improving environmental losses while having economic benefits. However, only those decreasing the CP of the plant and increasing the diet N cow partition into milk seemed to both not result in significant pollution swapping and be achievable in the nearby future.

40|$|Mozambique is a {{semi-arid}} area with unreliable rainfall distribution; therefore optimal planting dates {{are critical to}} ensure that maize is not stressed during critical stages. The objective {{of this research was}} to study the effect of sowing date and cultivar on maize (Zea mays L.) yields in Mozambique. A further objective was to establish whether the SWB model could be utilized to help select the optimum planting window for different maize cultivars and localities. An experiment was conducted during the 2007 / 08 season at the Chókwè Agricultural Research Station, Mozambique, in which a short (or early cultivar, Changalane) and long (or late) season maize cultivar (Tsangano) were sown on three different dates: 5 December 2007 (PD 1), 25 December 2007 (PD 2) and 15 January 2008 (PD 3). Sowing date had a significant effect (p< 0. 05) on yield and yield components. The 25 December planting (PD 2) out yielded (4. 3 t ha- 1) the 5 December (PD 1) (2. 5 t ha- 1,) and 15 January (PD 3) (1. 5 t ha- 1) plantings for cv. Changalane. However, for cv. Tsangano, PD 1 (3. 2 t ha- 1) out yielded PD 2 (2. 3 t ha- 1) and PD 3 (0. 7 t ha- 1). Cultivars varied significantly in yield potential. The most responsive cultivar to water supply was Changalane, which when planted late in December (PD 2), gave a water productivity (WP) of 17 kg ha- 1 mm- 1, while Tsangano, the late cultivar, performed better when planted early in December (PD 1), with a WP of 8. 5 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 The Soil Water Balance (SWB) model was calibrated on the data from one planting date per cultivar and successfully validated on independent data sets from the other two planting dates. Long-term historical weather data sets were obtained for Chókwè and Umbeluzi, two important dry land maize production areas in Mozambique. The calibrated SWB model was used to simulate maize yields for different planting dates to establish the best planting date for different cultivar x plant date <b>x</b> <b>soil</b> combinations. Simulation results for the two cultivars across three planting dates showed that the simulated grain yields per planting date varied substantially from year to year and between the two sites. The SWB scenario simulation results showed that for both Umbeluzii and Chókwè sites, in four out of five years, best yields can be achieved by planting Changalane late in December and Tsangano early in December. It can be concluded that the SWB model can be a very useful tool to help select the most suitable maize cultivars and planting dates for different localities, based on differences in plant water availability during the growing season.
