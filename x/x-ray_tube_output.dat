40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) is {{a powerful}} analysis method that allows researchers to noninvasively probe the crystalline structure of a material. This includes the ability to determine the crystalline phases present, quantify surface residual stresses, and measure the distribution of crystallographic orientations. The Structures and Materials Division at the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) heavily uses the on-site XRD lab to characterize advanced metal alloys, ceramics, and polymers. One of the x-ray diffractometers in the XRD lab (Bruker D 8 Discover) uses three different <b>x-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> (Cu, Cr, and Mn) for optimal performance over numerous material types and various experimental techniques. This requires that the tubes be switched out and aligned between experiments. This alignment maximizes the <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> s <b>output</b> through an iterative process involving four set screws. However, the <b>output</b> of the <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> cannot be monitored during the adjustment process due to standard radiation safety engineering controls that prevent exposure to the x-ray beam when the diffractometer doors are open. Therefore, the adjustment process is a very tedious series of blind adjustments, each followed by measurement of the output beam using a PIN diode after the enclosure doors are shut. This process {{can take up to}} 4 hr to perform. This technical memorandum documents an in-house project to motorize this alignment process. Unlike a human, motors are not harmed by x-ray radiation of the energy range used in this instrument. Therefore, using motors to adjust the set screws will allow the researcher to monitor the <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> s <b>output</b> while making interactive adjustments from outside the diffractometer. The motorized alignment system consists of four motors, a motor controller, and a hand-held user interface module. Our goal was to reduce the alignment time to less than 30 min.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{fabricate}} organic photovoltaic (OPV) {{cells with}} nanometric active layers sensitive to ionizing radiation and measure their dosimetric characteristics in clinical x-ray beams in the diagnostic tube potential range of 60 - 150 kVp. METHODS: Experiments {{were designed to}} optimize the detector 2 ̆ 7 s x-ray response and find the best parameter combination by changing the active layer thickness and {{the area of the}} electrode. The OPV cell consisted of poly (3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl) : [6, 6]-phenyl C 61 butyric acid methyl ester photoactive donor and acceptor semiconducting organic materials sandwiched between an aluminum electrode as an anode and an indium tin oxide electrode as a cathode. The authors measured the radiation-induced electric current at zero bias voltage in all fabricated OPV cells. RESULTS: The net OPV current as a function of beam potential (kVp) was proportional to kVp(- 0. 5) when normalized to <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>output,</b> which varies with kVp. Of the tested configurations, the best combination of parameters was 270 nm active layer thicknesses with 0. 7 cm(2) electrode area, which provided the highest signal per electrode area.

40|$|Abstract. Neonates on a Special Care Baby Unit {{often require}} {{radiography}} {{to monitor the}} progress of their treatment {{and as a result}} can have a large number of radiographs taken during their stay in hospital. The skin entrance dose was estimated from a knowledge of the technique factors, <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> and backscatter factors. Normalized organ dose data were employed to estimate the radiation dose to a number of critical organs. A number of methods of reducing the radiation dose to neonates were investigated. Initially, this involved changing the radiographic technique factors and introducing a lead rubber adjustable collimator, placed on top of the incubator, in addition to the light beam diaphragms on the X-ray tube. It was deduced from the results of calculations that these modifications to the radiographic examination technique had reduced the average entrance dose per radiograph from 92 /zGy to 58 /xGy, a reduction of 37 %. Later, a rare-earth film-screen combination was introduced to replace the existing fast calcium tungstate screens. This enabled the average entrance dose per radiograph to be reduced to 39 /zGy, a further reduction of 33 %. The mean radiation dose to a neonate is mainly determined by the number of radiographs taken and this is dependent on the clinical symptoms. Radiology {{is one of the main}} methods of assessing the progress of treatment of neonates on a Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU). Consequently, very ill neonates may have a large number of radiographic examinations durin...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Radiation doses {{have been}} {{monitored}} {{for a long}} time, as we are aware that radiation can produce biological effects. However, there is {{a limited amount of}} information available on patient dose from cervical spine examinations. In addition, the techniques used are variable between radiographic departments and even radiographers within one department. The difference in technique of particular concern is the use of radiographic grids. While it reduces scatter and improve image quality, the use of a grid demands increased exposure factors and dose to obtain the same optical density on the film. Method: This study investigated the range of doses for lateral cervical spine examinations in the Hunter and Sydney metropolitan regions of New South Wales, Australia. Radiation doses were calculated from <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> measurements and patient exposure parameters. Results: Differences in dose for 116 patients (53 non-grid, 63 grid) examined on 13 X-ray units were analysed. The study calculated the mean entrance surface dose for the non-grid system (228 μGy) to be significantly lower at the 95 % significance level than the mean entrance surface dose for the grid techniques (505 μGy). However, the use of a grid for computed radiography systems did not produce any differences in dose with the use or non-use of a grid, while there was a three-fold increase for film-screen systems. Conclusion: The increased level of dose and the inherent air-gap nature of the lateral cervical spine examination raises severe doubt on the use of anti-scatter grids and the recommendation is that they should not be used...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Simulating low-dose Computed Tomography (CT) {{facilitates}} in-silico studies {{into the}} required dose for a diagnostic task. Conventionally, low-dose CT images {{are created by}} adding noise to the projection data. However, in practice the raw data is often simply not available. This paper presents a new method for simulating patient-specific, low-dose CT images without the need of the original projection data. Methods: The low-dose CT simulation method included the following: (1) computation of a virtual sino-gram from a high dose CT image through a radon transform; (2) simulation of a 'reduced'-dose sinogram with appropriate amounts of noise; (3) subtraction of the high-dose virtual sinogram from the reduced-dose sinogram; (4) reconstruction of a noise volume via filtered back-projection; (5) addition of the noise image to the original high-dose image. The required scanner-specific parameters, such as the apodization window, bowtie filter, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> parameter (reflecting the photon flux) and the detector read-out noise, were retrieved from calibration images of a water cylinder. The low-dose simulation method was evaluated by comparing the noise characteristics in simulated images with experimentally acquired data. Results: The models used to recover the scanner-specific parameters fitted accurately to the calibration data, and {{the values of the}} parameters were comparable to values reported in literature. Finally, the simulated low-dose images accurately reproduced the noise characteristics in experimentally acquired low-dose-volumes. Conclusion: The developed methods truthfully simulate low-dose CT imaging for a specific scanner and reconstruction using filtered backprojection. The scanner-specific parameters can be estimated from calibration data. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medic...|$|E

In a subset of 15 (seven stable, eight unstable) patients, the detection and classification of coronary plaques by MSCT was verified by intracoronary ultrasound (ICUS). Sensitivity and specificity of MSCT compared with ICUS to detect significant plaques (defined as a parts per thousand yen 1 -mm plaque thickness on ICUS) was 83 % and 87 %.

40|$|Image {{quality in}} medical x-ray imaging is {{dependent}} on the characteristics of the x-ray photons produced  by  the  x-ray  tube,  the  detection  of  the  x-ray  photons  in  the  detector  and  the  image processing. X-ray image guidance during endovascular interventions is usually performed with C-arm fluoroscopy. It is of major importance that the image quality is sufficient for the procedure. The understanding of what affects the image quality could be made easier if the performance of the different parts of the system were to be judged separately, rather than considering the system as a whole.   The term Image QualityTube Output that is used throughout this thesis describes the image quality that only depends on the characteristics of the x-ray beam, such as spectral distribution and fluence, without the consideration of detector characteristics or image processing. The aim of this thesis was to  propose  a  method  to  evaluate  the  Image  QualityTube  Output  and  then  compare  two  different fluoroscopy systems used for endovascular interventions with respect to Image QualityTube  Output, patient dose and personnel exposure, all as a function of patient thickness.   To limit to the <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> a third x-ray system was used.

A test object was introduced and exposed together with the PMMA of varying thickness, using the parameters set by the ADRC.

40|$|PURPOSE: The authors {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} effect of direct energy conversion of x-rays via selfpowered Auger- and photocurrent, potentially suitable to practical radiation detection and dosimetry in medical applications. Experimental results are compared to computational predictions. The detector the authors consider is a thin-film multilayer device, composed of alternating disparate electrically conductive and insulating layers. This paper focuses on the experiments while a companion paper introduces the fundamental concepts of high-energy current (HEC) detectors. METHODS: The energy of ionizing radiation is directly converted to detector signal via electric current induced by high-energy secondary electrons generated in the detector material by the incident primary radiation. The HEC electrons also ionize the dielectric and the resultant charge carriers are selfcollected due to the contact potential of the disparate electrodes. Thus, an electric current is induced in the conductors in two different ways {{without the need for}} externally applied bias voltage or amplification. Thus, generated signal in turn is digitized by a data acquisition system. To determine the fundamental properties of the HEC detector and to demonstrate its feasibility for medical applications, the authors used a planar geometry composed of multilayer microstructures. Various detectors with up to seven conducting layers with different combinations of materials (250 mum Al, 35 mum Cu, 100 mum Pb) and air gaps (100 mum) were exposed to nearly plane-parallel 60 - 120 kVp x-ray beams. For the experimental design and verification, the authors performed coupled electron-photon radiation transport computations. The detector signal was measured using a commercial data acquisition system with 24 bits dynamic range, 0. 4 fC sensitivity, and 0. 9 ms sampling time. RESULTS: Measured signals for the prototype detector varied depending on the number of layers, material type, and incident photon energy, and it was in the range of 30 - 150 nA/cm(2) for unit air kerma (1 Gy), which is viable for practical applications. The experiments had an excellent agreement with the computations. Within the examined range of 60 - 120 kVp, the energy dependence of the HEC (normalized to the <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>output)</b> was relatively small. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the experimental results for 100 ms sampling time, {{it would be possible to}} measure the time dependence of x-ray beams for x-ray tube current of 0. 1 mA or higher. Significant advantages of the HEC device are that generation of its signal does not require external power supply, it can be made in any size and shape, including flexible curvilinear forms, and it is inexpensive. It remains to be determined, which of the potential applications in medical dosimetry (both in vivo and external), or radiation protection would benefit from such selfpowered detectors...|$|E

These tests were essential, since high temperature gradients tend to develop in an <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> during operation, which the metal-to-cerarnic seals of the tube must be capable of withstanding if damage to the device is to be avoided. The set-up of the XRF spectrometer in which the completed <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> was tested is discussed, in which the X-ray current and voltage measuring techniques are described. Furthermore a detailed account of the operation of the X-ray detector system and the multichannel analyser is given, which was used to detect and record spectra of the sample elements excited by the primary radiation of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube.</b> Finally the measured <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> performance characteristics are discussed and compared to the predicted results...|$|R

The miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube,</b> even with a small gate leakage current, exhibits an induced voltage on the gate electrode by the anode bias voltage, resulting in a very unstable operation and finally a failure. The induced gate voltage is apparently caused by charging at the insulating spacer of the miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> through the gate leakage current of the field emission.

40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{in the ability to}} construct and manipulate nanoscale particles have opened up the possibility of using solid metallic nanoparticles and mixed metal nanoshells as a means to increase dose enhancement and treatment efficacy to tumors. In order for nanoparticles to be an effective form of treatment, they must be delivered to tumors in sufficient concentrations so that there is a dose enhancement factor due to ionizing radiation, as well as being essentially non-toxic to healthy cells. Gold nanoparticles and silica-gold nanoshells fit these requirements. Gold has a high atomic number (Z= 79), which gives a larger cross section for the photoelectric effect vs. tissue with regards to kilovoltage x-rays. Both gold and silica are also relatively inert and biocompatible. The investigation of dose enhancement to cells that have been incubated with nanoparticles and nanoshells is the focus of this thesis. The effectiveness of the treatment was determined by measuring the size of multicellular hybrid spheroids consisting of human glioma cells and murine lymphocytic monocytes. Dose enhancement effects was also examined in murine lymphocytic monocytes using an MTS assay, which measures metabolic activity in cells. A clear dose response was observed for spheroids consisting of human glioma cells only: increasing doses resulted in decreased spheroid growth. With a few exceptions, this trend was also observed in hybrid spheroids consisting of glioma cells and nanoparticle or nanoshell loaded monocytes. Contrary to the premise of utilizing the photoelectric effect, the most pronounced dose effect was observed in the pure glioma irradiated spheroids which showed greater growth suppression compared to the nanoparticle and nanoshell loaded hybrid spheroids at each dose investigated. A similar trend was found when comparing the viability of bare and nanoparticle/nanoshell loaded monocytes exposed to kilovoltage x-rays. These results are considered anomalous since kilovoltage x-rays are expected to be more damaging to cells and spheroids containing nanoparticles/nanoshells due to enhanced photoelectric absorption. The anomalous results were attributed to inaccuracies in <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>output.</b> Optimization of MTS parameters required for accurate determination of monocyte viability represents the most significant finding of this work. It was found that 50, 000 cells per well yielded an accurate MTS signal. Furthermore, the MTS assay should not be performed less than 96 hours from the time of irradiation. As long as this 96 hour criterion is satisfied, any of the investigated MTS incubation times (1 – 4 hours) can be used. Finally, at the concentrations used in these studies, neither nanoparticles nor nanoshells were toxic to murine lymphocytes...|$|E

H 577 P HTI 2015 Chanxliii, 378 pages :illustrations (some color); 30 cmRadiation {{safety to}} the {{patients}} in medical imaging is always of high importance. Spine and pelvic radiographic examinations that involve a relatively high radiation dose to the radiosensitive organs of the patients are of particularly concern. A major reason for the relatively high dose being delivered to patients in these examinations {{is caused by the}} application of an anti-scatter grid. To this end, the main theme {{of this study was to}} explore the feasibility of replacing the anti-scatter grid by an optimal air gap in spine and pelvic radiography to maximize the dose reduction effect in patients while retaining the resultant images of diagnostic quality in computed radiography (CR) and digital radiography (DR) systems using an anthropomorphic RANDO phantom. To gain a holistic picture on the mechanism of this dose reduction method, it was important to uncover the scientific basis on the dose and scatter distribution patterns in diagnostic radiography. One objective of this research project was to uncover the air kerma distribution patterns of the <b>x-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> and the subsequent scatter distribution within and around a homogenous scattering medium by generating the 3 D dose maps. These were achieved by the physical measurement of air kerma at selected sites by an ionization chamber detector or thermoluminescent dosimeters and, coupled with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations on the measured data. Results on the investigation of air kerma distribution patterns among the three different brands of x-ray tube revealed the unique skewed shape 3 D distribution maps from the output of the studied x-ray tubes. This finding filled the knowledge gap on the anode heel effect investigation as was reflected on the characteristics variation of radiation intensity output of the x-ray tube. Findings on the investigation of air kerma distribution patterns on the water-equivalent dry slabs phantom by MC simulation on the photon transport uncovered the non-uniform distribution of scatter inside and around the scattering medium, and were presented in three-dimensional maps. Results on the investigation of dose reduction by the air gap method using the RANDO phantom confirmed that significant dose reduction effect with retention of image quality at diagnostic level was confirmed in all of the tested radiographic examinations in both the CR and DR systems. These examinations included cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, pelvis and full spine. Image Quality Score (IQS) and Visual Grading Analysis (VGA) tests were employed as the image evaluation methods for the assessors to determine the image quality of the images in according to the pre-set criteria. Among the non-grid images with different air gap thicknesses in place, those images being rated with the highest scores in both tests were considered as the best in image quality. Results on the IQS and VGA scores uncovered that the optimal air gap thickness for each of the tested radiographic examinations was in the range of 5 cm to 20 cm. By replacing the anti-scatter grid with an optimal air gap thickness, a substantial dose reduction effect ranging from 46. 7 % to 81. 6 % at the regions of radiosensitive organs of the tested RANDO phantom was evidenced. Effective doses simulated from the PCXMC 2. 0 program further revealed that a substantial dose reduction effect ranging from 50. 3 % to 80 % was found in the non-grid examinations with the optimal air gap thickness, which indicated that the risks on cancer induction could be reduced in the similar fashion. Of the same kind of radiographic examination, a further reduction in both the effective and organ doses by 3. 8 % to 18. 2 % were achieved while changing the imaging system from CR to DR. In conclusion, the use of an optimal air gap to replace the anti-scatter grid was proven to be an effective dose reduction method on high dose spine and pelvis radiographic examinations in both the CR and DR systems with image quality retained at the diagnostic level as was proven in the present study on a RANDO phantom model.

The dose rate was measured with an ionization chamber and an electrometer (PTW 34013 and Unidos-E both from PTW, Freiburg, Germany) at 1 cm apart from the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> in air. The air kerma strength of the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> operating at 50 kV with the tube current of 252 μA was as high as 108.1 Gy·cm 2 min− 1, which is approximately 15 times higher than that of a 10 -Ci HDR 192 Ir radioisotope source [20] that is widely used for brachytherapy. The fluctuation of the X-ray dose rate was as low as ± 2.7 %. In addition, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> has worked for over 2 months with no significant change in the electron beam current (0.25 mA at 50 kV) and the X-ray dose rate. The <b>X-ray</b> <b>tube</b> has been continuously operated for approximately 1 h/day.

30|$|Meanwhile, <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> {{based on}} carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) field-emission electron sources have been extensively developed because CNT emitters have several advantages compared with thermionic electron sources. The advantages of CNT emitters include (1) cold electron sources, and hence, little heat is generated inside the tube [6] {{which is important}} for the minimization of an X-ray tube; (2) simplicity and easy controllability in a pulse operation [7, 8]; (3) high current density for electron and X-ray microscopy devices [9, 10]. Several types of <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> have also been developed using CNT field emitters [11 – 15]. However, the miniature <b>X-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> are mostly not vacuum-sealed and thus should be operated in a vacuum chamber or with a vacuum pump.
