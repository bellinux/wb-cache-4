40|$|Knowledge {{and control}} of the {{polymorphic}} phases of chemical compounds are important aspects of drug development in the pharmaceutical industry. Salmeterol <b>xinafoate,</b> a long acting Î²-adrenergic receptor agonist, exists in two polymorphic Forms, I and II. Raman and near infrared spectra were obtained of these polymorphs at selected wavelengths in the range of 488 - 1064 nm; significant differences in the Raman and near-infrared spectra were apparent and key spectral marker bands have been identified for the vibrational spectroscopic characterisation of the individual polymorphs which were also characterised with X ray diffractometry. The solid-state transition of salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> polymorphs was studied using simultaneous in situ portable Raman spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry isothermally between transitions. This method assisted in the unambiguous characterisation of the two polymorphic forms by providing a simultaneous probe of both the thermal and vibrational data.

40|$|Particle {{inhalation}} is {{an effective}} and rapid delivery method {{for a variety of}} pharmaceuticals, particularly bronchodilation drugs used for treating asthma and COPD. Conditions of relative humidity and temperature inside the lungs are generally very different from the outside ambient air, with the lung typically being warmer and more humid. Changes in humidity, from inhaler to lung, can cause hygroscopic phase transitions and particle growth. Increasing particle size and mass can negatively affect particle deposition within the lung leading to inefficient treatment, while deliquescence prior to impaction is liable to accelerate drug uptake. To better understand the hygroscopic properties of four pharmaceutical aerosol particles; pharmaceutical particles from four commercially available pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) were stably captured in an optical trap, and their composition was examined online via Raman spectroscopy. Micron-sized particles of salbutamol sulfate, salmeterol <b>xinafoate,</b> fluticasone propionate and ciclesonide were levitated and examined over a range of relative humidity values inside a chamber designed to mimic conditions within the respiratory tract.

40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of impurities existing {{as separate}} crystalline phases at trace levels in drug materials {{is an important}} issue in the pharmaceutical industry. In the present study, a thermoanalytical approach previously developed for quantifying trace levels of polymorphic impurity (form II metastable nuclei) in commercial salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> powders has been successfully applied with slight modifications to ribavirin, an antiviral drug exhibiting roughly similar polymorph-dependent crystallization kinetics in melts to that of salmeterol <b>xinafoate.</b> Essentially, the approach involved modeling of the crystallization kinetics of both tested and reference drug materials in melts using the Avrami-Erofe'ev (AE) rate expression, derivation of a mathematical equation for relating the AE kinetic constant to the composition of reference polymorph mixtures, and the use of this derived equation (in the form of a calibration curve) to calculate the impurity contents of the tested samples from their computed AE constants. For ribavirin, modification of the latter equation by incorporation of an empirical exponent was found necessary to account for the composition-dependent changes in crystallization kinetics of the reference mixtures. Such modification has made possible the determination of polymorphic impurity content of as low as 0. 004 % (w/w) in ribavirin samples induced by different forms of grinding treatment. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} {{suitability}} of vibrational spectroscopic techniques (Raman, FT-IR and FT-NIR spectroscopy) as a means for the solid-state structural analysis of pharmaceuticals. Budesonide, fluticasone propionate, salbutamol hemisulfate, terbutaline hemisulfate, ipratropium bromide, polymorphic forms of salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> and two polymorphic forms of sulfathiazole were selected since they are used in the management of certain respiratory disorders and from different chemical and pharmacological entities along with some pharmaceutical excipients. Conventional visual examination is not sufficient to identify and differentiate spectra between different pharmaceuticals. To confirm the assignment of key molecular vibrational band signatures, quantum chemical calculations of the vibrational spectra were employed for better understanding of the first five selected drugs. The nondestructive nature of the vibrational spectroscopic techniques and the success of quantum chemical calculations demonstrated in this work have indeed offered a new dimension for the rapid identification and characterisation of pharmaceuticals and essentially warrant further research.

This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of this drug in patients with milder asthma in primary care. METHODS [...] A multicentre, double blind, randomised, parallel group comparison of salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> in a dose of 50 micrograms twice daily with placebo, both administered from a four-place dry powder inhaler (Diskhaler), was performed over six weeks in United Kingdom general practices. RESULTS [...] A total of 427 asthmatic patients aged 18 years or older were randomised to receive salmeterol or placebo in a 2 : 1 ratio. Of the total randomised population, 247 patients were previously on short acting bronchodilators alone whilst 180 patients were concurrently receiving up to 400 micrograms inhaled corticosteroid. Mean morning peak expiratory flow rose more in the salmeterol group than in the placebo group (treatment difference 17 l/min, 95 % confidence interval 9 to 26 l/min) but there was a smaller, non-significant difference in mean evening peak expiratory flow. Improvements occurred in the salmeterol-treated group compared with placebo for wheeze, shortness of breath, undisturbed nights, and relief medication use, irrespective of concomitant inhaled corticosteroid use. In addition, improvement in activity restriction was seen in the salmeterol group compared with placebo in the subgroup receiving only bronchodilator.

40|$|Background: Adherence to {{asthma and}} chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) treatment {{has been shown}} to depend on patient-level factors, such as disease severity, and medication-level factors, such as complexity. However, {{little is known about the}} impact of prescription charges – a factor at the health care system level. This study used real-life data to investigate whether co-payment affects adherence (implementation and persistence) and disease outcomes in patients with asthma or COPD. Methods: A matched, historical cohort study was carried out using two UK primary care databases. The exposure was co-payment for prescriptions, which is required for most patients in England but not in Scotland. Two comparison cohorts were formed: one comprising patients registered at general practices in England and the other comprising patients registered in Scotland. Patients aged 20 – 59 years with asthma, or 40 – 59 years with COPD, who were initiated on fluticasone propionate/salmeterol <b>xinafoate,</b> were included, matched to patients in the opposite cohort, and followed up for 1 year following fluticasone propionate/salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> initiation. The primary outcome was good adherence, defined as medication possession ratio ≥ 80 %, and was analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Secondary outcomes included exacerbation rate. Results: There were 1, 640 patients in the payment cohort, ie, England (1, 378 patients with asthma and 262 patients with COPD) and 619 patients in the no-payment cohort, ie, Scotland (512 patients with asthma and 107 patients with COPD). The proportion of patients with good adherence was 34. 3 % and 34. 9 % in the payment and no-payment cohorts, respectively, across both disease groups. In a multivariable model, no difference in odds of good adherence was found between the cohorts (odds ratio, 1. 04; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 85 – 1. 27).

40|$|Introduction: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a complex}} respiratory disorder, whose medical and socioeconomic burden {{as one of the}} main causes of morbidity and mortality is increasing worldwide. COPD pathophysiology includes chronic airway/lung inflammation and progressive airflow limitation. Therefore, anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator agents are key players in COPD treatment. Areas covered: This review article discusses the complementary molecular interactions connecting the respective mechanisms of action of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting β 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABAs). Moreover, attention is also focused on clinical trials, which have shown that ICS/LABA combinations are very effective in improving COPD symptoms and lung function, being also able to significantly reduce disease exacerbations.

Plastic behavior was observed,from rheometry of SX-PEG 400 crystallization media indicating a three-dimensional structure following formation of the crystal phase. Above the yield point, the plastic viscosity of the crystallization medium was identical to PEG solutions. Crystallization was concurrent with mixing regardless of the antisolvent addition method. The crystal size distribution (CSD) depended on the stirring conditions indicating that the CSD depended on a balance of the micro-, meso-, and macromixing steps in the turbulent mixing process arising from the viscous and microviscous properties of PEG. Crystallization from PEG 400 followed nucleation theory with the smallest microcrystals being produced at higher SX supersaturation. The degree of nucleation depended on the initial supersaturation and determined the final crystal median diameter. The latter finding was supported by focused beam reflectance measurement and particle vision and measurement analysis.

40|$|Salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> is an inhaled long-acting beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist {{recently}} introduced {{for the treatment}} of asthma. Both in vitro and animal studies suggest that it may have anti-inflammatory activities of benefit in this disease. To assess this directly, the effects of 6 weeks' treatment with salmeterol on indices of clinical activity, airway dysfunction and inflammation in subjects with stable atopic asthma were investigated. In a double blind study, asthmatic patients were randomized to 6 weeks' treatment with either salmeterol 50 microg twice daily (n= 14) or placebo (n= 12). They underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial biopsy immediately before starting treatment and again after 6 weeks. Treatment with salmeterol improved clinical indices of asthma activity, but there were no changes in BAL differential cell counts or mediator levels, and no change in T-cell numbers or activation status. In the biopsy specimens there were no changes in numbers of inflammatory cells, sub-basement membrane collagen deposition or mast cell degranulation.

To this end, the strength of cohesive SX-SX interactions and that of adhesive SX-lactose interactions were computed for the samples from the corresponding solubility parameters, and their fine particle fractions determined using a multi-stage liquid impinger. It was found that the aerosol performance of SX could be substantially improved by the addition of lactose carrier only if the adhesive SX-lactose interactions were stronger than the cohesive SX-SX interactions. The difference in strength between these two forms of interactions also displayed a significant correlation with the increase in fine particle fraction after the addition of lactose carrier.

The aim of the current work was to investigate the polymorphism of salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> (SX) following antisolvent micronization from poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) solvents and compare this to the properties of SX conventionally crystallized and micronized. Powder X-ray diffraction revealed that SX crystallized predominantly as the SX form I polymorph following rapid precipitation from PEG solvents and cooling crystallization from propan- 2 -ol. Thermo-kinetic analysis using a modified Avrami-Erofe'ev equation was applied to differential scanning calorimetric thermographs of crystallized and micronized SX. The kinetic analysis revealed that SX crystallized from PEG solvents underwent significantly less or no re-crystallization of SX form II from the melt. A polymorphic transition was identified upon heating ball-milled SX, although the untreated material was resistant to such transformation. The thermal behaviour of SX crystallized from PEG solvents was consistent with a lower degree of crystal lattice disorder and higher enantiotropic purity than SX crystallized from propan- 2 -ol; the same was also true when comparing SX before and after micronization.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} primary crystallization conditions on the mechanical properties and secondary processing behaviour of fluticasone propionate (FP) for carrier based dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations. Methods: Young’s modulus of FP crystals produced using different anti-solvents was determined using nanoindentation. Physicochemical and surface interfacial properties via the cohesive-adhesive balance (CAB) approach to colloid probe atomic force microscopy (AFM) of air-jet micronised FP crystals were investigated. These data were correlated to in vitro aerosolization performance of binary and combination DPI formulations containing salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> (SX). Results: Young’s modulus of FP crystals produced using different anti-solvents ranged from 0. 6 – 12. 4 GPa. Crystals with low Young’s modulus required multiple passes in the microniser to reduce the particle size to less than 5 μm, whilst those with the highest Young’s modulus required a single pass. CAB of micronized FP samples was similar with respect to lactose, however, their adhesive affinity to SX varied. Samples of FP with greatest adhesion to SX produced greater fine particle delivery of SX in combination DPI formulations. Conclusions: Crystallisation conditions may affect the mechanical properties of FP, and therefore secondary processing of the material and their interfacial properties and product performance in carrier based DPI formulations...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} the aerosolization and behaviour of microparticles of salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> (SX) and fluticasone propionate (FP) suspended in hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant. Methods. Microcrystals of SX and FP were produced from poly(ethylene glycol) by antisolvent crystallization. The suspension behaviour and aerosolization of the microcrystals when formulated as metered dose inhalers (MDIs) in HFA 134 a propellant was {{compared with that}} of microparticles produced by micronization (mSX and mFP) using a glass twin stage impinger and by laser light diffraction using a pressurized cell. Results. FP microparticles underwent non-reversible aggregation in suspension as seen by a doubling in the volume median diameter compared to the raw material. The degree of aggregation of SX particles in suspension was found to decrease as the particle size of the original particles increased. However, because the SX aggregate size was lowest for the particles with the smallest initial size (mSX), the highest fine particle fraction (FPF) of SX was obtained from a suspension of mSX. The FPFs following aerosolization of FP suspensions were similar although the FPF was lowest for particles with the largest original size. Conclusions. The size of the aggregates in the HFA suspensions was found to correlate directly with the FPFs determined by impaction...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} combination therapy comprising a long acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) and corticosteroid is widely recognized {{for the treatment}} of adult asthma. Here we examine the effect of salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> (SX) and fluticasone propionate (FP) alone and in combination on the immunological activation of human cultured mast cells (HCMC) in vitro. Methods: HCMC were passively sensitized with IgE antibody and then activated by challenging with anti-IgE antibody. The effect of drugs on the activation of mast cells was examined by measuring the amount of released chemical mediators (histamine, leukotrienes (LT) and prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2)) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Results: The release of each chemical mediator was inhibited by 10 − 9 - 10 − 8 M SX but not by 10 − 10 - 10 − 7 M FP. The production of GM-CSF was inhibited by a concentration of 10 − 8 M in both drugs and the inhibition was augmented by combined treatment with 10 − 11 M of each drug. Conclusions: The immunological release of chemical mediators (histamine, LT, PGD 2) from HCMC was inhibited by SX but not by FP. SX and FP inhibited the production of GM-CSF by HCMC and both drug showed synergistic inhibition in the production of GM-CSF...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> is an inhaled long-acting b 2 -adrenoceptor agonist {{recently}} introduced {{for the treatment}} of asthma. Both in vitro and animal studies suggest that it may have anti-inflammatory activities of benefit in this disease. To assess this directly, the effects of 6 weeks ’ treatment with salmeterol on indices of clinical activity, airway dysfunction and inflammation in subjects with stable atopic asthma were investigated. In a double blind study, asthmatic patients were randomized to 6 weeks ’ treatment with either salmeterol 50 mg twice daily (n= 14) or placebo (n= 12). They underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial biopsy immediately before starting treatment and again after 6 weeks. Treatment with salmeterol improved clinical indices of asthma activity, but there were no changes in BAL differential cell counts or mediator levels, and no change in T-cell numbers or activation status. In the biopsy specimens there were no changes in numbers of inflammatory cells, sub-basement membrane collagen deposition or mast cell degranulation. Regular treatment with salmeterol improves clinical indices of asthma but has no effect on the underlying inflammatory process. These findings strengthen guideline recommendations that long-acting b 2 -agonists should not be prescribed as sole antiasthma medication...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUnderstanding and {{controlling}} powder de-agglomeration {{is of great}} importance {{in the development of}} dry powder inhaler (DPI) products. Dry dispersion laser diffraction measures particle size readily under controlled dispersing conditions, but has not been exploited fully to characterise inherent powder dispersibility. The aim {{of the study was to}} utilise particle size-dispersing pressure titration curves to characterise powder cohesivity and ease of de-agglomeration. Seven inhaled drug/excipient powders (beclometasone dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, lactohale 300, salbutamol base, salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> and tofimilast) were subjected to a range of dispersing pressures (0. 2 – 4. 5 Bar) in the Sympatec HELOS/RODOS laser diffractometer and particle size measurements were recorded. Particle size-primary pressure data were used to determine the pressures required for complete de-agglomeration. The latter were employed as an index of the cohesive strength of the powder (critical primary pressure; CPP), and the curves were modelled empirically to derive the pressure required for 50 % de-agglomeration (DA 50). The powders presented a range of CPP (1. 0 – 3. 5 Bar) and DA 50 (0. 23 – 1. 45 Bar) which appeared to be characteristic for different mechanisms of powder de-agglomeration. This approach has utility as a rapid pre-formulation tool to measure inherent powder dispersibility, in order to direct the development strategy of DPI products...|$|E
40|$|In our {{previous}} studies, surface analysis by inverse gas chromatography (IGC) at infinite dilution (zero coverage) {{was performed on}} four salmeterol <b>xinafoate</b> (SX) powdered samples, viz, two supercritical CO 2 -processed Form I (SX-I) and Form II (SX-II) polymorphs, a commercial granulated SX (GSX) raw material and its micronized product (MSX). Both GSX and MSX are also of the same Form I polymorph. To further probe the differences in surface properties between the samples, the present study has extended the IGC analysis to the finite concentration range of selected energy probes. The adsorption isotherms of the SX samples were constructed using (nonpolar) octane, (polar acidic) chloroform, and (polar basic) tetrahydrofuran as liquid probes. Type II adsorption isotherms with weak knees were observed with each probe for all SX Form I samples. The extents of probe adsorption by the samples at various relative pressures follow the rank order: SX-II > GSX approximate to MSX > SX-I, indicating that the SX-I has fewer high-energy adsorption sites than GSX and MSX. Type III isotherms were observed for SX-II with the two polar probes, indicative of weak adsorbate-adsorbent interactions. The additional information generated shows that IGC analysis at finite coverage is a valuable complementary tool to that at infinite dilution. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
