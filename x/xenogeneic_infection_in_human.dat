50|$|Due {{to the low}} {{occurrence}} of this <b>infection</b> <b>in</b> <b>humans,</b> and non-lethal symptoms, it is not considered a public health crisis where large steps {{have to be taken}} toward prevention or the development of a vaccine. The most common way to prevent this <b>infection</b> <b>in</b> <b>humans</b> is to avoid contact with nonhuman primates and the soil in their proximity.

Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild <b>infections</b> <b>in</b> <b>humans,</b> can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|R
