50|$|Antenna {{designs for}} the CW and FM-CW started out as {{separate}} transmit and receive antennas {{before the advent of}} affordable microwave designs. In the late 1960s, traffic radars began being produced which used a single antenna. This was made possible by the use of circular polarization and a multi-port waveguide section operating at X band. By the late 1970s this changed to linear polarization and the use of ferrite circulators at both <b>X</b> <b>and</b> <b>K</b> bands. PD radars operate at too high a PRF to use a transmit-receive gas filled switch, and most use solid-state devices to protect the receiver low-noise amplifier when the transmitter is fired.|$|E
