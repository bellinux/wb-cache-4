50|$|Development of <b>xaliproden</b> {{for these}} two {{indications}} was discontinued in 2007 following analysis of Phase III data. While the drug did show an effect on hippocampal volume (suggesting perhaps a slowing of cell loss), there was insufficient evidence for efficacy in counteracting Alzheimer's related cognitive decline. Similarly while there were some indicators of efficacy in ALS, including a small but clinically noteworthy effect on some functional parameters, the overall benefit did not reach statistical significance when results across several Phase III trials were averaged. <b>Xaliproden</b> remains under investigation for treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Xaliproden</b> (codenamed SR57746) {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as a 5HT1A agonist. It has {{neurotrophic}} and neuroprotective effects in vitro, and has been proposed {{for use in the}} treatment of several neurodegenerative conditions including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The {{neurotrophic}} {{effect of}} <b>Xaliproden</b> has been followed using sequential cerebral {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) in rats with vincristine-induced brain lesion {{as a model of}} Alzheimer disease. METHODS: Nineteen rats received an intraseptal injection of vincristine on day 0, followed by a daily gavage with either the vehicle (Tween- 20 1 %) (n = 10) or <b>Xaliproden</b> (10 mg/kg) (n = 9). Eight sham-operated controls received a daily gavage with either the vehicle (n = 4) or <b>Xaliproden</b> (n = 4). Brain MR imaging was performed at 4. 7 T on a Biospec 47 / 30 MR system before surgery then 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after surgery. RESULTS: At day 3 following vincristine injection, an increase in MR signal intensity in the septum was observed on T 2 -weighted images. This increase was maximal at day 10, and remained stable until day 14. Daily treatment with <b>Xaliproden</b> delayed the appearance of hypersignals until day 7 and reduced by Ca. 50 % the magnitude of the increase in signal intensity from day 10. No changes were observed in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Quantitative MRI objectifies noninvasively the neuroprotective effect of <b>Xaliproden</b> on rat brain anatomy...|$|E
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a relentlessly {{progressive and}} fatal motor neuron disease. We carried out two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, multi-national studies with <b>xaliproden</b> (a drug with neurotrophic effect) to assess drug efficacy and safety at two doses. Patients with clinically probable or definite ALS {{of more than}} 6 months and less than 5 years duration {{were randomly assigned to}} placebo, 1 mg or 2 mg <b>xaliproden</b> orally once daily as monotherapy in Study 1 (n= 867); or to the same regimen with addition of riluzole 50 mg bid background therapy in Study 2 (n= 1210 patients). The two primary endpoints were defined as: 1. Time to death, tracheostomy, or permanent assisted ventilation (DTP), and 2. Time to vital capacity (VC) < 50 % or DTP before (log-rank test) and after adjustment using a Cox proportional hazard model for prespecified prognostic factors. Secondary endpoints were rates of change of various functional measures. In Study 1, primary outcome measures did not reach statistical significance. For the 2 mg group, for time to VC< 50 % analysis (without DTP) a significant 30 % RRR was obtained (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 8. 46, P= 0. 009). In Study 2, no significant results were obtained. However, there was a trend in favour of add-on 1 mg dose <b>xaliproden</b> vs. placebo (RRR 15 % [- 6. 31, ns] for time to VC< 50 %; RRR 12 % [CI: - 6. 27, ns] for time to VC< 50 % or DTP). Adjusted RR ratios were consistently more favourable for the <b>xaliproden</b> groups. Tolerability was good, and dose-dependent side effects were largely associated with the serotonergic properties of <b>xaliproden.</b> An effect of <b>xaliproden</b> on functional parameters, especially VC, was noted. Although this effect did not reach statistical significance, <b>xaliproden</b> had a small effect on clinically noteworthy aspects of disease progression in ALS. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Radiation {{therapy in}} the {{treatment}} of cancer is dose limited by radiation injury in normal tissues such as the intestine and the heart. To identify the mechanistic involvement of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b 1) in intestinal and cardiac radiation injury, we studied the influence of pharmacological induction of TGF-b 1 with <b>xaliproden</b> (SR 57746 A) in rat models of radiation enteropathy and radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD). Because it was uncertain to what extent TGF-b induction may enhance radiation injury in heart and intestine, animals were exposed to irradiation schedules that cause mild to moderate (acute) radiation injury. In the radiation enteropathy model, male Sprague-Dawley rats received local irradiation of a 4 -cm loop of rat ileum with 7 once-daily fractions of 5. 6 Gy, and intestinal injury was assessed at 2 weeks and 12 weeks after irradiation. In the RIHD model, male Sprague-Dawley rats received local heart irradiation with a single dose of 18 Gy and were followed for 6 months after irradiation. Rats were treated orally with <b>xaliproden</b> starting 3 days before irradiation {{until the end of the}} experiments. Treatment with <b>xaliproden</b> increased circulating TGF-b 1 levels by 300 % and significantly induced expression of TGF-b 1 and TGF-b 1 target genes in the irradiated intestine and heart. Various radiation-induced structural changes in the intestine at 2 and 12 weeks were significantly enhanced with TGF-b 1 induction. Similarly, in the RIHD model induction of TGF-b 1 augmented radiation-induced changes in cardiac function and myocardial fibrosis. These results lend further support for the direct involvement of TGF-b 1 in biological mechanisms of radiation-induce...|$|E

This {{study was designed to}} investigate whether prophylactic repetitive administration of 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists inhibits oxaliplatin-induced mechanical allodynia in mice. Repetitive administration of 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists (<b>xaliproden</b> and tandospirone) inhibited mechanical allodynia induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of oxaliplatin. These agonists also inhibited oxaliplatin-induced mast cell migration, which is involved in the induction of mechanical allodynia.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{examine how}} {{respiratory}} interventions affect survival as an outcome measure and to define survival rate for trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. DESIGN AND SETTING We reviewed {{the data of}} 3 phase 3 clinical trials and examined differences in times to death, tracheostomy, and permanent assisted ventilation. We assessed the outcomes with chi(2) and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and unpaired, 2 -tailed t tests for continuous variables. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate the differences in survival times between interventions. A power analysis generated sample size estimates for different end points.

40|$|One form of {{neurotoxicity}} is {{the principal}} and dose-limiting toxicity of oxaliplatin. It has been observed {{that the incidence of}} oxaliplatin-induced severe neurotoxicity has varied from 12 % to 18 % in different clinical trials. Oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy can be divided into two distinct syndromes. The first is a unique syndrome of acute, transient peripheral nerve hyperexcitability occurring shortly after the infusion of oxaliplatin. The second one is a peripheral sensory neuropathy occurring mainly in the distal extremities with symptoms similar to those caused by cisplatin. It may last for several months, and results in a severe disturbance of neurologic function, and has a significant impact on oxaliplatin treatment. Various strategies have been proposed to prevent or treat oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity, including the stop-and-go concept, calcium and magnesium infusions, antiepileptic drugs, glutathione, <b>xaliproden,</b> NSAIDs, glutamine, and opioid drugs. In this article, the authors focus on the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin, the role of glutamine in the management of oxaliplatin-neuropathy, genomic polymorphisms involved in an altered susceptibility to opioid drugs in managing oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain, and the use of nerve conduction velocity studies in objectively assessing oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy...|$|E
30|$|None of the non-steroidal-based drugs namely phenserine, statins, tarenflurbil, tramiprosate, and <b>xaliproden</b> have {{exhibited}} satisfactory {{efficiency in}} treatment of neurological disorders [124 – 126]. However, {{it is known}} that high levels of cholesterol are related with increased risk of AD. It has been verified based on animal studies that hypercholesterolemia promotes Aβ production and deposition. Currently, there are also two classes of medication approved for the AD treatment. The choline esterase inhibitor (ChEI) donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Reminyl), and rivastigmine (Exelon) are prescribed for the treatment of mild to moderate AD. The N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine is the only medicine for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia. Excess ions of iron, zinc, and copper cause precipitation of Aβ leading to the development of toxic Aβ oligomers [127]. Formation of Aβ oligomers can be easily prevented if the above metal ions are chelated with non-toxic ligands such as diferrioximme or D-penicillamine, giving soluble complexes which can be removed from living system. Polystyrene NPs of 240  nm conjugated with deferiprone administrated to cultured human cortical neurons in vitro showed decreased cytotoxicity by preventing Aβ aggregation [128]. However, the bioavailability and toxicity limit their application in the human system. Nanocarriers facilitate this property by conjugation of chelating agent with them.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease (MND), {{which is}} also known as {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis (ALS), causes a wide range of symptoms but the evidence base for the effectiveness of the symptomatic treatment therapies is limited. OBJECTIVES: To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Systematic Reviews of all symptomatic treatments for MND. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) on 15 November 2016 for systematic reviews of symptomatic treatments for MND. We assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the GRADE approach. We followed standard Cochrane study (review) selection and data extraction procedures. We reported findings narratively and in tables. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine Cochrane Systematic Reviews of interventions to treat symptoms in people with MND. Three were empty reviews with no included randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, all three reported on non-RCT evidence and the remaining six included mostly one or two studies. We deemed all of the included reviews of high methodological quality. Drug therapy for painThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review exploring the efficacy of drug therapy for pain in MND. Treatment for crampsThere is evidence (13 RCTs, N = 4012) that for the treatment of cramps in MND, compared to placebo:- memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably ineffective (moderate-quality evidence);- vitamin E may have little or no effect (low-quality evidence); and- the effects of L-threonine, gabapentin, <b>xaliproden,</b> riluzole, and baclofen are uncertain as the evidence is either very low quality or the trial specified the outcome but did not report numerical data. The review reported adverse effects of riluzole, {{but it is not clear}} whether other interventions had adverse effects. Treatment for spasticityIt is uncertain whether an endurance-based exercise programme improved spasticity or quality of life, measured at three months after the programme, as the quality of evidence is very low (1 RCT, comparison "usual activities", N = 25). The review did not evaluate other approaches, such as use of baclofen as no RCTs were available. Mechanical ventilation for supporting respiratory functionNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) probably improves median survival and quality of life in people with respiratory insufficiency and normal to moderately impaired bulbar function compared to standard care, and improves quality of life but not survival for people with poor bulbar function (1 RCT, N = 41, moderate-quality evidence; a second RCT did not provide data). The review did not evaluate other approaches such as tracheostomy-assisted ('invasive') ventilation, or assess timing of NIV initiation. Treatment for sialorrhoeaA single session of botulinum toxin type B injections to parotid and submandibular glands probably improves sialorrhoea and quality of life at up to 4 weeks compared to placebo injections, but not at 8 or 12 weeks after the injections (moderate-quality evidence from 1 placebo-controlled RCT, N = 20). The review authors found no trials of other approaches. Enteral tube feeding for supporting nutritionThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to support benefit or harms of enteral tube feeding in supporting nutrition in MND. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulationIt is uncertain whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves disability or limitation in activity in MND in comparison with sham rTMS (3 RCTs, very low quality evidence, N = 50). Therapeutic exerciseThere is evidence that exercise may improve disability in MND at three months after the exercise programme, but not quality of life, in comparison with "usual activities" or "usual care" including stretching (2 RCTs, low-quality evidence, N = 43). Multidisciplinary careThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to demonstrate any benefit or harm for multidisciplinary care in MND. None of the reviews, other than the review of treatment for cramps, reported that adverse events occurred. However, the trials were too small for reliable adverse event reporting. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This overview has highlighted the lack of robust evidence in Cochrane Systematic Reviews on interventions to manage symptoms resulting from MND. It is important to recognise that clinical trials may fail to demonstrate efficacy of an intervention for reasons other than a true lack of efficacy, for example because of insufficient statistical power, the wrong choice of dose, insensitive outcome measures or inappropriate participant eligibility. The trials were mostly too small to reliably assess adverse effects of the treatments. The nature of MND makes it difficult to research clinically accepted or recommended practice, regardless of the level of evidence supporting the practice. It would not be ethical, for example, to design a placebo-controlled trial for treatment of pain in MND or to withhold multidisciplinary care where such care is available. It is therefore highly unlikely that there will ever be classically designed placebo-controlled RCTs in these areas. We need more research with appropriate study designs, robust methodology, and of sufficient duration to address the changing needs-of people with MND and their caregivers-associated with MND disease progression and mortality. There is a significant gap in studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions for symptoms relating to MND, such as pseudobulbar emotional lability and cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Future studies should use appropriate outcome measures that are reliable, have internal and external validity, and are sensitive to change in what is being measured (such as quality of life).
