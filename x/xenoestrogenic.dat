40|$|Bisphenol-A (BPA) {{has been}} {{reported}} to have some <b>xenoestrogenic</b> effects on the reproductive system of male animals. In this study, we examined the growth of combs and testes of the male chickens exposed to BPA. White leghorn male chicks were administered 200 mg BPA orally every week from 2 wk of age. The combs and testes were examined at 16 wk of age. The body growth showed no significant difference between BPA-administered and control birds. However, the weight of the combs and testes were lower in the BPA-treated birds. Histologically, testes of the control birds were well matured; the seminiferous tubuli were filled with sperm. In contrast, the testes of most of the BPA-treated birds showed an immature appearance with smaller seminiferous tubuli and limited spermatogenesis.

Different features of xenobiotic-induced receptor activity in serum and sperm DNA fragmentation and apoptotic markers existed between the Inuits and the European Caucasians.

NP is widely used as {{surfactants}} in industrial and agricultural applications and in plastic formulations. Its <b>xenoestrogenic</b> activity was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. However, there are only few studies on the NP effects on prostate cell lines. Estrogens {{play an important role}} in development and growth of the prostate and may cause some pathologies, including cancer. Since NP mimics endogenous estrogens, it could have a negative influence on prostate physiology. In this study we examined the effects of NP and 17 β-estradiol (E 2) on the proliferation of non tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell line (PNT 1 A) and their interaction with estrogen receptors. These effects were also studied in presence of selective estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182, 780. We found that both NP and E 2 stimulate PNT 1 A proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, but the NP effects were lower than E 2. Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses revealed that both NP and E 2 induce cytoplasm-nucleus translocation of ERα. The nuclear localization of ERα by E 2 was already shown after 2 h of treatment and only after 6 h by NP. The inhibition of these effects by adding ICI 182, 780 was shown. Surprisingly, NP and E 2 didn’t affect the localization of ERβ. These results suggest that NP stimulates PNT 1 A proliferation probably through the interaction with ERα that in turn is involved in the activation of some prostate cell cycle key regulators...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{documented}} {{risk factors}} for breast cancer and rates of screening cannot completely explain recent increases in incidence or mortality. Established {{risk factors for}} breast cancer, including genetics, account for at best 30 % of cases. Most of these risk factors {{can be linked to}} total lifetime exposure to bioavailable estrogens. Experimental evidence reveals that compounds such as some chlorinated organics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), triazine herbicides, and pharmaceuticals affect estrogen production and metabolism and thus function as xenoestrogens. Many of these <b>xenoestrogenic</b> compounds also experimentally induce mammary carcinogenesis. Recent epidemiologic studies have found that breast fat and serum lipids of women with breast cancer contain significantly elevated levels of some chlorinated organics compared with noncancer controls. As the proportion of inherited breast cancer in the population is small, most breast cancers are due to acquired mutations. Thus, the induction of breast cancer in the majority of cases stems from interactions between host factors, including genetics and environmental carcinogens. We hypothesize that substances such as xenoestrogens increase {{the risk of breast cancer}} by mechanisms which include interaction with breast-cancer susceptibility genes. A series of major epidemiologic studies need to be developed to evaluate this hypothesis, including studies of estrogen metabolism, the role of specific <b>xenoestrogenic</b> substances in breast cancer, and relevant genetic-environmental interactions. In addition, experimental studies are needed to evaluate biologic markers of suspect xenoestrogens and biologic markers of host susceptibility and identify pathways of estrogenicity that affect the development of breast cancer. If xenoestrogens do play a role in breast cancer, reductions in exposure will provide an opportunity for primary prevention of this growing disease. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E

40|$|Sex {{hormone levels}} {{and timing of}} sexual {{maturation}} are considered important markers for health status of adolescents in puberty, and previous research suggests they might be influenced by metal exposure. In three campaigns of the Flemish Environment and Health Study (FLEHS I 2002 - 2006; FLEHS II 2007 - 2011 and FLEHS III 2012 - 2015), data were collected on internal exposure to metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Cr, Mn, Tl, Ni, Sb, Hg, As and As species) and sexual maturation in 2671 14 - 15 years old adolescents. All metals were measured in blood and/or urine, except total- and methylmercury which were measured in hair samples. Sex hormone levels were measured in blood serum of adolescent males of the cohorts of FLEHS I and FLESH II. The use of a uniform methodology in successive campaigns allows to confirm associations between exposure and health in different cohorts and over time. Furthermore, mathematical and statistical density correction methods using creatinine or specific gravity were tested for urinary markers. Significant associations between sex hormones and maturity markers were observed in the FLEHS I and II campaigns, when both were assessed together. Regardless of the applied correction method, creatinine correction systematically introduced bias due to associations of creatinine with sex hormones and maturation markers, especially in adolescent males, while {{this is not the}} case for specific gravity. A series of exposure-response associations were found, but several involving Cd, Pb, As, Tl and Cu persisted in different FLEHS campaigns. The effects of Pb and Cu on luteinizing hormone, (free) testosterone, (free) oestradiol and maturation support a <b>xenoestrogenic</b> agonistic action on the feedback of oestradiol to the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. Our results suggest that specific care should be taken when selecting urine density correction for investigating associations with hormonal and maturation markers in adolescent males.

With this technique, solvent dependencies and ligand-receptor interactions can be studied in great detail, due to the high spectral resolution and the fact that at cryogenic temperatures (4 K), no solvent reorientation effects complicate the interpretation. The FLN spectrum of a ligand bound to the receptor is compared to the spectra of the free ligand in solvent mixtures that mimic the functionalities present within the receptor's binding site. It is shown that for the well-known estrogen receptor (ER), the orientations of two <b>xenoestrogenic</b> ligands 3 - and 9 -hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (3 - and 9 -OH-BaP) can be determined. The FLN results clearly indicate that an H-bond accepted by HIS 524 {{plays a major role in}} the binding of these ligands to the ER.

40|$|Zearalenone (ZEN) is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} Fusarium fungi. ZEN primarily contaminates different cereals, and exerts a strong <b>xenoestrogenic</b> effect in animals and humans. ZEN is a fluorescent mycotoxin, although molecular interactions and microenvironmental changes significantly modify its spectral properties. During biotransformation, ZEN is converted into α-zearalenol (α-ZOL) and β-zearalenol (β-ZOL), the toxic metabolites of ZEN, which mimick {{the effect of}} estrogen. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are host molecules, and have been studied extensively; they can form stable complexes with several mycotoxins, including ZEN. However, information is limited regarding the interactions of CDs with ZOLs. Therefore, we studied the interactions of α- and β-ZOLs with native and six chemically modified β-CDs by fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence enhancement during complex formation, as well as binding constants, were determined. To understand ZOL-CD interactions better, molecular modeling studies were also carried out. Both mycotoxin derivatives formed the most stable complexes with methylated and sulfobutylated CD-derivatives; however, the CD complexes of α-ZOL were significantly stronger than those of β-ZOL.

40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) are {{a group of}} heterogeneous compounds of both natural and anthropogenic origin with highly persistent and bioaccumulative properties. They cause a range of adverse effects to {{human health and the}} environment around the world. There is growing concern that POPs may increase breast cancer risk due to their <b>xenoestrogenic</b> properties. The aim of this systematic literature review is to summarize and integrate the risks of breast cancer following environmental exposure to POPs (other than DDT) from primary epidemiological studies published between 2006 and 2015. After searching various databases, 14 case-control studies and one cohort study were included. Evidence of an association between increased breast cancer risk and environmental exposure to these chemicals is inconsistent and inadequate to conclude with certainty. However, most of the studies have examined exposure to the pollutants after diagnosis of breast cancer, overlooking exposure during critical windows of vulnerability. They have also largely focused on individual chemicals but ignored the combined effects of different chemicals. Therefore, major data gaps remain in examining exposure during critical windows of vulnerability and assessing combined effects of multiple chemicals.

40|$|Abstract Nonylphenol is {{the primary}} {{breakdown}} product of nonylphenol ethoxylates, a certain class of nonionic surfactants. Nonylphenol {{has been found to}} be toxic to aquatic organisms and has been suspected of being harmful to humans due to its <b>xenoestrogenic</b> properties. Although there are known releases of nonylphenol to the environment, there is a lack of data describing the extent of biodegradation. This study thus focuses on much needed information on the biodegradation kinetics of nonylphenol. Oxygen up-take, cell growth and nonylphenol removal data were collected using batch reactors in an electrolytic respirometer. Nonylphenol removal, cell growth and substrate removal rates were modeled by the Monod, Haldane, Aiba, Webb, and Yano equations. The dif-ferential equations were solved by numerical integra-tion to simulate cell growth, substrate removal, and oxygen uptake as a function of time. All models provided similar results with the Haldane model providing the best fit. The values of the kinetic parameters and the activation energy for nonylphenol were determined. These values can be used for predicting fate and transport of nonylphenol in the environment.

A simple method was developed to deconjugate estrogen metabolites present in human urine and fish bile back to active estrogens by enzymatic hydrolysis with b-glucuronidase or live Escherichia coli cells. Deconjugated extracts were tested for estrogenic activity in the in vitro stable estrogen receptor–mediated chemical-activated luciferase gene expression (ER-CALUX) assay. Estrogen glucuronides in urine obtained from human males and females were effectively converted to active forms after incubation with b-glucuronidase or E. coli. The highest estrogenic activity was found in deconjugated metabolites from urine of a pregnant woman, in which levels up to 3, 000 nmol estradiol equivalents per liter of urine were found after overnight incubation of urine with E. coli.

40|$|Comprehension of the ligand-receptor {{interactions}} is {{a prerequisite}} for constructing mechanism based quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models on <b>xenoestrogenic</b> activity. Molecular docking was performed to simulate the interactions between anthraquinone derivative (AQs) molecules and the estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha).

The recombinant yeast-based assay was employed to determine the estrogenic activities of 20 AQs. On the basis of the observed interactions between the AQs and ER alpha, appropriate molecular structural parameters were computed to develop a QSAR model. The polarizability term, the binding energy, the average molecular polarizability, the most negative formal charge in the molecule, and the average of the negative potentials on the molecular surface were significant parameters explaining the estrogenicity. The developed QSAR model had good robustness, predictive ability, and mechanism interpretability.

One major challenge in the area of food safety is, therefore, the development of multi-endpoint strategies that could increase the efficiency of high-throughput screening procedures.

Human MCF 7 and T 47 D carcinoma cells, representing the most frequently used model systems for tumorigenic responses in the mammary gland, were synchronized by hormone starvation during 48 h. Subsequently, a 24 h exposure was carried out with equipotent concentrations of the selected xenoestrogens or 17 beta-estradiol. Analysis of messenger RNA was performed on high-density oligonucleotide microarrays that display the sequences of 33, 000 human transcripts, yielding a total of 181 gene products that are regulated upon estrogenic stimulation. Surprisingly, genistein (a phytoestrogen), bisphenol-A and polychlorinated biphenyl congener 54 (two synthetic xenoestrogens) produced highly congruent genomic fingerprints by regulating the same range of human genes. Also, the monotonous genomic signature observed in response to xenoestrogens is identical to the transcriptional effects induced by physiological concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol. This striking functional convergence indicates that the transcription machinery is largely insensitive to the particular structure of estrogen receptor agonists. The occurrence of such converging transcriptional programs reinforces the hypothesis that multiple <b>xenoestrogenic</b> contaminants, of natural or anthropogenic origin, may act in conjunction with the endogenous hormone to induce additive effects in target tissues...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{literature}} survey into the consequences of hormone disrupting, and more in particular oestrogenic, substances for human health are summarized. For about 55 environment-contaminating (groups of) substances {{it is assumed that}} they may interfere with human reproduction via a hormone disrupting mechanism, probably via a wide range of toxic mechanisms. Available data indicate {{that a large number of}} these substances does not elicit their effects, if any, through interaction with the oestrogen receptor. The attention for the <b>xenoestrogenic</b> substances follows a reported possible decline in the quality of the human sperm. For other phenomena, e. g. breast and testicular cancers an increase in occurrence is reported. It is thought that these phenomena might be related to an increased exposure to oestrogenic substances. However, experimental data, supporting this hypothesis do not exist. A preliminary estimation indicates that exposure to anthropogenic environmental oestrogens contributes much less to the total exposure to oestrogens than exposure to endogenous or almost inevitable exposure to natural oestrogens via the food. At least part of the reported phenomena may be attributable to other factors which have changed in time e. g. diet composition and total energy intake. For a more definite conclusion about any causal relationship between the occurrence of health phenomena and exposure to environmental hormone disruptors additional scientific research into the nature and severity of the reported phenomena, the extent to which people are exposed and the association between the two of these is required...|$|E
40|$|Produced water {{constitutes}} the largest volume of waste from offshore {{oil and gas}} operations and is composed {{of a wide range}} of organic and inorganic compounds. Although treatment processes have to meet strict oil in water regulations, the definition of “oil” is a function of the analysis process and may include aliphatic hydrocarbons which have limited environmental impact due to degradability whilst ignoring problematic dissolved petroleum species. This thesis presents the partitioning behavior of oil in produced water as a function of temperature and salinity to identify compounds of environmental concern. Phenol, p-cresol, and 4 -tert-butylphenol were studied because of their <b>xenoestrogenic</b> power; other compounds studied are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon PAHs which include naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene. Partitioning experiments were carried out in an Innova incubator for 48 hours, temperature was varied from 4 ﾟC to 70 ﾟC, and two salinity levels of 46. 8 ‰ and 66. 8 ‰ were studied. Results obtained showed that the dispersed oil concentration in the water reduces with settling time and equilibrium was attained at 48 h settling time. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) partitions based on dispersed oil concentration whereas phenols are not significantly affected by dispersed oil concentration. Higher temperature favors partitioning of PAHs into the water phase. Salinity has negligible effect on partitioning pattern of phenols and PAHs studied. Simulation results obtained from the Aspen HYSYS model shows that temperature and oil droplet distribution greatly influences the efficiency of produced water treatment system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{persistent}} {{organic pollutants}} (POPs) are highly lipophilic and resistant to biodegradation and found in e. g. seafood and marine mammals. Greenlandic Inuit have high intake of marine food and thus high POP burden that varies according to local conditions and dietary preference. We do {{for the very first}} time report the serum POP related non-steroidal xenohormone activity of Inuit across Greenland. The aims were 1) to determine the integrated xenohormone bioactivities as an exposure biomarker of the actual lipophilic serum POP mixture measuring the effect on estrogen (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) transactivity in citizens from different Greenlandic districts and 2) to evaluate associations to serum POP markers (14 PCBs and 10 pesticides) and lifestyle characteristics. Methods Serum samples from 121 men and 119 women from Nuuk, Sisimiut and Qaanaaq were extracted using SPE-HPLC fractionation to obtain the serum POP fraction free of endogenous hormones. The serum POP fraction was used for determination of xenohormone transactivity using ER and AR reporter gene assays. Results In overall, the xenohormone transactivities differed between districts as well as between the genders. Associations between the transactivities and age, n- 3 /n- 6 and smoker years were observed. The <b>xenoestrogenic</b> and xenoandrogenic transactivities correlated negatively to the POPs for the combined female and male data, respectively. Conclusion The non-steroidal xenohormone transactivities can be used as an integrated biomarker of POP exposure and lifestyle characteristics. The actual serum POP mixtures antagonized the age adjusted sex hormone receptor functions. Comparison of different study populations requires in addition to age inclusion of diet and lifestyle factors. </p...|$|E
40|$|Xenoestrogens are endocrine-disrupting {{chemicals}} that mimic {{the action of}} endogenous estrogen hormones. Effects of xenoestrogen on aquatic wildlife are well documented, whereas the experimental evidence for impairment of reproductive behavior and physiology in mammals after exposure to xenoestrogens has been debated. The strongest arguments against such studies have been that the route, time course, and intensity of exposure did not simulate environmental exposure and that the chemicals tested have additional nonestrogenic toxic effects, hindering generalization of actual <b>xenoestrogenic</b> effects. Here we show that environmentallike exposure to the pure estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol during development alters reproductive behavior and physiology in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. We simulated environmental exposure by giving low doses (0. 4 and 0. 004 mu g/kg. d) of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol orally to pregnant females from conception to weaning of the pups, which continued to receive the treatment until puberty. We studied the sexual behavior, estrous cycle, and estradiol plasma levels of intact female rats when they reached 3 months of age. Exposure to the higher dose strongly affected female sexual behavior and physiology, with suppression of lordosis and the estrous cycle and enhanced aggression toward males. The lower dose disrupted appetitive components of sexual behavior that influence the rate of copulation. Estradiol plasma levels were not affected by the treatment. Our study revealed that exposure to low oral doses of a pure estrogen during development alters female sexual behavior and physiology. These results suggest potential risks of reproductive failure from xenoestrogen exposure in realistic ecological conditions. (Endocrinology 149 : 5592 - 5598, 2008...|$|E
40|$|Possible <b>xenoestrogenic</b> {{effects were}} investigated, {{for the first}} time, in two bivalve species from the Lagoon of Venice (Italy) : the clam Tapes philippinarum and the cockle Cerastoderma glaucum. Bivalves were {{collected}} far from their reproductive phase at the very early stage of gametogenesis (January), and in the pre-spawning period (June) in six sites. Vitellogenin (Vg) -like proteins (a biomarker of exposure to estrogenic compounds) were measured by the alkali-labile phosphate method (ALP), in both haemolymph and digestive gland from males and females (when {{it was possible to}} distinguish sex by microscopic observation of gonadal tissue). Haemolymph calcium concentrations (a parameter considered closely related to the presence of Vg-like proteins) and the bivalve condition index (CI) were also measured. In both seasons, bivalves collected at Campalto (near a sewage treatment plant) and Marghera (a highly contaminated area) had higher Vg-like protein levels, particularly in haemolymph, than animals from the other sampling sites. Interestingly, CI had high values in these polluted sites. In June only, Vg-like proteins and Ca 2 + levels in haemolymph exhibited similar trends in both bivalve species at most sampling sites. The responsiveness of bivalves to environmental xenoestrogens was higher in June, allowing better discrimination among sites. The present study demonstrates that animals from highly polluted areas have increased Vg-like protein levels. As endocrine disruption due to exposure to estrogenic compounds may cause fertility reduction, alterations in the sex ratio, and a decrease in reproductive rate, a condition of potential risk for bivalve populations in estuarine areas is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Cadmium (Cd) is a {{heavy metal}} of {{considerable}} occupational and environmental concern affecting wildlife and human health. Recent studies indicate that Cd, like other heavy metals, can mimic effects of 17 β-estradiol (E 2) involving E 2 receptor (ER) activation. Lactotrophs, the most abundant cell type in anterior pituitary gland, are the main target of E 2, which stimulates cell proliferation and increases prolactin secretion through ERα. The aim of this work was to examine whether Cd at nanomolar concentrations can induce cell proliferation and prolactin release in anterior pituitary cells in culture and whether these effects are mediated through ERs. Here we show that 10 nM Cd was able to stimulate lactotroph proliferation in anterior pituitary cell cultures from female Wistar rats and also in GH 3 lactosomatotroph cell line. Proliferation of somatotrophs and gonadotrophs were not affected by Cd exposure. Cd promoted cell cycle progression by increasing cyclins D 1, D 3 and c-fos expression. Cd enhanced prolactin synthesis and secretion. Cd E 2 -like effects were blocked by the pure ERs antagonist ICI 182, 780 supporting that Cd acts through ERs. Further, both Cd and E 2 augmented full-length ERαexpression and its 46 kDa-splicing variant. In addition, when co-incubated Cd was shown to interact with E 2 by inducing ERα mRNA expression which indicates an additive effect between them. This study shows {{for the first time}} that Cd at nanomolar concentration displays <b>xenoestrogenic</b> activities by inducing cell growth and stimulating prolactin secretion from anterior pituitary cells in a...|$|E
40|$|Parabens {{are widely}} used {{preservatives}} in basic necessities such as cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. In previous studies, <b>xenoestrogenic</b> actions of parabens were reported in an immature rat model and a rat pituitary cell line (GH 3 cells). The relationship between parabens and ovarian failure has not been described. In the present study, the influence of parabens on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis was investigated. A disruptor of ovarian small pre-antral follicles, 4 -vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD, 40 mg/kg), was used to induce premature ovarian failure (POF). Methylparaben (MP, 100 mg/kg), propylparaben (PP, 100 mg/kg), and butylparaben (BP, 100 mg/kg) dissolved in corn oil were treated in female 8 -week-old Sprague-Dawley rat for 5 weeks. Estrus cycle status was checked daily by vaginal smear test. Ovarian follicle development and steroid synthesis were investigated through real-time PCR and histological analyses. Diestrus phases in the VCD, PP, and BP groups were longer than that in the vehicle group. VCD significantly decreased mRNA level of folliculogenesis-related genes (Foxl 2, Kitl and Amh). All parabens significantly increased the Amh mRNA level but unchanged Foxl 2 and Kitlg acting in primordial follicles. VCD and MP slightly increased Star and Cyp 11 a 1 levels, which are related to an initial step in steroidogenesis. VCD and parabens induced an increase in FSH levels in serum and significantly decreased {{the total number of}} follicles. Increased FSH implies impairment in ovarian function due to VCD or parabens. These results suggest that VCD may suppress both formation and development of follicles. In particular, combined administration of VCD and parabens accelerated inhibition of the follicle-developmental process through elevated AMH level in small antral follicles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Breast cancer (BC) is {{the most}} common cancer for women in the western world. From very few cases an {{extraordinary}} increase in BC was observed in the Inuit population of Greenland and Canada although still lower than in western populations. Previous data suggest that exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) might contribute to the risk of BC. Rat studies showed that perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) cause significantly increase in mammary fibroadenomas. This study aimed at evaluating the association between serum levels of POPs/PFCs in Greenlandic Inuit BC cases and their controls, and whether the combined POP related effect on nuclear hormone receptors affect BC risk. Methods Thirty-one BC cases and 115 controls were sampled during 2000 - 2003 from various Greenlandic districts. The serum levels of POPs, PFCs, some metals and the combined serum POP related effect on estrogen- (ER), androgen- (AR) and Ah-receptor (AhR) transactivity were determined. Independent student t-test was used to compare the differences and the odds ratios were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models. Results We observed {{for the very first time}} a significant association between serum PFC levels and the risk of BC. The BC cases also showed a significantly higher concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls at the highest quartile. Also for the combined serum POP induced agonistic AR transactivity significant association to BC risk was found, and cases elicited a higher frequency of samples with significant POP related hormone-like agonistic ER transactivity. The AhR toxic equivalent was lowest in cases. Conclusions The level of serum POPs, particularly PFCs, might be risk factors in the development of BC in Inuit. Hormone disruption by the combined serum POP related <b>xenoestrogenic</b> and xenoandrogenic activities may contribute to the risk of developing breast cancer in Inuit. Further investigations are needed to document these study conclusions. </p...|$|E
