40|$|The {{development}} of a three dimensional (3 -D) neutronic kinetic modeling process aiming at control system design for CANadian Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactors is carried out in this thesis using a modal synthesis method. In this method, the reactor space-time neutron flux is synthesized by a time-weighted series of precalculated neutron flux modes. These modes are eigenfunctions of the governing neutron diffusion equation at reference steady-state operating conditions. The <b>xenon</b> <b>effect</b> has also been considered. A special {{attention has been paid}} to compare the performance of the developed 3 -D model with that of a traditional coupled point kinetic model. The 3 -D reactor model is implemented by MATLAB/SIMULINK software environment. A nondimensionalized SIMULINK representation of the reactor model is established. The performance of the developed 3 -D reactor neutronic kinetic model is then evaluated in a closed-loop environment with the help of a CANDU reactor regulating system (RRS) simulation platform. The dynamic behavior of the reactor model in a practical load-following mode has also been examined. The accuracy of the model has been validated against actual plant measurements under transient conditions. Through the analysis and simulation studies, it has convincingly demonstrated that the developed 3 -D reactor model has significant advantages over the traditional coupled point kinetic model in terms of the improved accuracy and the higher resolution in modeling the reactor internal flux behaviors. Furthermore, using Graphic User Interface (GUI) techniques a user-friendly software package for the RRS simulation platform is developed. Based on the 3 -D reactor model and identified deficiencies of existing RRS’ functions, an advanced 3 -D reactor power distribution control is proposed and investigated. Linearization of the reactor model is performed and the performance of the linearized reactor model is evaluated in a closed-loop RRS environment. Using the feedback control law, a newly designed control strategy tries to suppress the effects of high order neutron flux modes and to emphasize behaviors of the dominant mode – the fundamental flux distribution adopted by the nominal design. Thereby, the 3 -D power distribution shape during transients is optimally maintained closer to the nominal design shape than by the traditional RRS. The benefits of 3 -D power distribution include not only the improved economical operation, but also improved safety as the uncertainties and the uneven power distribution are reduced. These have been confirmed by extensive simulation studies to Regional Overpower Protection (ROP) detectors’ flux transients during load following processes...|$|E

The authors stated that the enlargement of bad pathology of abdominal cavity (fecal or traumatic peritonitis, hepatic steatosis) provides variation of performance state indices. In case of red blood variation has a compensatory habit and leads to the support of carrier function. In case of white blood variation is typical for profuse xenobiotic stress. The usage of xenon relieves the demand of compensatory variation in red blood and favors hemogram recovery. The authors connect the salvage of performance state with the endointoxication depression that for its part is connected with positive <b>xenon</b> <b>effect</b> on the interseptum cell elements of abdominal cavity organs. Key words: xenon, peritonitis, hepatic steatosis, blood. Резюме Авторы в экспериментальных исследованиях на 290 крысах массой 180 - 220 гр. показали, что развитие тяжелой патологии брюшной полости (каловый или травматический перитонит, жировой гепатоз) сопровождается изменениями показателей общесоматического состояния. В красной крови эти изменения носят компенсаторный характер и направлены на поддержание её транспортной функции, а в белой крови изменения характерны для массивной ксенобиотической нагрузки. Применение ксенона ослабляет необходимость компенсаторных изменений в красной крови и способствует нормализации формулы крови.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{recombinant}} globins as oxygen storage and delivery pharmaceuticals must address two key protein engineering problems, one {{dealing with the}} improvement of apoprotein stability {{and the other with}} the structural determinants of ligand binding rates. Thirteen naturally occurring apomyoglobins were observed to unfold following the same two transitions as sperm whale apomyoglobin but with variable stabilities. Even with highly similar proteins, it is difficult to identify the individual amino acids and the specific intramolecular noncovalent forces that confer protein stability. Site-directed mutagenesis of apomyoglobins suggests that single point mutations have complex, but generally small effects on the unfolding of apomyoglobin. However, two pig multiple mutants were constructed on the basis of substitution trends in stable mammalian myoglobins, and these genetically engineered proteins had markedly increased overall stabilities. This result suggests that analysis of naturally occurring variants may {{be the best way to}} select modifications that inhibit denaturation. Oxygen binding was measured by both conventional and ultrafast laser photolysis techniques for more than 70 myoglobin mutants at 25 different positions. Intramolecular geminate rebinding of oxygen to sperm whale myoglobin occurs on a nanosecond timescale at room temperature and shows two well separated kinetic components, indicating at least two internal sites from which the photodissociated ligands return to the iron. Xenon accelerates the fast reaction but decelerates and diminishes the slower reaction. The rates and proportions of the two components and <b>xenon</b> <b>effects</b> on them vary widely for different mutants and suggest photodissociated ligands occupy xenon site 4 in the distal pocket and xenon site 1 below the plane of the heme. Rebinding from these positions corresponds to the slower geminate phase for oxygen rebinding. Computed bimolecular rate constants for ligand entry suggest that only residues immediately adjacent to the bound ligand and Phe 46 are important for ligand movement into and out of the protein. Ligand entry and exit do not appear to occur via transiently connected channels through the interior of the protein. Instead, the kinetic data presented here suggest that ligands enter and escape through a region circumscribed by the distal histidine, Phe 46, and the heme propionates...|$|R

The thruster is operated at an anode flow rate of 5. 30 mg/s, at backpressures of 1. 5 × 10 − 3 Pa (1. 1 × 10 − 5 torr) and 4. 8 × 10 − 4 Pa (3. 6 × 10 − 6 torr), corrected for <b>xenon.</b> The <b>effect</b> of the facility backpressure is clearly seen in {{the wings of the}} plume.

The Langmuir probe results indicate that the electric fields near the nude Faraday probe are functions of facility backpressure and the angle from the thruster centerline. The plasma potential measured within 20 mm of the probe varied by no more than 3 V.

Similarly to {{but quite}} {{different}} from the <b>xenon</b> poisoning <b>effects</b> resulting from fission-produced iodine during restart-up process of a fission reactor, we introduce a complete new concept of the tritium well depth and tritium well time in fusion energy research area. To show what the least required amount of tritium storage is used to start up a fusion reactor and how long a time the fusion reactor needs to be operated for achieving the tritium break-even during the initial start-up phase due to the finite tritium breeding time that is dependent on the tritium breeder, specific structure of breeding zone, layout of coolant flow pipes, tritium recovery scheme and extraction process, the tritium retention of reactor components, unrecoverable tritium fraction in breeder, leakage to the inertial gas container, and the natural decay etc, we describe this new phenomenon and answer this problem by setting up and by solving a set of equations, which express a dynamic subsystem model of the tritium inventory evolution in a fusion experimental breeder (FEB). Two different simulation models give almost the same results, It is found the tritium well depth is about 317 - 319 g and tritium well time is approximately 240 full power days for reference case of the FEB designed detail configuration and it is also found that after one-year operation the tritium storage reaches 1. 18 kg that is more than the least required amount of tritium storage to start up three of FEB-like fusion reactors...|$|R

Especially the informations {{on the impact of}} these anethestic agents on animals or humans with impaired left ventricular function are deficient. Both agents demonstrated cardioprotective properties but differed in their negative inotropic action. METHODS: 27 thiopental anesthetized pigs were investigated in an open-chest model with 60 minutes of coronary occlusion (LAD) to induce myocardial ischemia. After first measurements, anesthesia was supplemented by 0, 55 MAC of xenon or isoflurane with concomitant reduction of thiopental. A third group with unchanged thiopental dosage served as a control group. Hemodynamics and load independent indices of left ventriculare systolic and diastolic function were assessed by conductance catheter. RESULTS: Xenon and isoflurane did not impair cardiac output or arterial pressure, whereas xenon increased afterload. Nevertheless, both drugs demonstrated negative inotropic <b>effects.</b> <b>Xenon</b> affected the active relaxation and compliance significantly.

To explore if next to the antagonism at the NMDA-receptor other molecular targets are involved, we tested the xenon requirement in short sleeping Drosophila shaker mutants and in [ℎ 38]. Methods. The Drosophila melanogaster strains wildtype Canton-S, [ℎ 38], ℎ 102 and ℎ, were raised and sleep was measured. Based on the response of the flies at different xenon concentrations, logEC 50 values were calculated. Results. The logEC 50 -values for WT Canton-S were 1. 671 (1. 601 – 1. 742 95 %-confidence intervall; = 238; P versus ℎ 102 > 0, 05), for ℎ 1. 711 (1. 650 – 1. 773; = 242; P versus WT Canton-S > 0, 05). The logEC 50 -value for ℎ 102 was 1. 594 (1. 493 – 1. 694; = 261; P versus ℎ > 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although anesthetics {{have some}} cardioprotective properties, these {{benefits}} are often counterbalanced by their negative inotropic <b>effects.</b> <b>Xenon,</b> {{on the other}} hand, does not influence myocardial contractility. Thus, xenon may be a superior treatment {{for the maintenance of}} global hemodynamics, especially during right ventricular ischemia, which is generally characterized by a high acute complication rate. METHODS: The effects of 70 vol% xenon and 0. 9 vol% isoflurane on biventricular function were assessed in a porcine model (n= 36) using the conductance catheter technique, and the expression of the type B natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene was measured. The animals underwent 90 min of right ventricular ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. A barbiturate-anesthetized group was included as a control. RESULTS: Cardiac output was compromised in unprotected animals during ischemia by 33 +/- 18 % and during reperfusion by 53 +/- 17 %. This was mainly due to impaired contractility in the left ventricle (LV) and increased stiffness. Isoflurane attenuated the increase in stiffness and resulted in a higher preload. In contrast, xenon increased the right ventricular afterload, which was compensated by an increase in contractility. Its effects on diastolic function were less pronounced. Upregulation of BNP mRNA expression was impeded in the remote area of the LV by both isoflurane and xenon. CONCLUSIONS: Xenon and isoflurane demonstrated equipotent effects in preventing the hemodynamic compromise that is induced by right ventricular ischemia and reperfusion, although they acted through somewhat differential inotropic and vasodilatory effects...|$|R

Rats received either the anesthetic gas xenon, the volatile anesthetic isoflurane or as positive control ischemic preconditioning (IPC) during three 5 -min periods before 25 -min ischemia.

To investigate the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) and p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), rats were pretreated with the PKC inhibitor calphostin C (0. 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) or the p 38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1). Additional hearts were excised for Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Infarct size was reduced from 50. 9 ± 16. 7 % in controls to 28. 1 ± 10. 3 % in xenon, 28. 6 ± 9. 9 % in isoflurane and to 28. 5 ± 5. 4 % in IPC hearts. Both, calphostin C and SB 203580, abolished the observed cardioprotection after xenon and isoflurane administration but not after IPC. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot assay revealed an increased phosphorylation and translocation of PKC-ɛ in xenon treated hearts. This effect could be blocked by calphostin C but not by SB 203580. Moreover, the phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK was induced by <b>xenon</b> and this <b>effect</b> was blocked by calphostin C.

We studied the haemodynamic changes caused by 70 % xenon in rabbits with chronically compromised left ventricular (LV) function. METHODS: Anaesthetized rabbits were thoracotomized and a major coronary artery was ligated to induce ischaemic heart disease. Nine weeks later, rabbits were again anaesthetized (ketamine/propofol), and haemodynamics were measured during inhalation of 70 % xenon using echocardiography [LV end-diastolic dimension (LVedD), fractional shortening (FS), velocity of circumferential fibre shortening (VcF), ejection fraction (EF) ] in closed-chest animals. Subsequently, rabbits were thoracotomized and instrumented for measurement of LV pressure (tip manometer), LV dP/dtmax and cardiac output (ultrasonic flow probe). Haemodynamics were recorded again during inhalation of 70 % xenon. RESULTS: All rabbits had compromised LV function 9 weeks after coronary artery ligation. Mean LVedD increased from 12. 9 (SD 0. 9) mm to 17. 1 (0. 4) mm; EF decreased from 73 (9) to 64 (8) %; FS decreased from 36 (7) to 29 (5) %; VcF decreased from 28. 9 (6. 8) to 17. 6 (4. 7) mm s(- 1); all P < 0. 05.

40|$|A conductor-dielectric {{junction}} {{exposed to}} the space environment is a frequent spacecraft design feature. Due to spacecraft charging and/or solar array operation, the conductor can acquire a high potential {{with respect to the}} surrounding plasma. If this potential is positive the insulators adjacent to exposed conductors can collect current as if they were conductors themselves. This phenomenon, called snapover, results in a substantial increase in current collection, and may even result in a glow discharge if the potential is high enough. If a conductor has a negative potential, arcing can occur at the site of a junction. Both of these phenomena negatively affect spacecraft operation. To prevent negative consequences, the physical mechanisms of snapover and arc inception require investigation.

In this process, zinc acetate dehydrate [Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 [*]·[*]H 2 O] was first dissolved into the ethanol solution along with monoethanolamine (MEA). A homogeneous transparent solution with a concentration of 0.2  M zinc acetate and a 1 : 1 molar ratio of MEA/zinc acetate dehydrate was prepared. This solution was kept for hydrolysis for 48  h and spin coated onto the PS substrate seven times to get the desired film thickness. In order to study the stability and the good quality of ZnO, thin films were deposited on a Corning glass substrate (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) and the transmittance measurements were taken with a PerkinElmer UV-Vis-NIR (Lambda 950) spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). To study the effect of annealing on the morphology of the ZnO film, samples were annealed in air atmosphere at 700 °C for 30  min inside a tubular furnace. The orientation and crystallinity of the ZnO crystallites were measured by an X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrometer (X'Pert PRO, PANalytical B.V., Almelo, The Netherlands) using CuKα radiation having a wavelength of 1.54  Å. The morphological effect of ZnO thin films with annealing was analyzed with a scanning electron microscope. The PL {{studies were carried out}} using a Varian fluorescence spectrometer (Cary Eclipse, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) under 3.8 -eV excitation of a <b>xenon</b> lamp. The <b>effect</b> of the PS substrate on the electrical properties of the device (ZnO-PS) was studied by the acquisition of current-voltage curves applying DC voltage in a cyclic scan (from − 10 to 10  V) at room temperature. Contacts were made of conductive carbon in two different configurations: lateral and transversal. A reference sample was fabricated and characterized by depositing ZnO on crystalline silicon.|$|R
