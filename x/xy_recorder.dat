40|$|Acquiring of the {{experimental}} data from PA- 3 polarographic analyser and their treatment by personal computer was performed using commercially available AD/DA converter and a software developed on basic of Visual Basic 3. 0 developing environment. Only minimal hardware arrangements to PA- 3 are necessary when requiring no special technical skill. Analyser's output to <b>XY</b> <b>recorder</b> {{is connected to the}} input of AD/DA converter and digitised data are transferred to the computer using its serial port. Further processing of the data is handled by software "Polarograf" whif is able to acquire, plot and manage experimental data and capable of exporting them in a readable form for Excel or other software. Functionality of the system was verified using several model voltammetric systems measured with carbon paste electrodes. The same principle of interfacing can be applied with only small changes practically to all analogue electroanalytical instrumentation...|$|E
40|$|The development, fabrication, and {{application}} of a magnetometer are described. The magnetometer has a miniature transducer and is capable of automatic scanning. The magnetometer described here is capable of detecting static magnetic fields as low as 1. 6 A/m and its transducer has an active area 0. 64 mm by 0. 76 mm. Thin and rugged, the transducer uses wire, 0. 05 mm in diameter, which is plated with a magnetic film, enabling measurement of transverse magnetic fields as close as 0. 08 mm from a surface. The magnetometer, which is simple to operate and has a fast response, uses an inexpensive clip-on milliammeter (commonly found in most laboratories) for driving and processing the electrical signals and readout. A specially designed transducer holding mechanism replaces the <b>XY</b> <b>recorder</b> ink pen; this mechanism provides the basis for an automatic scanning technique. The instrument {{has been applied to}} the measurements of magnetic fields arising from remanent magnetization in experimental plated-wire memory planes and regions of magnetic activity in geological rock specimens...|$|E
50|$|Formerly {{known as}} Chart. The {{software}} functions like a traditional multi-channel chart <b>recorder,</b> <b>XY</b> plotter, polygraph and digital voltmeter. It {{is compatible with}} both Windows and Macintosh operating systems. The software has hardware settings control, performs analysis in real-time and offline without the loss of raw data, procedure automation via editable macros, and multiple block samplings for the recording and settings of different signals within one file. Large specialised add-ons called Modules provide data acquisition and analysis features for specific applications such as ECG, blood pressure, cardiac output, HRV etc. Smaller software plugins provide additional and specialized functionality to LabChart. Extensions perform functions such as file translations into other formats (including PVAN and Igor Pro) and specialist analysis functions (for specific research areas such as spirometry and ventricular pressure). The last version of LabChart6 (version 6.1.3) was released on January 2009.|$|R
