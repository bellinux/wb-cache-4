5|$|All cacti {{have some}} adaptations to promote {{efficient}} water use. Most cacti—opuntias and cactoids—specialize in surviving in hot and dry environments (i.e. they are <b>xerophytes),</b> {{but the first}} ancestors of modern cacti were already adapted to periods of intermittent drought. A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become adapted to life as climbers or epiphytes, often in tropical forests, where water conservation is less important.|$|E
5|$|The Cucurbita digitata, C.foetidissima, C.galeotti, and C.pedatifolia species {{groups are}} <b>xerophytes,</b> arid zone {{perennials}} with storage roots; the remainder, including the five domesticated species, are all mesophytic annuals or short-life perennials with no storage roots. The five domesticated species are mostly isolated {{from each other}} by sterility barriers and have different physiological characteristics. Some cross pollinations can occur: C.pepo with C.argyrosperma and C.moschata; and C.maxima with C.moschata. Cross pollination does occur readily within the family Cucurbitaceae. The buffalo gourd (C.foetidissima), which does not taste good, {{has been used as}} an intermediary as it can be crossed with all the common Cucurbita.|$|E

25|$|The Huntington Desert Garden {{is part of}} The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California. The Desert Garden {{is one of the}} world's {{largest and}} oldest {{collections}} of cacti, succulents and other desert plants, collected from throughout the world. It contains plants from extreme environments, many of which were acquired by Henry E. Huntington and William Hertrich (the first garden curator) in trips taken to several countries in North, Central and South America. One of the Huntington’s most botanically important gardens, the Desert Garden brought together a group of plants largely unknown and unappreciated {{in the beginning of the}} 1900s. Containing a broad category of <b>xerophytes</b> (aridity-adapted plants), the Desert Garden grew to preeminence and remains today among the world’s finest, with more than 5,000 species in the 10 acre (4 ha) garden.|$|E
25|$|The main {{water source}} for {{terrestrial}} plants is soil water, which largely resembles the hydrogen isotope composition of rain water, but varies between environments and with enrichment by precipitation, depletion by evaporation, and exchange with atmospheric water vapor. There {{can be a}} significant offset between the δD value of source water and the δD value of leaf water {{at the site of}} lipid biosynthesis. No fractionation is associated with water uptake by roots, a process usually driven by capillary tension, with the one exception of <b>xerophytes</b> that burn ATP to pump water in extremely arid environments (with a roughly 10‰ depletion). However, leaf water can be substantially enriched relative to soil water due to transpiration, an evaporative process which is influenced by temperature, humidity, and the composition of surrounding water vapor. The leaf water hydrogen isotope composition can be described with a modified Craig-Gordon model, where ΔDe is the steady state enrichment of leaf water, εeq is the temperature-dependent equilibrium fractionation between liquid water and vapor, εk is the kinetic isotope effect from diffusion between leaf internal air space and the atmosphere, ΔDv is the leaf/air disequilibrium, ea is atmospheric vapor pressure, and ei is internal leaf vapor pressure.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} the North-West University Botanical Garden dates back to 1962 when dr. Wynand Louw, a botany lecturer, {{requested}} land from the then Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education {{for the establishment of}} a garden to grow plant material needed for formal practical laboratory sessions in botany. The garden was referred to as the Veld Garden during this initial period. The impetus to develop a proper botanical garden did however not start until 1971 with the arrival of prof. Daan Botha, a plant systematics lecturer. Curation of the Garden started in 1973 when mr. Bert Ubbink was appointed as curator. He was responsible for the initial design of the garden and also oversaw the layout of pathways, the construction of the office building, ponds as well as the rocky ridge and waterfall. The plant collections of the Botanical Garden also quickly expanded and two greenhouses were built to house the frost tender succulents and <b>xerophytes</b> as well as tropical and subtropical plants. In 1982 the Botanical Garden was officially opened to the public. Past curators include mr. Bert Ubbink (1973-2003), mr. Peter Mortimer (2003-2007), mr. Martin Smit (2007-2011) and mr. Chris van Niekerk (2012- [...] ).|$|E
5000|$|Xerophyte - A {{plant that}} {{is able to}} grow where the water supply is small. <b>Xerophytes</b> are plants {{that are able to}} control the loss of water from their aërial parts. <b>Xerophytes</b> employ many {{different}} tools to control the loss of water, such as; waxy deposits, varnish, or mineral crusts on the epidermis; reduction of air spaces; storage organs; thick-walled epidermis; and cork in woody plants. Some <b>xerophytes</b> are annual plants that grow quickly during the rainy season.|$|E

50|$|The carob genus, Ceratonia, {{belongs to}} the Fabaceae (legume) family, and is {{believed}} to be an archaic remnant of a part of this family now generally considered extinct.

Milfoil is usually surrounded by numerous ant hills. Ants are vitally tied to this {{as well as other}} sand species.

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to {{characterize}} and categorize some selected vascular species in the Ny-Alesund area, Svalbard, in relation to soil moisture conditions. A total of sixty releves were established to describe the floristic structures of plant communities. At each releve site, one soil core sample in a 100 ml metal container was collected to determine soil physical properties. Samples were oven-dried for 48 hours at 105 ℃. Moisture content was measured and soil moisture index was calculated for each releve. Based on the index, sixty releves were divided into five soil moisture classes. Throughout the sixty releves, twenty-five species of vascular plants were recognized. Of them, eleven species were selected for this study. They were Salix polaris, Oxyria digyna, Polygonum viviparum, Cerastium arcticum, C. regelii, Saxifraga caespitosa, S. cernua, S. nivalis, S. oppositifolia, Dryas octopetala, and Cassiope tetragona. These were the species that occurred in more than eleven releves out of the sixty. Their frequencies against the soil moisture classes were counted. Ecological distribution curves were constructed for the species. From the distribution pattern, especially the amplitude and the mode position on the moisture classes, the species were classified into six categories as follows, i. e., euryhygrotopic <b>xerophyte,</b> euryhygrotopic mesophyte, euryhygrotopic hygrophyte, stenohygrotopic <b>xerophyte,</b> stenohygrotopic mesophyte, and stenohygrotopic hygrophyte...|$|R
