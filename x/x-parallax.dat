For example, {{in the field of}} computer vision technology, many dense stereo matching algorithms [13] are implemented to compute depth values from <b>x-parallax</b> disparity.|$|E
30|$|The {{proportionality}} of the <b>x-parallax</b> disparity {{and ground}} height {{can also be}} validated by area-based stereo matching algorithm described in the previous section. The <b>x-parallax</b> disparity between the conjugate image points from resampled epipolar image pair and the ground heights of the corresponding ground points, which can be calculated by the newly generated RPCs, are investigated the proportionality between them.

30|$|The {{proposed}} method will {{be practical}} and useful in generating stereo image pairs {{for the many}} applications that employ dense matching algorithms [13], because the proposed method efficiently yields constraints on the search space, with near zero y-parallax and the <b>x-parallax</b> bounded by the minimum and maximum heights using any type of sensor models.|$|E
40|$|A {{photographic}} stereopair of the Metric Camera (MC) {{and another}} one of the Large Format Camera (LFC) covering parts of the Red Sea Hills in Sudan were evaluated for height accuracy using the parallax bar heighting technique. <b>X-parallaxes</b> of a number of points on the two stereo models were measured and used to compute the crude heights of the points. Corrections to the crude heights were then computed using different mathematical algorithms and a set of well-defined control points. Discrepancies between corrected (computed) heights and known heights of another set of points were used to compute the root-mean-square errors of height measurement. The results show that Shepard's interpolation or a higher degree polynomial can produce height errors of the order of :t 53 m. This error value may serve a useful purpose in some basic thematic applications where high height accuracies are not of paramount importance...|$|R
40|$|The {{geometric}} {{resolution of}} very high resolution optical space sensors like IKONOS, QuickBird and OrbView- 3 allows the generation of detailed digital surface models also in build up areas. This {{may be used as}} base for a 3 D-city model. As result of automatic image matching the height value of the building top show the form of the houses within the spacing of the height models well, but in most cases the neighboured points on the ground have some distance from the building caused by viewing shadows. The size of the used sub-matrix for image matching also will lead to some rounding of the edges caused {{by the fact that the}} pixels partially are located on top of the buildings and partially on the ground or even the wall. IKONOS, QuickBird, OrbView- 3 and Cartosat- 1 stereo pairs have been used for the generation of digital surface models in city areas. By simple theory the height accuracy is linear depending upon the height-to-base-ratio. This is the case for open and flat areas as well as for manual measurement, but not for image matching in cities. With a small height-to-base-relation (close to 1 : 1) only a limited number of points can be determined on the ground, degrading the overall information contents. In city areas it has been shown that a smaller convergence angle has some advantages and is not linear influencing the vertical accuracy- for a small convergence angle of the space images the standard deviation of the <b>x-parallaxes</b> is still better. Of course the mentioned problems are not the sam...|$|R
40|$|The usual {{satellite}} image orientation {{is based on}} bias corrected rational polynomial coefficients (RPC). The RPC are describing the direct sensor orientation of the {{satellite image}}s. The locations of the projection centres today are without problems, but an accuracy limit {{is caused by the}} attitudes. Very high resolution satellites today are very agile, able to change the pointed area over 200 km within 10 to 11 seconds. The corresponding fast attitude acceleration of the satellite may cause a jitter which cannot be expressed by the third order RPC, even if it is recorded by the gyros. Only a correction of the image geometry may help, but usually this will not be done. The first indication of jitter problems is shown by systematic errors of the y-parallaxes (py) for the intersection of corresponding points during the computation of ground coordinates. These y-parallaxes have a limited influence to the ground coordinates, but similar problems can be expected for the <b>x-parallaxes,</b> determining directly the object height. Systematic y-parallaxes are shown for Ziyuan- 3 (ZY 3), WorldView- 2 (WV 2), Pleiades, Cartosat- 1, IKONOS and GeoEye. Some of them have clear jitter effects. In addition linear trends of py can be seen. Linear trends in py and tilts in of computed height models may be caused by limited accuracy of the attitude registration, but also by bias correction with affinity transformation. The bias correction is based on ground control points (GCPs). The accuracy of the GCPs usually does not cause some limitations but the identification of the GCPs in the images may be difficult. With 2 -dimensional bias corrected RPC-orientation by affinity transformation tilts of the generated height models may be caused, but due to large affine image deformations some satellites, as Cartosat- 1, have to be handled with bias correction by affinity transformation. Instead of a 2 -dimensional RPC-orientation also a 3 -dimensional orientation is possible, respecting the object height more as by 2 -dimensional orientation. The 3 -dimensional orientation showed advantages for orientation based on a limited number of GCPs, but in case of poor GCP distribution it may cause also negative effects. For some of the used satellites the bias correction by affinity transformation showed advantages, but for some other the bias correction by shift was leading to a better levelling of the generated height models, even if the root mean square (RMS) differences at the GCPs were larger as for bias correction by affinity transformation. The generated height models can be analyzed and corrected with reference height models. For the used data sets accurate reference height models are available, but an analysis and correction with the free of charge available SRTM digital surface model (DSM) or ALOS World 3 D (AW 3 D 30) is also possible and leads to similar results. The comparison of the generated height models with the reference DSM shows some height undulations, but the major accuracy influence is caused by tilts of the height models. Some height model undulations reach up to 50 % of the ground sampling distance (GSD), this is not negligible but it cannot be seen not so much at the standard deviations of the height. In any case an improvement of the generated height models is possible with reference height models. If such corrections are applied it compensates possible negative effects of the type of bias correction or 2 -dimensional orientations against 3 -dimensional handling...|$|R

30|$|As {{stated in}} the introduction, we suggest four {{performance}} evaluation criteria for piecewise epipolar resampling algorithms: geo-positioning accuracy, pixel scale and perpendicularity of axis in object space, near zero y-parallax in epipolar image space, and proportionality between <b>x-parallax</b> disparity and ground height. The third and the fourth criteria have already been mentioned in several previous studies [3, 4, 7, 8].|$|E
30|$|Computational stereo is in {{the fields}} of {{computer}} vision and photogrammetry. In the computational stereo and surface reconstruction paradigms, {{it is very important to}} achieve appropriate epipolar constraints during the camera-modeling step of the stereo image processing. It has been shown that the epipolar geometry of linear pushbroom imagery has a hyperbola-like shape because of the non-coplanarity of the line of sight vectors. Several studies have been conducted to generate resampled epipolar image pairs from linear pushbroom satellites images; however, the currently prevailing methods are limited by their pixel scales, skewed axis angles, or disproportionality between <b>x-parallax</b> disparities and height. In this paper, a practical and unified piecewise epipolar resampling method is proposed to generate stereo image pairs with zero y-parallax, a square pixel scale, and proportionality between <b>x-parallax</b> disparity and height. Furthermore, four criteria are suggested for performance evaluations of the prevailing methods, and experimental results of the method are presented based on the suggested criteria. The proposed method is shown to be equal to or an improvement upon the prevailing methods.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{we suggest}} four {{performance}} evaluation criteria for epipolar resampling algorithms: (1) geo-positioning {{accuracy of the}} resampled epipolar images relative to the original sensor model, (2) square pixel scale and perpendicularity of axis in object space, (3) near zero y-parallax in epipolar image space, and (4) proportionality between the disparity in the <b>x-parallax</b> and the ground height. Using these criteria, performance evaluations of the previously suggested algorithms and the algorithm proposed in this paper are presented based on experimental data from satellite images, including optical images such as those from IKONOS, Pleiades, and WorldView, as well as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images as those from KOMPSAT- 5 and TerraSAR-X.|$|E
30|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to establish the epipolar geometry of the pushbroom camera to achieve effective epipolar image resampling. For example, Oh et al. [3] proposed a piecewise approach to this problem with rational polynomial coefficient (RPC); this is an image space-based approach and was shown to achieve almost zero y-parallax, as well as a linear relationship between the <b>x-parallax</b> and the ground height. Alternatively, Wang et al. [4] suggest a method that implements a new epipolarity model based on the projection reference plane (PRP); this is an object space-based approach, and experimental results showed that the vertical parallaxes all attained sub-pixel levels in along-track and cross-track stereo images from actual equipment, including Earth observation satellites SPOT- 5, IKONOS, IRS-P 5, and QuickBird.|$|E
40|$|By the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) {{a nearly}} world wide height {{model has been}} generated, which is {{available}} free of charge. The mayor limitation of this height model is the point spacing of 3 arcsec, corresponding to approximately 92 m at the equator. From the very high resolution space sensors like IKONOS, QuickBird and OrbView- 3 {{only a limited number}} of stereo combinations, taken from the same orbit, are available. The stereo scenes from SPOT- 5 HRS are not commercially distributed. With Cartosat- 1 and ALOS/PRISM new satellite stereo sensors are available having 2. 5 m ground sampling distance (GSD). The very short difference in time for imaging both scenes of a stereo model guarantees optimal conditions for matching. In the frame of the ISPRS-ISRO Cartosat- 1 Scientific Assessment Programme (C-SAP) the orientation of 3 stereo scenes has been computed by bias corrected, sensor oriented RPC-solution. The generation of digital elevation models (DEMs) followed by least squares matching. An analysis of the DEMs against reference DEMs showed sub-pixel accuracy of the height values as <b>x-parallax.</b> By automatic image matching digital surface models (DSM), showing the visible surface like buildings and vegetation, are generated. By filtering the DSMs have been changed into DEMs, including mainly the points on the bare ground, if enough points are still located on the bare ground. After filtering for open and flat terrain a standard deviation of the generated DEM in relation to a reference DEM of up to 2. 4 m has been reached. This corresponds to a standard deviation of 0. 7 GSD for the <b>x-parallax.</b> The 2. 5 m GSD justifies a point spacing of 7. 5 m for the DEM. This accuracy and morphologic information contents is sufficient for most of the space application. Of course the automatic image matching fails if the object has no contrast like in the case of snow coverage, but nevertheless very qualified height models have been generated. 1...|$|E
30|$|This section {{describes}} a modified algorithm to perform piecewise epipolar resampling that ensures (1) {{preservation of the}} geo-positioning accuracy of the original sensor model in the resampled epipolar images, (2) scales with equidistant pixels and perpendicularity of the axis, (3) near zero y-parallax, and (4) proportionality between the disparity in the <b>x-parallax</b> and the ground height. The proposed algorithm is a unified one {{because it can be}} applied to both along-track and cross-track stereo images and can also be applied to SAR stereo images for radargrammetry, as shown by experimental results reported in Section 5. The prevailing methods can also be applied to all of these types of stereo images, but the proposed one uses only the CSM [10] interface, stated in Section 3.2, {{so that it can be}} applied to all of stereo image pairs regardless of the sensor types, and furthermore, it shows better performance in terms of the four performance evaluation criteria.|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the 3 D models of the Earth surface based on stereoscopic image pairs depends on the {{accuracy of}} corresponding points located in both images. Area-based automatic image matching combined using a region-growing technique are able to provide a dense and accurate grid of corresponding points. However the region-growing process may stop at image patches where the <b>x-parallax</b> is suddenly changing. In such a case new seed points must be provided, usually by human operator. From the additional seed points the region-growing procedure may continue. Depending upon the type of image and the 3 D-structure of the mapped area, the human intervention may be considerable. A fully automatic alternative that combines scale invariant feature transform, least square matching and region-growing technique is presented. Experiments conducted on a stereo pair of IKONOS images covering different terrain types have shown {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method especially in locations with abrupt height changes, such as façades of high buildings...|$|E
40|$|DSMs are a {{geometric}} {{description of the}} height of the visible terrain surface, including elements like buildings and trees. DSMs became an important source for scene analysis and for 3 D feature detection and reconstruction. The digital metric camera (DMC) offers excellent image quality and can be used for automated DSM generation, with high accuracy. By using least squares matching as method to find corresponding points in two overlapping images for three dimensional reconstructions, the corresponding points potentially can be determined with sub-pixel accuracy. The investigation of the influence of different parameters on generating DSMs from DMC images is shown like the limitation of automatic DSM generation in urban areas. The aim of our investigation is, whether the selected parameters for image matching, optimized in few test areas, can be used for the whole study area. The generated DSM was checked against a reference DSM based on manual measurement. The comparison shows that the accuracy mainly depends on terrain slope and surface structure. Furthermore, satisfying DSMs strongly depend upon the quality of the DMCimages. A standard deviation of the DSM based on DMC-images in whole urban study area of 1. 0 up to 1. 3 GSD is possible, corresponding to 0. 3 up to 0. 4 GSD for the <b>x-parallax.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Linear array {{scanners}} {{are used}} as a substitute of two-dimensional/frame digital cameras since they can produce high-resolution digital images comparable to scanned aerial photographs. On the other hand, digital frame cameras have inadequate size that is dictated by technical considerations/limitations. In general, rigorous sensor modelling involves {{the description of the}} physical process of data capture using such a sensor. For imaging systems, rigorous modelling incorporates the system’s interior and exterior orientation parameters. Such parameters might not be always available for linear array scanners (e. g., commercially available IKONOS scenes). Deriving these parameters requires numerous ground control points. Moreover, the estimation process is geometrically ill posed due to the narrow angular field of view of the imaging system. Recently, parallel projection has emerged as an approximate model (for high altitude scanners with narrow angular field of view) {{that can be used to}} represent the mathematical relationship between scene and object space coordinates using few parameters. This paper outlines the derivation of resampling approach of linear array scanner scenes according to epipolar geometry. Conjugate points should have no y-parallax in the resampled scenes. Moreover, they should have an <b>x-parallax</b> that is linearly proportional to the corresponding object height. Such requirements can only be met by projecting the original scenes into a common horizontal plane. The paper explains the selection of such plane to meet these specifications. Experimental results using IKONOS data demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. 1...|$|E
40|$|The HRS (high {{resolution}} stereo) is {{an autonomous}} imaging system on SPOT 5. It {{has been designed}} especially for the generation of digital elevation models (DEMs). The combination of a forward and a backward view do allow a stereoscopic imaging with a height to base relation of 1. 2 and just 90 seconds time interval. Some images, which are usually not accessible and used only by SPOT Image for the generation of DEMs, have been made available for the SPOT HRS study team. The test area Bavaria has been analysed. Just based on the known view direction, the orientation of a HRS stereo pair has been adjusted with the Hannover program BLASPO. The mean square Z-discrepancies at the control points of 3. 9 m corresponds to an <b>x-parallax</b> of 0. 6 pixels, a realistic value for points located in areas with sufficient contrast. Depending upon the area, between 80 % and 90 % of the points could be matched successful by a least squares method. The determined ground points do describe a digital surface model (DSM) and not the requested DEM. Points located not on the solid ground have to be removed. For the 17 million points of one HRS stereo pair this can be made only by an automatic process. The Hannover program RASCOR removed approximately 35 % of the DSM points. Nevertheless in dense forest areas several points still may be located not on the ground. Corresponding to this, in the forest areas a height shift against the reference data could be seen. But also the relative accuracy in the forest is not so good like in the open areas caused by limited contrast and the not visible ground. In the open areas a vertical accuracy {{in the range of}} 5 m and a little better has been reached with a slight dependence upon the tangent of the slope. 1...|$|E
