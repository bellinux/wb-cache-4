40|$|We suggest optical {{schemes for}} the European X ray Free Electron Laser {{facility}} XFEL. EU in Hamburg a single element <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> {{on the basis}} of a reflection zone plate RZP for single shot diagnostics; and a two element soft <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> {{on the basis of}} two RZPs to carry out Resonant Inelastic X ray Scattering RIXS experiments. With this setup, a full map of the sample spectrum is obtainable in a single measurement. The main advantage of using zone plates is the possibility to enable dispersion and focusing in one step. Moreover, highest possible X ray transmission is achieved by using the minimum number of optical elements. Taking into account the European XFEL beam parameters, our simulations, concerning the RIXS experiment, produced very promising results, reaching an energy resolution E amp; 916;E of up to 30, 000 at photon energy of 1 keV. When applied as a single shot spectrometer the energy resolution for RZP is of the same order of magnitud...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{synchrotron}} endstation with a flow through liquid cell designed {{to study the}} electronic structure of liquids using soft x ray spectroscopies. In this cell, the liquid under study is separated from the vacuum by a thin window membrane, such that the sample liquid can be investigated at ambient pressure. The temperature of the probing volume can be varied in a broad range and with a fast temperature response. The optimized design of the cell significantly reduces the amount of required sample liquid and allows the use of different window membrane types necessary to cover a broad energy range. The liquid cell is integrated into the solid and liquid spectroscopic analysis SALSA endstation that includes a high resolution, high transmission <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> and {{a state of the}} art electron analyzer.

40|$|During {{the past}} 13 years high {{resolution}} <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometers</b> {{have been developed}} that use cryogenically cooled microcalorimeters. These devices have inherently high signal-to-noise by operating at temperatures below 0. 1 K and can achieve an energy resolution of < 10 eV over the 0. 1 - 10 keV band. Existing devices use doped semiconductor thermometers and typically employ HgTe absorbers. The energy resolution depends on achieving a low heat capacity for the device. For soft <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> applications a relatively thin absorber (approximately 1 micrometer) may be used and an energy resolution of approximately 7 eV has been achieved. For applications up to approximately 10 keV an absorber thickness of approximately 10 micrometer is required and the energy resolution is typically approximately 12 eV. Improvements to the energy resolution in this energy band could be achieved if the problems of thermalizing <b>X</b> <b>rays</b> in low heat capacity superconductors can be overcome. The recent work on transition edge thermometers by Irwin et nl. looks particularly promising because of the higher sensitivity achievable from a sharp superconducting transition. The relatively low impedance of such a device permits {{the use of a}} low noise SQUID amplifier for readout. This would also significantly reduce the cryogen heat load compared with JFETs required by higher impedance semiconductor thermometers...|$|R
40|$|We present {{relative}} elemental abundances for six elements (Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Fe) in {{the surface}} layer of 433 Eros, derived from a new analysis of the solar induced fluorescence measured by the NEARShoemaker <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (XRS). XRS derived elemental abundances have been presented before. However, calibration of XRS data depends critically on knowledge of the incident solar spectrum, which varies greatly on time scales of seconds to minutes. Unfortunately, the gas solar monitor carried by NEAR was inadequately calibrated prior to launch. The previously published XRS results were based partly on broadband measurements by the Earthorbiting GOES 8 (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) Xray detectors and partly on a preliminary solar monitor calibration {{carried out by the}} present authors. The new solar monitor calibration is based on a more recent set of physical models of the solar spectrum at various temperatures, an improved fitting procedure, analysis {{of a large number of}} flight spectra, and comparison with concurrent data from the GOES Xray detectors. In addition, the new analysis includes data from three solar flares not considered in earlier papers...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{distribution}} of chemical elements among the carious and normal enamel layers on teenagers, using energy dispersive <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> (EDS Rx). Materials and Methods: The EDS Rx analyzer is integrated to scanner electron microscope. The macro and mi-croelements were made in 30 premolars of teenager: 14 carious enamel layers and 16 normal enamel layers.

40|$|Because {{the alpha}} proton <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> (APXS) sensor {{head on the}} Mars Pathfinder rover, Sojourner, is placed on Martian soil by the {{deployment}} mechanism (ADM), the rover would be crippled if the actuator fails when the mechanism is in its deployed position, as rover ground clearance is then reduced to zero. This paper describes the unique fail-safe mounted on the ADM, especially {{the use of a}} low-temperature-melting alloy as a coupler device. The final form of the design is a low-melting-point metal pellet coupler, made from Cerrobend, in parallel with a Negator spring pack. In its solid state, the metal rigidly connects the driver (the actuator) and the driven part (the mechanism). When commanded, a strip heater wrapped around the coupler melts the metal pellet (at 60 (deg) C), allowing the driven part to turn independent of the driver. The Negator spring retracts the mechanism to its fully stowed position. This concept meets all the design criteria, and provides an added benefit. When the metal hardens the coupler once again rigidly connects the actuator and the mechanism. The concept presented here can easily be applied to other applications. Anywhere release devices are needed, low-melting-point couplers can be considered. The issues to be concerned with are thermal isolation, proper setting of the parts before actuation, and possible outgassing concerns. However, when these issues are overcome, the resulting release mechanism can promise to be the most light, simple, power conserving alternative available...|$|E

40|$|Mars Pathfinder, one of {{the first}} Discovery-class {{missions}} (quick, low-cost projects with focused science objectives), will land a single spacecraft with a microrover and several instruments on the surface of Mars in 1997. Pathfinder will be the first mission to use a rover, carrying a chemical analysis instrument, to characterize the rocks and soils in a landing area over hundreds of square meters on Mars, which will provide a calibration point or "ground truth" for orbital remote sensing observations. In addition to the rover, which also performs a number of technology experiments, Pathfinder carries three science instruments: a stereoscopic imager with spectral filters on an extendable mast, an alpha proton <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer,</b> and an atmospheric structure instrument/meteorology package. The instruments, the rover technology experiments, and the telemetry system will allow investigations of the surface morphology and geology at submeter to a hundred meters scale, the petrology and geochemistry of rocks and soils, the magnetic properties of dust, soil mechanics and properties, a variety of atmospheric investigations, and the rotational and orbital dynamics of Mars. Landing downstream from the mouth of a giant catastrophic outflow channel, Ares Vallis at 19. 5 deg N, 32. 8 deg W, offers the potential of identifying and analyzing a wide variety of crustal materials, from the ancient heavily cratered terrain, intermediate-aged ridged plains, and reworked channel deposits, thus allowing first-order scientific investigations of the early differentiation and evolution of the crust, the development of weathering products, and tile early environments and conditions on Mars...|$|E
40|$|We {{test the}} {{effectiveness}} of using an alpha backscatter, alpha-proton, <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> on a remotely operated rover to analyze soils and provide geologically useful information about the Moon during a simulated mission to a hypothetical site resembling the Apollo 17 landing site. On the mission, 100 soil samples are "analyzed" for major elements at moderate analytical precision (e. g., typical relative sample standard deviation from counting statistics: Si[11 %], Al[18 %], Fe[6 %], Mg[20 %], Ca[5 %]). Simulated compositions of soils are generated by combining compositions of components representing the major lithologies occurring at the site in known proportions. Simulated analyses are generated by degrading the simulated compositions according to the expected analytical precision of the analyzer. Compositions obtained from the simulated analyses are modeled by least squares mass balance as mixtures of the components, and the relative proportions of those components as predicted by the model are compared with the actual proportions used to generate the simulated composition. Boundary conditions of the modeling exercise are that all important lithologic components of the regolith are known and are represented by model components, and that the compositions of these components are well known. The effect of having the capability of determining one incompatible element at moderate precision (25 %) is compared with {{the effect of the}} lack of this capability. We discuss likely limitations and ambiguities that would be encountered, but conclude that much of our knowledge about the Apollo 17 site (based on the return samples) regarding the distribution and relative abundances of lithologies in the regolith could be obtained. This success requires, however, that at least one incompatible element be determined...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of aerosol number {{concentrations}} {{and direct}} aerosol sampling {{were conducted on}} continental Antarctica during the traverse of the Japanese–Swedish joint Antarctic expedition (JASE) from 14 November 2007 until 24 January 2008. Aerosol concentrations in background conditions decreased gradually with latitude in inland regions during the traverse. The lowest aerosol number concentrations were 160 L − 1 in D p > 0. 3 μm, and 0. 5 L − 1 in D p 2 μm. In contrast, aerosol concentrations reached 3278 L − 1 in D p > 0. 3 μm, and 215 L − 1 in D p > 2 μm under strong wind conditions. The estimated aerosol mass concentrations were 0. 04 – 5. 7 μg m − 3. Single particle analysis of aerosol particles collected during the JASE traverse was conducted using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> Major aerosol constituents were sulfates in fine mode, and sulfate, sea salts, modified sea salts, and fractionated sea salts in coarse mode. K-rich sulfates, Mg-rich sulfate, Ca-rich sulfates, and minerals were identified as minor aerosol constituents. Horizontal features of Cl / Na ratios imply that sea-salt modification (i. e. Cl loss) occurred on the Antarctic continent during the summer. Most sea-salt particles in the continental region near the coast were modified with acidic sulfur species such as H 2 SO 4 and CH 3 SO 3 H. By contrast, acidic species other than the acidic sulfur species (likely HNO 3) contributed markedly to sea-salt modification in inland areas during the traverse. Mg-rich sea-salt particles and Mg-free sea-salt particles were present in coarse and fine modes from the coast to inland areas. These sea-salt particles might be associated with sea-salt fractionation on the snow surface of continental Antarctica...|$|E

40|$|The {{plasma physics}} {{group at the}} Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) studies the {{interaction}} of accelerated heavy ions with dense laser created plasmas with special focus on the energy loss of the ions. Thus experimental characterization of the laser plasmas becomes important, and despite the increased quantity of analytical models and simulations, it still is an active area of research. In experiments made at GSI and other laboratories, the presence of ions with MeV kinetic energies has been found from laser created plasmas with medium laser fluxes of 1011 - 1012 W/cm 2. They were found through measurement of the doppler shift of spectral lines in the <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> range. Experiments performed to establish the conditions of this ion generation are presented here. Large jets of highly charged ions have been produced with the nhelix laser system, while their measured kinetic energies were not larger than 9 keV. The jet length has been measured and resulted to be 4 mm, detected with <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> pinhole cameras and spatially resolved <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometers.</b> Expansion properties of the quasi-static plasma during the laser pulse and the laser expansion have been compared. The comparison has been made with light emission recorded with a visible spectral range streak camera and an ultraviolet spectrometer from the expanding plasma and the <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> emission from the quasi-static state. The observed jet structure is created when the laser focus is at distances of 0. 5 to 1. 0 mm {{in front of the}} target surface. There is a laser flux threshold for jet generation in the order of 1012 W/cm 2, independently of other parameters. Changes in the laser beam angle incidence from normal to non normal lead to an increment of jet length. It is possible to extend these results to the targets suitable for ion beam-laser interaction experiments. The laser absorption in the planar laser-plasma interaction takes place near the critical density in a sheath of nanometers, while the targets have micrometers thickness. The creation of the highly charged ion jets will increase the interaction volume of the ion beam-laser created plasma thus providing a better tool for studying the ions` energy loss...|$|R

In about fifteen seconds, the <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> flux decreased to zero. The model for computing synthetic light curve, which is directly comparable to the observed curve, consists of two computing programs. One is a modified version of an existing code, which compute the coordinates of the tangent points of the SMM-sun lines. The other program computed the atmospheric densities along the angles (N to S and E to W) measured {{from the center of the}} sun. The various model also depends on the destination of the terrestrial atmosphere at geocentric positions of SMM and the sun, the mean atmospheric densities at different heights and latitudes, and the <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> absorption cross of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. The optical length, at a given time and for a <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> energy, is computed with the two angular parameters. The fit of a particular synthetic light, curve, i. e., the exponentials of the optical lengths, to the observed eclipse curve, yields the desired angular parameters...|$|R

However, this soft <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> technique has been rarely used at synchrotron facilities for mechanistic studies of metalloenzymes due to the difficulties of <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> induced sample damage and strong background signals from light elements that can dominate the low metal signal. Here, we combine femtosecond soft <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> pulses from a free electron laser with a novel <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> fluorescence yield <b>spectrometer</b> to overcome these difficulties. We present L edge absorption spectra of inorganic high valent Mn complexes Mn 6 15 mmol l with no visible effects of radiation damage. We also present the first L edge absorption spectra of the oxygen evolving complex Mn 4 CaO 5 in Photosystem II Mn lt; 1 mmol l at room temperature, measured under similar conditions. Our approach opens new ways to study metalloenzymes under functional condition...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{portable}} {{instruments in the}} archaeometric study of ancient artefacts mostly fulfilled in a non invasive manner has become a very common practise {{over the past few}} years. Among all the new instruments that are on the run the Field Portable Energy Dispersive <b>X</b> <b>Ray</b> Fluorescence (FPEDXRF) <b>spectrometers</b> proved the greatest speed up. In this paper we are going to show three cases in which multivariate statistics had the ability to provide an easier analysis of the big amount of data available to the researchers with {{the development of a new}} generation of Portable Systems applied to the study of Cultural Heritage...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{samples of}} the Martian {{regolith}} have been analyzed by the Viking lander <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> fluorescence <b>spectrometers.</b> Because of high-stability electronics, inclusion of calibration targets, and special data encoding within the instruments {{the quality of the}} analyses performed on Mars is closely equivalent to that attainable with the same instruments operated in the laboratory. Determination of absolute elemental concentrations requires gain drift adjustments, subtraction of background components, and use of a mathematical response model with adjustable parameters set by prelaunch measurements on selected rock standards. Bulk fines at both Viking landing sites are quite similar in composition, implying that a chemically and mineralogically homogeneous regolith covers much of the surface of the planet. Important differences between samples include a higher sulfur content in what appear to be duricrust fragments than in fines and a lower iron content in fines taken from beneath large rocks than those taken from unprotected surface material. Further extensive reduction of these data will allow more precise and more accurate analytical numbers to be determined and thus a more comprehensive understanding of elemental trends between samples...|$|R
40|$|Algorithms are {{presented}} which were created and {{implemented by the}} Goddard Space Flight Center's (GSFC's) Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) attitude operations team to support large-angle spacecraft pointing at scientific objectives. The mission objective of the post-repair SMM satellite was to study solar phenomena. However, because the scientific instruments, such as the Coronagraph/Polarimeter (CP) and the Hard <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> Burst <b>Spectrometer</b> (HXRBS), were able to view objects other than the Sun, attitude operations support for attitude pointing at large angles from the nominal solar-pointing attitudes was required. Subsequently, attitude support for SMM was provided for scientific objectives such as Comet Halley, Supernova 1987 A, Cygnus X- 1, and the Crab Nebula. In addition, the analysis was extended to include the reverse problem, computing the right ascension and declination of a body given the off-Sun angles. This analysis led to the computation of the orbits of seven new solar comets seen in the field-of-view (FOV) of the CP. The activities necessary to meet these large-angle attitude-pointing sequences, such as slew sequence planning, viewing-period prediction, and tracking-bias computation are described. Analysis is presented for the computation of maneuvers and pointing parameters relative to the SMM-unique, Sun-centered reference frame. Finally, science data and independent attitude solutions are {{used to evaluate the}} large-angle pointing performance...|$|R
