50|$|While kidneys can {{routinely}} {{be obtained}} from human donors, most organs {{are in short supply}} leading to consideration of <b>xenotransplants</b> from other species. Pigs are especially likely sources for <b>xenotransplants,</b> chosen for the anatomical and physiological characteristics they share with humans. However, the sugar galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (αGal) has been implicated as a major factor in hyperacute rejection in xenotransplantation. Unlike virtually all other mammals, humans and other primates do not make αGal, and in fact recognize it as an antigen. During transplantation, xenoreactive natural antibodies recognize αGal on the graft endothelium as an antigen, and the resulting complement-mediated immune response leads to a rejection of the transplant.|$|R
50|$|Different organ <b>xenotransplants</b> {{result in}} {{different}} responses in clotting. For example, kidney transplants {{result in a}} higher degree of coagulopathy, or impaired clotting, than cardiac transplants, whereas liver xenografts result in severe thrombocytopenia, causing recipient death within a few days due to bleeding. An alternate clotting disorder, thrombosis, may be initiated by preexisting antibodies that affect the protein C anticoagulant system. Due to this effect, porcine donors must be extensively screened before transplantation. Studies have also shown that some porcine transplant cells are able to induce human tissue factor expression, thus stimulating platelet and monocyte aggregation around the <b>xenotransplanted</b> organ, causing severe clotting. Additionally, spontaneous platelet accumulation may be caused by contact with pig von Willebrand factor.|$|R

To analyze the mechanisms of these interactions, a systemic fluorescent protein-expressing mouse is a useful recipient. In this study, we generated a novel NOG strain, which strongly expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP; PgkEGFP-NOG), especially in the liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and testis. Because the host tissues expressed EGFP, <b>xenotransplanted</b> human cancer cells were clearly identified as EGFP-negative colonies in PgkEGFP-NOG mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that EGFP-expressing stromal tissues formed a complicated tumor microenvironment within xenograft tissues.

40|$|Abstract Background Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) hold {{a promise}} for future {{cell-based}} therapies {{due to their}} immunomodulatory properties and/or secretory activity. Nevertheless non-neoplastic tumor compartment could also originate from MSC. We aimed to show whether multipotent MSC derived from human adipose tissue (AT-MSC) could create tumor cell-protective milieu and affect tumor cell behaviour in vitro and in vivo. Results Here we have demonstrated tumor-promoting effect of AT-MSC on human melanoma A 375 cells. AT-MSC coinjection mediated abrogation of tumor latency and supported subcutaneous <b>xenotransplant</b> growth from very low melanoma cell doses. Tumor incidence was also significantly increased by AT-MSC-derived soluble factors. AT-MSC supported proliferation, suppressed apoptosis and modulated melanoma cell responses to cytotoxic drugs in vitro. Expression and multiplex cytokine assays confirmed synergistic increase in VEGF {{that contributed to the}} AT-MSC-mediated support of A 375 <b>xenotransplant</b> growth. Production of G-CSF and other factors implicated in formation of supportive proinflammatory tumor cell microenvironment was also confirmed. SDF- 1 α/CXCR 4 signalling contributed to tumor-promoting effect of systemic AT-MSC administration on A 375 xenotransplants. However, no support was observed for human glioblastoma cells 8 MGBA co-injected along with AT-MSC that did not sustain tumor <b>xenotransplant</b> growth in vivo. Tumor-inhibiting response could be attributed to the synergistic action of multiple cytokines produced by AT-MSC on glioblastoma cells. Conclusions Herein we provide experimental evidence for MSC-mediated protective effect on melanoma A 375 cells under nutrient-limiting and hostile environmental conditions resulting from mutual crosstalk between neoplastic and non-malignant cells. This tumor-favouring effect was not observed for the glioblastoma cells 8 MGBA. Collectively, our data further strengthen the need for unravelling mechanisms underlying MSC-mediated modulation of tumor behaviour for possible future MSC clinical use in the context of malignant disease. </p...|$|E

All 52 patients with acute myeloidleukemia carrying at diagnosis mutated or cytoplasmic NPM (NPMc(+) acute myeloid leukemia) retained this feature at relapse.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} tumoral progression and drug resistance, cultured cell lines are valuable tools applied on tumor related assays provided {{they are well}} established and characterized. Our laboratory settled the NG 97 cell line derived from a human astrocytoma grade III, which started to develop and express important phenotypical characteristics of an astrocytoma grade IV after injection in the flank of nude mice. Astrocytomas are extremely aggressive malignancies of the Central Nervous System (CNS) and account for 46 % of all primary malignant brain tumors. Progression to worse prognosis occurs in 85 % of the cases possibly due to changes in cell tumor microenvironment and through biological pathways that are still unclear. Methods This work focused on characterizing the NG 97 cell line specifically after being recovered from the <b>xenotransplant,</b> who maintained their undifferentiated characteristics along the following 60 th passages in vitro. These cells were subcultivated to evaluate the possible contribution of these undifferentiated characteristics to the malignant progression phenotype. These characteristics were the expression of molecules involved in the processes of migration, dedifferentiation and chromosomal instability. Results Results showed that NG 97 (ht) had an decrease in doubling time through sub cultivation, which was characterized by a converse modulation between the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin. In addition, β 1 integrins were present in intermediate levels while α 5 integrins had a high expression profile as well as fibronectin and laminin. Cytogenetic analysis of NG 97 (ht) revealed several chromosomal abnormalities, 89 % of the cells showed to be hyperdiploid and the modal number was assigned to be 63. Several acrocentric chromosomes were visualized and at least 30 figures were attributed to be murine. These findings suggest a possible fusion between the original NG 97 cells with stromal murine cells in the <b>xenotransplant.</b> Conclusion In this study the NG 97 (ht) cells were characterized to embryonic recovery patterns of intermediate filaments, adhesion molecules expression, chromosomal imbalances and murine chromosomes. In the latter case, these presumably chromosomes were originated as fusions between murine stroma cells and NG 97 cell lineage in the <b>xenotransplant.</b> Our results emphasize important queries about astrocytomas tumor progression. </p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} some of the factors that might play a role in influencing attitude to xenotransplantation: first, the consideration of receiving cells and tissue from xenotransplants in relation to whole xeno-organs; secondly, the fact that there is greater uncertainty regarding the result and risk of infection associated with xenotransplantation than with allotransplantation. We also describe the attitude to research on xenotransplantation, and the relationship between the attitude to receiving a <b>xenotransplant</b> and an allotransplant. Finally, we describe the attitude to xenotransplantation in relation to treatment for renal failure and waiting-time for allotransplantation. A questionnaire was sent to randomly selected members of the public aged 18 to 75 (n= 1000) and to all patients in the same age range who were waiting for kidney transplants in Sweden in the spring of 1998 (n= 460). The response rate was 60 % among the public and 87 % among the patients. Both study groups were positive to a greater extent in their attitude to receiving cells and tissue than to receiving a whole organ such as a kidney. The response `rather positive' to receiving organs was generally favored by the public, whereas the most generally favored response to receiving cells and tissue was `very positive'. When there was suggested to be a greater uncertainty regarding the outcome with xenotransplantation compared with allotransplantation, the number of negative and uncertain respondents increased, both among the public and the patients. Eighty percent of the public and about 90 % of the patients were in favor of continued research on xenotransplantation. Of those members of the public who responded, the attitude to receiving an organ from a human was positive in 86 % of cases, with an emphasis on `very positive'. There was a moderate relation between the attitude to receiving an organ from a human and to receiving a <b>xenotransplant.</b> Among the patients, there was no systematic or strong relation between the attitude to xenotransplantation and the kind of dialysis treatment they were on. Neither was there any systematic or strong relation to the waiting-time.

However, the mechanism of how CEACAM 6 contributes to cancer formation and its role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the role of CEACAM 6 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methods CEACAM 6 expression was examined in normal squamous epithelia {{as well as a number}} of patient HNSCC samples and tumours derived from HNSCC cell lines injected into NOD/SCID mice. CEACAM 6 expression was manipulated in HNSCC cell lines by shRNA-mediated CEACAM 6 knockdown or virally-delivered overexpression of CEACAM 6. The role of CEACAM 6 in tumour growth and chemotherapeutic sensitivity was then assessed in vivo and in vitro respectively. Results CEACAM 6 expression was significantly increased in highly tumourigenic HNSCC cell lines when compared to poorly tumourigenic HNSCC cell lines. Moreover, HNSCC patient tumours demonstrated focal expression of CEACAM 6. Functional investigation of CEACAM 6, involving over-expression and knock down studies, demonstrated that CEACAM 6 over-expression could enhance tumour initiating activity and tumour growth via activation of AKT and suppression of caspase- 3 mediated cell death. Conclusion We report that CEACAM 6 is focally overexpressed in a large fraction of human HNSCCs in situ. We also show that over-expression of CEACAM 6 increases tumour growth and tumour initiating activity by suppressing PI 3 K/AKT-dependent apoptosis of HNSCC in a <b>xenotransplant</b> model of HNSCC. Finally, our studies indicate that foci of CEACAM 6 expressing cells are selectively ablated by treatment of <b>xenotransplant</b> tumours with pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3 K/AKT in vivo. </p...|$|E

Results: Bioactivity of estrone pellets and their metabolization into estradiol were demonstrated. However, there was no impact on endometriosis development (no difference in lesion number, weight, size or fluorescence). This lack of response was not due to absence of estrogen receptor expression, since strong expression was found in all lesions harvested.
