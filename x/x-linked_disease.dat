25|$|The world’s first PGD was {{performed}} by Handyside, Kontogianni and Winston at the Hammersmith Hospital in London. Female embryos were selectively transferred in five couples at risk of <b>X-linked</b> <b>disease,</b> resulting in two twins and one singleton pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|PGD {{is a form}} {{of genetic}} {{diagnosis}} performed prior to implantation. This implies that the patient’s oocytes should be fertilized in vitro and the embryos kept in culture until the diagnosis is established. It is also necessary to perform a biopsy on these embryos in order to obtain material on which to perform the diagnosis. The diagnosis itself can be carried out using several techniques, depending {{on the nature of the}} studied condition. Generally, PCR-based methods are used for monogenic disorders and FISH for chromosomal abnormalities and for sexing those cases in which no PCR protocol is available for an <b>X-linked</b> <b>disease.</b> These techniques need to be adapted to be performed on blastomeres and need to be thoroughly tested on single-cell models prior to clinical use. Finally, after embryo replacement, surplus good quality unaffected embryos can be cryopreserved, to be thawed and transferred back in a next cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{time period}} for X-chromosome {{inactivation}} explains this disparity. Inactivation {{occurs in the}} epiblast during gastrulation, which {{gives rise to the}} embryo. Inactivation occurs on a cellular level, resulting in a mosaic expression, in which patches of cells have an inactive maternal X-chromosome, while other patches have an inactive paternal X-chromosome. For example, a female heterozygous for haemophilia (an <b>X-linked</b> <b>disease)</b> would have about half of her liver cells functioning properly, which is typically enough to ensure normal blood clotting. Chance could result in significantly more dysfunctional cells; however, such statistical extremes are unlikely. Genetic differences on the chromosome may also render one X-chromosome more likely to undergo inactivation. Also, if one X-chromosome has a mutation hindering its growth or rendering it non viable, cells which randomly inactivated that X will have a selective advantage over cells which randomly inactivated the normal allele. Thus, although inactivation is initially random, cells that inactivate a normal allele (leaving the mutated allele active) will eventually be overgrown and replaced by functionally normal cells in which nearly all have the same X-chromosome activated.|$|E
2500|$|Most <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are evident}} in males because they lack the second X-chromosome that can {{compensate}} for the <b>diseases</b> allele. Some <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases</b> include fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. In the case of <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases,</b> if cffDNA can determine gender, invasive testing can be eliminated. In congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the adrenal cortex lacks appropriate corticosteroid synthesis, leading to excess adrenal androgens and affects female fetuses. There is an external masculinization of the genitalia in the female fetuses. At the moment, at-risk mothers are given dexamethasone at 6 weeks of the pregnancy which suppresses the pituitary to release androgens. Invasive testing is used at 11 weeks of the pregnancy to determine {{the sex of the}} fetus. In Europe, tests for sex determination are available as early as 7 weeks of gestation; these tests cost $390.|$|R

25|$|The {{identification}} of fetal sex {{for women who}} are carriers of <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases</b> is advantageous for the family. <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases</b> occur at a rate of 5 in 10,000 live births. The most commonly published sex-linked diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia. Ultrasonography is unreliable during the first trimester of pregnancy, as the genitalia are not fully developed. Other methods for sex determination before the use of cffDNA are invasive and performed at 11 weeks of gestation. There is a small risk of miscarriage. The main method is to target the SRY gene on the Y chromosome and DYS14 sequence.|$|R
25|$|Female embryos were {{selectively}} transferred in five couples {{at risk of}} <b>X-linked</b> <b>disease,</b> {{resulting in}} two twins and one singleton pregnancy. Because the Y chromosome region Kontogianni was amplifying contained many repeats, it was more efficient than trying to amplify a unique region. A band on the PCR gel indicated that the embryo was male {{and the absence of}} a band indicated that the embryo was female. However, amplification failure or an anucleate blastomere also resulted in absence of a band on the PCR gel. To reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, Kontogianni went on to co-amplify sequences on the X and Y (Kontogianni et al., 1991). At that time nothing was known about allele dropout, cumulus cell contamination, or amplification failure from single cells. During the 1980s, human IVF embryos were exclusively transferred on day two of development as the culture medium used was incapable of reliably growing embryos past this stage. Since the biopsy was to be performed on day three, the first diagnoses were all performed in one day, with transfer of the embryos late on day three. A comparison of day two and day three transfers indicated that this would not adversely affect pregnancy rates. The worry of embryos arresting was so high that some transfers took place {{in the early hours of}} day four so that the embryos were removed from culture as soon as possible. There were many evenings at the Hammersmith when a transfer was performed at 1 a.m. on day four and researchers returned to the laboratory at 7 a.m. to start the next case. Prof. Winston helped deliver most of the first PGD babies.|$|E

50|$|A {{complement}} to specific gene testing for monogenic disorders, {{which can be}} very useful for genetic diseases with sex linkage, such as, for example, <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases.</b> In such cases, it may be much easier to exclude the possibility of disease in the child by prenatal sex discernment than to test for any specific sign of the disease itself.|$|R
50|$|Some {{classify}} the paternal {{age effect}} {{as one of}} two different types. One effect {{is directly related to}} advanced paternal age and autosomal mutations in the offspring. The other effect is an indirect effect in relation to mutations on the X chromosome which are passed to daughters who are then at risk for having sons with <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|R

2500|$|As {{in other}} <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases,</b> males are {{affected}} because {{they only have}} one copy of the X chromosome. In Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, the defective gene is that for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), {{a participant in the}} 'recycling' of purine nucleotides.

50|$|The McLeod {{phenotype}} is a {{recessive mutation}} of the Kell blood group system. The McLeod gene encodes the XK protein, {{which is located}} on the X chromosome, and has the structural characteristics of a membrane transport protein but an unknown function.

50|$|Pyruvate {{dehydrogenase}} deficiency (also {{known as}} pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency or PDCD) {{is one of}} the most common neurodegenerative disorders associated with abnormal mitochondrial metabolism. PDCD is an <b>X-linked</b> <b>disease</b> that shows heterogeneous characteristics in both clinical presentation and biochemical abnormality. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a multi-enzyme complex that plays a vital role as a key regulatory step in the central pathways of energy metabolism in the mitochondria.|$|E
50|$|Affected fathers {{can never}} pass this <b>X-linked</b> <b>disease</b> to their sons but {{affected}} fathers can pass the X-linked gene to their daughters {{who has a}} 50% chance to pass this disease-causing gene to each of her children. Since females who inherit this gene do not show symptoms, they are called carriers. Each of the female's carrier's son has a 50% chance to display the symptoms {{but none of the}} female carrier's daughters would display any symptoms.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{families}} at risk for <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases,</b> patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases</b> {{who are in the}} process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of <b>X-linked</b> Mendelian recessive <b>diseases.</b> Such <b>X-linked</b> Mendelian <b>diseases</b> include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and hemophilia A and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the recessive allele. Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a dominant gene for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one's phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of having the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the risk ratio in either sex, or the options for disease treatment.|$|R
50|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of HLH includes secondary HLH and macrophage-activation syndrome or other primary immunodeficiencies that present with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, such as <b>X-linked</b> lymphoproliferative <b>disease.</b>|$|R
50|$|SFMS is an <b>X-linked</b> <b>disease</b> by {{chromosome}} Xq13. X-linked diseases map to {{the human}} X chromosome because this syndrome is an X chromosome linked females who have two chromosomes are not affected but because males only have one X chromosome, {{they are more likely}} to be affected and show the full clinical symptoms. This disease only requires one copy of the abnormal X-linked gene to display the syndrome. Since females have two X chromosomes, the effect of one X chromosome is recessive and the second chromosome masks the affected chromosome.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{invasive}} testing, {{determination of}} the fetal sex is important; while males are sometimes affected by this <b>X-linked</b> <b>disease,</b> female DMD is extremely rare. This {{can be achieved by}} ultrasound scan at 16 weeks or more recently by free fetal DNA testing. Chorion villus sampling (CVS) can be done at 11-14 weeks, and has a 1% risk of miscarriage. Amniocentesis can be done after 15 weeks, and has a 0.5% risk of miscarriage. Fetal blood sampling can be done around 18 weeks. Another option in the case of unclear genetic test results is fetal muscle biopsy.|$|E
50|$|Skewed X {{inactivation}} has medical significance {{due to its}} {{impacts on}} X-linked diseases. If the diseased X-linked allele does not cause selection, {{the extent of the}} primary stochastic skewing can influence the severity of the disease. The diseased X-linked allele can cause strong selection in a heterozygote for the cells with the diseased allele on the inactive chromosome. Therefore, strong skewing in females members of a family can suggest they are carriers of an <b>X-linked</b> <b>disease.</b> X Chromosome skewing also has an ability to amplify diseases on the X chromosome. In wildtype women, recessive diseases on the X chromosome are often unexpressed due to the roughly even inactivation process, which prevents mutated alleles from becoming heavily expressed. However, skewed inactivation, can lead to a more severe expression of the disease.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Robert Edwards and Richard Gardner {{reported}} the successful {{identification of the}} sex of rabbit blastocysts. It {{was not until the}} 1980s that human IVF was fully developed, which coincided with the breakthrough of the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. Handyside, Kontogianni and Winston's first successful tests happened in October 1989, with the first births in 1990 though the preliminary experiments had been published some years earlier. In these first cases, PCR was used for sex determination of patients carrying <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|R
40|$|A unified genetic, physical, and {{functional}} {{map of the}} human X chromosome is being built through a concerted, international effort. About 40 percent of the 160 million base pairs of the X chromosome DNA have been cloned in overlapping, ordered contigs derived from yeast artificial chromosomes. This rapid progress toward a physical map is accelerating the identification of inherited disease genes, 26 of which are already cloned and more than 50 others regionally localized by linkage analysis. This article summarizes the mapping strategies now used {{and the impact of}} genome research on the understanding of X chromosome inactivation and <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

5000|$|X-SCID in dogs {{is seen in}} Basset Hounds and Cardigan Welsh Corgis. Because it is an <b>X-linked</b> <b>disease,</b> {{females are}} {{carriers}} only and disease is seen in males exclusively. It {{is caused by a}} mutation in the gene for the cytokine receptor common gamma chain. [...] Recurring infections are seen and affected animals usually do not live beyond three to four months. Characteristics include a poorly developed thymus gland, decreased T-lymphocytes and IgG, absent IgA, and normal quantities of IgM. [...] A common cause of death is canine distemper, which develops following vaccination with a modified live distemper virus vaccine. [...] Due to its similarity to X-SCID in humans, breeding colonies of affected dogs have been created in order to study the disease and test treatments, particularly bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy.|$|E

50|$|WASp is {{a product}} of the WASp, and {{mutations}} in the WASp can lead to Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (an <b>X-linked</b> <b>disease</b> that mainly affects males with symptoms that include thrombocytopenia, eczema, recurrent infections, and small-sized platelets) in these patients the protein is usually significantly reduced or absent. Other, less inactivating mutations affecting the WASp cause X-linked thrombocytopenia, or XLT, where there is usually detectable protein levels by flow cytometry. The majority of the mutations causing classic WAS are located in the WH1 domain of the protein and these mutations affect binding with the WASp Interacting Protein. Mutations located in the GBD domain disrupt autoinhibition and lead to an unfolded protein that is constituvely active. Unlike WAS and XLT, WASp in this case is present and active. Activated WASP leads to nuclear localization of actin filaments and this can lead to premature apoptosis, aneuploidy and failure to undergo cytokinesis causing myelodisplasia and X- linked neutropenia.|$|E
40|$|Barth {{syndrome}} (BTHS) is an <b>X-linked</b> recessive <b>disease</b> primarily affecting males. Clinically, {{the disease}} is characterized by hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, chronic/cyclic neutropenia, 3 -methylglutaconic aciduria, growth retardation and respiratory chain dysfunction. It is caused by mutations in the TAZ gene coding for the tafazzin protein {{which is responsible for}} cardiolipin remodeling. In this work, we present a novel pathogenic TAZ mutation c. 83 T>A, p. Val 28 Glu, found in mosaic form in almost all female members of a Polish family. Sanger sequencing of DNA from peripheral blood and from epithelial cells showed female mosaicism in three generations. This appears to be a new mechanism of inheritance and further research is required {{in order to understand the}} mechanism of this mosaicism. We conclude that BTHS genetic testing should include two or more tissues for women that appear to be noncarriers when blood DNA is initially tested. The results of our study should not only be applicable to BTHS families, but also to families with other <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{inactivation}} of one X chromosome {{in females}} is normally random {{with regard to}} which X is inactivated. However, exclusive or almost-exclusive inactivation of one X may be observed in association with some X-autosomal rearrangements, mutations of the XIST gene, certain <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases,</b> and MZ twinning. In the present study, a methylation difference near a polymorphism in the X-linked androgen-receptor gene was used to investigate the possibility that nonrandom X inactivation is increases in fetuses and newborns {{that are associated with}} confined placental mosaicism (CPM) involving an autosomal trisomy. Extreme skewing was observed in 7 (58 %) of 12 cases with a meiotic origin of the trisomy, but in none of 10 cases examined with a somatic origin of the trisomy, and in only 1 (4 %) of 27 control adult females. In addition, an extremely skewed X-inactivation pattern was observed in 3 of 10 informative cases of female uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15. This may reflect the fact that a proportion of UPD cases arise by “rescue” of a chromosomally abnormal conceptus and are therefore associated with CPM. A skewed pattern of X inactivation in CPM cases is hypothesized to result from a reduction {{in the size of the}} early-embryonic cell pool, because of either poor early growth or subsequent selection against the trisomic cells. Since ∼ 2 % of pregnancies detected by chorionic villus sampling are associated with CPM, this is likely a significant contributor to both skewed X inactivation observed in the newborn population and the expression of recessive <b>X-linked</b> <b>diseases</b> in females...|$|R
50|$|Mutations of the GJB1 gene {{affecting}} the signalling of and trafficking through gap junctions, {{resulting in an}} inherited peripheral neuropathy called <b>X-linked</b> Charcot-Marie-Tooth <b>Disease.</b> Complications include the demyelination of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, causing delayed transmission rates of nerve communication in the peripheral nervous system, due to irregularities in the normal function of the cells. This condition leads {{to a number of}} symptoms, most commonly muscle weakness and sensory problems in the outer extremities of the limbs. As a result muscle atrophy and soft tissue injuries due to delayed nerve transmission can occur. In males, due to the hemizygousity of the X-chromosome, the symptoms and issues surrounding <b>X-linked</b> Charcot-Marie-Tooth <b>disease</b> are more prevalent.|$|R
