30|$|Most of {{the above}} models are mainly based on the {{following}} cases: case 1, <b>diseases</b> <b>transmit</b> only in prey species (for example, [18 – 25] and the references cited therein); case 2, <b>diseases</b> <b>transmit</b> only in predator species (for example, see [26 – 30] and the references cited therein); case 3, <b>diseases</b> <b>transmit</b> both in prey and predator species (see [31]). The dynamical behaviors of the models with disease are studied, such as the stability, periodic solution, oscillation, bifurcation, and chaos. Their {{results indicated that the}} predators die out and the prey tends to its carrying capacity; or the infected prey and the predators both die out; or the predator and prey coexist.|$|R
