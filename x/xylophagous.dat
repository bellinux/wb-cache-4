500|$|Many insects also {{engage in}} mutualistic {{relationships}} with fungi. Several groups of ants cultivate fungi {{in the order}} Agaricales as their primary food source, while ambrosia beetles cultivate various species of fungi in the bark of trees that they infest. Likewise, females of several wood wasp species (genus Sirex) inject their eggs together with spores of the wood-rotting fungus Amylostereum areolatum into the sapwood of pine trees; {{the growth of the}} fungus provides ideal nutritional conditions {{for the development of the}} wasp larvae. At least one species of stingless bee has a relationship with a fungus in the genus Monascus, where the larvae consume and depend on fungus transferred from old to new nests. Termites on the African savannah are also known to cultivate fungi, and yeasts of the genera Candida and Lachancea inhabit the gut of a wide range of insects, including neuropterans, beetles, and cockroaches; it is not known whether these fungi benefit their hosts. Fungi ingrowing dead wood are essential for <b>xylophagous</b> insects (e.g. woodboring beetles). They deliver nutrients needed by xylophages to nutritionally scarce dead wood. [...] Thanks to this nutritional enrichment the larvae of woodboring insect is able to grow and develop to adulthood. The larvae of many families of fungicolous flies, particularly those within the superfamily Sciaroidea such as the Mycetophilidae and some Keroplatidae feed on fungal fruiting bodies and sterile mycorrhizae.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} century the forests of Central Europe changed from open {{woodlands}} to even-aged stands with closed-canopy. This change resulted in severe decline of forest biodiversity. This study examines how, and why such change affected <b>xylophagous</b> insects. I have studied microhabitat preferences, i. e. distribution of <b>xylophagous</b> insects in canopy and understorey of closed forests, forest edges and wooded meadows. I used method of rearing insect from timber baits exposed to ovipositing females of <b>xylophagous</b> insects in different situations in the forest at the beginning if vegetation season. After one season of exposition,the baits were collected enclosed in fly-wire cages, where emerging insects were collected for two seasons. This thesis consists of two parts: The first part is an unpublished manuscript dealing with effect of habitat insolation, vertical stratification, forest structure and amount of dead wood on community of long-horned beetles (Cerambycidae) and jewell beetles (Buprestidae) feeding on wood of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Baits were exposed in the canopy and the understorey of forest interior, the canopy and the understorey of forest edge and on solitary trees on wooded meadows. Most insect species do prefer insoled wood for their development, and were {{more common in the}} understorey than in the canopy. Insolation of bait was thus the prime factor affecting composition of reared insects. No relation was found between dead wood volume and species composition or abundance of reared insects This shows that insolation of the dead wood is crucial to conservation of most <b>xylophagous</b> insects. The second part of the thesis studies effect of vertical stratification and insolation on distribution of xylophages feeding reared from wood of 8 tree species (Alnus glutinosa, Populus alba, P. x canadensis, Salix alba, Carpinus betulus, Quercus robur, Tilia cordata, Ulmus laevis) and host specificity of xylophages. Results show that: (i) community composition of xylophages reflects evolutionary history of their host plants; (ii) communities reared from different trees exhibit different preferences for forest strata and insolation of the habitat, probably in connection to preferred growth conditions of the host plant, (iii) many <b>xylophagous</b> insect species exhibit strong preferences to insoled habitats, and are thus confined to forest edges in extensively managed forests as well as in unmanaged forest reserves...|$|E
40|$|Loss of {{dead wood}} habitat and {{biodiversity}} {{has led to}} numerous excellent conservation based ecological and management studies. However, {{the structure of the}} <b>xylophagous</b> food web remains unclear for saproxylic <b>xylophagous</b> beetles and their parasitoid wasps, but fungi are believed to play an important role, both in direct and indirect nutritional acquisition and production of volatile chemicals. In the first study of its kind this thesis explores the importance of volatiles in host-searching behaviour and role of fungi in oviposition choice and larval nutrition, using three endophytic fungi, Stereum hirsutum, Stereum gausapatum and Eutypa spinosa, and two tree species Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur, in early stage decay. Newly designed traps, excluding wood visual stimuli, provided the first evidence of wood-fungal volatile attraction by saproxylic wood-boring beetles, including primary and secondary xylophages, and their parasitoid wasps. Expanding on these results, the importance of fungi was further demonstrated through oviposition choice in field logs by two polyphagous cerambycid species. Ovipositing within or 20 mm from their preferred fungal species plug, females chose abiotic conditions suitable for sustaining fungal growth, suggesting a larval nutritional benefit. Further investigation, using one of the cerambycid species above, corroborated, via olfactometry, that volatiles from the preferred wood-fungal combination were attractants to gravid females, and induced ovipositor probing within the olfactometer. In addition, GC-EAG found six volatile compounds provoked an antennal response, including a monoterpene, two sesquiterpenes, an alkane and a ketone. Most importantly olfactometry and GC-EAG showed gravid females were unresponsive to wood or favored fungus presented singly. The result are discussed herein. In conjunction with the volatile only field trap experiment, a novel method to promote fungal only volatiles, by autoclaving the wood prior to sub-culturing, was trialed. GC-MS comparative analysis showed disparity between agar sub-cultured, autoclaved wood and natural wood with fungi, volatiles. This suggests that genes encoding cellulases and hemicellulases are regulated according to carbohydrate source, nutritional availability, oxygen and metal ions, supporting the variations observed. These results are discussed herein with regard to <b>xylophagous</b> beetles and their parasitoid wasps. The principal findings of this thesis are that wood-fungal interaction volatiles of the ephemeral early decay stage provide important olfactory host resource cues for saproxylic <b>xylophagous</b> beetles and their parasitoid wasps. Fungi, and particular, endophytic fungi, were shown to be a key component of the early stage <b>xylophagous</b> food web through volatile production, and as nutritional support evidenced by oviposition choice, olfactometry, GC-EAG and GC-MS analysis. This thesis has opened a new, exciting and important area of research with the potential to radically improve conservation management and employ a more holistic approach.

In this study, high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA was used to investigate the diversity of metagenomic gut communities of C. punctulatus and P. boleiriana, and thereby to identify possible shifts in symbiont allegiances during cockroaches evolution. Our results revealed that the hindgut prokaryotic communities of both <b>xylophagous</b> cockroaches are dominated by members of four Bacteria phyla: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria.
