For example, MAD phasing requires that the scattering be recorded at least three (and usually four, for redundancy) wavelengths of the incoming <b>X-ray</b> <b>radiation.</b> A single crystal may degrade too much during the collection of one data set, owing to radiation damage; in such cases, data sets on multiple crystals must be taken.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{astronomy}} uses X-ray wavelengths. Typically, <b>X-ray</b> <b>radiation</b> {{is produced}} by synchrotron emission (the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), thermal emission from thin gases above 107 (10million) kelvins, and thermal emission from thick gases above 107 Kelvin. Since X-rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, all X-ray observations must be performed from high-altitude balloons, rockets, or X-ray astronomy satellites. Notable X-ray sources include X-ray binaries, pulsars, supernova remnants, elliptical galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and active galactic nuclei.|$|E

It is often used to study and treat aspiration of food, what parts of the digestive tract are malfunctioning during swallowing, and positions in which swallowing is easiest. Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure. and it does not allow for fine grain analysis of tongue movements.|$|E

In this contribution, cool MHD disk wind physics is reviewed by means of a self-similar analytical model to analyze whether hot (Te similar or equal to 80, 000 K) and dense (n(e) similar or equal to 10 (9) cm(- 3)) plasma can be produced in disk winds. It is shown that these high densities can only be achieved {{at the base of the}} wind where the stellar <b>X-rays</b> <b>radiation</b> field is strong. The propagation of the <b>X-rays</b> <b>radiation</b> through the disk wind is analyzed: a cocoon of photoionized gas is generated around the star.

5|$|Bright arcs and spots {{sporadically}} appear {{within the}} main ovals. These transient phenomena {{are thought to}} be related to interaction with the solar wind. The magnetic field lines in this region are believed to be open or to map onto the magnetotail. The secondary ovals observed inside the main oval {{may be related to the}} boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines or to the polar cusps. The polar auroral emissions are similar to those observed around Earth's poles: both appear when electrons are accelerated towards the planet by potential drops, during reconnection of solar magnetic field with that of the planet. The regions within both main ovals emit most of auroral X-rays. The spectrum of the auroral <b>X-ray</b> <b>radiation</b> consists of spectral lines of highly ionized oxygen and sulfur, which probably appear when energetic (hundreds of kiloelectronvolts) S and O ions precipitate into the polar atmosphere of Jupiter.

25|$|Projectional {{radiography}} is {{the practice}} of producing two-dimensional images using <b>x-ray</b> <b>radiation.</b> Bones contain much calcium, which due to its relatively high atomic number absorbs x-rays efficiently. This reduces the amount of X-rays reaching the detector {{in the shadow of}} the bones, making them clearly visible on the radiograph. The lungs and trapped gas also show up clearly because of lower absorption compared to tissue, while differences between tissue types are harder to see.|$|E
25|$|Beam Hardening: <b>X-ray</b> <b>radiation</b> {{consists}} of hard and soft particles, i.e. particles {{with a lot}} of energy and particles with little energy. Unnecessary exposure is mostly caused by soft particles, as they are to weak to pass through the body and interact with it. Hard particles, by contrast, pass through the patient. A filter in front of the x-ray tube can catch the soft particles, thus hardening the beam. This decreases dose without impacting image quality.|$|E

25|$|Medical imaging {{is often}} {{perceived}} to designate {{the set of}} techniques that noninvasively produce images of the internal aspect of the body.

This means that cause (the properties of living tissue) is inferred from effect (the observed signal). In the case of medical ultrasonography, the probe consists of ultrasonic pressure waves and echoes that go inside the tissue to show the internal structure.

25|$|Changes in {{luminosity}} {{are common}} to all stars, but the severity of such fluctuations covers a broad range. Most stars are relatively stable, but a significant minority of variable stars often undergo sudden and intense increases in luminosity and consequently {{in the amount of}} energy radiated toward bodies in orbit. These stars are considered poor candidates for hosting life-bearing planets, as their unpredictability and energy output changes would negatively impact organisms: living things adapted to a specific temperature range could not survive too great a temperature variation. Further, upswings in luminosity are generally accompanied by massive doses of gamma ray and <b>X-ray</b> <b>radiation</b> which might prove lethal. Atmospheres do mitigate such effects, but their atmosphere might not be retained by planets orbiting variables, because the high-frequency energy buffeting these planets would continually strip them of their protective covering.|$|E
