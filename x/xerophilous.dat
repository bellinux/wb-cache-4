500|$|N. ensifer is a <b>xerophilous</b> {{species that}} can thrive in dry climates. In Colima, colonies are {{frequent}} among the basins, but rarely are {{they found in}} the mountainous regions. N. ensifer ants prefer to nest {{in the sand and}} under large stones, as certain areas in Manzanillo had no stones buried in the soil and no colonies were found alongside hills with plain soil. Most colonies are found under stones with no noticeable craters surrounding the nest entrance, although one colony was found under an Acacia plant. These nest holes are usually [...] in diameter. A single path connects the entrance to the main nest site, followed by a passage that descends straight into the dirt several inches deep. This passage widens under a stone which forms a gallery for the larvae and pupae. Wherever stones are formed, passageways may descend further into the ground and form more chambers. Although it is unknown how deep these passages go, excavated nests are as deep as [...]|$|E
