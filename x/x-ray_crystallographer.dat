25|$|Rosalind Elsie Franklin (25 July 192016 April 1958) was an English chemist and <b>X-ray</b> <b>crystallographer</b> {{who made}} {{contributions}} {{to the understanding of}} the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite.

25|$|Mering was an <b>X-ray</b> <b>crystallographer</b> {{who applied}} X-ray {{diffraction}} {{to the study}} of rayon and other amorphous substances, in contrast to the thousands of regular crystals that had been studied by this method for many years. He taught her the practical aspects of applying X-ray crystallography to amorphous substances. This presented new challenges in the conduct of experiments and the interpretation of results. Franklin applied them to further problems related to coal, in particular the changes to the arrangement of atoms when it is converted to graphite. She published several further papers on this work which {{has become part of the}} mainstream of the physics and chemistry of coal. This work was covered in a 1993 monograph, and in the regularly-published textbook Chemistry and Physics of Carbon. Mering continued the study of carbon in various forms, using X-ray diffraction and other methods.|$|E
25|$|Born to a {{prominent}} British Jewish family, Franklin was educated {{at a private}} day school at Norland Place in West London, Lindores School for Young Ladies in Sussex, and St Paul's Girls' School, London. Then she studied the Natural Sciences Tripos at Newnham College, Cambridge, from which she graduated in 1941. Earning a research fellowship, she joined the University of Cambridge physical chemistry laboratory under Ronald George Wreyford Norrish, who disappointed her for his lack of enthusiasm. Fortunately, the British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) offered her a research position in 1942, and started her work on coals. This helped her earn a Ph.D. in 1945. She went to Paris in 1947 as a chercheur (post-doctoral researcher) under Jacques Mering at the Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'Etat, where she became an accomplished <b>X-ray</b> <b>crystallographer.</b> She became a research associate at King's College London in 1951 and worked on X-ray diffraction studies, which would eventually facilitate the double helix theory of the DNA. In 1953, after two years, owing to disagreement with her director John Randall and more so with her colleague Maurice Wilkins, she was compelled to move to Birkbeck College. At Birkbeck, J. D. Bernal, chair of the physics department, offered her a separate research team. She died in 1958 {{at the age of}} 37 of ovarian cancer.|$|E

25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopes {{are often}} used in electron diffraction mode. The advantages of electron diffraction over X-ray crystallography are that the specimen {{need not be a}} single crystal or even a polycrystalline powder, and also that the Fourier transform reconstruction of the object's magnified structure occurs physically and thus avoids the need for solving the phase problem faced by the <b>X-ray</b> <b>crystallographers</b> after obtaining their X-ray diffraction patterns of a single crystal or polycrystalline powder.|$|R

40|$|In {{cases where}} enzyme-catalysed {{synthesis}} of a peptide bond {{is being used}} to re-form a protein from two large peptide fragments, the organic co-solvent chosen has so far been glycerol, for most solvents in use in small-molecule systems are potent protein denaturants.

In one such case, the reported re-formation of cytochrome c from a two-fragment complex system, cytochrome c-T, the extent and rate of conjugate formation duplicates that reported for enzymic resynthesis. We observed no difference between mixtures containing or lacking enzyme. We warn of the danger of confusion possible to those engaged in studies of resynthesis, and suggest a simple control of purchased glycerol to avoid it.

Unusually, the giant leap {{that occurred in}} the biological sciences {{in the middle of the}} last century seems in retrospect to have had a strangely inevitable quality about it. Perhaps that was because physics, which had played such a large part in ending World War II, was being purged by the move of physicists into the innocent pursuit of biology, and they were bringing with them all those useful isotopes plus a happy ignorance of, even distaste for, classical biochemistry and genetics. If Newton had not existed, his analysis of the forces of physics might have been delayed for another century.

50|$|Resolution by Proxy (ResProx) is {{a method}} for {{assessing}} the equivalent X-ray resolution of NMR-derived protein structures. ResProx calculates resolution from coordinate data rather than from electron density or other experimental inputs. This {{makes it possible to}} calculate the resolution of a structure regardless of how it was solved (X-ray, NMR, EM, modeling, ab initio prediction). ResProx was originally designed to serve as a simple, single-number evaluation that allows straightforward comparison between the quality/resolution of X-ray structures and the quality of a given NMR structure. However, it {{can also be used to}} assess the reliability of an experimentally reported X-ray structure resolution, to evaluate protein structures solved by unconventional or hybrid means and to identify fraudulent structures deposited in the PDB. ResProx incorporates more than 25 different structural features to determine a single resolution-like value. ResProx values are reported in Angstroms. Tests on thousands of X-ray structures show that ResProx values match very closely to resolution values reported by <b>X-ray</b> <b>crystallographers.</b> Resolution-by-proxy values can be calculated for newly determined protein structures using a freely accessible ResProx web server.

40|$|Single {{particle}} cryo-EM {{has recently}} {{developed into a}} powerful tool to determine the 3 D structure of macromolecular complexes at near-atomic resolution, which allows structural biologists to build atomic models of proteins. All technical aspects of cryo-EM technology have been considerably improved {{over the last two}} decades, including electron microscopic hardware, image processing software and the ever growing speed of computers. This leads to a more widespread use of the technique, and it can be anticipated that further automation of electron microscopes and image processing tools will soon fully shift the focus away from the technological aspects, onto biological questions that can be answered. In single particle cryo-EM, no crystals of a macromolecule are required. In contrast to X-ray crystallography, this significantly facilitates structure determination by cryo-EM. Nevertheless, a relatively high level of biochemical control is still essential to obtain high-resolution structures by cryo-EM, and it can be anticipated that the success of the cryo-EM technology {{goes hand in hand with}} further developments of sample purification and preparation techniques.

40|$|Solving {{the phase}} problem in protein X-ray {{crystallography}} {{relies heavily on}} {{the identity of the}} crystallized protein, especially when molecular replacement (MR) methods are used. Yet, it is not uncommon that a contaminant crystallizes instead of the protein of interest. Such contaminants may be proteins from the expression host organism, protein fusion tags or proteins added during the purification steps. Many contaminants co-purify easily, crystallize and give good diffraction data. Identification of contaminant crystals may take time, since the presence of the contaminant is unexpected and its identity unknown. A webserver (ContaMiner) and a contaminant database (ContaBase) have been established, to allow fast MR-based screening of crystallographic data against currently 62 known contaminants. The web-based ContaMiner (available at [URL] currently produces results in 5 min to 4 h. The program is also available in a github repository and can be installed locally. ContaMiner enables screening of novel crystals at synchrotron beamlines, and it would be valuable as a routine safety check for 'crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis' publications.

50|$|In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick {{put forward}} their double-helix model of DNA, based on {{crystallized}} X-ray structures being studied by Rosalind Franklin. According to the model, DNA {{is composed of}} two strands of nucleotides coiled around each other, linked together by hydrogen bonds and running in opposite directions. Each strand is composed of four complementary nucleotides - adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) - with an A on one strand always paired with T on the other, and C always paired with G. They proposed such a structure allowed each strand {{to be used to}} reconstruct the other, an idea central to the passing on of hereditary information between generations.The foundation for sequencing proteins was first laid by the work of Fred Sanger who by 1955 had completed the sequence of all the amino acids in insulin, a small protein secreted by the pancreas. This provided the first conclusive evidence that proteins were chemical entities with a specific molecular pattern rather than a random mixture of material suspended in fluid. Sanger's success in sequencing insulin greatly electrified <b>x-ray</b> <b>crystallographers,</b> including Watson and Crick who by now were trying to understand how DNA directed the formation of proteins within a cell. Soon after attending a series of lectures given by Fred Sanger in October 1954, Crick began to develop a theory which argued that the arrangement of nucleotides in DNA determined the sequence of amino acids in proteins which in turn helped determine the function of a protein. He published this theory in 1958.|$|R
