5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the <b>xenobiotic</b> (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble <b>xenobiotic</b> can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E
5|$|However, many {{traits that}} appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations: {{structures}} originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process. One example is the African lizard Holaspis guentheri, which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives. However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree—an exaptation. Within cells, molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the recruitment of several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions. Another example is the recruitment of enzymes from glycolysis and <b>xenobiotic</b> metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within the lenses of organisms' eyes.|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we discuss the}} {{potential}} application of biosensors for the ecotoxicologal risk assessment of <b>xenobiotics</b> in soil environments. In the first part we introduce basic concepts of ecotoxicological risk assessment, ecotoxicology, environmental fate of <b>xenobiotics,</b> with particular focus on bioavailability processes and their importance in exposure and ecotoxicity of <b>xenobiotics</b> in soils. Specifically, all the main processes controlling the environmental fate of <b>xenobiotics</b> in soils are explained. In the second part we introduce some principles of the functioning of different classes of whole cell biosensors and chemical sensors for <b>xenobiotics</b> of ecotoxicological interests and present some applications and their contribution to improve the ecoxicological risk assessment of <b>xenobiotics</b> in soils. We show how biosensors can be applied together with chemical assessment of bioavailability of <b>xenobiotics</b> in soil to assess ecotoxicological risk. The application of biosensors to improve the classical risk assessment paradigm is presented, {{in order to show}} how this technology can be used to assess the ecotoxicological risk of <b>xenobiotics</b> in soils. Examples of biosensors with potential application for ecotoxicological risk assessment are also presented and discussed. The relevance of these studies of environmental health is also acknowledged. We conclude that biosensors technology holds relevant potential for ecotoxicological risk assessment of <b>xenobiotics</b> in soils...|$|R

40|$|Small {{molecular}} weight <b>xenobiotics</b> are compounds of extreme concern in potable water applications {{due to their}} adverse human health and environmental effects. However, conventional water treatment processes cannot fully and systematically remove them due to their low concentrations in natural waters and wastewaters. Biological limitation to degrade such compounds is another cause for inefficient removal. Physical barriers like membranes possessing pore sizes smaller than the compounds to be removed emerged as a good solution. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis proved to be quite effective for <b>xenobiotics</b> removal in potable water production in the Paris purification plant of Méry-sur-Oise. However, even these very narrow pore membrane processes may result in incomplete removal: <b>xenobiotics</b> retention is high but factors such as adsorption, size exclusion and charge repulsion affect unpredictably their retention. The water solutions complexity to be treated renders <b>xenobiotics</b> removal predictions even more difficult due to interactions between <b>xenobiotics</b> and compounds in water.

2500|$|Ligands {{that bind}} to and {{activate}} nuclear receptors include lipophilic substances such as endogenous hormones, vitamins A and D, and <b>xenobiotic</b> endocrine disruptors. [...] Because {{the expression of}} a large number of genes is regulated by nuclear receptors, ligands that activate these receptors can have profound effects on the organism. [...] Many of these regulated genes are associated with various diseases, which explains why the molecular targets of approximately 13% of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs target nuclear receptors.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} nuclear receptors, {{referred}} to as orphan receptors, have no known (or at least generally agreed upon) endogenous ligands. [...] Some of these receptors such as FXR, LXR, and PPAR bind a number of metabolic intermediates such as fatty acids, bile acids and/or sterols with relatively low affinity. [...] These receptors hence may function as metabolic sensors. [...] Other nuclear receptors, such as CAR and PXR appear to function as <b>xenobiotic</b> sensors up-regulating the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize these xenobiotics.|$|E
2500|$|Induction of CYP1A1 by {{benzopyrene}} occurs via binding to the {{aryl hydrocarbon}} receptor in the cytosol, leading the transformed receptor to translocate to the nucleus where it dimerises with {{aryl hydrocarbon receptor}} nuclear translocator and then binds <b>xenobiotic</b> response elements in DNA located upstream of certain genes. [...] This process increases transcription of genes including CYP1A1, resulting in increased CYP1A1 protein production. This process is similar to induction of CYP1A1 by certain polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. Seemingly, CYP1A1 activity in the intestinal mucosa prevents major amounts of ingested benzopyrene to enter portal blood and systemic circulation. Intestinal, but not hepatic, expression of CYP1A1 depends on TOLL-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which is a eucaryotic receptor for bacterial surface structures such as lipoteichoic acid. Moreover, benzopyrene {{has been found to}} activate a transposon, LINE1, in humans.|$|E

2500|$|PCBs undergo <b>xenobiotic</b> biotransformation, a {{mechanism}} {{used to make}} lipophilic toxins more polar and more easily excreted from the body. [...] The biotransformation {{is dependent on the}} number of chlorines present, along with their position on the rings. [...] Phase I reactions occur by adding an oxygen to either of the benzene rings by Cytochrome P450. [...] The type of P450 present also determines where the oxygen will be added; phenobarbital (PB)-induced P450s catalyze oxygenation to the meta-para positions of PCBs while 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC)-induced P450s add oxygens to the ortho-meta positions. PCBs containing ortho-meta and meta-para protons can be metabolized by either enzyme, making them the most likely to leave the organism. [...] However, some metabolites of PCBs containing ortho-meta protons have increased steric hindrance from the oxygen, causing increased stability and an increased chance of accumulation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adaptive}} {{response is}} manifested as the induction of <b>xenobiotic</b> metabolizing enzymes. Evidence of this response was first observed from the induction of cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (Cyp1a1) resultant from TCDD exposure, which {{was determined to}} be directly related to activation of the Ahr signaling pathway. [...] The search for other metabolizing genes induced by Ahr ligands, due to the presence of DREs, has led to the identification of an [...] "Ahr gene battery" [...] of Phase I and Phase II metabolizing enzymes consisting of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, NQO1, ALDH3A1, UGT1A2 and GSTA1. Presumably, vertebrates have this function to be able to detect a wide range of chemicals, indicated by the wide range of substrates Ahr is able to bind and facilitate their biotransformation and elimination.

Due to a lack of available human clinical trials, there is insufficient evidence to recommend tamarind for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Different parts of tamarind (T. indica) are recognized for their various medicinal properties. A previous study reported that the seed, leaf, leaf veins, fruit pulp and skin extracts of tamarind possessed high phenolic content and antioxidant activities. The presence of lupanone and lupeol, [...] catechin, epicatechin, quercetin and isorhamnetin [...] in the leaf extract could have contributed towards the diverse range of the medicinal activities.

2500|$|Microbial cytochromes P450 {{are often}} soluble enzymes and are {{involved}} in diverse metabolic processes. In bacteria the distribution of P450s is very variable with many bacteria having no identified P450s (e.g. E.coli). Some bacteria, predominantly actinomycetes, have numerous P450s (e.g.,). Those so far identified are generally involved in either biotransformation of <b>xenobiotic</b> compounds (e.g. CYP105A1 from Streptomyces griseolus metabolizes sulfonylurea herbicides to less toxic derivatives,) or are part of specialised metabolite biosynthetic pathways (e.g. CYP170B1 catalyses production of the sesquiterpenoid albaflavenone in Streptomyces albus,). Although no P450 has yet {{been shown to be}} essential in a microbe, the CYP105 family is highly conserved with a representative in every streptomycete genome sequenced so far (...)

Despite albumin’s low affinity (Kd 104 M to 106 M) for these lipophilic compounds, the high concentration of albumin in serum makes this protein a major carrier of steroids and lipophilic hormones and a regulator of their access to receptors. Albumin also func-tions as a sink for <b>xenobiotics,</b> diminishing the binding of <b>xenobiotics</b> to hormone receptors and other cellular proteins. This protects animals from endocrine disruption by <b>xenobiotics.</b> We propose that these properties of albumin were important in protochordates and primitive vertebrates, such as jawless fish, about 600 to 530 million years ago, just before and during the Cambrian period. It is at that time that the ancestral receptors of adrenal and sex steroids- androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, mineralo-corticoids, and progestins- arose in multicellular animals. Albumin regulated access of steroids to their receptors, as well as protecting animals from endocrine disruptors, such as phytochemicals, fungal chemicals and phenolics, and other chemicals formed at hydrothermal vents by geo-chemical processes.
