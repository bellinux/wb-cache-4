Nectriopsis violacea specialises on Fuligo septica. Bacterial associates, mainly from the family Enterobacteriaceae, were discovered on plasmodia. The combination of plasmodia and bacteria can bind atmospheric nitrogen or produce enzymes which make possible the decomposition of e.g. lignin, carboxymethylcellulose or <b>xylan.</b> In a few cases, the plasmodia acquired salt tolerance or tolerance of heavy metals through this association.|$|E
5|$|Some Tremella species produce polysaccharides {{that are}} of {{interest}} to the medical field, because of their biological activity; several patents have been filed in China pertaining to the use of these compounds for cancer prevention or immune system enhancement. In 1966, Slodki reported discovering an acidic polysaccharide from haploid cells of T.mesenterica that closely resembled those produced by the species Cryptococcus laurentii. The structural similarity of the polysaccharides from the two species suggested a phylogenetic relationship between them. Subsequently, researchers chemically synthesized the polysaccharide, and determined the chemical identities of the component sugar units. The polysaccharide, known as glucuronoxylomannan—produced by fruit bodies and in pure culture conditions—has been shown to consist of a mannan backbone that is glycosylated with <b>xylan</b> chains in a regular repeating structure. Laboratory tests have associated a number of biological activities with T.mesenterica glucuronoxylomannan, including immunostimulatory, protecting against radiation, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, hypocholesterolemic, hepatoprotective, and antiallergic effects.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified <b>xylan</b> and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E
30|$|In {{comparison}} with hydrolysis experiments performed on <b>xylans,</b> total yields of xylose release {{were more important}} for hydrolysis of <b>xylans</b> in presence of Avicel. This {{could be explained by}} a loading of enzymatic proteins 6.6 -folds more important for hydrolysis of Avicel in presence of <b>xylans</b> compared to enzymes loading for <b>xylans</b> hydrolysis. Globally, when hydrolysis was conducted simultaneously onto cellulose and <b>xylans,</b> release of glucose was decreased compared to action onto separated Avicel. This indicates a lesser efficiency of cellulases in this case. Recent studies revealed that xylose, XOs and <b>xylans</b> have a negative impact during hydrolysis of cellulose with cellulases. For XOs, their negative impact during cellulose hydrolysis with cellulases was reported in numerous studies (Hu et al. 2013; Shi et al. 2011). XOs inhibitory effect is higher than the one obtained in presence of xylose (Qing et al. 2010). A mixture of XOs from DP 7 to 16 was recovered from hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw (Kont et al. 2013) and these oligosaccharides induced an inhibitory effect 100 -fold more important on CBH from T. reesei than cellobiose. By mimicking the structure of cellulose chain, these oligosaccharides bind the active site of CBHs (Kont et al. 2013). Competitive inhibition seems to be partly responsible of the negative impact of XOs on cellulases efficiency (Qing et al. 2010) notably on CBHI (Zhang and Viikari 2012). Structural resolution of the CBH Cel 7 A from Hypocrea jecorina complexed with XOs indicated that xylotriose, xylotetraose and xylopentaose bind predominantly to the entrance of the substrate-binding tunnel of the enzyme and that an second alternative binding mode occurs near the catalytic center of the enzyme (Momeni et al. 2015). The data obtained during hydrolysis of Avicel in presence of <b>xylans,</b> indicate that a larger proportion of residual cellulose and a lesser extent part of <b>xylans</b> could remain in reactional media. Previous experiments demonstrated that presence of <b>xylans</b> was a factor decreasing cellulases efficiency notably by limiting cellulose accessibility (Penttilä et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2012; Zhang and Viikari 2014). This could be attributed to the adsorption of <b>xylans</b> chains onto cellulose surface (Kohnke et al. 2008, 2011). One could not exclude that binding of <b>xylans</b> chains into the active site of cellulases occurs leading to their inhibition (Zhang et al. 2012).|$|R

Antevendo alterações no cenário produtivo da indústria da pasta celulósica, a investigação científica tem desenvolvido trabalhos na área dos produtos alternativos ao papel de valor acrescentado, como a pasta solúvel e celulose micro-fibrilada (CMF), cuja produção pressupõe a eliminação das hemiceluloses mais abundantes da pasta (xilanas). Sendo o E. globulus a espécie de madeira mais usada no processamento da pasta celulósica kraft nacional, há um crescente interesse no desenvolvimento desses produtos a partir da pasta celulósica kraft branca dessa espécie. Nesse âmbito, o isolamento, a caracterização química e estrutural das xilanas, presentes na pasta branca, revelam-se muito importantes para o seu processamento {{posterior}} visando igualmente produtos de valor acrescentado. Sendo assim, este trabalho teve dois objetivos principais: 1. º) avaliação do perfil de extração alcalina das xilanas da pasta branca kraft do E. globulus com solução de hidróxido de sódio; 2. º) caracterização química e estrutural das xilanas isoladas. Foi determinado o teor de pentosanas removido e os parâmetros correspondentes que resultaram numa melhor relação entre a taxa máxima de remoção e o rendimento de xilana: extração com solução de NaOH 10 % durante 1 hora. No entanto, dependendo do processamento posterior das xilanas e para dar resposta ao interesse industrial, foi igualmente estudado o tempo da extração alcalina com NaOH a 5 %, concentração que resultou no teor de pentosanas removido em cerca de 70 % do máximo encontrado com NaOH 10 %. As xilanas extraídas com diferentes tempos de extração e com hidróxido de sódio de concentração 5 % e 10 % foram caracterizadas quimicamente e estruturalmente através de análise de açúcares neutros e por metanólise ácida, RMN 1 D e 2 D e os pesos moleculares determinados através de SEC. A pureza das xilanas extraídas foi avaliada através da análise dos monossacarídeos neutros que demonstraram teores de xilose compreendidos entre 93, 5 % e 99, 6 %. Nas xilanas resultantes da extração com NaOH 10 %, os teores de glucose apresentaram-se entre 2. 3 % e 6. 5 %. O elevado grau de pureza de todas as amostras de xilanas isoladas e a previsível co-precipitação da β- e γ-celulose na extração com NaOH 10 % foram confirmados através de metanólise ácida. Através de RMN de 1 H foi possível observar, em todas as amostras de xilanas da pasta branca kraft, os sinais normalmente correspondentes às ressonâncias dos protões anoméricos das unidades urónicas (MeGlcA e MeGlcA- 2 Gal) e da cadeia polimérica principal da xilana, concluindo-se a concordância da suaestrutura face às condições extractivas. As estruturas de xilanas foram confirmadas através de RMN de 13 C e técnicas RMN bidimensionais. Através de SEC, as amostras extraídas com NaOH 10 % apresentaram um peso molecular ligeiramente superior às amostras extraídas com NaOH 5 %. Foi também demonstrada a tendência para o seu aumento até às 2 horas de extração, tempo a partir do qual aumenta o risco de degradação e conversão em derivados com menor peso molecular. Em conclusão, este trabalho permitiu, por um lado, optimizar o perfil de extração alcalina e, por outro, dar um contributo para o conhecimento das características estruturais das xilanas da pasta branca kraft do E. globulus, informação importante per se e fundamental para a I&D do seu processamento posterior, trabalhos associados já a decorrer e futuros. The {{paper and}} pulping industry {{have an important}} contribution to the Portuguese industry, representing 4, 5 % of the industrial GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Anticipating changes in the productive scenario of the cellulosic pulping industry, research has been developing studies on alternative products to the value added products, as soluble pulp and microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), which production presumes the elimination of the more abundant hemicelluloses in the pulp (<b>xylans).</b> As the E. globulus is the most used specie in the national processing of cellulosic kraft pulp, there is an increasing interest in the developing of those products from the bleached cellulosic kraft pulp of this specie. Therefore, the isolation, the chemical and the structural characterisation of the <b>xylans</b> present in the bleached pulp are very important for its afterwards processing, having as scope value added products. This work had two main goals: 1. st) evaluation of the alkaline extraction profile of the <b>xylans</b> present in the kraft bleached pulp of the E. globulus with sodium hydroxide solution; 2. nd) chemical and structural characterisation of the isolated <b>xylans.</b> It had been determined the pentosans pulp content and the parameters which showed a better correlation between the maximum solubility value and the <b>xylans</b> extraction yield: extraction with a 10 % NaOH solution for one hour. However, depending on the afterwards processing of the <b>xylans,</b> and to respond to the industrial interest on the subject, it had also been studied the kinetics of the alkaline extraction with a 5 % solution of NaOH, which removed a pentosans content of around 70 % of the maximum obtained with a 10 % NaOH solution. The <b>xylans</b> extracted with different extraction times, and 5 % and 10 % of sodium hydroxide solutions, were chemically and structurally characterised using neutral sugars analysis and acid methanolysis, NMR 1 D and 2 D, and its molecular weights were determined using SEC. The <b>xylans</b> purity was evaluated by the neutral viiionosaccharides analysis, which showed <b>xylans</b> contents between 93, 5 % and 96. 6 %. The <b>xylans</b> extracted with NaOH 10 % solution presented glucose contents in the range 93, 5 % - 99, 6 %. The high purity level of all isolated <b>xylans</b> samples, and the expected co-precipitation of the β- e γ-cellulose in the extraction with NaOH 10 % solution, were confirmed with acid methanolysis. The 1 H NMR of all <b>xylans</b> extracted from the bleached kraft pulp showed the signals usually corresponding to the resonance of the anomeric protons of the uronic units (MeGlcA and MeGlc- 2 Gal), and of the main polymeric chain of the <b>xylans,</b> which showed the independence of the structure from the extraction conditions. The <b>xylans</b> structures were confirmed by 13 C NMR and bidimensional NMR analyses. SEC results showed that the <b>xylans</b> extracted with NaOH 10 % solution have a molecular weight slightly higher than the samples extracted with NaOH 5 %. It had also been showed that the <b>xylans</b> molecular weight tends to increase until two hours of extraction time reaction. After two hours, it started increasing the risk of degradation and conversion into lower molecular weight compounds. In conclusion, this work not only allowed to optimise the alkaline extraction profile, but also gave a contribution to the knowledge of the structural characteristics of the <b>xylans</b> of the bleached kraft pulp from the E. globulus. This information is important per se and essential for the R&D of the afterwards processing of the pulp, ongoing and future works.

In this context, the characterization of enzymatic cocktails was based on the measurement of enzymatic activities (FPU, β-glucosidase, xylanase, β-xylosidase) supposed to play an essential role during cellulose and <b>xylans</b> hydrolysis. As beechwood <b>xylans</b> used for enzymatic hydrolysis experiments contain few arabinose (< 1  % DM) and no esterified groups (acetyl, feruloyl), arabinosidase and esterases activities were not quantified.|$|R
