5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is thought to}} be caused by a mutation in a gene on the <b>X</b> <b>chromosome.</b> A 2007 study concluded, based on analysis of microsatellite markers (small gene sequences found in common among individuals having the same ethnicity, ancestry or genetic disease) of the family described by Keipert, that this gene was likely located on the long arm of the <b>X</b> <b>chromosome</b> between positions Xq22.2q28. This is not definitive, however, and no specific gene has been named.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} has 38 diploid chromosomes. However, unlike {{others in the}} {{subfamily}} Tragelaphinae, the <b>X</b> <b>chromosome</b> and Y chromosome are compound and each is fused with one of two identical autosomes.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. When a female carries a mutated gene {{on one of her}} two copies of the <b>X</b> <b>chromosome,</b> there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but will not herself have the associated disease. However, a son who inherits the mutation will have the disease; this is because males have only one copy of the <b>X</b> <b>chromosome</b> and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E
25|$|Then, in 1959 Susumu Ohno {{proved that}} these satellite-like {{structures}} found exclusively in female cells were actually derived from female <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> He called these structures Barr bodies {{after one of}} the investigators who originally documented their existence. Ohno’s studies of Barr bodies in female mammals with multiple <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> revealed that such females used Barr bodies to inactivate all but one of their <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Thus, Ohno described the “n-1” rule to predict the number of Barr bodies in a female with n number of <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in her karyotype.|$|R
5000|$|XXXX {{syndrome}} (also called tetrasomy X, quadruple X, or 48, XXXX) {{is a rare}} chromosomal disorder {{caused by}} the presence of four <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> instead of two <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{polymorphic}} site {{exists in}} exon 11 of G 6 PD: in the wild-type enzyme, nucleotide (NT) 1311 is a C, but is some individuals from diverse populations a T is present instead. Nine of 54 <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> from Europeans of mixed origins, nine of 41 <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, three of 18 <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of Sicilians, five of 20 African <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and nine of 20 Asian Indian <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> had the mutant genotype. In contrast, the mutation {{was found in}} only three of 59 Oriental <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and in three of 30 Central/South American <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> The mutation was absent from four samples of chimpanzee DNA. Twenty-one of 22 male subjects from Mediterranean countries who had the G 6 PD Mediterranean 563 T genotype investigated {{in the present study}} or reported previously had a T at NT 1311. Only one had the normal C at NT 1311. In contrast, both G 6 PD Mediterranean 563 T males from the Indian subcontinent had the normal C at NT 1311. These findings suggest that the same mutation at nucleotide 563 giving rise to G 6 PD Mediterranean may have arisen independently in Europe and in Asia...|$|R
5|$|The {{dromedary}} has 74 diploid chromosomes, {{the same}} as other camelids. The autosomes consist of five pairs of small to medium-sized metacentrics and submetacentrics.

5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that a gene for aposematism might be recessive and located on the <b>X</b> <b>chromosome.</b> If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E
5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} non-coding RNAs {{are always}} polyadenylated {{at the end}} of transcription. There are small RNAs where the poly(A) tail is seen only in intermediary forms and not in the mature RNA as the ends are removed during processing, the notable ones being microRNAs. But, for many long noncoding RNAs– a seemingly large group of regulatory RNAs that, for example, includes the RNA Xist, which mediates <b>X</b> <b>chromosome</b> inactivation– a poly(A) tail is part of the mature RNA.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{molecular}} basis of G 6 PD deficiency in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Further emphasis {{will be presented}} on the genetic polymorphism at nucleotide 1311 for both normal and deficient subjects. Methods: DNA extraction was done for 83 G 6 PD-deficient subjects and 80 normal controls. A combination of PCR-RFLP and PCR-DGGE procedures were employed to uncover the sequence variations at nt 563 (C/T) (G 6 PD Mediterranean) and at nt 1311 (C/T) polymorphism in both subjects with deficient and normal G 6 PD activity. Results: Ninety-one percent (93 / 102) of the <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> from G 6 PD deficient patients had nt 563 (C-T) mutation (G 6 PD Med), whereas ~ 9 % of the <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> from G 6 PD deficient subjects might have other G 6 PD variant(s) (or normal <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in heterozygote females). Niney-six percent (89 / 93) of the G 6 PD Med-bearing <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> showed thymine (T) at nucleotide position 1311.

5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a {{regulatory}} system similar to RNA interference. Antisense RNAs are widespread; most downregulate a gene, {{but a few}} are activators of transcription. One way antisense RNA can act is by binding to an mRNA, forming double-stranded RNA that is enzymatically degraded. There are many long noncoding RNAs that regulate genes in eukaryotes, one such RNA is Xist, which coats one <b>X</b> <b>chromosome</b> in female mammals and inactivates it.|$|E
5|$|The animal has a {{karyotype}} of 46 chromosomes, with a {{total of}} 50 major arms on the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes). The <b>X</b> <b>chromosome</b> is submetacentric (with one arm slightly longer than the other) and the Y chromosome is small and acrocentric (with one very short and one long arm). The karyotype is conserved among species of Miniopterus; the number of chromosomes and arms is identical in M.griveaudi, the Malagasy M.aelleni and M.gleni, and even the Asian M.fuliginosus.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} contains 52chromosomes with a {{total of}} 58major arms (2n=52, FN=58). The non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) are mostly acrocentric, having a long and a short arm, or telocentric, having only one arm, but there are also three large metacentric pairs, which have two major arms, and a small metacentric pair. The Y chromosome is metacentric and the <b>X</b> <b>chromosome</b> is variable, ranging from nearly metacentric to acrocentric in five specimens studied.|$|E

5|$|The addax has 29 {{pairs of}} {{chromosomes}}. All chromosomes are acrocentric {{except for the}} first pair of autosomes, which are submetacentric. The <b>X</b> <b>chromosome</b> is {{the largest of the}} acrocentric chromosomes, and the Y chromosome is medium-sized. The short and long arms of the pair of submetacentric autosomes correspond respectively to the 27th and 1st chromosomes in cattle and goats. In a study, the banding patterns of chromosomes in addax were found to be similar to those in four other species of the subfamily Hippotraginae.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} {{in the blue}} wildebeest is 58. Chromosomes were studied in a male and a female wildebeest.

Metaphases were studied in the male's chromosomes, and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well, similar to those in the female both in size and morphology. the rest were acrocentric. The <b>X</b> <b>chromosome</b> is a large acrocentric while the Y chromosome a minute one.|$|E
40|$|The {{repair of}} {{mismatched}} heteroduplex DNA has {{been implicated in}} the normal resolution of meiotic exchange events. Although sequence microheterogeneity over defined intervals of homologous chromosomes has been correlated with local effects on recombination, this correlation has not previously been extended to effects on chromosomal levels of exchange. In {{order to determine the}} role of microheterogeneity in normal exchange between homologs, a system was devised for monitoring exchange between isogenic <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Lack of microheterogeneity did not significantly alter the frequency of exchange along the isogenic <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> relative to controls or to previously reported values.

25|$|This {{pattern of}} dosage compensation, caused by random X-inactivation, is {{regulated}} across development in female mammals, following concerted patterns throughout development; for example, {{at the beginning}} of most female mammal development, both <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are initially expressed, but gradually undergo epigenetic processes to eventually achieve random inactivation of one X. In germ cells, inactivated <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are then once again activated to ensure their expression in gametes produced by female mammals.|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the human and}} mouse <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> to systematically test Ohno's law, which states that the gene content of <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> is conserved across placental mammals. First, we improved {{the accuracy of the}} human X-chromosome reference sequence through single-haplotype sequencing of ampliconic regions. The new sequence closed gaps in the reference sequence, corrected previously misassembled regions and identified new palindromic amplicons. Our subsequent analysis led us to conclude that the evolution of human and mouse <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> was bimodal. In accord with Ohno's law, 94 – 95 % of X-linked single-copy genes are shared by humans and mice; most are expressed in both sexes. Notably, most X-ampliconic genes are exceptions to Ohno's law: only 31 % of human and 22 % of mouse X-ampliconic genes had orthologs in the other species. X-ampliconic genes are expressed predominantly in testicular germ cells, and many were independently acquired since divergence from the common ancestor of humans and mice, specializing portions of their <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> for sperm production.

5|$|The {{karyotype}} includes 80 chromosomes with a {{total of}} 86 major arms (2n=80; FN=86). The <b>X</b> <b>chromosome</b> is subtelocentric (with one pair of long arms and one pair of short arms) and the Y chromosome is acrocentric (with only one pair of arms, or with a minute second pair). Among the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), the four metacentric or submetacentric (with two pairs of arms as long as or not much shorter than the other) pairs of chromosomes are small, and the 35 pairs of acrocentrics range from large to small. Some of those have a minute second pair of arms and could also be classified as subtelocentric, which would raise FN to 90. This karyotype is similar to other known karyotypes of members of Euryoryzomys.|$|E

The gall bladder is absent, a synapomorphy (shared-derived character) of Oryzomyini. The karyotype includes 56chromosomes and a fundamental number of 60chromosomal arms (2n=56, FN=60). The form of the sex chromosomes {{has been used to}} distinguish the marsh rice rat from Oryzomys couesi, but may be too variable among Oryzomys species to be useful in differentiating them. <b>X</b> <b>chromosome</b> inactivation occurs in the marsh rice rat, though the animal lacks LINE-1 retrotransposons, which have been suggested as components of the inactivation process. Mutants with fused or additional molars and with light fur have been recorded in laboratory colonies; the abnormal molars are apparently the result of a single autosomal recessive mutation. At about 50%, hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells in the blood) is high in the marsh rice rat compared to other rodents; this may be an adaptation that enables the rice rat to increase oxygen capacity while swimming under water.|$|E

40|$|Tests for {{chemically}} induced nondisjunction {{and loss}} of the sex chromosomes in Drosophila were performed. Of 31 compounds tested four gave rise only to an increase of XO exceptions, indicating the induction of chromosome loss. Six compounds, all known spindle inhibitors (cokchicine, organic mercury, leand, and tin compounds) gave rise to an increase both of XXY and XO or of only XXY. The effect by metalloorganic compounds of which methylmercury was studied particularly closely, folows a peculiar pattern. In females with structurally normal <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> only an increase of XX gametes is obtained, while with <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> heterozygous for long inversions only 0 gametes are increased. The data indicates that the effect ofthe metal compounds occurs at first meiosis and that the process is connected with a meiotic drive, giving rise to a preferential segregation of the two <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> to the functioning pole. The increase only of 0 gametes with structurally heterozygous <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> can tentatively be explained by a loss due to crosig over within the inversion. An increase {{of the effect of}} methyl mercury was obtained where the normal pairing of the <b>X</b> <b>chromosomes</b> was interfered with by means of autosomal inversions. Likewise a synergisdc increase of nondisjunction was obtained when a temperature chock of 10 °C was appled together with treatment with methylmercury.
