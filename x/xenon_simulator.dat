Multi-junction cells demand higher fidelity of a solar simulator than do single junction cells, due to a need for close spectral matching as well as AM 0 intensity.

Some previous studies, using sunlamps emitting nonsolar-spectrum UV or excessive UV doses, {{have questioned the}} ability of sunscreens to prevent UV-induced immune suppression. Our study evaluated the immune protection capacities of commercial sunscreen lotions {{in relation to the}} effects of UV spectrum and dose. C 3 H mice were exposed to a fixed UV dose from Kodacel-filtered FS sunlamps that caused maximum Langerhans cell depletion and suppression of CH. Kodacel film blocks UV energy below 290 nm, thus eliminating immune-suppressive effects of UVC (200 - 290 nm) not present in sunlight. CH was equally suppressed in unprotected and placebo-lotion-treated, UV-exposed mice. Mice protected with sun protection factor (SPF) - 15 and SPF- 30 sunscreens mounted normal CH responses. SPF- 4 and SPF- 8 sunscreen-protected mice had CH responses significantly greater than those of unprotected mice. Direct effects of UV spectral differences on the immune protection value of an SPF- 15 sunscreen were determined by exposing mice to UV radiation from unfiltered and Kodacel-filtered sunlamps and a 1000 -W <b>xenon</b> lamp solar <b>simulator</b> (UV spectrum nearly equivalent to sunlight). The sunscreen immune protection value was 30 times the minimum immune suppression dose for the solar simulator, while being 7. 5 times this dose for Kodacel-filtered and 2 times the dose for unfiltered sunlamps.

The experiments were performed also on ascorbic acid 	 at the same concentration. Human HaCaT keratinocytes were grown in 3, 5 cm 2 plates containing complete medium (DMEM with 10 % fetal calf serum). Thirty minutes before UV radiation, medium was removed and replaced by PBS with or without the antioxidants.

In-situ FT-IR spectroscopy was used to monitor most reactants and products. Most experiments used dry air, except for the HBr + O 3 runs with varying humidity. Ozone was found to react with HBr with an apparent rate constant of 4 x 10 - 19 cm 3 molec - 1 s - 1, with the data suggesting that HOBr is formed in the initial reaction, but that it reacts with HBr to form Br 2, with a rate constant of at least 3. 5 x 10 - 15 cm 3 molec - 1 s - 1. Humidity affected the HBr wall loss rate but did not affect the apparent O 3 + HBr rate constant, suggesting that the reaction of HBr with O 3 may not be surface dependent.

40|$|Solar {{energy is}} a {{sustainable}} resource which has substantial potential {{to meet the}} increasing demand for renewable energy. Though {{there has been some}} success in harvesting solar energy for electricity production, converting solar energy to chemical energy as fuels is still a challenge due to low efficiency. Since the discovery of TiO 2 photocatalysts for splitting water (4) and reducing CO 2 (5) to form useful chemical feedstock such as H 2, CO and CH 4, much research has been done to increase the efficiency of photocatalysts. However, the current conversion efficiency of photocatalysts remains low (~ 5 %) (6, 7). Issues being addressed include the wide bandgap and mismatched band edge for reactions (thermodynamic energy for reaction), poor quantum efficiency of the photon collector systems, high recombination of e-/h+ pairs and limitation in the rate of charge transfer from photocatalyst to reactants. This work focuses on improving efficiency of photocatalysts for fuel production through several approaches: (1) engineering a metal-organic-framework (MOF) to have proper band gaps and band edges for targeted reactions and for enhancing photoadsorption in the visible light range, (2) tuning an ABO 3 -type perovskite for desired bandgaps and thermodynamically favored bandedges for CO 2 reduction with water in visible light range. A porphyrin-based Ti-MOF is studied for CO 2 photoreduction to gaseous chemical fuels such as CH 4 and CO. The porphyrin linkers allow porphyrin-based MOF- 525 to achieve narrow bandgap (Eg = ~ 1. 7 eV) to absorb visible light, indicating its ability to harvest more solar energy than conventional TiO 2. Ti/Zr-MOF- 525 also exhibited the appropriate energy level alignment for CO 2 and H 2 O redox reaction for CO and CH 4 production. Its CO 2 photoreactivity under visible light was demonstrated in a photoreaction, illuminated by 150 W <b>Xenon</b> solar <b>simulator.</b> Interestingly, Ti/Zr-MOF- 525 demonstrates a selectivity toward CH 4, a more valuable fuels than CO. The gas phase reaction condition is an advance over liquid photoreaction. The catalyst stability was also studied and presented. After 3 cycles of reactions, Ti/Zr-MOF- 525 is relatively stable for CO 2 photoreduction and able to maintain its photoreactivity at about 60 - 65 % of fresh catalyst. The reduction of reactivity is due to a less stable fresh catalyst. When investigating LaCr 1 -xFexO 3 perovskite oxides for photocatalyst, it was found that when replacing Cr ions at the B sites of LaCrO 3 by Fe ions, the bandgap does not follow a linear trend in regards to metal ratio composition but rather reflects the smaller bandgap of LaFeO 3. Bandedges were successfully measured for the new synthesized materials. At x = 0. 25, the conduction band potential remains similar with x = 0. However, at x = 0. 75, the conduction band potential was more negative than either perovskites at x = 0 or x = 1. Future simulation of density of state could address this interesting observation. CO 2 reduction relativities of each perovskites were predicted well by their measured bandgaps and bandedges. Among five studied perovskites, synthesized LaCr 0. 25 Fe 0. 75 O 3 (x = 0. 75) is the most active for CO 2 photoreduction under visible illumination at room temperature thanks to its small bandgap (2. 0 eV) and its suitable bandedges for CO 2 photoreduction...|$|R
