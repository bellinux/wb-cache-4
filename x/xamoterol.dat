To study the acute hemodynamic effects of <b>xamoterol,</b> 24 patients, 39 - 70 years old, with mild-to-moderate postinfarction left ventricular dysfunction entered a double-blind, between-patient comparison of a single 5 -minute intravenous infusion of <b>xamoterol</b> (0. 2 mg/kg) and placebo. The acute hemodynamic effects of <b>xamoterol</b> were measured at rest and during two multistaged symptom-limited supine bicycle exercise tests (Ex-T), a control Ex-T followed by an Ex-T with either <b>xamoterol</b> or placebo.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} effects of the new β 1 {{adrenoceptor}} partial agonist, <b>xamoterol,</b> on neuroendocrine activity after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Fifty-one consecutive patients with AMI were randomized to treatment with <b>xamoterol,</b> 200 mg twice a day, or placebo; patients were also stratified {{as to whether or not}} diuretic therapy was given for left ventricular dysfunction. Noradrenalin, plasma renin activity (PRA), and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were measured over a 10 -day period. Noradrenalin concentrations are higher (p &# 60; 0. 05) in patients treated with diuretics at the time of admission and fell over the subsequent 10 days (p &# 60; 0. 01). Treatment with <b>xamoterol</b> did not affect this noradrenalin response to myocardial infarction. PRA was also significantly higher in the patients treated with diuretics, and there was a nonsignificant trend for <b>xamoterol</b> to blunt the PRA response in these patients. There was no difference in ANF levels between those patients who were treated with diuretics and those who were not; <b>xamoterol</b> did not affect ANF. Thus <b>xamoterol</b> does not further elevate noradrenalin levels as do conventional beta blockers, and it does not activate the renin-angiotensin system as do potent nonselective beta agonists. Furthermore, <b>xamoterol</b> does not increase ANF levels, probably because it is not negatively inotropic.

40|$|Chronic {{therapy with}} the beta 1 {{selective}} partial agonist <b>xamoterol</b> is {{not associated with}} the tolerance seen with agonists of greater intrinsic activity. In order to investigate whether this {{could be explained by}} the effect of <b>xamoterol</b> on the in vivo regulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors, 2 studies have been performed. 40 right atrial biopsies were obtained from 55 patients prospectively randomised in a double blind fashion to receive either <b>xamoterol</b> or the beta 1 selective antagonist atenolol (previously shown to upregulate beta 1 -adrenoceptors and enhance beta 2 mediated responses) for at least 5 weeks prior to treatment groups but basal and stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were significantly lower in the <b>xamoterol</b> group. Ethical constraints prevented the inclusion of a placebo control group, but data from a small group of patients taking neither drug suggested that the <b>xamoterol</b> group had higher adenylate cyclase activities than patients not treated with this drug. Thus <b>xamoterol</b> did not downregulate human cardiac beta-adrenoceptors and is unlikely to have desensitised adenylate cyclase responses. The lack of a placebo control group and the inability to demonstrate the coupling of beta 1 -adrenoceptors to adenylate cyclase limited the human study. A complementary rat model was therefore used. Rats were infused for 6 days with either <b>xamoterol</b> or the full agonist isoprenaline using sham operated animals for control. Unlike isoprenaline, <b>xamoterol</b> infusion did not downregulate cardiac beta-adrenoceptors, and although it selectively densensitised beta 1 mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase, it did so significantly less than isoprenaline which also desensitised beta 2 -adrenoceptor responses. Thus <b>xamoterol</b> desensitised beta-adrenoceptor mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase significantly less than isoprenaline.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>xamoterol</b> and (-) -isoprenaline have been {{compared}} for their activity at beta-adrenoceptor sites {{in a number}} of in vitro cardiac and smooth muscle preparations. <b>Xamoterol</b> produced weak positive chronotropic effects in guinea-pig, rat and cat atria (intrinsic activity less than 0. 55, (-) -isoprenaline = 1). Positive inotropic effects were obtained in driven left atria of the cat but were absent in guinea-pig left atrial and right ventricular strip preparations. Agonistic effects were due to beta 1 -adrenoceptor stimulation. <b>Xamoterol</b> was without beta-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibitory effects in guinea-pig ileal, tracheal and uterine preparations and in the rat vas deferens and oestrogen-primed uterus. Weak beta 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation was obtained in progesterone-primed rat uteri. <b>Xamoterol</b> produced non-specific inhibitory effects in guinea-pig ileal and tracheal preparations. <b>Xamoterol</b> acted as a competitive antagonist at beta 1 -(pA 2 range = 7. 4 to 7. 8) and beta 2 -adrenoceptors (pA 2 range 5. 2 to 6. 2) and displaced [125 I]-iodocyanopindolol from guinea-pig left atrial (pKD = 7. 25) and uterine (pKD 5. 24) membrane preparations. It is concluded that <b>xamoterol</b> displays a selective affinity for beta 1 -adrenoceptors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} whether <b>xamoterol,</b> a partial agonist, would improve exercise time more than metoprolol {{in patients with}} mild to moderate heart failure after a myocardial infarction. DESIGN [...] Single-centre double blind randomised parallel group comparison of metoprolol 50 - 100 mg and <b>xamoterol</b> 100 - 200 mg twice daily. PATIENTS [...] 210 patients aged 40 - 80 years (173 men) with clinical evidence of heart failure early after a myocardial infarction. 106 were given metoprolol and 104 <b>xamoterol.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Exercise test results and performance at three months; the exercise test, quality of life, and clinical assessments at baseline (5 - 7 days after the infarction) and after 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS [...] Exercise time increased at three months by 22 % in the metoprolol group and 29 % in the <b>xamoterol</b> group, but with {{no significant difference between}} the groups. Patients taking <b>xamoterol</b> showed overall non-significantly higher mean values of exercise time achieved with higher heart rates at rest and exercise. Improvements in quality of life, clinical signs of heart failure, and New York Heart Association functional class were seen in both treatment groups over one year, with minor benefits of <b>xamoterol</b> on breathlessness, peripheral oedema, and functional class. Eighteen patients taking metoprolol and 22 taking <b>xamoterol</b> withdrew from the study during one year, with a low mortality, reinfarction rate, and progress of heart failure in both treatment groups. Mean dose from baseline to 3 months was 135 mg metoprolol and 347 mg <b>xamoterol.</b> CONCLUSION [...] beta 1 Receptor antagonists with or without partial agonist activity are safe to use in mild to moderate heart failure after a myocardial infarction. Exercise tolerance, quality of life, and clinical signs and functional class of heart failure improve, and few patients show deterioration in their condition. Exercise tolerance is no better with <b>xamoterol</b> than metoprolol...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to verify our previous hypothesis that carteolol, a beta(1) /beta(2) -adrenoceptor-blocking agent, is a nonconventional partial agonist of cardiac beta(1) -adrenoceptors. To this purpose, we characterized the effects of carteolol in guinea pig myocardial preparations and measured the affinities of carteolol for high- and low-affinity sites of beta 1 -adrenoceptors labeled by CGP 12177 [(-) 4 -(3 -t-butylamino- 2 -hydroxypropoxy) - 2 -benzimidazol- 2 -one]. All experiments were performed in comparison with <b>xamoterol,</b> a cardioselective beta(1) -adrenoceptor partial agonist. Both drugs caused cAMP-dependent positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, but carteolol was less effective and less potent than <b>xamoterol,</b> and its cardiac actions were not affected by conventional concentrations of the beta-blocker propranolol. Both carteolol and <b>xamoterol</b> antagonized the cardiac effects of isoprenaline, but although the antagonistic concentrations of <b>xamoterol</b> were almost equal to those producing cardiostimulation, the antagonistic concentrations of carteolol were 3 log units lower than those causing cardiostimulant effects. Both carteolol and <b>xamoterol</b> competed with (-) [H- 3]CGP 12177 for a high-affinity site of beta(1) -adrenoceptors, but carteolol showed a higher affinity than <b>xamoterol.</b> Moreover, carteolol, unlike <b>xamoterol,</b> bound also to a low-affinity site of the receptors. The binding affinity constants of the drugs for the high- affinity site correlated well with the respective blocking potencies against isoprenaline, whereas the affinity constant of carteolol for the low-affinity site was well related to its agonist potency. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that carteolol, unlike <b>xamoterol,</b> is a nonconventional partial agonist, which causes agonistic effects through interaction with the low-affinity propranolol-resistant site of beta(1) -adrenoceptors and antagonistic actions through the high- affinity site of the same receptors...|$|E

The results of this study show that <b>xamoterol</b> is a safe and effective treatment for left ventricular dysfunction resulting from ischaemic heart disease...|$|E
40|$|Myocardial {{oxygen uptake}} and {{an index of}} {{mechanical}} left ventricular efficiency were determined in basal conditions or during prolonged therapy with the new beta 1 -adrenoceptor partial agonist <b>xamoterol</b> in 16 patients with mild to moderate ischemic heart failure. During <b>xamoterol</b> therapy, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 24. 4 +/- 6. 5 to 17. 8 +/- 8. 6 mm Hg (P less than 0. 01) and the isovolumic index of inotropic state (dP/dt) /DP 40 increased by 14 % (P less than 0. 01). The heart rate increased slightly and the mean systolic and peak systolic wall stress also tended to increase (+ 7 %; NS) but myocardial oxygen uptake (14. 1 vs 14. 7 ml/min; NS) and the index of efficiency (8. 77 +/- 3. 44 to 8. 82 +/- 4. 27; NS) were not significantly modified. In conclusion, prolonged therapy with <b>xamoterol</b> was not accompanied by a deterioration in the mechanical efficiency of the ventricle, even in patients with ischemic heart disease...|$|E
40|$|Following 4 {{weeks on}} placebo, {{eighteen}} patients with bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome (BTS) {{were treated with}} 100 mg <b>xamoterol</b> twice daily for 2 - 4 weeks. Ambulatory 24 h Holter electrocardiogram recordings showed that <b>xamoterol</b> decreased maximum heart rate from 140 +/- 5. 1 to 107 +/- 6 beats min- 1 (P < 0. 001) during exercise, increased minimum heart rate from 43 +/- 1. 7 to 51 +/- 2. 4 beats min- 1 (P < 0. 005) at night and shortened maximum duration of sinus arrest from 3438 +/- 484 to 1767 +/- 202 ms (P < 0. 005) in BTS. Symptomatically, patients reported that palpitations were improved and syncopal attacks disappeared. Although the study has the limitation of an open design, effects of treatment were objectively evaluated using Holter monitoring by investigators who reviewed the recordings in a blinded manner. The findings suggest that <b>xamoterol</b> {{may be useful in}} the treatment of BTS. Further studies are needed to evaluate fully its therapeutic potential in this condition...|$|E
40|$|<b>Xamoterol</b> 200 mg {{twice daily}} was given for 2 months to nine {{patients}} with severe heart failure already being treated with {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) inhibitors. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 28 to 13 mmHg and end-systolic volume fell from 115 to 106 ml m- 2; indices of contractility improved and ejection fraction rose from 33 to 38 %. The time constant of ventricular relaxation, T 1, improved from 62 to 44 ms. Exercise tolerance improved. Thus, in this group of patients with severe heart failure, <b>xamoterol</b> produced benefits in systolic and diastolic function. There were no adverse effects...|$|E
40|$|<b>Xamoterol</b> {{has been}} shown to reduce the {{frequency}} of oedema and lung crepitations in heart failure. We examined its effects on blood pressure and renal function in healthy volunteers. Systolic blood pressure rose, sodium and chloride excretion increased and there was a strong correlation in individual subjects between rises in systolic blood pressure and in sodium excretion. Although no changes in glomerular filtration rates were seen, changes sufficient to explain the observed rise in sodium excretion are well within the experimental error of this study. <b>Xamoterol</b> may increase sodium excretion by an action on renal haemodynamics...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of age, sex and <b>xamoterol</b> treatment on exercise capacity {{has been investigated}} in 705 heart failure patients {{who took part in}} a multicentre, placebo-controlled study. Regression analysis suggests that although less than 20 % of the total variation in exercise capacity between patients is explained by these factors, useful information may be gained by taking them into account. Exercise capacity declines with age, more rapidly in males than in females; the benefits of <b>xamoterol</b> are independent of age and sex. This approach demonstrates that exercise testing is a sensitive indicator of physical performance and allows the effects of treatment to be seen in context...|$|E
40|$|<b>Xamoterol</b> ('Corwin', 'Carwin', 'Corwil', 'Xamtol', ICI 118, 587) *, {{a partial}} beta-agonist, has {{beneficial}} effects {{in patients with}} mild to moderate heart failure. In acute haemodynamic studies in more severe heart failure some patients have shown negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, although treatment with a partial agonist should protect the heart against excessive stimulation, while providing a baseline level of sympathetic drive. This study {{examined the effects of}} oral <b>xamoterol</b> in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. Ten patients were studied, nine with ischaemic heart disease. All but one were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class III. Other treatment, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, was continued. The patients underwent a standard bicycle exercise test, and the following day cardiac catheterization was performed to obtain measurements of ventricular size (by cineangiography) and pressures during the cardiac cycle. The patients began treatment with <b>xamoterol</b> 200 mg b. d. in addition to their baseline therapy, and this was continued for an average of 9 weeks, after which the exercise test and the haemodynamic investigations were repeated. At baseline, all patients had a raised left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and nine had a low election fraction, raised end-systolic and end-diastolic volume indices and reduced left ventricular (+) dP/dtmax <b>Xamoterol</b> produced a marked reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, a fall in end-systolic volume index and improvements in T 1, (+) dP/dtmax and (dP/dt) /DP 40 with no change in mean aortic pressure. Duration of exercise increased in four patients, and did not change in the other four tested. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
