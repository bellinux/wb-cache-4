5|$|<b>X-ray</b> <b>crystallography</b> {{is a form}} of elastic scattering; the {{outgoing}} X-rays have the same energy, and thus same wavelength, as the incoming X-rays, only with altered direction. By contrast, inelastic scattering occurs when energy is transferred from the incoming X-ray to the crystal, e.g., by exciting an inner-shell electron to a higher energy level. Such inelastic scattering reduces the energy (or increases the wavelength) of {{the outgoing}} beam. Inelastic scattering is useful for probing such excitations of matter, but not in determining the distribution of scatterers within the matter, which is the goal of <b>X-ray</b> <b>crystallography.</b>|$|E

5|$|Since the 1920s, X-ray {{diffraction}} {{has been}} the principal method for determining the arrangement of atoms in minerals and metals. The application of <b>X-ray</b> <b>crystallography</b> to mineralogy began with the structure of garnet, which was determined in 1924 by Menzer. A systematic X-ray crystallographic study of the silicates was undertaken in the 1920s. This study showed that, as the Si/O ratio is altered, the silicate crystals exhibit significant changes in their atomic arrangements. Machatschki extended these insights to minerals in which aluminium substitutes for the silicon atoms of the silicates. The first application of <b>X-ray</b> <b>crystallography</b> to metallurgy likewise occurred in the mid-1920s.

5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of <b>X-ray</b> <b>crystallography</b> is {{single-crystal}} X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. <b>X-ray</b> <b>crystallography</b> allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E
