In the present work we investigated {{the consequences of this}} type of binding of <b>xanomeline</b> on the binding characteristics and function of the M 1 muscarinic receptor. Pretreatment of CHO cells that stably express the M 1 receptor for 1 hr with increasing concentrations of <b>xanomeline</b> followed by washing and waiting for an additional 23 hr in control culture media transformed xanomeline-induced inhibition of [3 H]NMS binding from monophasic to biphasic.

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors {{are part of}} the G protein-coupled superfamily of receptors. There are five subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M 1 -M 5). These receptors are therapeutic targets for in a number of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. The orthosteric (primary) binding domain of muscarinic receptors is highly conserved across subtypes making it difficult to develop agonists or antagonists that bind with selectivity at a particular subtype. However, there are allosteric (secondary) binding sites on muscarinic receptors that are thought to be less well conserved between subtypes, which may lead to the development of drugs that bind in a subtype-selective manner. One potential drug of interest is <b>xanomeline.</b> Previous research has found that it binds in a unique manner to muscarinic receptors; it binds in a reversible manner at the orthosteric site and in a wash-resistant manner at an allosteric site. Furthermore, <b>xanomeline</b> is thought to be an M 1 /M 4 selective agonist. The goal of the current research was to characterize the effects of prolonged exposure of the various receptor subtypes to <b>xanomeline</b> and determine the mechanisms through which these effects occur. To do this Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the various individual muscarinic receptors were exposed to <b>xanomeline</b> for brief and long-term time periods and radioligand binding and functional assays were performed. <b>Xanomeline</b> was shown to bind in a reversible and wash-resistant manner at the M 1 -M 4 receptor subtypes. Although the effects of acute <b>xanomeline</b> exposure were similar across subtypes, long-term treatment with <b>xanomeline</b> resulted in differential effects among subtypes. More detailed experiments were conducted at the M 1 and M 3 receptor subtypes to elucidate the mechanisms of the long-term effects of <b>xanomeline.</b> Wash-resistant <b>xanomeline</b> binding was able to modulate the functional properties of the receptor. The consequences of the long-term effects of wash-resistant <b>xanomeline</b> binding are dependent on activation of the receptor through the orthosteric binding site. It appears that these effects are a result of receptor internalization and allosteric modulation of the receptor. Thus, my research demonstrates {{that it is important to}} determine both the acute and long-term drug interactions with the receptor as part of the drug development process...|$|E

The objective of this thesis is to compare long-term effects of short-term exposure of the muscarinic receptors to <b>xanomeline</b> among subtypes. There are two groups of muscarinic receptors that differ in their extracellular-to-intracellular signal transduction - the odd-numbered ones (M 1, M 3, M 5) preferentially couple to Gq/ 11 G-proteins, whereas even-numbered ones (M 2, M 4) couple mainly via Gi/o. CHO cells stably expressing individual muscarinic receptor subtypes were used for all experiments.

Impairment of muscarinic neurotransmission occurs in serious disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia or Parkinson's disease that are accompanied by cognitive decline mainly due to the disruption of M 1 receptor signaling in the brain.

Mutations of D 105 in the orthosteric binding site and mutation of D 99 located out of the orthosteric binding site decreased affinity of all tested agonists that was translated as a decrease in potency in accumulation of inositol phosphates and intracellular calcium mobilization.

The {{focus of the}} present study was to determine if M 1 receptors activated by allosteric agonists undergo the same regulatory fate as M 1 receptors activated by orthosteric agonists. Results The orthosteric agonists carbachol, oxotremorine-M and pilocarpine were compared to the allosteric agonists AC- 42, AC- 260584, N -desmethylclozapine and <b>xanomeline.</b> All ligands activated M 1 receptors and stimulated interaction of the receptors with β-arrestin- 1. All ligands reduced cell surface binding and induced the loss of total receptor binding. Receptor internalization was blocked by treatment with hypertonic sucrose indicating that all ligands induced formation of clathrin coated vesicles. However, internalized receptors recycled to the cell surface following removal of orthosteric, but not allosteric agonists. Whereas all ligands induced loss of cell surface receptor binding, no intracellular vesicles could be observed after treatment with AC- 260584 or <b>xanomeline.</b> Brief stimulation of M 1 receptors with AC- 260584 or <b>xanomeline</b> resulted in persistent activation of M 1 receptors, suggesting that continual receptor signaling might impede or delay receptor endocytosis into intracellular vesicles.

More importantly, we tested the hypothesis that muscarinic receptor agonists with varied receptor subtype selectivity can blunt cocaine's discriminative stimulus and reinforcing effects; we hypothesized a critical role for the M 1 and/or M 4 receptor subtypes in this modulation. Mice were trained to discriminate cocaine from saline, or to self-administer intravenous cocaine chronically. The nonselective muscarinic antagonists scopolamine and methylscopolamine, the nonselective muscarinic agonists oxotremorine and pilocarpine, the M 1 /M 4 -preferring agonist <b>xanomeline,</b> the putative M 1 -selective agonist (4 -hydroxy- 2 -butynyl) - 1 -trimethylammonium- 3 -chlorocarbanilate chloride (McN-A- 343), and the novel M 1 -selective agonist 1 -(1 - 2 -methylbenzyl) - 1, 4 -bipiperidin- 4 -yl) - 1 H benzo[d]imidazol- 2 (3 H) -one (TBPB) were tested as substitution and/or pretreatment to cocaine. Both muscarinic antagonists partially substituted for cocaine and enhanced its discriminative stimulus. Conversely, muscarinic agonists blunted cocaine discrimination and abolished cocaine self-administration with varying effects on food-maintained behavior. Specifically, increasing selectivity for the M 1 subtype (oxotremorine < <b>xanomeline</b> < TBPB) conferred lesser nonspecific rate-suppressing effects, with no rate suppression for TBPB. In mutant mice lacking M 1 and M 4 receptors, <b>xanomeline</b> failed to diminish cocaine discrimination while rate-decreasing effects were intact.

The M 1 muscarinic subtype, widely expressed post-synaptically in cortex and hippocampus, {{is involved in}} CNS disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Therefore, ligands selectively activating this receptor subtype {{can be useful in}} the treatment of AD. Numerous {{attempts have been made to}} generate M 1 -selective agonists, but many of these efforts have failed, because most muscarinic agents (i. e. <b>xanomeline)</b> recognize the orthosteric acethylcoline binding site highly conserved in all the five subtypes. Recent extensive mutagenesis studies highlighted that the significant M 1 preferential agonism displayed by 77 -LH- 28 - 1 [1] was consistent with an allosteric mode of interaction [2]. In this study, according to the hybrid molecule approach, novel muscarinic agonists have been designed, covalently connecting 77 -LH- 28 - 1 scaffold with <b>xanomeline</b> to obtain compounds potentially endowed with improved M 1 -selectivity and potency. The synthesis of the novel compounds and the preliminary pharmacological results, including the alcohol intermediates, will be discussed. References 1) Langmead, C. J.; Austin, N. E.; Branch, C.

40|$|The M 4 muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor (mAChR) is implicated in many {{central nervous system}} disorders, however, due to a highly conserved acetylcholine (ACh) binding orthosteric site, {{there is a lack}} of highly selective ligands as therapeutics and experimental probes for this target. There are two classes of functionally selective M 4 mAChR ligands, one being the allosteric modulators, typified by the small molecule LY 2033298 (3 -amino- 5 -chloro- 6 -methoxy- 4 -methyl-thieno[2, 3 -b]pyridine- 2 -carboxylic acid cyclopropylamide) (Chan et al., 2008), and the other being the atypical agonists, exemplified by <b>xanomeline</b> and McN-A- 343, whose mode of binding at the M 4 mAChR is not clear. Challenges to understanding the activity of these ligands include the interplay of binding, efficacy and, when considering allosteric modulation, cooperativity. Thus, to investigate the molecular determinants of allosteric and atypical agonist activity, site-directed mutagenesis was utilised in conjunction with radioligand assays, to determine the role of specific amino acid residues on affinity or binding cooperativity, and M 4 mAChR-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 / 2 phosphorylation, as a measure of efficacy or functional modulation by LY 2033298. The endogenous agonist, ACh was used as a control agonist. Chapter 2 focused on four different regions of the M 4 mAChR; extracellular loops (ECLs) 1, 2 and 3, and transmembrane domain (TM) 7. In the ECL 1, we identified Ile 93 (2. 65) and Lys 95 (2. 67) as key residues that specifically governed the signalling efficacy of LY 2033298 and its binding cooperativity with ACh, while Phe 186 (5. 29) in the ECL 2 was identified as a key contributor to the binding affinity of the modulator for the allosteric site. The highly conserved TM 7 residues, Tyr 439 (7. 39) and Tyr 443 (7. 43), were important for both McN-A- 343 and <b>xanomeline</b> affinity, while the ECL residues, Ile 93 (2. 65), Phe 186 (5. 29), Ser 428 (6. 63) and Asp 432 (7. 32) were detrimental to McN-A- 343 affinity. Ser 428 (6. 63) was exclusively involved in atypical agonist efficacy. In contrast, Tyr 439 (7. 39) and Tyr 443 (7. 43), were identified as contributing to a key activation switch utilized by all classes of agonists, except <b>xanomeline.</b> This initial study highlighted the general importance of aromatic residues for allosteric agonist activity, which led us to perform alanine scanning mutagenesis of selected aromatic residues in the top third the M 4 mAChR. Additionally, due to the importance of Phe 186 (5. 29) in allosteric agonist binding in the ECL 2, residues lining the proximal and distal ends of ECL 2 was also mutated. Results outlined in Chapter 3 showed that, Tyr 89 (2. 61) and Trp 435 (7. 35), on top of TM 2 and TM 7, respectively, were important for LY 2033298 binding. Tyr 89 (2. 61) was exclusively involved in LY 2033298 efficacy compared to the other ligands, while other TM 2 /ECL 1 residues also played a large role in LY 2033298 efficacy. Multiple residues clustered between the putative allosteric and orthosteric sites, on TM 2 /ECL 1 and TM 7, appear to form the conformational link for transmitting ACh-LY 2033298 cooperativity. Tyr 89 (2. 61) was particularly important for the positive binding cooperativity between ACh and LY 2033298. Only two residues (Tyr 89 (2. 61) and Tyr 439 (7. 39)) were identified to affect the functional modulation of ACh by LY 2033298 in the current thesis. Orthosteric binding site residues, Trp 164 (4. 57) and Trp 413 (6. 48), were global activation switches for both allosteric and orthosteric agonists. The final study, outlined in Chapter 4, characterised the activity of the atypical agonists at the second set of mutant M 4 mAChRs. It revealed that Trp 413 (6. 48) is a critical contact residue for <b>xanomeline,</b> while playing a smaller role in ACh and McN-A- 343 binding. In the distal ECL 2, Ile 187 (5. 30), may play a role in both <b>xanomeline</b> and McN-A- 343 binding, while Ile 187 (5. 30), Gln 188 (5. 31) and Phe 189 (5. 32) played a large role in McN-A- 343 efficacy. Trp 164 (4. 57) and Trp 413 (6. 48), like Tyr 439 (7. 39) and Tyr 443 (7. 43), were global activation switches for all three classes of agonists. These results provide new insights into the existence of multiple binding pockets and activation switches in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), some of which can be selectively exploited by allosteric and atypical agonists for future development of selective M 4 mAChR ligands, whereas others represent global activation mechanisms for all classes of ligand...|$|E

40|$|There {{are five}} subtypes of muscarinic receptors that serve various {{important}} physiological {{functions in the}} central nervous system and the periphery. Mental functions like attention, learning, and memory are attributed to the muscarinic M 1 subtype. These functions decline during natural aging and an early deficit is typical for Alzheimer´s disease. In addition, stimulation of the M 1 receptor increases non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein and thus prevents accumulation of noxious β-amyloid fragments. The selectivity of classical muscarinic agonists among receptor subtypes is very low due to the highly conserved nature of the orthosteric binding site among receptor subtypes. Herein we summarize some recent studies with the functionally-selective M 1 agonist <b>xanomeline</b> that indicate complex pharmacological profile of this drug that includes interactions with and activation of receptor from both orthosteric and ectopic binding sites, and the time-dependent changes of ligand binding and receptor activation. These findings point to potential profitability of exploitation of ectopic ligands in the search for truly selective muscarinic receptor agonists. Key word...|$|E
40|$|Atypical {{agonists}} of muscarinic receptors bind {{to individual}} receptor subtypes with comparable affinity but activate them selectively {{to a certain}} extent. Molecular mechanism underlying this "functional selectivity" is not known and its elucidation may contribute to development of new atypical functionally selective agonists suitable for therapeutic use. Functional selectivity of atypical muscarinic agonists {{may be caused by}} a distinct molecular mechanism(s) of how these compounds activate the receptor. Agonist-specific conformations induced by structurally complex atypical agonists may lead to utilization of a parallel activation mechanism that is different than the activation mechanism induced by non-selective classical agonists. In order to examine this possibility we investigated whether the M 1 receptor preferring atypical agonists <b>xanomeline</b> and N-desmethylclozapine, and the classical orthosteric agonists carbachol and oxotremorine, activate the M 1 receptor through a common cascade of transmission switches. To this end we mutated key amino acids of the M 1 receptor that are essential for ligand binding to the orthosteric binding site (D 1053. 32, D 993. 26), receptor activation (transmission switch, D 712. 50), or interaction with G-protein (ionic lock switch, R 1233. 50 D 1223. 49).

40|$|The muscarinic M- 1 {{receptor}} (M 1 R) {{is highly}} involved in cognition, and selective M- 1 agonists have procognitive properties. Loss of M 1 R {{has been found}} in postmortem brain tissue for several neuropsychiatric disorders and may be related to symptoms of cognitive dysfunction. I- 123 -iododexetimide is used for imaging muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchRs). Considering its high brain uptake and intense binding in M 1 R-rich brain areas, I- 123 -iododexetimide may be an attractive radiopharmaceutical to image M 1 R. To date, the binding affinity and selectivity of I- 123 -iododexetimide for the mAchR subtypes has not been characterized, nor has its brain distribution been studied intensively. Therefore, this study aimed to address these topics. Methods: The in vitro affinity and selectivity of I- 127 -iododexetimide (cold-labeled iododexetimide), as well as its functional antagonist properties (guanosine 5 '-[gamma- 35 S-thio] triphosphate [GTP gamma S- 35] assay), were assessed on recombinant human M 1 R-M 5 R. Distributions of I- 127 -iododexetimide and I- 123 -iododexetimide in the brain were evaluated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and storage phosphor imaging, respectively, ex vivo in rats, wild-type mice, and M- 1 -M- 5 knock-out (KO) mice. Inhibition of I- 127 -iododexetimide and I- 123 -iododexetimide binding in M 1 R-rich brain areas by the M 1 R/M 4 R agonist <b>xanomeline,</b> or the antipsychotics olanzapine (M 1 R antagonist) and haloperidol (low M 1 R affinity), was assessed in rats ex vivo. Results: In vitro, I- 127 -iododexetimide displayed high affinity for M 1 R (pM range), with modest selectivity over other mAchRs. In bio-distribution studies on rats, ex vivo I- 127 -iododexetimide binding was much higher in M 1 R-rich brain areas, such as the cortex and striatum, than in cerebellum (devoid of M(1) Rs). In M- 1 KO mice, but not M- 2 -M- 5 KO mice, I- 127 -iododexetimide binding was strongly reduced in the frontal cortex compared with wild-type mice. Finally, acute administration of both an M 1 R/M 4 R agonist <b>xanomeline</b> and the M 1 R antagonist olanzapine was able to inhibit I- 123 -iododexetimide ex vivo, and I- 123 -iododexetimide binding in M- 1 -rich brain areas in rats, whereas administration of haloperidol had no effect. Conclusion: The current results suggest that I- 123 -iododexetimide preferentially binds to M 1 R in vivo and can be displaced by M 1 R ligands. I- 123 -iododexetimide may therefore be a useful imaging tool as a way to further evaluate M 1 R changes in neuropsychiatric disorders, as a potential stratifying biomarker, or as a clinical target engagement biomarker to assess M 1...|$|E
