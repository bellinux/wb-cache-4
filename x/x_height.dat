2500|$|The epigraphic ancient Ionian sampi is not {{normally}} rendered {{with the modern}} numeral character in print. In specialized epigraphical or palaeographic academic discussion, it is either represented by a glyph , or by a Latin capital serifed T as a makeshift replacement. As this character {{has in the past}} never been supported in normal Greek fonts, there is no typographical tradition for its uppercase and lowercase representation in the style of a normal text font. Since its inclusion in the Unicode character encoding standard, experimental typographical stylizations of a lowercase textual Sampi have been developed. The Unicode reference glyph for [...] "small letter archaic sampi", according to an original draft, was to have looked like the stem of a small τ with a square top at <b>x</b> <b>height,</b> but was changed after consultation with Greek typesetting experts. The glyph shown in current official code charts stands on the baseline and has an ascender slightly higher than cap height, but its stem has no serifs and is slightly curved leftwards like the descender of an ρ or β. Most type designers who have implemented the character in current fonts have chosen to design a glyph either at <b>x</b> <b>height,</b> or with a descender but no ascender, and with the top either square or curved (corresponding to ancient scribal practice.) ...|$|E
