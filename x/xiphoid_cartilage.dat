40|$|In {{pectus excavatum}} {{there may be}} a {{cartilaginous}} horn on the inner surface of the xiphoid process rubbing on the heart, or the xiphoid process may be tipped inward, rubbing on the heart and causing anginoid pain. Being cartilaginous, these protrusions of the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>cartilage</b> are not visible on preoperative radiographs. Eight per cent of pectus excavatum patients have organic heart disease (Reusch, 1961). Funnel chest may cause anginoid pain (Poppe, 1965) which can be relieved surgically. A previously unreported abnormality is here recorded. In pectus excavatum {{there may be a}} cartilaginous protrusion from the inner surface of the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>cartilage</b> (similar to the horn of a rhinoceros) which rulbs on the heart with each beat, or the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>cartilage</b> may be tipped in-ward so that it rubs on the heart, causing electro-cardiographic changes and anginoid pain. Being cartilaginous, these deformities will not show on radiographs. Two such cases are reported: the first had an actual horn on the inner surface of the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>cartilage,</b> and the second patient had the tip of the xiphoid turned inward so that it also was rubbing on the heart. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE Neither patient had metal internal or external fixa-tion devices used post-operatively. The operative tech-nique described by Ravitch (1965) was followed, and in addition three stitches of No. 1 cotton were placed beneath the sternum to support it in its new position. These sling stitches run from the pectoral muscles on each side below the sternum. CASE REPORTS CASE 1 Mrs. H. C., a white woman aged 37, gave a history on 4 August 1962 of cough of four weeks' duration and said that when she had colds the cough persisted for a considerable period of time after such colds. Three days before we saw her she fainted. She had momentary 'suppression ' sensation in her chest, severe at times, and she felt lifeless. She had had chest pain for a long time on the left running from the front to the back. She had some dyspnoea. Occa...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{homozygous}} Gunn rats to conjugate trimethylacetic acid with glucuronic acid was significantly reduced {{from that of}} the heterozygous Gunn rats. This was interpreted as indicative of a reduced glucuronosyl transferase activity in the livers of the homozygous rats. However, the glucuronosyl transferase which promote the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate chains in cartilages are apparently unaffected. Proteoglycans extracted from costal, tracheal and <b>xiphoid</b> <b>cartilages</b> of homozygous rats were indistinguishable from the proteoglycans isolated from the same cartilages of heterozygous rats. Indeed, the chondroitin sulfate chains from the cartilages of the homozygous rats were of the same size as those from the cartilages of the heterozygous rats. Comparison of the data obtained in this study with similar data on proteoglycans from bovine nasal septal cartilage revealed that the rat proteoglycan monomers were smaller than the bovine proteoglycan monomers. In addition, the protein cores of the rat proteoglycans had less histidine, arginine, proline, tyrosine, and phenylalanine and more serine and glycine residues than the protein core of the proteoglycan from bovine nasal septal cartilage...|$|R
50|$|The {{rib cage}} is an {{arrangement}} of bones in the thorax of all vertebrates except the lamprey and the frog. It is formed by the vertebral column, ribs, and sternum and encloses the heart and lungs. In humans, the rib cage, {{also known as the}} thoracic cage, is a bony and cartilaginous structure which surrounds the thoracic cavity and supports the pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle), forming a core portion of the human skeleton. A typical human rib cage consists of 24 ribs, the sternum (with <b>xiphoid</b> process), costal <b>cartilages,</b> and the 12 thoracic vertebrae. Together with the skin and associated fascia and muscles, the rib cage makes up the thoracic wall and provides attachments for the muscles of the neck, thorax, upper abdomen, and back.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of chaotropic agents on proteoglycan and non-collagenous proteins, chicken <b>xiphoid</b> <b>cartilage</b> was treated with guanidine-HCI and MgCl 2 in different concentrations (1 M to 5 M), and different periods of time (12, 24, 48 and 72 hr). The maximum yield of uronic acid was obtained with 3 M MgCl 2 (73. 3 per cent). Concentrations of 4 M and 5 M of MgCl 2 showed that much less uronic acid was removed, 55. 3 per cent and 38. 1 respectively. Extraction with 3 M MgCl 2 and 3 M guanidine-HCl resulted better efficiency when performed for 48 hr. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of the extracts obtained with guanidine-HCl and MgCl, in different concentrations pointed out that most components are equally removed with the two solvents, showing that the extraction with MgCl 2 is an alternative assay to remove non-collagenous proteins from extracellular matrix...|$|E
40|$|Following vasectomy, sperm granulomas are {{generally}} {{believed to be}} important sites of access of spermatozoal antigens to the immune system. This study tests the validity of that assumption by grafting tissues from a sperm granuloma to an ectopic site (the scrotal skin) and studying {{the effect on the}} regional (inguinal) lymph node. <b>Xiphoid</b> <b>cartilage</b> provided the graft material in control animals. The experimental lymph nodes showed significant increases in weight and in the number of sectional profiles of cortical nodules indicating that they were stimulated by the presence of the granuloma tissue. To investigate the mechanism of lymph node stimulation further, a group of rats underwent unilateral vasectomy followed after 7 wk by ipsilateral orchidectomy. Three months after the initial operation the histological features of the regional (left renal) lymph node of the epididymis and granuloma were compared with corresponding nodes from rats 3 months following unilateral vasectomy only and following sham operation. The results indicate that continuous sperm production is required to sustain activity of the regional lymph nodes despite the continued presence of spermatozoa in the sperm granuloma...|$|E
40|$|Immunisation with {{heterologous}} type II collagen (CII) induces arthritis in mice of the DBA/ 1 strain, {{which is}} genetically susceptible to this disease. To develop an experimental model of autoimmunity more adequate {{for the study}} of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA), DBA/ 1 mice were injected with 100 micrograms of native CII that had been purified from mouse <b>xiphoid</b> <b>cartilage.</b> About six weeks later the animals developed a chronic progressive polyarthritis involving the four paws but mainly confined to interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints. The evolution of the disease fluctuated between remissions and exacerbations. The initial lesions assessed by clinical observations were more severe when the disease occurred early than in the case of late onset. Interestingly, the incidence of arthritis was clearly preponderant in males, and, moreover, the few female mice which developed arthritis had mild disease states with lower arthritic scores than the males. Varying levels of autoantibodies against mouse CII were found in the sera of immunised animals, regardless of the development of arthritis. These data indicate that the injection of homologous CII into mice caused a polyarthritis that is clinically closer to the human RA than the disease induced with heterologous CII and therefore will represent a useful tool {{for the study of}} the self-perpetuating mechanisms that characterise RA...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{full-thickness}} {{articular cartilage}} defects of knee have a poor healing capacity that may pro-gress to osteoarthritis and need a knee replacement. This study determines the healing effect of bioglue in full-thickness articular cartilage defect of femoral condyle in rabbit. Methods: Forty-eight male rabbits were randomly {{divided into four}} equal groups. In group A, 4 mm articular cartilage defects were created in {{the right and left}} medial femoral condyles. Then a graft from <b>xiphoid</b> <b>cartilage</b> was transferred into the defect together with a designed bioglue and the knees were closed. In group B, an artic-ular cartilage defect was created identical to group A, but the defect size was 6 mm. In group C, 4 and 6 mm articular cartilage defects were created in the right and left medial femoral condyles respectively. The graft was transferred into the defect and the knees were stitched. In group D, articular cartilage defects were created simi-lar to group C, just filled with bioglue and closed. The rabbits were euthanized and subgroups were defined as A 1, B 1, C 1 and D 1 after 30 days and A 2, B 2, C 2 and D 2 after 60 days. The cartilages were macroscopically and histologically investigated for any changes.

40|$|Abstract Background In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} microcurrent stimulation on the repair process of <b>xiphoid</b> <b>cartilage</b> in 45 -days-old rats. Methods Twenty male rats were divided into a control group and a treated group. A 3 -mm defect was then created with a punch in anesthetized animals. In the treated group, animals were submitted to daily applications of a biphasic square pulse microgalvanic continuous electrical current during 5 min. In each application, it was used a frequency of 0. 3 Hz and intensity of 20 μA. The animals were sacrificed at 7, 21 and 35 days after injury for structural analysis. Results Basophilia increased gradually in control animals during the experimental period. In treated animals, newly formed cartilage was observed on days 21 and 35. No statistically significant differences in birefringent collagen fibers were seen between groups {{at any of the}} time points. Treated animals presented a statistically larger number of chondroblasts. Calcification points were observed in treated animals on day 35. Ultrastructural analysis revealed differences in cell and matrix characteristics between the two groups. Chondrocyte-like cells were seen in control animals only after 35 days, whereas they were present in treated animals as early as by day 21. The number of cuprolinic blue-stained proteoglycans was statistically higher in treated animals on days 21 and 35. Conclusion We conclude that microcurrent stimulation accelerates the cartilage repair in non-articular site from prepuberal animals. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{laboratory}} rat (Rattus norvegicus albinus) {{has been}} used as a model for medical, biological and molecular research, for a long time. It is an interesting fact that there are no detailed descriptions of the gross anatomy of the liver and its ways of fixation. The aim of this study is to define clearly and according to the Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria principles, the liver and its way of fixation in this species of laboratory mammal. Eighty-eight rats (Rattus norvegicus albinus) were used, with a weight between 250 and 450 g. They were dissected in fresh, after been euthanized by an overdose of thiopental sodium intraperitoneal. An incision from the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>cartilage</b> up to the pubic region was made and another on each costal arch toward dorsal.

40|$|Multiple {{epiphyseal}} dysplasia (MED) {{can result}} from mutations in matrilin- 3, a structural protein of the cartilage extracellular matrix. We have previously shown that in a mouse model of MED the tibia growth plates were normal at birth but developed a progressive dysplasia characterised by the intracellular retention of mutant matrilin- 3 and abnormal chondrocyte morphology. By 3  weeks of age, mutant mice displayed {{a significant decrease in}} chondrocyte proliferation and dysregulated apoptosis. The aim of this current study was to identify the initial post-natal stages of the disease. We confirmed that the disease phenotype is seen in rib and <b>xiphoid</b> <b>cartilage</b> and, like tibia growth plate cartilage is characterised by the intracellular retention of mutant matrilin- 3. Gene expression profiling showed a significant activation of classical unfolded protein response (UPR) genes in mutant chondrocytes at 5  days of age, which was still maintained by 21  days of age. Interestingly, we also noted the upregulation of arginine-rich, mutated in early stage of tumours (ARMET) and cysteine-rich with EGF-like domain protein 2 (CRELD 2) are two genes that have only recently been implicated in the UPR. This endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and UPR did not lead to increased chondrocyte apoptosis in mutant cartilage by 5  days of age. In an attempt to alleviate ER stress, mutant mice were fed with a chemical chaperone, 4 -sodium phenylbutyrate (SPB). SPB at the dosage used had no effect on chaperone expression at 5  days of age but modestly decreased levels of chaperone proteins at 3  weeks. However, this did not lead to increased secretion of mutant matrilin- 3 and in the long term did not improve the disease phenotype. We performed similar studies with a mouse model of Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, but again this treatment did not improve the phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{internal}} thoracic artery {{is responsible}} for irrigation of the sternum. The sternum consists of three parts, the manubrium, body of sternum and xiphoid process. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze irrigation, by the branches of {{internal thoracic artery}}, towards the posterior side of the manubrium, in which we can observe the insertions of sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles as well as the branches of internal thoracic artery to the body and xiphoid process. Methods: Sixty male and female the anterior sternocostal wall of the thorax previously fixed in formaldehyde solution, with ages ranging from 20 to 80 years were used from the Service of Verification of Death (SVO) of the Federal University of São Paulo - Paulista School of Medicine. The research project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of São Paulo under number: 0109 / 06 on 02 / 01 / 2006. In these the anterior sternocostal wall of the thorax. the right and left internal thoracic arteries had already been partially dissected by the graduate students, and injected with colored neoprene latex, yellow in left internal thoracic arteries and red in right side arteries. It was used a dissecting microscope with 10 X, dissecting forceps and sharp and blunt point scissors. The trunk and branches of internal thoracic arteries were dissected and after being measured they were recorded in a specific file, the material was photographed at different angles and close. In statistical analysis the paired t test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey technique were employed. Results: The sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles, with their insertions in the manubrium were irrigated by sternal branches in all 120 studied internal thoracic arteries. The body of the sternum received sternal branches originated from both internal thoracic artery and the branches arising directly from it. A difference was found regarding the amount of trunks and sternal branches in different sternal intercostal spaces of 60 the anterior sternocostal wall of the thorax. The xiphoid process was irrigated from the sternal branches of the internal thoracic artery and the superior epigastric artery, branches only of the superior epigastric and irrigation of their own superior epigastric artery. Conclusions: in the final considerations it was reported that the internal thoracic artery actively participates in the irrigation, insertions of the sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles and, therefore, manubrium. The internal thoracic artery is the third arterial pedicle for the sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles. The sternal branches are in greater quantities than those originating from branches of the sternal trunks. The preservation of these trunks is needed to keep the blood supply of the sternum, when suffering sternotomy and using both internal thoracic arteries. The xiphoid process provides irrigation from different vessels, but its maintenance through the superior epigastric artery is relevant since this vessel is richly distributed on the posterior and anterior <b>xiphoid</b> <b>cartilage.</b> Objetivos: As artérias torácicas internas, direita e esquerda, são responsáveis pela irrigação do osso esterno. O uso de ambas as artérias torácicas internas, nas cirurgias de revascularização do miocárdio, é um dos fatores que podem ocasionar a mediastinite, uma vez que dificulta o esterno de receber um bom aporte sanguíneo, facilitando a ação de agentes bacterianos. Abordagens de tratamentos demonstram que ainda não há uma conduta ideal para evitar ou tratar a ferida inflamatória do esterno. A preservação dos ramos esternais é ainda o ideal como resposta às medidas terapêuticas. A irrigação, pelos ramos da artéria torácica interna, para a face posterior do manúbrio na qual se encontram as inserções dos músculos esternotireóideo e esterno-hióideo, bem como os ramos da artéria torácica interna para o corpo e processo xifóide foi a finalidade do presente estudo. Métodos: Foi utilizado 60 faces internas de paredes torácicas anteriores (plastrões torácicos) já formalizados, femininos e masculinos, com idades entre 20 e 80 anos, provenientes do serviço de verificação de óbito (SVO) da Universidade Federal de São Paulo - Escola Paulista de Medicina. Nestes plastões as artérias torácicas internas direitas e esquerdas já se encontravam parcialmente dissecadas, por alunos de pós-graduação, e injetadas com látex neoprene colorido. Foi utilizada lupa de dissecação com aumento de 10 x, pinça de dissecação e tesouras ponta fina e romba. Os troncos e ramos das artérias torácicas internas foram dissecados, medidos e protocolados em fichário específico, o material foi fotografado em diferentes aproximações e ângulos. Na análise estatística o Teste t pareado e não pareado, Análise de Variância (ANOVA) e a técnica de Tukey foram empregados. Resultados: Os músculos esternotireóideo e esterno-hióideo, com suas inserções no manúbrio, foram irrigados por ramos esternais em todas as 120 artérias torácicas internas estudadas. O corpo do esterno recebeu ramos esternais provindos tanto de troncos da artéria torácica interna quanto de ramos originados diretamente dela. Existiu diferença na quantidade de troncos e de ramos esternais nos diferentes espaços intercostais das 60 faces internas de paredes torácicas anteriores. O processo xifóide recebeu irrigação dos ramos esternais da artéria torácica interna e da artéria epigástrica superior, ramos somente da epigástrica superior e irrigação da própria artéria epigástrica superior. Nas considerações finais, a artéria torácica interna participa ativamente da irrigação, nas inserções, dos músculos esternotireóideo e esterno-hióideo e consequentemente do manúbrio. Os ramos esternais são em maior quantidade do que aqueles ramos originados dos troncos esternais, a preservação destes troncos se faz necessária para manter o aporte sanguíneo do esterno, quando este sofrer esternotomia e forem utilizadas ambas as artérias torácicas internas. O processo xifóide apresenta irrigação provinda de diferentes vasos, mas sua manutenção pela a artéria epigástrica superior é relevante, já que este vaso se distribui ricamente pela face posterior e anterior do processo xifóide.
