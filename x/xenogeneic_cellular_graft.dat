40|$|Background : Vitiligo in hair-bearing {{areas is}} often {{associated}} with leucotrichia. Repigmentation of leucotrichia has been reported mainly with tissue and follicular hair grafts. Objectives : To evaluate the repigmentation response of leucotrichia after noncultured <b>cellular</b> <b>grafting.</b> Methods : We retrospectively reviewed patients with stable generalized and segmental vitiligo who underwent noncultured <b>cellular</b> <b>grafting</b> from March 2008 to November 2010 in areas with leucotrichia. The percentage repigmentation of white hairs was based on clinical assessment and standardized digital photography, and was graded 'poor', 'fair', 'good' or 'excellent', corresponding to a scale of 0 - 100 % repigmentation with respective intervals of 25 %. Results : Eighty-four patients with vitiligo underwent cellular grafting; of these, 13 had grafting in areas with leucotrichia. Twelve patients (92 %) had poor repigmentation of leucotrichia 3 months after transplant. One patient defaulted follow-up after this period. At 6 months, fair repigmentation was achieved in eight out of the 12 remaining patients (67 %). After 9 - 12 months, however, 91 % (10 out of 11) of the patients achieved good or excellent repigmentation. One patient did not reach the 9 -month follow-up period at the time of data analysis. Leucotrichia of eyebrows yielded excellent repigmentation in eight out of nine patients, whereas hairs on the limbs and scalp showed good repigmentation in two out of two patients at 9 - 12 months. Conclusions : Good to excellent repigmentation of leucotrichia can be achieved with noncultured <b>cellular</b> <b>grafting,</b> obviating the need for hair transplantation...|$|R
40|$|The proliferative {{reactivity}} of lymphocytes from rat donors maintained under germfree or conventional conditions was examined in mixed lymphocyte cultures stimulated with allogeneic and xenogeneic cell surface antigens. The results show (a) that lymphocytes from conventionally maintained rats are less reactive to human, hamster, guinea pig, and mouse cell surface antigens {{than to the}} major H alloantigens, and (b) that lymphocytes from germfree rats display no demonstrable reactivity to xenogeneic cells, but are quantitatively normal in their response to allogenic cells. The conclusion drawn from these observations is that the circulating lymphocyte pool of an individual consists of {{a greater proportion of}} cells reactive to H alloantigens of other members of the same species than to the <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cellular</b> antigens of members of other species and that this large number of cells is not generated by a mechanism involving immunization to cross-reactive environmental antigens...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} epidermal noncultured <b>cellular</b> <b>grafting</b> in patients with vitiligo {{and the role of}} postinflammatory, spontaneous, or UV-induced pigmentation in obtaining repigmentation. Design: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Setting: Ambulatory patients in an institutional practice. Patients were followed up for 3 to 12 months. Patients: A total of 33 paired, symmetrically distributed leukodermic lesions, all resistant to therapy, were observed in 28 patients. Nineteen patients appeared to have a stable vitiligo (group 1), whereas there was doubt about the stability of the disease in 9 patients (group 2). Intervention: After laser ablation, a hyaluronic acid-enriched <b>cellular</b> <b>graft</b> was applied to 1 lesion while the paired lesion received placebo. Three weeks later all lesions were exposed to UV irradiation twice per week for approximately 2 months. Main Outcome Measures: Primarily, the percentage of repigmentation was assessed after 3, 6, and 12 months using a digital image analysis system. The repigmentation pattern was also evaluated after 1 and 3 months. Results: A strongly significant difference between <b>cellular</b> <b>grafts</b> and placebo was observed after 3, 6, and 12 months (P<. 001, P=. 002, and P=. 002, respectively). In group 1, repigmentation of at least 70 % of the treated area was achieved in 55 %, 57 %, and 77 % of the actively treated lesions 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment, whereas in group 2 repigmentation of at least 70 % of the treated area was not observed at any time point. The repigmentation pattern was diffuse in 94 % of the responding patients. Conclusions: After a strict preoperative selection for disease stability, transplantation resulted in repigmentation of at least 70 % of the treated area in most actively treated vitiligo lesions.

40|$|Although {{intracerebral}} transplantation {{of various}} fibroblast(-like) cell populations {{has been shown}} feasible, {{little is known about}} the actual in vivo remodeling of these <b>cellular</b> <b>grafts</b> and their environment. In this study, we aimed to compare the in vitro and in vivo behavior of two phenotypically similar-but developmentally distinct-fibroblast-like cell populations, namely, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs) and mouse fetal membrane-derived stromal cells (mFMSCs). While both mEFs and mFMSCs are readily able to reduce TNF-α secretion by LPS/IFN-γ-activated BV- 2 microglia, mFMSCs and mEFs display strikingly opposite behavior with regard to VEGF production under normal and inflammatory conditions. Whereas mFMSCs downregulate VEGF production upon coculture with LPS/IFN-γ-activated BV- 2 microglia, mEFs upregulate VEGF production in the presence of LPS/IFN-γ-activated BV- 2 microglia. Subsequently, in vivo grafting of mFMSCs and mEFs revealed no difference in microglial and astroglial responses toward the <b>cellular</b> <b>grafts.</b> However, mFMSC grafts displayed a lower degree of neoangiogenesis compared to mEF grafts, thereby potentially explaining the lower cell number able to survive in mFMSC grafts. In summary, our results suggest that physiological differences between fibroblast-like cell populations might lie at the basis of variations in histopathological and/or clinical outcome following cell grafting in mouse brain...|$|R

A challenge in vascular tissue engineering is to develop optimal scaffolds and establish expandable cell sources {{for the construction of}} tissue-engineered vascular grafts that are nonthrombogenic and have long-term patency. Here, we used tissue-engineered vascular grafts as a model to demonstrate the potential of combining nanofibrous scaffolds and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for vascular tissue engineering. Biodegradable nanofibrous scaffolds with aligned nanofibers were used to mimic native collagen fibrils to guide cell organization in vascular grafts. The results from artery bypass experiments showed that nanofibrous scaffolds allowed efficient infiltration of vascular cells and matrix remodeling. Acellular grafts (without MSCs) resulted in significant intimal thickening, whereas <b>cellular</b> <b>grafts</b> (with MSCs) had excellent long-term patency and exhibited well organized layers of endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), as in native arteries. Short-term experiments showed that nanofibrous scaffolds alone induced platelet adhesion and thrombus formation, which was suppressed by MSC seeding. In addition, MSCs, as ECs, resisted platelet adhesion in vitro, which depended on cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. These data, together with the observation on the short-term engraftment of MSCs, suggest that the long-term patency of <b>cellular</b> <b>grafts</b> may be attributed to the antithrombogenic property of MSCs. These results demonstrate several favorable characteristics of nanofibrous scaffolds, the excellent patency of small-diameter nanofibrous vascular grafts, and the unique antithrombogenic property of MSCs...|$|R
30|$|While cases {{shown above}} depict {{the success of}} biomaterial-assisted cell {{delivery}} to lesion sites for improved therapy, another big challenge is the immune rejection of transplanted allo- or xeno-geneic cells. If cells are transplanted without protection, host immune system would recognize these foreign antigens quickly and immediate rejection of <b>cellular</b> <b>grafts</b> occurs. Hydrogels are mainly used to encapsulate cells for immune-isolation, which are either biodegradable for short-term application (e.g. oral delivery of genetically engineered E. coli to remove urea (Prakash and Chang, 1996)) or mechanically stable materials for treatment of chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes). The highly hydrated microenvironment of hydrogels enabled embedded cells to be instructed to differentiate, proliferate, and migrate (Vermonden et al., 2008).|$|R

Surgical methods become important in cases where medical therapy fails to cause repigmentation or in cases of segmental vitiligo where the response to surgery is excellent. The basic principle of surgical treatment is autologous grafting of viable melanocytes from pigmented donor skin to recipient vitiliginous areas. Various grafting methods have been described including tissue <b>grafts</b> and <b>cellular</b> <b>grafts.</b> Stability of the disease {{is the most important}} criterion to obtain a successful outcome.

40|$|We have {{reported}} previously that oral administration of pig cells to NOD mice modified <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cellular</b> response against pig islet cells (PICs), and hypothesized {{that it may}} have induced active suppression. This preliminary report evaluated only the effect of feeding pig cells by ‘primary’ proliferation, i. e. when splenocytes from fed mice are confronted with pig cells in vitro. The present study also considered ‘secondary’ proliferation and cytokine production after feeding and subsequent in vivo graft of pig cells. Additionally, serum IgM and IgG isotypes were quantified by ELISA using pig target cells. Induction of active mechanism by feeding was hypothetical, which led us here to transfer splenocytes from mice fed pig spleen cells (PSC) and evaluate ‘primary’ (after transfer) and ‘secondary’ (after transfer and subsequent graft of pig cells) proliferations and cytokine secretions in recipient mice. We also determined whether the effects of feeding pig cells persisted after depression of suppressor mechanisms by cyclophosphamide. Mice fed with PSC displayed increased ‘primary’ splenocyte proliferation to PSC or PIC (P < 0 · 0001), while ‘secondary’ responses were decreased (P < 0 · 03) in those fed PSC and subsequently grafted with PSC. The increased ‘primary’ and decreased ‘secondary’ proliferations were reduced (P < 0 · 04) by pretreatment with cyclophosphamide. The IL- 10 / and IL- 4 /IFNγ ratios produced in response to PSC increased (P < 0 · 04) in mice fed and grafted with PSC compared to those grafted only with PSC. IgM and IgG levels against pig cells were, respectively, increased (P < 0 · 04) and decreased (P < 0 · 04) in mice fed and grafted with PSC. IgG 2 a and IgG 2 b, but not IgG 1, levels were lower (P < 0 · 01). These effects of feeding PSC on ‘secondary’ proliferation, cytokine and antibody productions, were not detected when mice were fed PSC only after graft with PSC. Transfer with splenocytes from mice fed PSC increased ‘primary’ proliferation of splenocytes from recipient mice in response to PSC (P < 0 · 02) or PIC (P < 0 · 05). After transfer with splenocytes from PSC-fed mice and graft with PSC, ‘secondary’ proliferation to pig cells were reduced (P < 0 · 04), and the IL- 10 /IFNγ ratio produced in response to PSC was increased fourfold. Thus, oral administration of PSC induces active transferable mechanisms, characterized by a biphasic pattern with early increased ‘primary’ <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cellular</b> reactions to both PSC and PIC, followed by decreased ‘secondary’ responsiveness and a concomitant shift of the Th 1 /Th 2 balance towards greater Th 2 influence. Decreased responsiveness may be due to active suppression, even though induction of anergy or deletion cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our {{investigations}} was to measure, in a co-culture condition, the immunoresponse to allogeneic or xeno-genic cells, selected as potential sources for cell therapy of arthritis. We challenged human spleen-derived cells (hSpl) by three different mechanisms: 1) exposure to donor allogeneic or <b>xenogeneic</b> <b>cellular</b> antigens; 2) exposure to donor cells transduced with adenoviral antigens (Ad) and 3) lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known inflammatory immunostimu-lant. The immunoresponse to allogeneic human synovial-derived mesenchymal stromal cells alone or transduced with adenoviral green fluorescent protein (hSD-MSC or hSD-MSC/GFP) or the immunoresponse to xenogeneic equine mesenchymal stromal cells (eqMSC) or equine dermal fibroblasts (eqDFb), characterized by the proportion of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + human splenocytes (hSpl), was measured on Day 0 and Day 6 of co-culture by flow cytometry. In culture with hSD-MSC, hSD-MSC/GFP, eqDFb, or eqMSC, the proportion of CD 3 + and CD 8 + hSpl increased with time in culture but not with exposure to cell allo- or xeno-antigens. Both hSD-MSC and hSD-MSC/GFP increased in number during culture and were not affected in viability or proliferation by co-culture with allogeneic hSpl. In this in vitro, pri-mary exposure study, hSpl demonstrated a natural selection and adaptation to a short-term cell culture environment, and that neither allogeneic nor xenogeneic cell antigens incited a greater cellular immunoactivation than co-cultured hSpl alone...|$|R

Study Design:The WJ-MSCs from umbilical cords of preterm birth and term controls were isolated and induced into neural progenitors. The cells were analyzed for neuroglial markers by flow cytometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunocytochemistry. Results:Independent of gestational age, a subset of WJ-MSC displayed the neural progenitor cell markers Nestin and Musashi- 1 and the mature neural markers microtubule-associated protein 2, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and myelin basic protein. Neuroglial induction of WJ-MSCs from term and preterm birth resulted in the enhanced transcription of Nestin and Musashi- 1.

40|$|Background: The role of {{histocompatibility}} and {{immune recognition}} in stem cell transplant therapy has been controversial, with many reports arguing that undifferentiated {{stem cells are}} protected from immune recognition due {{to the absence of}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC) markers. This argument is even more persuasive in transplantation into the central nervous system (CNS) where the graft rejection response is minimal. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we evaluate graft survival and neuron production in perfectly matched vs. strongly mismatched neural stem cells transplanted into the hippocampus in mice. Although allogeneic cells survive, we observe that MHC-mismatch decreases surviving cell numbers and strongly inhibits the differentiation and retention of graft-derived as well as endogenously produced new neurons. Immune suppression with cyclosporine-A did not improve outcome but non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, indomethacin or rosiglitazone, were able to restore allogeneic neuron production, integration and retention to the level of syngeneic grafts.

Here, we report {{the results of}} a randomized study of bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, administered to pigs, which offer several new insights regarding cellular cardiomyoplasty. First, cells were safely injected by using a percutaneous-injection catheter 3 d after myocardial infarction.

First, we determined by flow cytometry the cell surface expression of Multiple immunoregulatory proteins in resting conditions or after treatment with human TNF-alpha, IL- 1 alpha, or IL- 1 beta, which did not induce apoptosis. TNF-alpha {{and to a lesser extent}} IL- 1 alpha led to a marked upregulation of SLA 1, VCAM- 1. and ICAM- 1 on PCC. SLA H and E-selectin remained undetectable in all the conditions assayed. Notably, CD 86 was constitutively expressed at moderate levels, whereas CD 80 and CD 40 were barely detected. To assess their function, we next Studied the interaction of PCC with human monoblastic U 937 and Jurkat T cells. U 937 cells adhered to resting and in a greater proportion to cytokine-stimulated PCC. Consistent with its expression pattern, pig VCAM- 1 was key, mediating the increased adhesion after cytokine stimulation. We also conducted coculture experiments with U 937 and PCC and measured the release of pig and human cytokines. Stimulated PCC secreted IL- 6 and IL- 8, whereas U 937 secreted IL- 8 in response to PCC. Finally, coculture Of PCC With Jurkat in the presence of PHA led to it marked Jurkat activation as determined by the increase in IL- 2 secretion.

The cause of the difference in response was a decrease in nitrogen content on high-G capsules due to detachment of PLL in vivo and an increase of the zeta-potential.

Aim: To evaluate the cosmetic results obtained with ultrathin split-thickness skin grafts followed by NBUVB therapy in resistant, stable vitiligo. Methods: Forty patients of stable vitiligo were treated with ultrathin split-thickness grafting and the patients were then put on NBUVB therapy. The results obtained were analyzed by the extent of repigmentation achieved as well as the final cosmetic outcome at the recipient as well as donor sites. Results: The first evidence of repigmentation was seen in the second week after starting NBUVB. On objective assessment, more than 90 % repigmentation was seen in 83 % of patients and the overall cosmetic results at the recipient site were graded as good to excellent in 90 % patients at the end of NBUVB treatment. Perigraft halo of depigmentation was seen in six patients (15 %) on the recipient site. Hypertrophic scarring was observed in two patients at the donor site. Conclusions: Ultrathin split-thickness skin grafting, when combined with NBUVB therapy, leads to better cosmetic outcome with faster onset of repigmentation in resistant stable vitiligo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNew {{technologies}} that facilitate solid alveolar ridge augmentation are receiving considerable {{attention in the}} field of prosthodontics because of the growing requirement for esthetic and functional reconstruction by dental implant treatments. Recently, several studies have demonstrated potential advantages for stem-cell-based therapies in regenerative treatments. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are now an excellent candidate for tissue replacement therapies, and tissue engineering approaches and chair-side <b>cellular</b> <b>grafting</b> approaches using autologous MSCs represent the clinical state of the art for stem-cell-based alveolar bone regeneration. Basic studies have revealed that crosstalk between implanted donor cells and recipient immune cells {{plays a key role in}} determining clinical success that may involve the recently observed immunomodulatory properties of MSCs. Part II of this review first overviews progress in regenerative dentistry to consider the implications of the stem cell technology in dentistry and then highlights cutting-edge stem-cell-based alveolar bone regenerative therapies. Factors that affect stem-cell-based bone regeneration as related to the local immune response are then discussed. Additionally, pre-clinical stem cell studies for the regeneration of teeth and other oral organs as well as possible applications of MSC-based immunotherapy in dentistry are outlined. Finally, the marketing of stem cell technology in dental stem cell banks with a view toward future regenerative therapies is introduced...|$|R
40|$|Background—Traditional {{pharmacological}} therapies aiming {{to modify the}} abnormal electrophysiological substrate underlying cardiac arrhythmias may be limited by their relatively low efficacy, global cardiac activity, and significant proarrhythmic effects. We suggest a new approach, in which transfected <b>cellular</b> <b>grafts</b> expressing various ionic channels {{may be used to}} manipulate the local electrophysiological properties of cardiac tissue. To examine the feasibility of this concept, we tested the hypothesis that transfected fibroblasts expressing the voltage-sensitive potassium channel Kv 1. 3 can modify the electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytic cultures. Methods and Results—A high-resolution multielectrode mapping technique was used to assess the electrophysiological and structural properties of primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The transfected fibroblasts, added to the cardiomyocytic cultures, caused a significant effect on the conduction properties of the hybrid cultures. These changes were manifested by significant reduction in extracellular signal amplitude and by the appearance of multiple local conduction blocks. The location of all conduction blocks correlated with the spatial distribution of the transfected fibroblasts assessed by vital staining. All electrophysiological changes were reversed after the application of Charybdotoxin, a specific Kv 1. 3 blocker. In contrast, conduction remained uniform in the control hybrid cultures when nontransfected fibroblasts were used. Conclusions—Transfected fibroblasts are able to electrically couple with cardiac myocytes, causing a significant local an...|$|R
40|$|Approved May 2017 by {{the faculty}} of UMKC in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Nursing PracticeAdults with compromised liver function are inherently deficient and especially vulnerable to the consequences of vitamin D deficiency. Consequences of vitamin D deficiency include liver disease progression, infection, and graft failure. A vitamin D supplementation protocol is proposed to systematically optimize serum vitamin D levels in both pre and post liver transplanted patients. This quasi-experimental study used convenience sampling for 45 post liver transplant patients at a large academic facility. The measurable outcome in the three-month study was the serum 25 -hydroxy vitamin D levels post supplementation protocol. Seventy-eight percent of patients reached minimum guideline levels using the protocol with an average increase of serum vitamin D of 13. 8 ng/mL. Long-term outcomes of clinical significance may include decreased incidence of acute <b>cellular</b> <b>graft</b> rejection and infections in the immune compromised patient. Optimizing vitamin D in vulnerable patient populations such as chronic liver disease and the immune-suppressed post-transplanted patient {{has the potential to}} curtail complications of vitamin D deficiency. As a result, employing a vitamin D protocol can have a favorable impact on patient quality of life, safety, and healthcare spending...|$|R
40|$|Each {{neuronal}} subtype {{is distinct}} {{in how it}} develops, responds to environmental cues, and whether {{it is capable of}} mounting a regenerative response following injury. Although the adult central nervous system (CNS) does not regenerate, several experimental interventions have been trialled with successful albeit limited instances of axonal repair. We highlight here some of these approaches including extracellular matrix (ECM) modification, <b>cellular</b> <b>grafting,</b> gene therapy-induced replacement of proteins, as well as application of biomaterials. We also review the recent report demonstrating the failure of axonal localization and transport of growth-promoting receptors within certain classes of mature neurons. More specifically, we discuss an inability of integrin receptors to localize within the axonal compartment of mature motor neurons such as in the corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts, whereas in immature neurons of those pathways and in mature sensory tracts such as in the optic nerve and dorsal column pathways these receptors readily localize within axons. Furthermore we assert that this failure of axonal localization contributes to the intrinsic inability of axonal regeneration. We conclude by highlighting the necessity for both combined therapies as well as a targeted approach specific to both age and neuronal subtype will be required to induce substantial CNS repair. </p...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of myoblasts transplanted into the skeletal muscle die within the first week after injection. Inflammatory response to the intramuscular cell transfer was studied in allogeneic but not in autologous model. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate immune reaction to autotransplantation of myogenic cells and to assess its dynamics within the first week after injection. Muscle-derived cells or medium alone was injected into the intact skeletal muscles in autologous model. Tissue samples were collected 1, 3, and 7 days after the procedure. Our analysis revealed the peak increase of the gene expression of all evaluated cytokines (Il- 1 α, Il- 1 β, Il- 6, Tgf-β, and Tnf-α) at day 1. The mRNA level of analyzed cytokines normalized in subsequent time points. The increase of Il-β gene expression was further confirmed at the protein level. Analysis of the tissue sections revealed rapid infiltration of injected cell clusters with neutrophils and macrophages. The inflammatory infiltration was almost completely resolved at day 7. The survived cells were able to participate in the muscle regeneration process. Presented results demonstrate that autotransplanted muscle-derived cells induce classical early immune reaction in the site of injection which may contribute to <b>cellular</b> <b>graft</b> elimination...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) causes significant cell {{loss and}} damage to myocardium. Cell-based therapies for treatment of MI aim to remuscularize the resultant scar, {{but the majority of}} transplanted cells do not survive or integrate with host tissue. Additionally, survival of tissue engineered constructs after implantation depends heavily on induction of a vascular response in host tissue in order to promote a quick anastomosis of the <b>cellular</b> <b>graft.</b> Scaffolds can improve cell retention following implantation, but often do little to enhance host-graft integration. Fibrin is an ideal biomaterial for cardiac tissue engineering as it is a natural, biodegradable polymer that can induce neovascularization, promote cell attachment, and has tunable mechanical properties. The research presented in this dissertation describes the development and characterization of a novel high density microtemplated fibrin scaffold with mechanical stiffness comparable to native myocardium, tunable degradation, and a microarchitecture designed to promote cellular organization within constructs. Acellular fibrin scaffolds demonstrated highly angiogenic properties when implanted. Cell seeding with a tri-cell mixture of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts demonstrated the fibrin scaffolds promote cardiomyocyte alignment {{and the development of a}} pre-vascular network. The fibrin scaffolds are designed to promote graft cell organization and improve chances of construct survival and integration with host tissue upon implantation...|$|R
