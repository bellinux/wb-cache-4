5|$|McCool is {{a devout}} Christian, and she {{incorporated}} Christian crosses on her wrestling attire. She has had several wrestling-related injuries; in November 2007, she fractured her nose during an overseas WWE tour after Victoria's clothesline hit {{her in the}} face. She has been hospitalized twice, had two broken ribs, a broken sternum, and a broken <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process.</b> When she chose to leave the WWE, she mentioned that her foot had been injured for two months with a broken toe, torn joint capsules and a torn MCL.|$|E
25|$|The breast {{meridian}} for {{the length}} of the sternum bone (from the sternal notch at the lower-throat) to the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process</b> (at the lower tip).|$|E
25|$|The upper {{border is}} oval and articulates with the manubrium, at the sternal angle. The lower border is narrow, and articulates with the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|The sternum is {{composed}} of highly vascular tissue, covered by {{a thin layer of}} compact bone which is thickest in the manubrium between the articular facets for the clavicles. The inferior sternopericardial ligament attaches the pericardium to the posterior <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|The sternum {{develops}} {{from two}} cartilaginous bars {{one on the}} left and one on the right, connected with the cartilages of the ribs on each side. These two bars fuse together along the middle to form the cartilaginous sternum which is ossified from six centers: one for the manubrium, four for the body, and one for the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|The muscle fibres of the {{diaphragm}} emerge from many surrounding structures. At the front, fibres insert into the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process</b> {{and along the}} costal margin. Laterally, muscle fibers insert into ribs 6-12. In the back, muscle fibres insert into the vertebra at T12 and two appendages, {{the right and left}} crus, descend and insert into the lumbar vertebrae at L1 & L2.|$|E
25|$|The <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process</b> {{may become}} joined {{to the body}} {{before the age of}} thirty, but this occurs more {{frequently}} after forty; on the other hand, it sometimes remains ununited in old age. In advanced life the manubrium is occasionally joined to the body by bone. When this takes place, however, the bony tissue is generally only superficial, the central portion of the intervening cartilage remaining unossified.|$|E
25|$|The {{ossification}} centers {{appear in}} the intervals between the articular depressions for the costal cartilages, in the following order: in the manubrium and first piece of the body, during the sixth month of fetal life; {{in the second and}} third pieces of the body, during the seventh month of fetal life; in its fourth piece, during the first year after birth; and in the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process,</b> between the fifth and eighteenth years.|$|E
25|$|The {{cormorants}} and the darters have {{a unique}} bone {{on the back of}} the top of the skull known as the os nuchale or occipital style which was called a <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process</b> in early literature. This bony projection provides anchorage for the muscles that increase the force with which the lower mandible is closed and this bone and the highly developed muscles over it, the M. adductor mandibulae caput nuchale are unique to the families Phalacrocoracidae and Anhingidae.|$|E
25|$|Each outer border, at its {{superior}} angle, {{has a small}} facet, which with {{a similar}} facet on the manubrium, forms a cavity for the cartilage of the second rib; below this are four angular depressions which receive the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. The inferior angle has a small facet, which, with a corresponding one on the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process,</b> forms a notch for the cartilage of the seventh rib. These articular depressions are separated {{by a series of}} curved interarticular intervals, which diminish in length from above downward, and correspond to the intercostal spaces. Most of the cartilages belonging to the true ribs, articulate with the sternum at the lines of junction of its primitive component segments. This is well seen in some other vertebrates, where the parts of the bone remain separated for longer.|$|E
2500|$|Located at the {{inferior}} {{end of the}} sternum is the pointed <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process.</b> [...] Improperly performed chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation can cause the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process</b> to snap off, driving it into the liver which can cause a fatal hemorrhage.|$|E

2500|$|The sternum or {{breastbone}} {{is a long}} flat bone {{shaped like}} a necktie located {{in the center of}} the chest. It connects to the ribs via cartilage, forming the front of the rib cage, and thus helps to protect the heart, lungs, and major blood vessels from injury. [...] The sternum consists of three regions: the manubrium, the body, and the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process.</b> It is one of the largest and longest flat bones of the body.|$|E
50|$|Located at the {{inferior}} {{end of the}} sternum is the pointed <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process.</b> Improperly performed chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation can cause the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process</b> to snap off, driving it into the liver which can cause a fatal hemorrhage.|$|E
50|$|Pressure on the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process</b> {{should be}} avoided when {{administering}} chest compressions in CPR, as this can cause the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process</b> to break off, resulting in punctures or lacerations of the diaphragm. Additionally, the liver may be punctured, resulting in lethal hemorrhaging.|$|E
50|$|During CPR, it is {{important}} to not put pressure on the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process.</b> This piece of bone is unsupported and can easily be broken off, causing damage to internal organs. Proper placement of the hands during CPR is {{at the base of the}} sternum, just above the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

50|$|Much the way {{the first}} seven ribs {{articulate}} with the sternum, the cartilage in the celiac plexus joins on the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process,</b> reinforcing it, and indirectly attaches the costal cartilage to the sternum. The <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process</b> {{is involved in the}} attachment of many muscles, including the abdominal diaphragm, a muscle necessary for normal breathing. It also anchors the rectus abdominus muscles ("abs").|$|E

50|$|In newborns {{and young}} (especially slender) infants, {{the tip of}} the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process</b> may be both seen and felt as a lump just below the sternal notch. By age 15 to 29, the xiphoid usually fuses to the body of the sternum with a fibrous joint. Unlike the {{synovial}} articulation of major joints, this is non-movable. Ossification of the <b>xiphoid</b> <b>process</b> occurs around age 40.|$|E
