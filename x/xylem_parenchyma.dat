50|$|The {{systems that}} {{transport}} and store heavy metals {{are the most}} critical systems in a hyper-accumulator because the heavy metals will damage the plant before they are stored. The root-to-shoot transport of heavy metals is strongly regulated by gene expression. The genes that code for metal transport systems in plants have been identified. These genes are expressed in both hyper-accumulating and non-hyper-accumulating plants. There is {{a large body of}} evidence that genes known to code for the transport systems of heavy metals are constantly over-expressed in hyper-accumulating plants when they are exposed to heavy metals. This genetic evidence suggests that hyper-accumulators overdevelop their metal transport systems. This may be to speed up the root-to-shoot process limiting the amount of time the metal is exposed to the plant systems before it is stored. Cadmium accumulation has been reviewed. These transporters are known as heavy metal transporting ATPases (HMAs).One of the most well-documented HMAs is HMA4, which belongs to the Zn/Co/Cd/Pb HMA subclass and is localized at <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> plasma membranes. HMA4 is upregulated when plants are exposed to high levels of Cd and Zn, but it is down regulated in its non-hyperaccumulating relatives. Also, when the expression of HMA4 is increased there is a correlated increase in the expression of genes belonging to the ZIP (Zinc regulated transporter Iron regulated transporter Proteins) family. This suggests that the root-to-shoot transport system acts as a driving force of the hyper-accumulation by creating a metal deficiency response in roots.|$|E

Various methods were employed to release intracellular substances from <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells and all resulted in a reduction of supercooling ability. It was concluded that the reduction of supercooling ability primarily resulted from changes of intracellular conditions, including the release of intracellular contents or their mixing with extracellular solutions, rather than due to changes of cell wall structures.

40|$|Although {{cellular}} {{injury in}} some woody plants has been correlated with freezing of supercooled water, {{there is no}} direct evidence that intracellular ice formation is responsible for the injury. In this study we tested the hypothesis that injury to <b>xylem</b> ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells in supercooling tissues is caused by intracellular ice formation. The ultrastructure of freezing-stress response in <b>xylem</b> ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells of flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.) was determined in tissue prepared by freeze substitution. Wood tissue was collected in the winter, spring, and summer of 1992. Specimens were cooled from 0 to - 60 [deg]C at a rate of 5 [deg]C h- 1. Freezing stress did not affect the structural organization of wood tissue, but <b>xylem</b> ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells suffered severe injury in the form of intracellular ice crystals. The temperatures at which the ice crystals were first observed depended on the season in which the tissue was collected. Intracellular ice formation was observed at - 20, - 10, and - 5 [deg]C in winter, spring, and summer, respectively. Another type of freezing injury was manifested by fragmented protoplasm with indistinguishable plasma membranes and damaged cell ultrastructure but no evidence of intracellular ice.

40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy {{was used to}} study vascular colonization in susceptible cultivars of tomato infected with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici or Verticillium albo-atrum and of pea infected with F. oxysporum fsp. pisi. There were many similarities in colonization by all pathogens. Hyphae were normally {{in close proximity to}} vessel walls and aligned approximately parallel to the long axes ofvessels. Vessel to vessel colonization was uncommon but occasionally occurred by penetration of intertracheary pit membranes. Pit penetration was achieved by constricted hyphae and localized membrane degradation. Penetration of <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> pit membranes was not observed in either host but colonization of <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells occurred early in disease development in pea but only when the host plant was moribund in tomato. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and V. albo-atrum caused extensive erosion of tomato vessel secondary walls, both where hyphae were in direct contact with walls and in areas remote from invading hyphae. Penetration of secondary walls was common but its extent was limited by the primary wall/middle lamella. There was little secondary wall erosion in pea although the primary wall/middle lamella of pit fields was often extensively degraded. Many vessel and <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cell secondary walls in both species contained, irregular electron-opaque areas. Vessel walls and colonizing hyphae were often coated in an amorphous electron-opaque material. The material occluded intertracheary and <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> pit cavities and encrusted intertracheary pit membranes. Its appearance varied from smooth to rough and “bubbly”. A distinctive fibrillar coating was found much less frequently. Infection was accompanied by the gradual death of <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells throughout infected plants. <b>Xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells adjacent to infected vessels often contained well developed “protective” layers.

30|$|Focussing on {{four types}} of {{parenchyma}} cell around pith regions of branches of Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis, we examined the timing and role of cell death during heartwood formation. Large parenchyma cells that were located in the inner part of the pith died within a year. By contrast, other parenchyma cells died within 4  years, with the timing of cell death {{depending on the type}} of cell. Axial parenchyma cells of the xylem close to the pith died first. Then, small parenchyma cells died in the perimedullary zone in the outer part of the pith. Finally, ray parenchyma cells in the xylem close to the pith died. Variations in the autofluorescence of cell walls, which might have been due to deposition of heartwood substances, were observed first in <b>xylem</b> ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells and small parenchyma cells in the perimedullary zone. Our results indicate that the initiation of heartwood formation occurs within 4  years in pith regions of branches in Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis.

40|$|The {{structure}} and transport properties of pit membranes at {{the interface between}} the metaxylem and <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells and the possible role of these pit membranes in solute transfer to the phloem was investigated. Electron microscopy revealed a fibrillar, almost tubular matrix within the pit membrane structure between the xylem vessels and <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> of leaf blade bundles in rice (Oryza sativa). These pits are involved primarily with regulating water flux to the surrounding <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells. Vascular parenchyma cells contain large mitochondrial populations, numerous dictyosomes, endomembrane complexes and vesicles {{in close proximity to}} the pit membrane. Taken collectively this suggests that endocytosis may occur at this interface. A weak solution of 5, 6 -carboxyfluorescein diacetate (5, 6 -CFDA) was applied to cut ends of leaves and after a minimum of 45 minutes, the distribution of the fluorescent cleavage product, 5, 6 -carboxyfluorescein (5, 6 -CF) was observed using confocal microscopy. Cleavage of 5, 6 -CFDA occurred within the <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells and the non-polar 5, 6 -CF was then symplasmically transported to other parenchyma elements and ultimately, via numerous pore plasmodesmata, to adjacent thick-walled sieve tubes. Application of Lucifer Yellow, and, separately, Texas Red labelled dextran (10 kDa) to the transpiration stream, confirmed that these membrane-impermeant probes could only have been offloaded from the xylem via the xylem vessel-xylem parenchyma pit membranes, suggesting endocytotic transmembrane transfer of these membrane-impermeant fluorophores. Accumulation within the thick-walled sieve tubes, but not in thin-walled sieve tubes, confirms the presence of a symplasmic phloem loading pathway, via pore plasmodesmata between <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> and thick-walled sieve tubes, but not thin-walled sieve tubes...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} {{mechanisms for}} the simultaneous release of anions and cations into the xylem sap in roots, we investigated voltage-dependent ion conductances in the plasmalemma of <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells. We applied the patch-clamp technique to protoplasts {{isolated from the}} <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> by differential enzymic digestion of steles of barley roots (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Apex). In the whole-cell configuration, three types of cation-selective rectifiers could be identified: (a) one activated at membrane potentials above about - 50 mV; (b) a second type of outward current appeared at membrane potentials above + 20 to + 40 mV; (c) below a membrane potential of approximately - 110 mV, an inward rectifier could be distinguished. In addition, an anion-specific conductance manifested itself in single-channel activity in a voltage range extending from about - 100 to + 30 mV, with remarkably slow gating. In excised patches, K+ channels activated at hyperpolarization {{as well as at}} depolarization. We suggest that salt is released from the <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> into the xylem apoplast by simultaneous flow of cations and anions through channels, following electrochemical gradients set up by the ion uptake processes in the cortex and, possibly, the release and reabsorption of ions {{on their way to the}} xylem...|$|E
40|$|Polar auxin {{transport}} (PAT) {{is a major}} {{determinant of}} plant morphology and internal anatomy with important roles in vascular patterning, tropic growth responses, apical dominance and phyllotactic arrangement. Woody plants present a highly complex system of vascular development in which isolated bundles of xylem and phloem gradually unite to form concentric rings of conductive tissue. We generated several transgenic lines of hybrid poplar (Populus tremula x alba) with the auxin-responsive DR 5 promoter driving GUS expression in order to visualize an auxin response during the establishment of secondary growth. Distinct GUS expression in the cambial zone and developing xylem-side derivatives supports the current view of this tissue as a major stream of basipetal PAT. However, we also found novel sites of GUS expression in the primary <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> lining the outer perimeter of the pith. Strands of primary <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> depart the stem as a leaf trace, and showed GUS expression as long as the leaves to which they were connected remained attached (i. e., until just prior to leaf abscission). Tissue composed of primary <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> strands contained measurable levels of free indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and showed basipetal transport of radiolabeled auxin ((3) H-IAA) that was both significantly faster than diffusion and highly sensitive to the PAT inhibitor NPA. Radiolabeled auxin was also able to move between the primary <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> in the interior of the stem and the basipetal stream in the cambial zone, an exchange that was likely mediated by ray parenchyma cells. Our results suggest that (a) channeling of leaf-derived IAA first delineates isolated strands of pre-procambial tissue but then later shifts to include basipetal transport through the rapidly expanding xylem elements, and (b) the transition from primary to secondary vascular development is gradual, with an auxin response preceding the appearance of a unified and radially-organized vascular cambium...|$|E
40|$|Freezing {{behavior}} of wood tissue of red osier dogwood (Cornus sericea L.) cannot {{be explained by}} current concepts of freezing resistance. Previous studies indicated that water in wood tissue presumably froze extracellularly. However, {{it was observed that}} <b>xylem</b> ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells within these tissues could survive temperatures as low as - 80 [deg]C and the walls of these cells did not collapse during freezing (S. R. Malone and E. N. Ashworth [1991] Plant Physiol 95 : 871 - 881). This observation was unexpected and is inconsistent with the current hypothesis of cell response during freezing. Hence, the objective of our study was to further examine the mechanism of freezing resistance of wood tissue of red osier dogwood. We studied freezing stress response of <b>xylem</b> ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells of red osier dogwood using freeze substitution and transmission electron microscopy. Wood samples were collected in winter, spring, and summer of 1992. Specimens were cooled from 0 [deg]C to - 60 [deg]C at 5 [deg]C/h. Freezing stress did not affect the structural organization of wood tissue. However, the <b>xylem</b> ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells showed two unique responses to a freezing stress: protoplasm contraction and protoplasm fragmentation. Protoplasm contraction was evident at all freezing temperatures and in tissues collected at different times of the year. Cells with fragmented protoplasm, however, were noticed only in tissues collected in spring and summer. Protoplasm contraction in winter tissue occurred without apparent damage to the protoplasm. In contrast, protoplasm contraction in spring and summer tissues was accompanied by substantial damage. No evidence of intracellular ice formation was observed in parenchyma cells exposed to freezing stress. Differences in protoplasm contraction and appearance of cells with fragmented protoplasm likely indicated seasonal changes in cold hardiness of the wood tissue of red osier dogwood. We speculate that the appearance of fragmented protoplasm may indicate that cells are being injured by an alternative mechanism in spring and summer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Lignification in Zinnia elegans L. stems is {{characterized}} by a burst in the production of H 2 O 2, the apparent fate of which is to be used by xylem peroxid-ases for the polymerization of p-hydroxycinnamyl alco-hols into lignins. A search for the sites of H 2 O 2 production in the differentiating xylem of Z. elegans stems by the simultaneous use of optical (bright field, polarized light and epi-polarization) and electron-microscope tools revealed that H 2 O 2 is produced on the outer-face of the plasma membrane of both differenti-ating (living) thin-walled xylem cells and particular (non-lignifying) <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells. From the production sites it diffuses to the differentiating (sec-ondary cell wall-forming) and differentiated lignifying xylem vessels. H 2 O 2 diffusion occurs mainly through the continuous cell wall space. Both the experimental data and the theoretical calculations suggest that H 2 O 2 dif-fusion from the sites of production might not limit the rate of xylem cell wall lignification. It can be concluded that H 2 O 2 is produced at the plasma membrane in dif-ferentiating (living) thin-walled xylem cells and <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells associated to xylem vessels, and that it diffuses to adjacent secondary lignifying xylem vessels.

Compartmentation of plant products and their biosynthetic pathways occurs at both the cellular and subcellular levels in a highly regulated fashion. As part of the investigation into the compartmentation of alkaloid biosynthetic pathways, two enzymes, tryptophan synthase ? (TSB) and tyrosine decarboxylase (TyDC), have been localized in Camptotheca acuminata and Papaver somniferum respectively. In C. acuminata, TSB plays a role in the biosynthesis of the monoterpene indole alkaloid camptothecin (CPT). Subcellular localization of TSB using immunogold labeling was conducted in different tissue parts of a two year old tree and thirty day old seedlings. In the tree leaf tissue, TSB was localized to the chloroplasts of the palisade cells. In the seedling tissue, TSB was localized to the chloroplasts of the palisade cells as well as the plastids and nuclei of the <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> in the leaves. In the seedling stem, TSB was localized to the chloroplasts and some nuclei of the <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> In the seedling root, TSB was localized to the plastids of the <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> but mostly to the plastids of the outer cortical cells.

40|$|The {{cortical}} microfilament (MF) {{component of}} the cytoskeleton within axial elements of the secondary vascular system of the angiosperm tree, Aesculus hippocastanum L. (horse-chestnut) was studied using transmission electron microscopy of ultrathin sections and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of actin in thick sections. As seen by electron microscopy, MF bundles have a net axial orientation within fusiform cambial cells and their secondary vascular derivatives (i. e. in the axial <b>xylem</b> and phloem <b>parenchyma,</b> <b>xylem</b> fibres, vessel and sieve elements, and companion cells). Immunofluorescence studies, however, reveal that this axial orientation can be more accurately described as a helix of extremely high pitch; it is a persistent feature of all axial secondary vascular elements during their development. Helical MF arrays are the only arrangement seen in secondary phloem cells. However, in addition to helices, other MF arrays are seen in secondary xylem cells. For example, fibres possess ellipses of MFs associated with simple-pit formation, and vessel elements possess circular arrays of MFs that associate with the developing inter-vessel bordered pits, ray–vessel contact pits, and with the perforation plate. Linear MF arrays are seen co-oriented with the developing tertiary wall-thickenings in vessel elements. The possible roles of MFs during the cytodifferentiation of secondary vascular cells is discussed, and {{compared with that of}} microtubules...|$|R
30|$|Changes in the {{morphology}} {{and functions}} of vacuoles provide useful information about the mechanism of cell death. In the present study, we monitored the morphology and contents of vacuoles during the death of ray parenchyma cells in the conifer Cryptomeria japonica. In differentiating <b>xylem,</b> ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells had large central vacuoles. In sapwood, vacuoles in ray parenchyma cells contained proteins, an indication {{that one of the}} main functions of these vacuoles might be protein storage. A dramatic decrease in the protein content of some vacuoles was detected in the intermediate wood before the initiation of vacuole rupture. Although vacuole rupture was detected from the intermediate wood to the outermost heartwood, some vacuoles were obviously enlarged in the inner intermediate wood. Condensed nuclei were first observed after the rupture of these large vacuoles in ray parenchyma cells. It seems plausible that the autolysis of the contents of ray parenchyma cells might be caused by the rupture of the enlarged vacuoles in the inner intermediate wood.|$|R
40|$|By {{introducing}} a chimeric gene fusion of the osmotin promoter and [beta]-glucuronidase into tobacco by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, we have demonstrated {{a very specific}} pattern of temporal and spatial regulation of the osmotin promoter during normal plant development and after adaptation to NaCl. We {{have found that the}} osmotin promoter has a very high natural level of activity in mature pollen grains during anther dehiscence and in pericarp tissue at the final, desiccating stages of fruit development. GUS activity was rapidly lost after pollen germination. The osmotin promoter thus appears to be unique among active pollen promoters described to date in that it is active only in dehydrated pollen. The osmotin promoter was also active in corolla tissue at the onset of senescence. Adaptation of plants to NaCl highly stimulated osmotin promoter activity in epidermal and cortex parenchyma cells in the root elongation zone; in epidermis and <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells in stem internodes; and in epidermis, mesophyll, and <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells in developed leaves. The spatial and temporal expression pattern of the osmotin gene appears consistent with both osmotic and pathogen defense functions of the gene...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of antigibberellins to potato plant cultures {{results in an}} accelerated tuber appearance, caused by stimulation of pith-,and cortex-cell growth, particularly in the radial direction. Their growth considerably precedes the initiation of parenchymatous cell divisions, which are the first steps of naturally occurrring tuberisation, regulated by a different mechanism than the quantitative proportion of endogenous gibberellins and cytokinins. Part of the cortex cells change the orientation of their divisions to a periclinal one. The <b>xylem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells also undergo hypertrophy...|$|E
40|$|We {{have been}} {{interested}} in studying the molecular mechanisms of freeze-tolerance in woody plants. To address this question, seasonal protein extractions were taken from red-osier dogwood (Corpus sericea L.) xylem in an attempt to identify proteins associated with cold acclimation in extremely freeze-tolerant organism. A 24 kDa protein was found to have maximum accumulation during periods of cold acclimation. A polyclonal antibody was raised against this protein and used for subsequent screening of a cDNA expression library generated from cold acclimated xylem. Four unique cDNA s were subsequently sequenced and found to encode putative novel dehydrin-like proteins. Immunogold in situ localization, using the anti- 24 kDa antibody, revealed abundant labeling throughout the cytosol and nuclei of cold acclimated <b>xylem</b> ray <b>parenchyma,</b> pith parenchyma, and cortical tissues. In addition, a novel association with plasmodesmata was observed within the simple pits of <b>xylem</b> ray <b>parenchyma</b> and adjacent differentiating xylem cell types. Although the dehydrin function remains unknown, they may non-specifically stabilize nuclear and cytosolic macromolecules and membrane surfaces during periods of desiccation. Previous studies have related the occurrence of dehydrins during cold acclimation due to the desiccative stress induced by the formation of extracellular ice during freezing. As a result, it was of interest to determine the environmental regulatory mechanism for 24 kDa protein accumulation. Through extensive controlled photoperiod and field studies, we determined that the 24 kDa dehydrin-like protein accumulates in response to prolonged short day exposure and is phytochrome mediated. Through usage of climatic ecotypes, we have confirmed that this photoperiod regulation is under genetic control. Decreasing photoperiod in late summer triggered a series of physiological events that ultimately reduced stem water content, enhanced freeze-tolerance and increased 24 kDa protein accumulation. As a result, freeze-tolerance was acquired prior to the onset of the first frost episodes. Interspecific analyses between 24 Cornus species determined that 24 kDa protein occurrence is widespread and occurs in both supercooling and non-supercooling tissues. Due to the commonality of the 24 kDa protein in less hardy species, we are unsure of the 24 kDa protein s role in the extreme freeze tolerance that is characteristic of C. sericea. ...|$|R
40|$|Sengon (Falcataria moluccana) is {{fast growing}} species mostly planted by farmers {{due to its}} high productivity. Sengon {{originating}} from Solomon Island has been known with the high productivity eventhough susceptible to gall rust attack; on the other hand, sengon originating from Wamena {{is known to be}} more tolerant to gall rust attack. There is no previous study in terms of stem xylem structures comparing sengon from those seed origins. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify the differences in anatomical structure of sengon stem; and to compare the xylem cell based on proportions and dimensions of the stems between the two provenances. Six stem samples of tolerant Wamena provenance and six samples of susceptible Solomon provenance were used in this study. Samples were collected from progeny trial of sengon in Lumajang, Jawa Timur. The observations include the anatomical structures and vessel element, parenchyma apotracheal cell, <b>parenchyma</b> paratracheal cell, <b>xylem</b> fiber, fiber length, and fiber diameter. The result showed that {{there was no difference in}} terms of anatomical structures between sengon Wamena (tolerant) and Solomon (susceptible) stem in cross section, tangential and radial section of periderm, phloem, secondary xylem (vessel cell, <b>xylem</b> fiber, and <b>parenchyma</b> <b>xylem)</b> and pith. However, in one of susceptible stem sample, a black reaction zone on the secondary xylem was found. Analysis of variance showed that parenchyma paratracheal cell, apotracheal cell, number of xylem fibers, xylem fiber diameter and length were not significantly different between stem of sengon Wamena (tolerant) and Solomon (susceptible) ...|$|R
40|$|Differential thermal analysis, {{differential}} scanning calorimetry, pulsed nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy, and low temperature microscopy are utilized to investigate low temperature freezing points or exotherms which occur near − 40 C in the xylem of cold-acclimated shagbark hickory (Carya ovata L.). Experiments using these methods demonstrate that the low temperature exotherm results from the freezing of cellular water in a manner predicted for supercooled dilute aqueous solutions. Heat release on freezing, {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} relaxation times, and freezing and thawing curves for hickory twigs all point to a supercooled fraction in the xylem at subfreezing temperatures. Calorimetric and low temperature microscopic analyses indicate that freezing occurs intracellularly in the <b>xylem</b> ray <b>parenchyma.</b> The supercooled fraction {{is found to be}} extremely stable, even at temperatures only slightly above the homogeneous nucleation temperature for water (− 38 C).
