40|$|Abstract — This study {{concerns}} two issues. Firstly an equiva-lence {{is given}} between {{the use of}} 1 D Fourier-Bessel series and the <b>X</b> <b>Wave</b> Transform, as applied to annular arrays and the computation and tuning of linear fields. Secondly, an optimal choice of modelling aperture in the Fourier-Bessel analysis is suggested. The Fourier-Bessel approach is a numerical method which has been developed and implemented for calculation and tuning of linear lossless fields in both continuous wave and pulsed wave cases. The <b>X</b> <b>Wave</b> Transform is a theoretical mathematical method for expressing an arbitrary linear lossless fields as a summation of weighted <b>X</b> <b>Wave</b> expansions. Our discussion establishes a connection between these two studies, showing that the numerical Fourier-Bessel approach is in the limit equivalent to the analytical <b>X</b> <b>wave</b> approach to the description of circular symmetric fields. Furthermore it suggests a numerical optimisation of the Fourier-Bessel approach by implementing of a one-off optimal modelling aperture which replaces the previous iterative approach. Potential applications exist in the area of optimal ultrasound field calculation and tuning, for example in the study of contrast agent responses. I...|$|E

By replacing analog phase shifters and switches in existing ionosonde with digital phase shifters with different initial phase, 0 °, + 90 °, − 90 °, circularly polarized waves are synthesized digitally within the range of 1 - 30 MHz, which eliminates the nonlinearity and expands the bandwidth of the ionosonde, and {{there is no need to}} switch the analog switches continuously.

40|$|<b>X</b> <b>waves,</b> spatiotemporal {{generalization}} of the monochromatic Bessel- (or Durnin-) type beams, are known in linear acoustic, microwave and optics for their unique property of defeating both {{spatial and temporal}} spreadings. Recently, we {{brought to the attention}} that X-type waves are also the key to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics observed in the nonlinear (high intensity) regime. Indeed, <b>X</b> <b>waves</b> represent the normal-propagation mode for a wide class of parametric interactions described by hyperbolic nonlinear models featuring spatial self-focusing and temporal self-broadening. Here, we provide a complete and detailed description of the experiment in which the spontaneous appearance of <b>X</b> <b>waves</b> has been observed. The experiment concerns frequency doubling of a 170 -fs, 50 -mum standard laser wave packet in a 22 -mm lithium triborate crystal, tuned for second-harmonic generation with positive phase mismatch, positive group-velocity dispersion, and large group-velocity mismatch. Conventional beam-profile and autocorrelation measurements at the crystal output face show evidence of spatiotemporal self-trapping. The characterization of the free-space propagation reveals sub-Gaussian diffraction and pulse broadening, consistent with the presence of angular dispersion.

In this first electropenetrography (EPG) study of S. titanus, we characterized its feeding waveforms and defined their biological meanings. Four typical waveform phases (pathway, <b>X</b> <b>wave,</b> sustained ingestion, and interruption) and four families within those phases (A, B, C, and N) were characterized using DC EPG technology. We proposed biological meanings for these waveforms based on excreta pH-ingestion correlations, presence of X waves, and comparison with previous AC, DC, and AC-DC EPG waveforms conducted on Cicadomorpha. We observed that sustained (i. e., > 10 min) ingestion by a deltocephaline leafhopper can occur from both xylem and phloem vascular cells. Waveform C 2 x represented ingestion of xylem fluid, and two waveforms represented behaviors when stylets were inserted into phloem sieve elements: C 2 p variant 1 (C 2 p- 1), which may represent salivation (perhaps simultaneous with ingestion), and C 2 p variant 2 (C 2 p- 2), which represented active ingestion. Furthermore, we found that the EPG-recorded <b>X</b> <b>wave</b> has a dual meaning by occurring prior to sustained ingestion from either phloem or xylem. This <b>X</b> <b>wave</b> was very similar in appearance to the model <b>X</b> <b>wave</b> of sharpshooters, an entirely different leafhopper subfamily, Cicadellinae. All cicadellines are obligate xylem-ingesters. Such a “dual-meaning X wave” will provide insights into how the feeding tactics of S. titanus relate to other sheath-feeding hemipterans, and will provide support for future research to clarify the role of this leafhopper as a vector of plant pathogens...|$|E
40|$|BGPI : équipe 6 In {{phytophagous}} hemipterans, salivary sheath-feeding {{species are}} described as xylem or phloemsap-ingesting specialists. Because these two food sources have very different characteristics, two different feeding tactics are associated with this supposed specialization. Study of feeding behavior is crucial to elucidate transmission abilities of vectors of plant pathogens. In a recently published DC-EPG study, {{results showed that the}} leafhopper Scaphoideus titanus (subfamily Deltocephalinae) ingests significantly from both phloem and xylem. S. titanus is an invasive species originally from North America that is now common in French vineyards. Until now, this insect hasbeen considered a phloem-feeder; however, this attribute was solely based on its role as a vector of the Flavescence doree phytoplasma. More importantly from a vector standpoint, S. titanus recordings revealed the first dual-meaning <b>X</b> <b>wave,</b> containing two different-appearing ingestion waveforms that were correlated with phloem and xylem ingestion, respectively. In addition, the S. titanus <b>X</b> <b>wave</b> strongly resembled that of sharpshooter leafhoppers (subfamily Cicadellinae),vectors of Xylella fastidiosa ssp. fastidiosa, the xylem-inhabiting bacterium that causes lethal Pierce’s disease of grape. Recent research has shown that the sharpshooter <b>X</b> <b>wave</b> represents the essential feeding behaviors responsible for inoculation of X. fastidiosa into grape xylem cells. Although many hemipterans ingest from xylem, probably only those few species that perform asharp shooter-style <b>X</b> <b>wave</b> can be X. fastidiosa vectors. Therefore, is it possible that S. titanus could also become a vector of Xylella fastidiosa? Until now, no deltocephaline leafhopper has been formally proven to be a vector of X. fastidiosa. Also, North American X. fastidiosa ssp. fastidiosa has not yet been introduced to Europe. However, if this subspecies were introduced into European vineyards, could S. titanus (already present in the vineyards) be a potential vector...|$|E

After a brief overview of the filamentation process we study the case of an intense filament co-propagating with a weaker seed pulse. The filament is shown to induce strong Cross-Phase-Modulation (XPM) effects on the weak seed pulse: driven by the pump, the seed pulse undergoes pulse splitting with the daughter pulses slaved to their pump counterparts. They undergo strong spatio-temporal reshaping and are transformed into XWaves traveling at the same group velocities as the pump split-off pulses. In the presence of a gain mechanism such as Four-Wave-Mixing or Stimulated Raman Scattering, energy is then transferred from the pump filament leading to amplification of the seed <b>X</b> <b>Wave</b> and formation of a temporally compressed intensity peak...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an {{approach}} for simplifying the experimental arrangement, needed to generate limited diffracting waves through annular ultrasonic arrays, is analyzed in terms mainly {{of the subsequent}} acoustic field. The main idea is to approximate the theoretical X-wave electrical excitations to rectangular driving signals in each array annulus, {{by means of the}} L 2 curve criterion. The differences between theoretical X-wave signals and these approximate signals, related to real excitation effects, were minimized by using the transition times and amplitudes of the rectangular signals as fitting parameters. Acoustic field simulations, based on the impulse response technique, are applied for evaluating the agreement degree between both emitted ultrasonic fields, whit the calculated classical <b>X</b> <b>wave</b> and with the new approximation method proposed here for low-cost limited-diffraction wave generation. In addition, source vibration and ultrasonic field simulated signals were compared with those of the classic <b>x</b> <b>wave</b> under an exact driving, with the purpose of validating the method. The good agreement between the two vibration signals and resulting field distributions, obtained from the classical <b>X</b> <b>wave</b> excitations and those provided by the drastic simplification presented here, can be justified by the filtering effects induced by the transducer elements bands in frequency domain. These results suggest the possibility of achieving limited diffraction waves with relatively simple driving waveforms, which can be implemented with a moderate cost in analogical electronics...|$|E
