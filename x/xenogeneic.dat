Depending on the application, the cells can be genetically altered to express any required protein. However, enough research has to be carried out to validate the safety and stability of the expressed gene before these types of cells can be used.|$|E

Yet 1993 he acted as a junior operator of the former Baxter Novacor Company for the wearable artificial heart system Novacor and researched at last as a proctor of JarvikHeart in cooperation with Robert Jarvik developing a new miniaturized “valve axial pump”. Supported by the Bavarian Research Foundation (Bayerische Forschungsstiftung, grant 219/96) together with his research team as a consultant of cardiac surgery he investigated the <b>xenogeneic</b> transplantation of multi-transgenic pig hearts as a possible future organ replacement therapy in man since 1997. Since 2004 he worked within the scope of a Transregio Research Group FOR 535 of the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)) and since 2012 as a principal investigator (PI) for the sector of <b>xenogeneic</b> heart transplantation of the Transregio Research Collaborative Research Centre 127 (Transregio-Sonderforschungbereich SFB 127) with the speaker Bruno Reichart in the Walter-Brendel-Center of experimental medicine (WBex). Cardiac xenotransplantation (from pig to man), which was studied by Brenner and Reichart since 1997, has reached a preclinical status despite of a higher immunological complexity than allotransplantation due to preexisting and new-built antibodies against whole organs. Using a patented combination (EP 1181034 B1, EP 1980263A1, US 8,435,520 B2) consisting of transgenic organs/cells and immunoadsorption (elimination of antibodies from the recipient) and a special combination of immunosuppressive drugs hyperacute and delayed xenograft rejection should be prevented and long-term survival of a xenograft should be enabled and realized. In times of massively increasing shortage of donor organs and yet major problems with artificial hearts (cable connections, batteries, strokes and infections) this makes xenotransplantation highly interesting in the area of organ/cell transplantation. By using an almost unlimited source of porcine organs (heart, kidney, lung, cornea, (liver rather improbably) and cells (pig islet cells) against diabetes, nigrostriatal brain cells against Morbus Parkinson, stem cells, bone/-marrow, skin etc.) not only in Europe, but also worldwide many people could be helped with animal cells or with the replacement of a whole organ. In view of 45 original papers, over 110 national and international oral presentations, two highly prized international research awards and as an advising tutor of 20 postdocs and postgraduates (for example [...] ) Brenner did pioneer work and substantially contributed to the scientific progress of the LMU, especially due to his know-how in the area of xenotransplantation and mechanical circulatory support systems. Brenner can be classified as an international expert for mechanical and “biological” heart replacement, wherefore he also owns patents (for example [...] ). In his teaching activity since 2004 Brenner was involved in the introduction of the practical MECUM student educational program of the LMU oriented to the Harvard-University concept. Since 2007 he was the responsible organizing associate lecturer for the compartment of cardiac surgery of the LMU and since 2011 deputy speaker of the cardiovascular educational block of the new medical student education system Modul 23 of the LMU. As the leader of the cardiac surgical advanced training program he organized about 400 specialist and scientific qualification performances mostly as from the Bayerische Landesärztekammer certificated Monday education for consultant training and professional development since 2003.

Brenner was promoted to doctor of medicine at the Physiological Institute of the LMU Munich with magna cum laude 1995. His dissertation covered the effect of different peptides on the sympathetic nervous system of Brown-Norway rats before and after inhibition of converting enzyme. This work was essential for the development of the medicine Ramipril. In 1997 he obtained a scholarship of the Bavarian Research Foundation (Bayerische Forschungsstiftung) for a project dealing with the development of gene technological and mechanical proceedings to realize <b>xenogeneic</b> transplantation of pig organs at the Institute for Surgery Research of the LMU.

Neutrophils and monocytes/elicited M were rapidly recruited in response to <b>xenogeneic</b> pig (PK 15 or spleen) cells and, to a significantly lesser extent, allogeneic cells. These innate responses preceded T cell infiltration and occurred in their absence in SCID mice. Syngeneic cells induced negligible neutrophil or M responses.

40|$|<b>Xenogeneic</b> tissues {{are derived}} from other animal species and provide a source of {{material}} for engineering mechanically functional tissue grafts, such as heart valves, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage. <b>Xenogeneic</b> tissues, however, contain molecules, known as antigens, which invoke an immune reaction following implantation into a patient.

However, processes used for cell and antigen removal from tissues often have deleterious effects on the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tissue, rendering the tissue unsuitable for implantation due to poor mechanical properties.

40|$|<b>Xenogeneic</b> {{lymphocytes}} can induce proliferative {{responses in}} the mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) ~ which are as strong as those induced by allogeneic lymphocytes (1).

The recently described "primed lymphocyte typing " (PLT) assay (2) {{has made it possible}} to determine indirectly the genetic control of <b>xenogeneic</b> MLC. Sensitization in a mixed lymphocyte culture positively selects for memory cells which give a rapid secondary response upon restimulation with cells from the initial stimulator (3, 4). Studies in human families (2, 5 - 7) showed that restimulation is caused by the same LD determinants of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) that induce primary MLC responses. In this paper we present studies of human lymphocytes which were sensitized to cells of a single mouse strain and restimulated with cells from a variety of strains. By choosing combinations of primary and secondary stimulator which shared only certain parts of their genetic material, we could assay the relative importance of non-H- 2 and various H- 2 antigens for activation of human lymphocytes.

Here, we report a robust model of <b>xenogeneic</b> graft-versus-host-like disease (GVHD) based on intravenous injection of human PBMC into 2 Gy conditioned NOD-scid IL 2 rγnull mice. These mice develop <b>xenogeneic</b> GVHD consistently (100 %) following injection of {{as few as}} 5 × 106 PBMC, regardless of the PBMC donor used. As in human disease, the development of <b>xenogeneic</b> GVHD is highly dependent on expression of host major histocompatibility complex class I and class II molecules and is associated with severely depressed haematopoiesis. Interrupting the tumour necrosis factor-α signalling cascade with etanercept, a therapeutic drug in clinical trials for the treatment of human GVHD, delays the onset and progression of disease. This model now provides the opportunity to investigate in vivo mechanisms of <b>xenogeneic</b> GVHD as well as to assess the efficacy of therapeutic agents rapidly...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of cells}} from <b>xenogeneic</b> origin in a bioartificial liver {{can have a}} number of {{immunological}} consequences, not only for the cells in the bioartificial liver but also for the patient receiving the bioartificial liver treatment. The impact of these consequences will depend on the immune status of the patient receiving bioartificial liver treatment, the duration and frequency of the treatment and on the extent of interaction between the patients blood (or plasma) and the <b>xenogeneic</b> liver cells. In an experimental model we infused rats with a culture supernatant of pig hepatocytes and demonstrated using Western blots and immunohistological techniques that antibodies are raised against the very small amounts of the pig hepatocyte-derived proteins present in the culture medium. Potential problems of bioartificial liver destruction and the possibility of hypersensitivity reactions due to the secretion of <b>xenogeneic</b> proteins into the circulation of the patient are discussed. Because the liver has {{an important role in the}} clearance of immune complexes it is concluded that precautions should be taken when (repeated) application of a <b>xenogeneic</b> bioartificial liver in patients with liver failure is considere...|$|E
