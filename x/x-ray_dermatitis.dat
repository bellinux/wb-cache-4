25|$|The use of X-rays {{for medical}} {{purposes}} (which developed {{into the field}} of radiation therapy) was pioneered by Major John Hall-Edwards in Birmingham, England. Then in 1908, {{he had to have}} his left arm amputated because of the spread of <b>X-ray</b> <b>dermatitis</b> on his arm.|$|E
50|$|Hall-Edwards' {{interest}} in X-rays {{cost him his}} left arm. A cancer (then called <b>X-ray</b> <b>dermatitis)</b> was sufficiently advanced by 1904 to cause him to write papers and give public addresses {{on the dangers of}} X-rays and only then were protective measures begun. He lost his personal battle, and his left arm had to be amputated at the elbow in 1908, and four fingers on his right arm soon thereafter, leaving only a thumb. His left hand is held by the Birmingham University Museum as a specimen to demonstrate the effects of radiation.|$|E
