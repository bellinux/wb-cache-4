5|$|The {{carotenoids}} are pigmented molecules found {{naturally in}} plants, and {{some types of}} fungi, including S.scutellata. A 1965 study reported the carotenoid composition of this fungus, found to contain {{a high proportion of}} monocyclic carotenes—carotenes with only one cyclohexene ring, such as beta-carotene. Also present were minor amounts of <b>xanthophyll,</b> a molecule structurally related to the carotenes.|$|E
25|$|This <b>xanthophyll,</b> {{like its}} sister {{compound}} zeaxanthin, has primarily {{been used in}} food and supplement manufacturing as a colorant due to its yellow-red color. Lutein absorbs blue light and therefore appears yellow at low concentrations and orange-red at high concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Most dinophyte chloroplasts contain form II RuBisCO, {{at least}} the {{photosynthetic}} pigments chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c2, beta-carotene, {{and at least one}} dinophyte-unique <b>xanthophyll</b> (peridinin, dinoxanthin, or diadinoxanthin), giving many a golden-brown color. All dinophytes store starch in their cytoplasm, and most have chloroplasts with thylakoids arranged in stacks of three.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} structure of <b>xanthophylls</b> {{is similar to}} that of carotenes, but <b>xanthophylls</b> contain oxygen atoms, while carotenes are purely hydrocarbons with no oxygen. <b>Xanthophylls</b> contain their oxygen either as hydroxyl groups and/or as pairs of hydrogen atoms that are substituted by oxygen atoms acting as a bridge (epoxide). For this reason, they are more polar than the purely hydrocarbon carotenes, and it is this difference that allows their separations from carotenes in many types of chromatography. Typically, carotenes are more orange in color than <b>xanthophylls.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Xanthophylls,</b> oxygenated {{derivatives}} of carotenes, play critical {{roles in}} photosynthetic apparatus of cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants. Although the <b>xanthophylls</b> biosynthetic pathway of algae is largely unknown, {{it is of}} particular interest because they have a very complicated evolutionary history. Carotenoid hydroxylase (CHY) is an important protein that plays essential roles in <b>xanthophylls</b> biosynthesis. With the availability of 18 sequenced algal genomes, we performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of chy genes and explored their distribution, structure, evolution, origins, and expression...|$|R
40|$|Carotenes, {{and their}} oxygenated {{derivatives}} <b>xanthophylls,</b> are essential {{components of the}} photosynthetic apparatus. They contribute to the assembly of photosynthetic complexes and participate in light absorption and chloroplast photoprotection. Here, we studied the role of <b>xanthophylls,</b> as distinct from that of carotenes, by characterizing a no <b>xanthophylls</b> (nox) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which was obtained by combining mutations targeting the four carotenoid hydroxylase genes. nox plants retained alpha- and beta-carotenes but were devoid in <b>xanthophylls.</b> The phenotype included depletion of light-harvesting complex (LHC) subunits and impairment of nonphotochemical quenching, two effects consistent with the location of <b>xanthophylls</b> in photosystem II antenna, but also a decreased efficiency of photosynthetic electron transfer, photosensitivity, and lethality in soil. Biochemical analysis revealed that the nox mutant was specifically depleted in photosystem I function due to a severe deficiency in PsaA/B subunits. While the stationary level of psaA/B transcripts showed no major differences between genotypes, the stability of newly synthesized PsaA/B proteins was decreased and translation of psaA/B mRNA was impaired in nox with respect to wild-type plants. We conclude that <b>xanthophylls,</b> besides their role in photoprotection and LHC assembly, are also needed for photosystem I core translation and stability, thus making these compounds indispensable for autotrophic growth...|$|R
25|$|The {{cylinder}} {{also has}} an air vacuum chamber which removes air bubbles from the dough before extruding. Otherwise small bubbles will form in the pasta and decreases the mechanical strength which cause breakage from hours to days after drying. The air also oxidizes the carotenoid or <b>xanthophyll</b> which results in a white, chalky appearance of the pasta.|$|E
25|$|The carotenes alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene; and the <b>xanthophyll</b> beta-cryptoxanthin (all {{of which}} contain {{beta-ionone}} rings), {{but no other}} carotenoids, function as provitamin A in herbivores and omnivore animals, which possess the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase which cleaves beta-carotene in the intestinal mucosa and converts it to retinol. In general, carnivores are poor converters of ionone-containing carotenoids, and pure carnivores such as cats and ferrets lack beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinal (resulting in none of the carotenoids being forms of vitamin A for these species).|$|E
2500|$|Lutein ( [...] or from Latin luteus meaning [...] "yellow") is a <b>xanthophyll</b> {{and one of}} 600 known {{naturally}} occurring carotenoids. Lutein is synthesized only by plants and like other xanthophylls is found in high quantities in green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale and yellow carrots. In green plants, xanthophylls act to modulate light energy and serve as non-photochemical quenching agents to deal with triplet chlorophyll (an excited form of chlorophyll), which is overproduced at very high light levels, during photosynthesis. See <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle for this topic.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Xanthophylls</b> are {{the most}} common yellow {{pigments}} that form one of two major divisions of the carotenoid group. The name is from Greek xanthos (ξανθος, [...] "yellow") + phyllon (φύλλον, [...] "leaf"). <b>Xanthophylls</b> are most commonly found in the leaves of green plants, but they also find their way into animals through the food they eat. For example, the yellow color of chicken egg yolks, fat, and skin comes from the feed the chickens consume. Chicken farmers understand this, and often add <b>xanthophylls,</b> usually lutein, to make the egg yolks more yellow.|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological studies {{demonstrate}} {{that a high}} dietary intake of carotenoids may offer protection against age-related macular degeneration, cancer and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Humans cannot synthesize carotenoids and depend on their dietary intake. Major carotenoids {{that have been found}} in human plasma can be divided into two groups, carotenes (nonpolar molecules, such as β-carotene, α-carotene or lycopene) and <b>xanthophylls</b> (polar carotenoids that include an oxygen atom in their structure, such as lutein, zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin). Only two dietary carotenoids, namely lutein and zeaxanthin (macular <b>xanthophylls),</b> are selectively accumulated in the human retina. A third carotenoid, meso-zeaxanthin, is formed directly in the human retina from lutein. Additionally, <b>xanthophylls</b> account for about 70 % of total carotenoids in all brain regions. Some specific properties of these polar carotenoids must explain why they, among other available carotenoids, were selected during evolution to protect the retina and brain. It is also likely that the selective uptake and deposition of macular <b>xanthophylls</b> in the retina and brain are enhanced by specific xanthophyll-binding proteins. We hypothesize that the high membrane solubility and preferential transmembrane orientation of macular <b>xanthophylls</b> distinguish them from other dietary carotenoids, enhance their chemical and physical stability in retina and brain membranes and maximize their protective action in these organs. Most importantly, <b>xanthophylls</b> are selectively concentrated in the most vulnerable regions of lipid bilayer membranes enriched in polyunsaturated lipids. This localization is ideal if macular <b>xanthophylls</b> are to act as lipid-soluble antioxidants, which is the most accepted mechanism through which lutein and zeaxanthin protect neural tissue against degenerative diseases...|$|R
40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is associated with}} a low level of macular carotenoids in the eye retina. Only two carotenoids, namely lutein and zeaxanthin are selectively accumulated in the human eye retina from blood plasma where more than twenty other carotenoids are available. The third carotenoid which is found in the human retina, meso-zeaxanthin is formed directly in the retina from lutein. All these carotenoids, named also macular <b>xanthophylls,</b> play key roles in eye health and retinal disease. Macular <b>xanthophylls</b> are thought to combat light-induced damage mediated by reactive oxygen species by absorbing the most damaging incoming wavelength of light prior to the formation of reactive oxygen species (a function expected of carotenoids in nerve fibers) and by chemically and physically quenching reactive oxygen species once they are formed (a function expected of carotenoids in photoreceptor outer segments). There are two major hypotheses about the precise location of macular <b>xanthophylls</b> in the nerve fiber layer of photoreceptor axons and in photoreceptor outer segments. According to the first, macular <b>xanthophylls</b> transversely incorporate in the lipid-bilayer portion of membranes of the human retina. According to the second, macular <b>xanthophylls</b> are protein-bound by membrane-associated, xanthophyll-binding proteins. In this review we indicate specific properties of macular <b>xanthophylls</b> that could help explain their selective accumulation in the primate retina with special attention paid to xanthophyll-membrane interactions...|$|R
2500|$|... β-Carotene is {{composed}} of two retinyl groups, and is broken down in the mucosa of the human small intestine by β-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase to retinal, a form of vitamin A. β-Carotene {{can be stored in}} the liver and body fat and converted to retinal as needed, thus making it a form of vitamin A for humans and some other mammals. The carotenes α-carotene and γ-carotene, due to their single retinyl group (β-ionone ring), also have some vitamin A activity (though less than β-carotene), as does the <b>xanthophyll</b> carotenoid β-cryptoxanthin. All other carotenoids, including lycopene, have no beta-ring and thus no vitamin A activity (although they may have antioxidant activity and thus biological activity in other ways).|$|E
6000|$|In pure yellow flowers, as in pure white, human {{interest}} is wanting. It {{is true that}} yellow is a human colour, since in the hair we find yellows of different shades--it is a pity that we cannot find, or have not found, a better word than [...] "shades" [...] for the specific differences of a colour. There is the so-called tow, the tawny, the bronze, the simple yellow, and the golden, which includes many varieties, and the hair called carroty. But none of these has the flower yellow. Richard Jefferies tells us that when he placed a sovereign {{by the side of}} a dandelion he saw how unlike the two colours were--that, in fact, no two colours could seem more unlike than the yellow of gold and the yellow of the flower. It is not necessary to set a lock of hair and any yellow flower side by side to know how utterly different the hues are. The yellow of the hair is like that of metals, of clay, of stone, and of various earthy substances, and like the fur of some mammals, and like <b>xanthophyll</b> in leaf and stalk, and the yellow sometimes seen in clouds. When Ossian, in his famous address to the sun, speaks of his yellow hair floating on the eastern clouds, we instantly feel the truth as well as beauty of the simile. We admire the yellow flower for the purity and brilliance of its colour, just as we admire some bird notes solely for the purity and brightness of the sound, however unlike the human voice they may be. We also admire it in many instances for the exquisite beauty of its form, and the beauty of the contrast of pure yellow and deep green, as in the yellow flag, mimulus, and numerous other plants. But however much we may admire, we do not experience that intimate and tender feeling which the blues and reds inspire in us; in other words, the yellow flower has not the expression which distinguishes those of other colours. Thus, when Tennyson speaks of the [...] "speedwell's darling blue," [...] we know that he is right--that he expresses a feeling about this flower common to all of us; but no poet would make so great, so absurd a mistake as to describe the purest and loveliest yellow of the most prized and familiar wild flower--buttercup or kingcup, yellow flag, sea poppy, marsh marigold, or broom, or furze, or rock-rose, let us say--by such a word--the word that denotes an intimate and affectionate feeling--the feeling one cherishes for the loved ones of our kind. Nor could that word of Tennyson be properly used of any pure white flower--the stitchwort for instance; nor of any white and yellow flower like the Marguerite. But no sooner do you get a touch of rose or crimson in the whitest flower, as we see in the daisy and eyebright, than you can say of it that it is a [...] "dear" [...] or a [...] "darling" [...] colour, and no one can find fault with the expression.|$|E
50|$|Antheraxanthin is an {{intermediate}} molecule of the <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle in most photosynthetic eukaryotes, namely plants, and some bacteria.

5000|$|The yellow {{color of}} the human macula lutea (literally, yellow spot) in the retina of the eye results from the lutein and {{zeaxanthin}} it contains, both <b>xanthophylls</b> again requiring a source in the human diet {{to be present in}} the eye. These <b>xanthophylls</b> protect the eye from ionizing blue and ultraviolet light, which they absorb. These two specific <b>xanthophylls</b> do not function in the mechanism of sight, since they cannot be converted to retinal (also called retinaldehyde or vitamin A aldehyde). Their arrangement {{is believed to be the}} cause of Haidinger's brush, an entoptic phenomenon that allows to perceive the polarization of light.|$|R
40|$|The {{growth and}} level of <b>xanthophylls</b> of several {{representative}} species of green algae were investigated as a possible source of pigmentation for the egg yolk and broiler markets. Chlorella pyrenoidosa 7 - 11 - 05 was selected for fermentation studies because of its high level of <b>xanthophylls</b> and wide temperature range for growth. The heterotrophic metabolism was preferred because of the ease of adaptability to present fermentation equipment. When used as the sole carbon source, glucose was the only sugar, among many tested, that gave appreciable growth in illuminated shaken flasks. A dry cell weight of 90 g per liter and total <b>xanthophylls</b> of 450 mg per liter were obtained from 190 g per liter of glucose monohydrate in 168 -hr illuminated shaken flasks. Higher levels of glucose decreased yields. In combination with glucose, monosaccharides, such as fructose and galactose, were readily assimilated. The 7 - 11 - 05 strain was adapted to galactose as the sole carbon source after six vegetative passages. Light of the proper intensity and duration stimulated total <b>xanthophylls</b> approximately 35 %. The effect on dry cell weight and total <b>xanthophylls</b> of seven antibiotics added at various levels in shaken flasks was studied. Erythromycin was essentially stable throughout the fermentation and nontoxic up to 25 μg/ml, with only slight toxicity at higher levels. Both erythromycin and ristocetin were effective in controlling {{a high incidence of}} bacterial contamination in 30 -liter fermentors. With the higher agitation and aeration rates possible in 30 -liter fermentors, dry cell weights in excess of 100 g per liter and total <b>xanthophylls</b> of 467 to 512 mg per liter were readily obtained from 230 to 260 g per liter of glucose in 162 -hr illuminated batch-type fermentations. Continuous-feed runs yielded a dry cell weight of 302 g per liter and total <b>xanthophylls</b> of 650 mg per liter from 520 g per liter of glucose. The type of Chlorella cell produced was an important consideration with respect to the availability of the <b>xanthophylls</b> in pigmenting egg yolks and broilers...|$|R
5000|$|The {{chemical}} {{nature of}} the yellow pigment in budgerigars and other psittacidae is unknown,and {{in the absence of}} a chemical name George A Smith coined the term [...] "psittacins" [...] to cover the yellow, orange and red pigments found in parrots and parrot-like birds. Psittacins impart a far more constant intensity of colour to feathers than do the more commonly found carotenoid pigments such as <b>xanthophyll,</b> the yellow pigment found in the canary. At each moult the canary extracts <b>xanthophyll</b> directly from its food, and the depth of colouration of the growing feathers is determined by the concentration of <b>xanthophyll</b> in its diet.

40|$|Abstract: Three {{experiments}} were accomplished {{to compare the}} efficacy of yellow and red <b>xanthophylls</b> extracted from Tagetes erectus and Capsicum sp., with synthetic citranaxanthin, canthaxanthin, and ester of $-apo- 8 -carotenoic pigments at different concentrations to enhance the yellow color of chicken egg yolk. In each trial brown laying hens were placed in cages, and after seven days of feeding a sorghum-soybean diet without pigments treatments were assigned. Yolk eggs were classified with the Roche yolk color fan (RYCF) or Minolta refractometer. In the first experiment, 168 hens were randomly distributed to seven treatments® with one control group, synthetic pigments, and natural <b>xanthophylls.</b> In {{the second and third}} experiments, 100 hens were assigned to four different treatments consisting in the same basal diet with addition of natural <b>xanthophylls,</b> and three combinations of apo-ester and citranaxantin. In all experiments, after four weeks of feeding these experimental diets, the color of 10 egg yolks per treatment was evaluated 10 different times every other day or twice a week. Results indicated that live performance was not affected by treatments, but the egg yolk color changed significantly according to the pigment added. Hens fed with diets with 7. 5 ppm of yellow <b>xanthophylls</b> extracted from Tagetes and 4. 0 ppm of red <b>xanthophylls</b> from Capsicum had yolk eggs classified as color 11. 7 ± 0. 1.
