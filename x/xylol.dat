In this application, with {{a mixture}} of isomers, it is often {{referred}} to as xylenes or <b>xylol.</b> Solvent xylene often contains a small percentage of ethylbenzene. Like the individual isomers, the mixture is colorless, sweet-smelling, and highly flammable. Areas of application include the printing, rubber, and leather industries. It is a common component of ink, rubber, and adhesives. In thinning paints and varnishes, it can be substituted for toluene where slower drying is desired, and thus is used by conservators of art objects in solubility testing. Similarly it is a cleaning agent, e.g., for steel, silicon wafers, and integrated circuits. In dentistry, xylene can be used to dissolve gutta percha, a material used for endodontics (root canal treatments). In the petroleum industry, xylene is also a frequent component of paraffin solvents, used when the tubing becomes clogged with paraffin wax.

5000|$|The {{cell wall}} of C. cupreum is largely {{composed}} of chitin and glucan, which {{is reflected in}} the large number of acquired genes encoding class V chitin synthase and glucan synthase found in the C. cupreum cDNA. The vegetative mycelium is profusely branched, septate and multicellular; the mycelial cells are multinucleate. The species is distinguished from other Chaetomium species by a high frequency of boat-shaped ascospores and copper coloured terminal hairs. The fruiting bodies occur {{on the surface of the}} substratum and are attached by undifferentiated rhizoids. The perithecia of C. cupreum are ovate in shape and copper colored with dimensions of 110-120 x 120-130 μm. The presence of long, thin hairs on the outer surface of the perithecium is a characteristic feature of Chaetomium (Gr. χαίτη = long hair). In C. cupreum, these hairs are numerous, thin, septate lateral hairs with a base 3.0-3.5 μm in diameter. Hairs at the apex of the perithecium are rigid, septate, 4.5-6.0 μm in diameter with 1-2 spirals. The apical hairs are covered with small copper coloured granules whose pigment is soluble in alcohol, ether, cellosolve, <b>xylol</b> but insoluble in water. Club-shaped asci measuring 38 × 13 μm develop in clusters n the interior, basal part of the perithecium. Each ascus contains 8 reddish ascospores that are boat shaped with dimensions of 10.0 × 5.5μm. The walls of the asci are mucilaginous and disintegrate, causing the ascospores to remain inside the perithecium at maturity, embedded in mucilaginous jelly. The ascospores and the mucilaginous matrix form a paste that is extruded through the apical opening in the the perithecium producing [...] "cirrhi" [...] resembling toothpaste squeezed out from a toothpaste tube. Chaetomium cupreum is intermediate between the species: C. trilaterale Chivers and C. aureum Chivers. C. aureum and C. cupreum both produce conspicuous cirrhi while C. trilaterale does not. The ascospores of C. cupreum are similar shape but larger than C. aureum. The pigment produced by C. trilaterale in agar cultures is water soluble while the granules produced on C. cupreum are insoluble.|$|E

40|$|The skin irritant, <b>xylol,</b> {{when applied}} to the ears of {{sensitized}} and reinjected rabbits often causes a severe inflammation {{with the formation of}} crusts and destruction of tissue. Dry gangrene of the entire ear tip may result (Figs. 1, 2, and 3). The same agent, applied in the same dosage and in the same way, to the ears of (1) normal rabbits, (2) normal rabbits injected once with horse serum (serum controls), or (3) sensitized but not reinjected rabbits, causes only a mild inflammation with more or less edema. The inflammation and edema disappear in 2 or 3 days, leaving a practically normal ear. The ear lesions of the sensitized reinjected rabbits which develop after the application of <b>xylol</b> are interpreted as a primary anaphylactic reaction. This primary anaphylactic reaction is considered the result of a local autoinoculation of the ear tissues with circulating antigen. The local autoinoculation is brought about by the irritant action of the <b>xylol</b> which causes an inflammation and edema of the site of application. An anaphylactic reaction may now occur because the inflamed tissues are more active metabolically than normal tissues and therefore the inflamed cells are affected by more antigen per unit of time than the normal cells. A subliminal concentration of antigen for non-inflamed, sensitized cells may thus become effective when inflamed sensitized cells are concerned. This process may theoretically occur in any tissue of a sensitized animal which can show an anaphylactic reaction, for example the intestines, lungs, heart, skin, nerves, arteries, etc. It is possible that this interplay of conditions may explain a number of functional abnormalities in the human subject...|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} the prevalence {{and intensity of}} helminths and their zo-onotic importance in small rodents inhabiting in the suburban areas of Hamadan City, Iran. Methods: The present survey {{was conducted on the}} helminth infections of two spe-cies of rodents Apodemus sylvaticus (n= 60) and Mus musculus(n= 72) in the suburban areas of Hamadan City during 2010 - 2012. Rodents were collected and examined for hel-minth in the different organs. The nematodes were collected in 5 % formalin solution and cleared in lactophenol, cestodes and trematodes collected from intestine fixed in AFA solution and stained by acetocarmine, cleared in <b>xylol</b> for identification. Results: Helminths found in A. sylvaticus and M. musculus and their prevalence {{for the first time in}} suburban areas of Hamadan City were as follows; In A. sylvaticus: Cysticercus fasciolaris(3. 33 %), Syphacia fredrici(26. 67 %), S. stroma(8. 33 %), Anoplocephalidae sp. (1. 67 %), Skrjabinotaenia lobata(5 %), Plagiorchis muris(1. 67 %) and in M. musculus: Hymenolepis nan...|$|E
