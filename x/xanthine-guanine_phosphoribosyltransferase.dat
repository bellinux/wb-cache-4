40|$|We have {{developed}} a system to study mutations that affect <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> gene (gpt) expression in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient CHO cells that have been transformed by the plasmid vector pSV 2 gpt. One isolated transformant, designated AS 52, carries a single copy of the Escherichia coli gpt gene stably integrated into the high-molecular-weight DNA and expresses the bacterial gene for the enzyme <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase.</b> Mutants deficient in this enzyme can be induced in the AS 52 cell line {{by a variety of}} mutagens, and spontaneous or induced mutants can be selected for resistance to 6 -thioguanine (Tgr). Two Tgr clones derived from the AS 52 line were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization and were found to contain deletions involving at least a portion of the gpt gene. Because of the small size and stability of the integrated pSV 2 gpt plasmid, and the well-defined selection protocol for mutant isolation, the AS 52 line offers promise as a system suitable for the study of mutation at the molecular level in CHO cells...|$|E

We showed that adenovirus type 5 infection of HIT T- 15 cells, a transformed hamster beta cell line, represses insulin {{gene transcription}} and mRNA levels. Using expression plasmids transiently introduced into HIT T- 15 cells, we showed that adenovirus type 5 E 1 a transcription regulatory proteins repress insulin enhancer-promoter element activity as assayed with a surrogate <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> gene. We relate E 1 a repression of the insulin gene to other examples of repression of enhancer-dependent genes by E 1 a and discuss the possible relationship of this repression to insulin gene regulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> (GPT) gene was {{fused to}} a metal-responsive promoter and transfected into a murine cell line. Clonal transformants harboring metal-responsive or nonresponsive GPT genes (using a thymidine kinase promoter) were then studied {{for the loss}} of transfected gene function either during periods of constitutive expression or during periods of induced activity. Nontoxic levels of cadmium and zinc markedly reduced the frequency of mutagenesis in all transfected lines irrespective of transcriptional status. A survey of 17 GPT-clones derived from two original transfectants showed partial or complete excisions of the transfected gene in every case. These studies show that quantities of cadmium and zinc that induce metallothioneins also suppress the incidence of deletions in murine cells...|$|E
40|$|A new {{oxytetracycline}} (OTC) resistance (Otcr) determinant, Tet 34, was cloned from chromosomal DNA of Vibrio sp. no. 6 {{isolated from}} intestinal contents of cultured yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata). The transformant, containing cloned Tet 34, could grow in broth containing 25 μg of drug per ml with 10 mM MgCl 2. Tet 34 encoded an {{open reading frame}} (ORF) 154 amino acids long. The amino acid sequence of the ORF was homologous to sequences of several bacterial <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferases</b> (XPRTs), which act in purine nucleotide salvage synthesis. Mg 2 + binding site residues and the active site were highly conserved in XPRT and the ORF of Tet 34. The results suggest that Tet 34 encodes a new Mg 2 +-dependent Otcr mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms of}} ethyl methanesulfonate-induced reversion in mammalian cells were studied by using {{as a target}} a gpt gene that was integrated chromosomally {{as part of a}} shuttle vector. Murine cells containing mutant gpt genes with single base changes were mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate, and revertant colonies were isolated. Ethyl methanesulfonate failed to increase the frequency of revertants for cell lines with mutant gpt genes carrying GC [...] AT transitions or AT [...] TA transversions, whereas it increased the frequency 50 -fold to greater than 800 -fold for cell lines with mutant gpt genes carrying AT [...] GC transitions and for one cell line with a GC [...] CG transversion. The gpt genes of 15 independent revertants derived from the ethyl methanesulfonate-revertible cell lines were recovered and sequenced. All revertants derived from cell lines with AT [...] GC transitions had mutated back to the wild-type gpt sequence via GC [...] AT transitions at their original sites of mutation. Five of six revertants derived from the cell line carrying a gpt gene with a GC [...] CG transversion had mutated via GC [...] AT transition {{at the site of the}} original mutation or at the adjacent base in the same triplet; these changes generated non-wild-type DNA sequences that code for non-wild-type amino acids that are apparently compatible with <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> activity. The sixth revertant had mutated via CG [...] GC transversion back to the wild-type sequence. The results of this study define certain amino acid substitutions in the <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> polypeptide that are compatible with enzyme activity. These results also establish mutagen-induced reversion analysis as a sensitive and specific assay for mutagenesis in mammalian cells...|$|E

The two phosphoribosyltransferases and uridine phosphorylase were not significantly associated with purified membrane fractions as was purine nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2. 4. 2. 1). The effects of the poorly permeable enzyme-inactivating reagents, 4 -diazoniumbenzenesulphonate, 7 -diazonium- 1, 3 -naphthalene-disulphonate and 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzenesulphonate, on Escherichia coli indicate that all the above-mentioned enzymes and also the <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> [Miller, Ramsey, Krenitsky & Elion (1972) Biochemistry 11, 4723 [...] 4731] are located intracellularly...|$|E

Cells transformed with PSV 2 -gpt and pJ-gpt express the E. coli gpt gene to approximately the same extent, judged by determinations of the XGPRT activity of cell extracts. Blot hybridisation experiments with restriction endonuclease-cleaved DNA from the transformants have revealed the presence of vector DNA sequences in the cells, {{at least some of}} which are most probably integrated into high mol. wt. chromosomal DNA.

The transformed cells synthesize the bacterial enzyme 5 -phospho-alpha-D-ribose- 1 -diphosphate:xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (XGPRT; EC 2. 4. 2. 22) and have been maintained in selective medium for over 4 months. Lymphoid cell lines expressing a K immunoglobulin light chain were obtained by transfecting cells with pSV 2 -gpt containing a rearranged K light chain genomic segment from the S 107 myeloma cell line. The S 107 light chain is synthesized in gpt-transformed J 558 L myeloma cells and {{is identical to the}} light chain synthesized by the S 107 myeloma cell line, as judged by immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, this light chain is synthesized and secreted as part of an intact antibody molecule by transformed hybridoma cells that normally secrete an IgGl (gamma, K) antibody molecule.

40|$|Escherichia coli (Ec) cells possess two purine salvage enzymes: <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> (XGPRT) and {{hypoxanthine}} phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). EcXGPRT {{shares a}} common structural feature {{with other members}} of this family, a flexible loop that closes over the active site during catalysis. The replacement of six of these amino acids by alanine has no effect on the Km for the two substrates. However, the Ki for the nucleoside monophosphate increases by 27 -fold, and the kcat is reduced by ∼ 200 -fold. Nucleoside phosphonates (NP) are good inhibitors of EcXGPRT and EcHPRT, with Ki values as low as 10 nM. In the absence of the flexible loop, these values increase by 5 - to 30 -fold, indicating the importance of the loop for high-affinity inhibition. Crystal structures of two NPs in complex with EcXGPRT explain the tight binding. Prodrugs of NPs with low Ki values for EcXGPRT or EcHPRT exhibit IC 50 values between 5 and 23 μM against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in cell-based assays, suggesting that these compounds are therapeutic leads against pathogenic bacteria. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Mycophenolic acid, an {{inhibitor}} of purine metabolism, {{was shown}} to block the replication of vaccinia virus in normal cell lines. This observation {{led to the development}} of a dominant one-step plaque selection system, based on expression of the Escherichia coli gpt gene, for the isolation of recombinant vaccinia viruses. Synthesis of <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> enabled only the recombinant viruses to form large plaques in a selective medium containing mycophenolic acid, xanthine, and hypoxanthine. To utilize the selection system efficiently, we constructed a series of plasmids that contain the E. coli gpt gene and allow insertion of foreign genes into multiple unique restriction endonuclease sites in all three reading frames between the translation initiation codon of a strong late promoter and synthetic translation termination sequences. The selection-expression cassette is flanked by vaccinia virus DNA that directs homologous recombination into the virus genome. The new vectors allow high-level expression of complete or partial open reading frames and rapid construction of recombinant viruses by facilitating the cloning steps and by simplifying their isolation. The system was tested by cloning the E. coli beta-galactosidase gene; in 24 h, this enzyme accounted for approximately 3. 5 % of the total infected-cell protein...|$|E

An average of 20 colonies of transformed cells was obtained, using the calcium phosphate technique, 10 microg DNA vector, no carrier DNA and 1 x 10 (6) recipient cells. Five independent Eco. gpt-transformed PCC 4 cell lines were propagated in selective medium and assayed for XGPRT activity. All of them had the ability to convert [14 C]xanthine to xanthine monophosphate. pSV 2 gpt sequences were present and associated with high mol. wt. cellular DNA. pSV 2 gpt sequences and XGPRT activity were both conserved in the three clones that were propagated in non-selective medium for 30 generations. The transformed PCC 4 cells retained their ability to produce, in host mice, teratocarcinoma tumors composed of embryonal carcinoma and various differentiated tissues. Thus, pSV 2 gpt can be used as a dominant marker to select teratocarcinoma stem cells co-transformed with genes that are not selectable by themselves...|$|E

All gpt-transformed cell lines were found to contain one or more insertions of pSV 2 sequences exclusively associated with high-molecular-weight DNA. Additional analyses showed {{that at least one}} integrated copy in each cell line retained an intact gpt gene and flanking SV 40 sequences required for expression of <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase.</b> Most cell lines contained pSV 2 sequences which had integrated with partial sequence duplication. Upon fusion with COS- 1 cells, a simian cell line permissive for autonomous pSV 2 replication, most gpt-transformed cell lines produced low-molecular-weight DNA molecules related to pSV 2. The majority of these replicating DNAs were indistinguishable from the original transfecting plasmid in both size and restriction enzyme cleavage pattern. In addition, the recovered DNA molecules were able to confer ampicillin resistance to E. coli and to transform mouse L cells and Gpt- E. coli to a Gpt+ phenotype.

Nine transformed PCC 3 stem cell lines, each of which was clonally derived from respective colonies surviving after the selection process, were isolated. Southern blot analysis revealed {{that all of them}} stably maintained delta-crystallin sequences associated with high mol. wt. cellular DNA after propagation in non-selective medium in vitro, and after the production of solid tumors in the syngenic host mice. Six cell lines contain the intact delta-crystallin gene sequence and eight contain the gpt sequence. The number of delta-crystallin DNA copies was highly variable among transformed lines, 1 - 500 delta-crystallin genes per diploid mouse genome. No expression of the exogenous genes was detected in the transformed cells {{as long as they were}} in the undifferentiated state. However, the synthesis of delta-crystallin in certain types of cells was detected immunohistologically in three lines after the differentiation. The positive cell types were unique to each line, skeletal muscle in Y delta- 9, certain columnar epithelia in Y delta- 2, and unidentified spindle-shaped cells in Y delta- 3.

40|$|Background: <b>Xanthine–guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> (XGPRTase) is {{an enzyme}} of purine {{nucleotide}} salvage synthesis. The gpt gene of Helicobacter pylori has been annotated as encoding an XGPRTase and proposed as essential for {{survival of the}} bacterium in vitro. The aims of this work were to investigate the structure of H. pylori XGPRTase and to compare the key features of the enzyme to other phosphoribosyltransferases employing computational, modelling, and bioinformatic tools. Materials and Methods: XGPRTase activity was measured in the cytosolic fraction of H. pylori by 31 P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and also in recombinant XGPRTase produced by a cell-free expression system. Bioinformatics was employed to analyze the phylogeny of XGPRTase, and a structural model of the XGPRTase was built using threading techniques. The observed interactions of purine phosphoribosyltransferases with immucillin-GP were used to study the theoretical interactions of H. pylori XGPRTase with this transition-state analog. Results: It was demonstrated that the gpt gene of H. pylori encodes a functional XGPRTase enzyme. Analyses of the XGPRTase sequence showed that the enzyme is significantly divergent from equivalent mammalian enzymes. Modelling served to identify specific features of the enzyme and key residues involved in catalysis. Conclusions: The H. pylori XGPRTase is structurally similar to other phosphoribosyltransferase enzymes, but {{there were significant differences}} between the hood domain of H. pylori XGPRTase and other purine salvage phosphoribosyltransferases. Significant {{differences were found between the}} interactions of the H. pylori and human enzymes with a purine phosphoribosyltransferase inhibitor...|$|E
40|$|Cultured monkey (TC 7) {{and mouse}} (3 T 6) cells {{synthesize}} an Excherichia coli enzyme, <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> (XGPRT; 5 -phospho-alpha-D-ribose- 1 -diphosphate:xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, EC 2. 4. 2. 22), after transfection with DNA vectors carrying the corresponding bacterial gene, Ecogpt. In contrast to mammalian cells, {{which do not}} efficiently use xanthine for purine nucleotide synthesis, cells that produce E. coli XGPRT can synthesize GMP from xanthine via XMP. After transfection with vector-Ecogpt DNAs, surviving cells producing XGPRT can be selectively grown with xanthine as the sole precursor for guanine nucleotide formation in a medium containing inhibitors (aminopterin and mycophenolic acid) that block de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. Cells transformed for Ecogpt arise with a frequency of 10 (- 4) to 10 (- 5); {{they appear to be}} genetically stable in as much as there is no discernible decrease in XGPRT formation or loss on their ability to grow in selective medium after propagation in nonselective medium. Although several of the vector-gpt DNAs can replicate in monkey and mouse cells, none of the transformants contain autonomously replicating vector-gpt DNA. Rather, the gpt transformants contain one to five copies of the transfecting DNA associated with, and most probably integrated into, cellular DNA sequences. In several transformants, vector-coded gene products for which there was no selection are also synthesized. This suggests that recombinant DNAs containing Ecogpt as a selective marker can be useful for cotransformation of nonselectable genes...|$|E

Transfection of Escherichia coli bacteria by several plasmids indicates that the transfection efficiency was much higher for the closed circular/supercoiled (sc-) and circular/relaxed (cr-) DNA than for the linearized (In-) DNA (Xie, T. D., L. Sun, H. G. Zhao, J. A. Fuchs, and T. Y. Tsong. 1992. Biophys. J. 63 : 1026 – 1031). To resolve these conflicting observations, we have systematically examined electrotransfection of NIH 3 T 3 mouse fibroblast by the plasmids, pRSVcat, pRSVneo, and pRSVgpt. Mg(2 +) -facilitated surface binding of DNA before, and DNA uptake by 3 T 3 cells after treatment with PEF, were monitored by 3 H-labeled plasmids. Transfection efficiency was evaluated by both the transient expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) activity 2 – 3 days after, and the permanent expression of neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) and <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> (gpt) genes in the transformants 2 weeks after the PEF treatment. Our results indicate that cell surface binding and PEF-induced cell uptake of DNA did not depend on the topology of DNA.

40|$|Infection of cultured {{mammalian}} {{cells with}} the Leporipoxvirus Shope fibroma virus (SFV) causes the induction {{of a novel}} uracil DNA glycosylase activity in the cytoplasms of the infected cells. The induction of this activity, early in infection, correlates with the early expression of the SFV BamHI D 6 R open reading frame which possesses significant protein sequence similarity to eukaryotic and prokaryotic uracil DNA glycosylases. The SFV BamHI D 6 R open reading frame and the homologous HindIII D 4 R open reading frame from the Orthopoxvirus vaccinia virus were cloned under the regulation of a phage T 7 promoter and expressed in Escherichia coli as insoluble high-molecular-weight aggregates. During electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, the E. coli-expressed proteins migrate with an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa. The insoluble protein aggregate generated by expression in E. coli was solubilized in urea and, following a subsequent refolding step, displayed the ability to excise uracil residues from double-stranded plasmid DNA substrates, with the subsequent formation of apyrimidinic sites. The viral enzyme, like all other characterized uracil DNA glycosylases, is active {{in the presence of}} high concentrations of EDTA, is substrate inhibited by uracil, and does not display any endonuclease activity. Attempts to inactivate the HindIII D 4 R gene of vaccinia virus by targeted insertion of a dominant <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> selection marker or direct insertion of a frame-shifted oligonucleotide were uniformly unsuccessful demonstrating that, unlike the uracil DNA glycosylase described for herpesviruses, the poxvirus enzyme is essential for virus viability...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian {{cells in}} culture {{have been used}} to study the genetic effects of {{physical}} and chemical agents. We have used Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, clone K 1 -BH 4, to quantify mutations at the X-linked, large (35 kb) hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) locus (the CHO/HPRT assay) induced by environmental agents. By transfecting an hprt-deletion mutant CHO cell line with the plasmid vector pSV 2 gpt, we isolated a transformant, AS 52. AS 52 cells carry a single functional copy of an autosomal, small (456 bp) <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> (gpt) gene (the bacterial equivalent of the mammalian hprt gene; AS 52 /GPT assay). We found that ionizing radiations such as X-rays and neutrons and oxidative genotoxic chemicals such as Adriamycin, bleomycin, hydrogen peroxide, and potassium superoxide are much more mutagenic to the gpt gene in AS 52 cells than to the hprt locus in K 1 -BH 4 cells. The hypermutability of the gpt gene probably results from a higher recovery of multilocus deletion mutants in AS 52 cells than in K 1 -BH 4 cells, rather than a higher yield of induced mutants. These results demonstrate that the use of the hprt locus alone could lead to an underestimate of the genetic risk of these agents. Analyses of the mutation spectrum using a polymerase chain reaction-based deletion screening and DNA sequencing procedure showed that a high proportion of HPRT- and GPT- mutants induced by X-rays carry deletion mutations. Thus, both the mutant frequency and mutation spectrum need to be considered in assessing the genetic risk of ionizing radiation and oxidative genotoxic chemicals...|$|E

To understand the molecular {{mechanism of the}} uPA gene regulation by cAMP, we developed a system which allows us to obtain mutant cells with modified regulatory proteins. A uPA-gpt hybrid gene was constructed, in which the regulatory region of the uPA gene was linked to a bacterial <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> gene (gpt), and it was transfected into LLC-PK 1 cells. A stably transformed cell line, which expressed gpt only {{in the presence of}} calcitonin, was obtained, and then these cells were treated with a chemical mutagen, ethyl methanesulfonate. Cells were screened for constitutive gpt expression and, as mutations in regulatory proteins should affect the two genes at the same time, cells were further screened for an increased basal uPA mRNA level. Several such clones were obtained and none of them had modified cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, suggesting that mutations were in the post-protein kinase step in the pathway of hormone action. Five clones were fused with the parent LLC-PK 1 cells, and all of the fusion cells showed reduced basal uPA mRNA levels, indicating that they were recessive mutants. One clone was analyzed further for sensitivity to calcitonin in the induction of uPA mRNA, and it showed a significantly different dose-response pattern compared with parent cells. These results suggest that the uPA gene is regulated, at least partly, by a negatively regulating factor and that the action of cAMP is linked to this factor...|$|E

This paper describes {{the structure of}} the messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNA's) formed during the expression of gpt and an unexpected feature of the nucleotide sequence in the gpt DNA segment. Analyses of the gpt-specific mRNA's produced during infection of CV 1 cells indicate that in addition to the mRNA's expected on the basis of known simian virus 40 RNA splicing patterns, there is a novel SV 40 -gpt hybrid mRNA. The novel mRNA contains an SV 40 leader segment spliced to RNA sequences transcribed from the bacterial DNA segment. The sequence of the 5 '-proximal 345 nucleotides of the gpt DNA segment indicates that the only open translation phase begins with an AUG about 200 nucleotides {{from the end of the}} gpt DNA. Two additional AUGs as well as translation terminator codons in all three phases precede the XGPRT initiator codon. Deletion of the two that are upstream of the putative start codon increases the level of XGPRT production in transfected cells; deletion of sequences that contain the proposed XGPRT initiator AUG abolishes enzyme production. Based on the location of the XGPRT coding sequence in the recombinants and {{the structure of the}} mRNA's, we infer that the bacterial enzyme can be translated from an initiator AUG that is 400 to 800 nucleotides from the 5 ' terminus of the mRNA and preceded by two to six AUG triplets...|$|E

To characterize the T. brucei HGPRT enzyme in detail, the T. brucei hgprt was isolated within a 4. 2 kb SalI-KpnI genomic insert and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 630 bp that encoded a protein of 210 amino acids with a M(r) = 23. 4 kd. After gap alignment, the T. brucei HGPRT exhibited 21 - 23 % amino acid sequence identity, mostly in three clustered regions, with the HGPRTs from human, S. mansoni, and P falciparum, indicating that the trypanosome enzyme was the most divergent of the group. Surprisingly, the T. brucei HGPRT was more homologous to the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) from the prokaryote V. harveyi than to the eukaryotic HGPRTs. Northern blot analysis revealed two trypanosome transcripts of 1. 4 and 1. 9 kb, each expressed to equivalent degrees in insect vector and mammalian forms of the parasite. The T. brucei hgprt was inserted into an expression plasmid and transformed into S phi 606 E. coli that are deficient in both HPRT and <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> activities. Soluble, enzymatically active recombinant T. brucei HGPRT was expressed to high levels and purified to homogeneity by GTP-agarose affinity chromatography. The purified recombinant enzyme recognized hypoxanthine, guanine, and allopurinol, but not xanthine or adenine, as substrates and was inhibited by a variety of nucleotide effectors.

The structures of XGPRT complexed with the purine base substrates guanine or xanthine in combination with cPRib-PP, an analog of the second substrate PRib-PP, have been solved to 2. 0 Å resolution. In these two structures the disordered phosphate-binding loop of uncomplexed XGPRT becomes ordered through interactions with the 5 ′-phosphate group of cPRib-PP. The cyclopentane ring of cPRib-PP has the C 3 exo pucker conformation, stabilised by the cPRib-PP-bound Mg 2 +. The purine base specificity of XGPRT appears to be due to water-mediated interactions between the 2 -exocyclic groups of guanine or xanthine and side-chains of Glu 136 and Asp 140, as well as the main-chain oxygen atom of Ile 135. Asp 92, together with Lys 115, could help stabilise the N 7 -protonated tautomer of the incoming base and could act as a general base to remove the proton from N 7 when the nucleotide product is formed. The 2. 6 Å resolution structure of XGPRT complexed with product GMP is similar to the substrate-bound complexes. However, the ribose ring of GMP is rotated by ∼ 24 ° compared with the equivalent ring in cPRib-PP.

Expression of a nonselectable gene (cat, coding for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase [CAT]) linked to a selectable gene (gpt, coding for <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> [XPRT]) in the plasmid pSV 2 catSVgpt was quantified after transfection of SV 40 -transformed xeroderma pigmentosum [XP 20 s(SV 40) ] and normal human [GM 0637 (SV 40) ] fibroblast cell lines. A novel autoradiographic assay with [3 H]xanthine incorporation showed 0. 5 to 0. 7 % phenotypic expression of XPRT in both cell lines. Without selection, transient CAT activity was 20 times greater in the GM 0637 (SV 40) than in the XP 20 s(SV 40) cells, and transient XPRT activity was 5 times greater. Both of these transient activities were increased and equalized in both cell lines by transfection with pRSVcat or pRSVgpt. Genotypic transformation to gpt+ occurred at a frequency of 2 X 10 (- 4) to 4 X 10 (- 4) in both cell lines with pSV 2 catSVgpt. After 2 to 3 months in selective medium, stable expression of the (nonselected) cat gene was found in 11 (92 %) of 12 gpt-containing clones derived from GM 0637 (SV 40) cells and in 13 (81 %) of 16 gpt-containing clones from XP 20 s(SV 40) cells.

The increasing development of antibiotic resistance by the bacterium continues to limit treatment options. The identification and characterisation of novel therapeutic targets are necessary for successful future treatment of the infection. One potential target for therapeutic intervention is the gpt gene encoded by hp 0735 (jhp 0672) in H. pylori strain 26695 (J 99). This gene produces a putative <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> (XGPRTase), an enzyme of the purine salvage synthesis pathway. This project employed theoretical, molecular and biochemical approaches to investigate features of H. pylori gpt and XGPRTase that will serve to ascertain their therapeutic potential. The production of a functional XGPRTase by H. pylori was investigated in cell-free extracts, and the kinetic parameters of this activity were compared to those of purified rXGPRTase enzyme. The three 6 -oxopurine substrates were recognised by rXGPRTase and allosteric kinetics were observed for some substrates of the enzyme in cell-free extracts and for purified enzyme. These observations indicate complex regulation and an influence of cellular interactions on activity. Bioinformatics were employed to analyse XGPRTase phylogeny, and threading techniques used to build a structural model of XGPRTase. The enzyme is significantly divergent from the equivalent mammalian enzyme, and modelling identified specific features of the enzyme. Molecular approaches were utilised to analyse the essential role of gpt in H. pylori survival. These included insertional inactivation of the gpt in wild-type H. pylori strains and in mutants possessing a complementing copy of the gene present at the rdxA locus. No mutants were recovered with inactivated gpt possibly as a result of pleiotropic effects. Plasmid-mediated complementation was attempted employing IPTG-inducible shuttle vectors and did not yield any mutants. Further characterisation of H. pylori XGPRTase was performed by determining the effects of nucleotide monophosphates and purine analogues on enzyme activity. Inhibition by GMP was observed in all cases, however differences in the inhibition by other nucleotide monophosphates were found between cell-free extracts and the recombinant enzyme. Inhibition of rXGPRTase activity was observed by the purine analogue 6 -mercaptopurine ribose, a compound that previously has been shown to inhibit H. pylori growth in culture...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} expression-plasmid vectors {{for use in the}} mouse, myeloma cell-line, J 558 L. Following introduction of the plasmids into J 558 L using spheroplast fusion, the vectors allow selection for stably-transfected cells. Selective survival depends on expression from a gpt gene in the plasmid, which encodes the enzyme, <b>xanthine-guanine</b> <b>phosphoribosyltransferase</b> (XGPRT). Expression of XGPRT confers, on J 558 L, a dominant selectable-resistance to mycophenolic acid in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine. The resultant stable gpt+-transfectants can then be screened for expression of a protein encoded by a non-selected gene in the expression plasmid. Initially, a systematic study was carried out to compare the effect on XGPRT expression of different expression elements placed upstream of the gpt coding sequence, in single-gene plasmids. Comparative expression levels were estimated by comparing the stable gpt+-transfection frequencies of J 558 L obtained with each plasmid. This study demonstrated the importance of the IgH-gene enhancer for obtaining high-level expression from a transfected gene. A combination of an IgH enhancer and a promoter element, upstream of the gpt coding-sequence, resulted in the highest levels of expression, but the type of promoter used was of only secondary importance. Identified combinations of effective upstream elements were then incorporated into plasmid vectors, which were constructed for expression from heterologous genes encoding proteins of interest. Stable gpt+- transfectants containing a non-selected gene were only obtained following transfection with plasmids which also contained the gpt gene. This was in contrast to situations in which a non-selected gene was cotransfected with a gpt gene which resided on a different plasmid; here, none of the stable gpt+-transfectants screened had cointegrated the non-selected gene with the gpt gene. Different classes of the two-gene expression plasmids were constructed, which differed in the relative orientation and position of the transcription units. The efficiency of the various plasmids was estimated by measuring the expression levels from a model cDNA, encoding chicken lysozyme. Transfectants were isolated which express and secrete biologically-active chicken lysozyme, at levels greater, in molar terms, than the typical level of secretion of endogenous Ig from myeloma cells. In some cases, the stable gpt+-transfection frequencies obtained with two-gene plasmids were low, compared with the transfection frequencies obtained with plasmids containing only the gpt gene. It was proposed that this was due to transcriptional interference between the two genes on the same plasmid. As this phenomenon might also restrict the expression from the non-selected gene, overcoming this effect was considered important in optimising expression. However, attempts to identify and overcome the phenomenon were inconclusive and, consequently, a rational strategy for overcoming this potential limitation on expression levels was not obtained...|$|E
