Methods: Volunteers (n = 32) in their twenties without nasal disease such as septal deviation or rhinitis were enrolled in the study. The more patent nostril in each subject was measured by acoustic rhinometry as the base value. After intranasal spray of <b>xylometazoline,</b> the same nostril was remeasured by same method. Twenty four hours later, intranasal packing of epinephrine gauze was done and the same treatment was done. Subject preferences about the procedures were asked.

40|$|Background: Rhinorrhea and nasal {{congestion}} are simultaneous symptoms {{associated with the}} common cold. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of a combination nasal spray of ipratropium and <b>xylometazoline</b> for simultaneous treatment of these symptoms. Methods: The trial was a multicenter double-blind, parallel-group, randomized design on patients with common cold symptoms. Patients scored symptoms of runny nose and {{nasal congestion}} and recorded adverse events in a diary for up to 7 days. Patients also recorded tissue use. The five test treatments consisted of ipratropium, 0. 6 mg/mL, and <b>xylometazoline,</b> 1. 0 mg/mL; ipratropium, 0. 6 mg/mL, and <b>xylometazoline,</b> 0. 5 mg/mL; ipratropium, 0. 6 mg/mL; <b>xylometazoline,</b> 1. 0 mg/mL; and placebo solution. Results: Eight hundred sixty-four patients were screened and 786 patients received treatment. One day after treatment {{there was a clear}} separation between the scores for the placebo and ipratropium treatment groups for rhinorrhea and between the placebo and <b>xylometazoline</b> treatment groups for congestion. Both ipratropium/xylometazoline 1. 0 and ipratropium/xylometazoline 0. 5 treatments were superior to <b>xylometazoline</b> with respect to rhinorrhea (p < 0. 0001) and superior to ipratropium with respect to nasal congestion scores (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Common cold {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} conditions that family doctors encounter. One of the first symptoms to occur is nasal congestion, which can have a negative impact on daily life and prompts many patients to seek treatment for relief. <b>Xylometazoline</b> nasal spray (Otrivin*) is a topical decongestant that has been used successfully for many years and is generally recognized as an effective and safe therapy. However, most studies have investigated its clinical efficacy in healthy patients and few have included patients with common cold. *Otrivin® is a registered trademark of Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland. Scope: To review the published clinical efficacy and safety of <b>xylometazoline</b> alone and in combination in the management of nasal congestion in patients with common cold. Literature searches of PubMed and the Cochrane Library were conducted to obtain published open or blinded, randomized, placebo- or active-controlled studies on the use of <b>xylometazoline</b> hydrochloride for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion in patients with common cold. Searches included papers published in English only, up to September 2009.

40|$|Introduction. The main {{place of}} {{pathogens}} accumulation and growth in childhood is the lymphoid tissue of the nasopharynx. Often, {{the development of}} rhinosinusitis begins with the adenoiditis. The most vulnerable in this situation are the children of preschool age with hyperplasia of the pharyngeal lymphoid ring. In this group, recurrent diseases of the upper respiratory tract are observed. Objective: optimization of the program for therapy of acute rhinosinusitis in children with pharyngeal lymphoid ring hyperplasia. Materials and methods. We observed 100 patients aged 2 to 6 years randomly divided into 2 groups of 50 children each. Regimen of 0. 05 % <b>xylometazoline</b> solution application: one injection into each nostril twice a day. Sodium chloride 0. 9 % {{was used in the}} form of nasal irrigation in the first group of children twice a day before <b>xylometazoline</b> administration. Clinical method consisted of the evaluation of anamnesis, clinical pattern, general clinical research methods. We took a smear for cytomorphological analysis of the nasal mucosa; performed staining with Giemsa’s diluted solution followed by microscopy, quantitative determination of the secretory IgA (sIgA) in saliva by enzyme immunoassay. The results were processed by the Mann-Whitney test, Fisher’s exact test. Results. Application of 0. 05 % <b>xylometazoline</b> in combination with a nasal irrigation by NaCl 0. 9 % has a statistically significant regenerating and sanation effect on the nasal mucosa. Use in <b>xylometazoline</b> with nasal irrigation by sodium chloride 0. 9 %, in contrast to <b>xylometazoline</b> administration without preparation of the nasal cavity, is not associated with a reduction of sIgA level in saliva, but leads to some increase of it. Conclusion. The use of 0. 05 % <b>xylometazoline</b> solution with nasal irrigation by sodium chloride 0. 9 % in the therapeutic regimen for acute rhinosinusitis in children with hyperplasia of the pharyngeal lymphoid ring has significant advantages over the <b>xylometazoline</b> administration without preparation of the nasal cavity...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The nasal decongestants {{oxymetazoline}} and <b>xylometazoline</b> {{are frequently}} {{used in the}} topical treatment of rhinitis and sinusitis. As nitric oxide (NO) is thought {{to play a role}} in inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, the aim of this study was to examine the in vitro effects of these compounds on the activity and the expression of NO producing enzymes, including the inducible form of NO synthase (iNOS) and the constitutive isoform of NO synthase (cNOS). Experiments concerning the effects of both compounds on enzymatic activity and enzyme induction of iNOS were performed in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced rat alveolar macrophage cell line (NR 8383) using the Griess assay and the 3 H-citrulline assay respectively. The effects on cNOS were examined in fresh rat synaptosomes using the 3 H-citrulline assay. The direct scavenging properties of both compounds were investigated using a amperometric NO sensor.

Critical parameters of the nasal airway can be quantified objectively with acoustic rhinometry (AR) and peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF). ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate nasal airway patency in asthmatics compared to non-asthmatic controls. Nasal volume, cross sectional area and flow were measured using acoustic rhinometry (AR) and peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) in 87 asthmatics and 93 non-asthmatic controls before and after decongestion with <b>xylometazoline.</b> Nasal congestion index (NCI) was calculated, and allergy status was assessed by skin prick test or specific IgE.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{reports have}} shown that, {{although}} rare, findings of mucosal ulcers and perforations {{of the nasal}} septum in some cases {{may be associated with}} the use of topical nasal glucocorticosteroids (GCS). It can been speculated that, a reduction in septal mucosal blood flow causing ischemia may eventually induce septal perforations. AIM: To evaluate whether a single dose of a potent nasal GCS given in a clinically recommended dose may acutely reduce the mucosal blood flow on the nasal septum. METHODS: Six healthy subjects received in a randomised double blind placebo controlled crossover procedure one dose of 64 micrograms budesonide aqueous nasal spray (Rhinocort aqua, AstraZeneca R&D, Lund, Sweden) and placebo. One dose was delivered into each nasal cavity by means of a pump spray. As a positive control 140 micrograms of <b>xylometazoline</b> (Nezeril, AstraZeneca R&D, Lund, Sweden) was sprayed in the same way, but in an open fashion. A wash-out period of at least 3 days followed each session. Blood flow was measured on the nasal septum with Laser Doppler flowmetry up to 20 min after administration. RESULTS: Budesonide did not affect the nasal septal mucosal blood flow as compared to placebo, but <b>xylometazoline</b> reduced the septal mucosal blood flow by 60. 9 +/- 7. 1 % measured from baseline values.

40|$|Objectives: Rhinomanometry {{before and}} after {{decongestion}} distinguishes a nasal airway organic stenosis from congestion of nasal mucosa in patients with nasal stuffiness. Together with rhinoscopy and patient history, {{it is used to}} decide if nasal surgery would benefit the patient. Rhinomanometry measurements should thus be reliable and reproducible. Materials and methods: We performed repetitive active anterior rhinomanometry in 9 persons during 5 months to test reproducibility of nasal airway resistance (NAR) over time. We also did test-retest measurements in several participants. <b>Xylometazoline</b> hydrochloride was applied in each nasal cavity to minimize effects of mucosal variation and the nasal cavity was examined with rhinoscopy. The participants evaluated subjective nasal stuffiness on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: The long term mean coefficient of variation (CV) of NAR over time was 27 % for the whole group while the short term CV was 7 - 17 % for test-retest within an hour. Mean NAR reduction after decongestion was 33 %, but 13 % of NAR values were not reduced after decongestion. Participants had difficulties estimating stuffiness on a VAS in 15 % of the assessments, but there was no correlation between the VAS estimates and NAR. Conclusion: We found a high NAR variation over a period of five months. This implies low long-term rhinomanometry reproducibility and we suggest future research on standardised decongestion to increase the reproducibility...|$|E
40|$|Background: Previous rhinomanometry {{studies have}} shown {{significant}} long-term variability of the nasal airway resistance and questioned the clinical validity of rhinomanonnetry. Research question: Could treatment with a topical glucocorticoid, budesonide, influence the long-term variability of active anterior rhinomanometry? Methods: Eight healthy volunteers participated in an unblinded controlled trial without, and later with, nasal budesonide once a day for 5 months. Their nasal airway resistance was measured every two weeks with active anterior rhinomanometry before and after decongestion with <b>xylometazoline</b> hydrochloride. In addition, subjective nasal obstruction was evaluated on a Visual Analogue Scale before each measurement. The participants had a year earlier been investigated with rhinomanometry every two weeks during 5 months but without budesonide treatment. We compared the variability of nasal airway resistance during the two periods with and without treatment with topical budesonide. Results: Budesonide significantly reduced mean nasal airway resistance and the standard deviation of the mean after decongestion for 6 of 8 participants. The mean reduction of the nasal airway resistance was 40 % for the decongested nasal cavity compared to the period without treatment with nasal budesonide. Subjective nasal obstruction assessed by Visual Analogue Scale was reduced in 3 of the 8 participants. Conclusion: The variability of nasal airway resistance was significantly reduced by treatment with topical budesonide for 6 out of 8 healthy volunteers participating in an unblinded repeated 5 month trial where the participants served as their own controls...|$|E
