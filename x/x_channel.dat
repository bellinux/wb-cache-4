Some P 2 <b>X</b> <b>channels</b> display a time- and activation-dependent change in permeability as they undergo {{the transition from the}} relatively Na+-selective I 1 state to the I 2 state, which is also permeable to organic cations.

Total internal reflection fluorescence and fluorescence resonance en-ergy transfermicroscopy between fluorescently labeled P 2 X 2 and 42 nicotinic channels demonstrated close spatial arrangement of the channels in human embryonic kidney cells and in hippocampal neuronmembranes. The data suggest that P 2 X 2 and 42 channels may form a dimer, with the channels 80 Å apart.

40|$|The P 2 <b>X</b> 2 <b>channel</b> is a ligand-gated channel {{activated}} by ATP. Functional features {{that reflect the}} dynamic flexibility of the channel include time-dependent pore dilatation following ATP application and direct inhibitory interaction with activated nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the membrane. We have been studying the mechanisms by which P 2 <b>X</b> 2 <b>channel</b> functionality is dynamically regulated. Using a Xenopus oocyte expression system, we observed that the pore properties, including ion selectivity and rectification, depend on the open channel density on the membrane. Pore dilatation was apparent when the open channel density was high and inward rectification was modest. We also observed that P 2 <b>X</b> 2 <b>channels</b> show voltage dependence, {{despite the absence of}} a canonical voltage sensor. At a semi-steady state after ATP application, P 2 <b>X</b> 2 <b>channels</b> were activated upon membrane hyperpolarization. This voltage-dependent activation was also [ATP] dependent. With increases in [ATP], the speed of hyperpolarization-induced activation was increased and the conductance–voltage relationship was shifted towards depolarized potentials. Based on analyses of experimental data and various simulations, we propose that these phenomena can be explained by assuming a fast ATP binding step and a rate-limiting voltage-dependent gating step. Complete elucidation of these regulatory mechanisms awaits dynamic imaging of functioning P 2 <b>X</b> 2 <b>channels...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the Gaussian many-to-one <b>X</b> <b>channel,</b> {{which is}} a special case of general {{multiuser}} <b>X</b> <b>channel,</b> is studied. In the Gaussian many-to-one <b>X</b> <b>channel,</b> communication links exist between all transmitters {{and one of the}} receivers, along with a communication link between each transmitter and its corresponding receiver. As per the <b>X</b> <b>channel</b> assumption, transmission of messages is allowed on all the links of the channel. This communication model is different from the corresponding many-to-one interference channel (IC). Transmission strategies which involve using Gaussian codebooks and treating interference from a subset of transmitters as noise are formulated for the above channel. Sum-rate is used as the criterion of optimality for evaluating the strategies. Initially, a 3 × 3 many-to-one <b>X</b> <b>channel</b> is considered and three transmission strategies are analyzed. The first two strategies are shown to achieve sum-rate capacity under certain channel conditions. For the third strategy, a sum-rate outer bound is derived and the gap between the outer bound and the achieved rate is characterized. These results are later extended to the K ×K case. Next, a region in which the many-to-one <b>X</b> <b>channel</b> can be operated as a many-to-one IC without loss of sum-rate is identified. Further, in the above region, it is shown that using Gaussian codebooks and treating interference as noise achieves a rate point that is within K/ 2 − 1 bits from the sum-rate capacity. Subsequently, some implications of the above results to the Gaussian many-to-one IC are discussed. Transmission strategies for the many-to-one IC are formulated and channel conditions under which the strategies achieve sum-rate capacity are obtained. A region where the sum-rate capacity can be characterized to within K/ 2 − 1 bits is also identified. Finally, the regions where the derived channel conditions are satisfied for each strategy are illustrated for a 3 × 3 many-to-one <b>X</b> <b>channel</b> and the corresponding many-to-one IC.
