500|$|Since Dexter {{producers}} try {{to shield}} the child actors {{as much as possible}} from the show's dark subject matter, executive producer Daniel Cerone urged the mother of his son's friend not to let her son audition to play a young Dexter, who is filmed sitting in a pool of blood. Erik King found the shot of the boy crying in the blood to be the creepiest moment of the first season. He described it as [...] "very uncomfortable to watch, even when you know it's not real and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> kids are actors." [...] Cinematographer Romeo Tirone tightened the camera's shutter angle when filming these scenes to make them [...] "feel like fragments of memory - subjective, with tight close-ups against an indistinct background. You don't see all the details of the environment." [...] Series director Keith Gordon found these flashbacks [...] "incredible" [...] because he thought they were [...] "like a Stanley Kubrick movie".|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{know that}} I loved poets and in {{particular}} Swedish ones. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> gentlemen are always poor and always ask for support. You also know that their verse-craft is neither happy nor fruitful unless their purse is filled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she replied, laughing. [...] "Don't think me inquisitive, Arthur; I was {{surprised}} to find <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> girls, with whom I am myself but lightly acquainted." ...|$|R
60|$|ALEX. No, General; {{you must}} not ask that; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how <b>these</b> gipsies hate to be stared at.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's nothing. I {{always think}} the Jolly Seventeen {{are so good}} at {{original}} ideas. If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> other towns Wakamin and Joralemon and all, you'd find out and realize that G. P. is the liveliest, smartest town in the state. Did <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that Percy Bresnahan, the famous auto manufacturer, came from here and----Yes, I think that a St. Patrick's Day party would be awfully cunning and original, and yet not too queer or freaky or anything." ...|$|R
2500|$|By {{the time}} Leibowitz closed, the {{prosecution}} had employed anti-semitic remarks to discredit him. Wade Wright added to this, referring to Ruby's boyfriend Lester Carter as [...] "Mr. Caterinsky" [...] and called him [...] "the prettiest Jew" [...] he ever saw. He said, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> defense witnesses are bought and paid for? May the Lord have mercy on the soul of Ruby Bates. Now the question {{in this case is}} this—Is justice in the case going to be bought and sold in Alabama with Jew money from New York?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking in January 2010 to noted UK soul writer Pete Lewis of {{the award-winning}} Blues & Soul, Fakir {{confirmed}} {{plans for the}} [...] "new" [...] Four Tops to release a new album, while revealing his personal feelings about the current line-up: [...] "To me the new group is like {{an extension of the}} family, because we've all been very close for so many years... Which makes it easier for ME, because I truly miss Lawrence, [...] "Obie" [...] AND Levi - I'd be lying if I said I didn't - and not one of them could EVER be replaced. But, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>these</b> new guys do perform well enough for the people to still enjoy the shows and still enjoy the music. So for me, it kinda makes it bittersweet. Because, {{at the end of the}} day, the legacy is still going on and I'm very pleased that it IS!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Right-wing {{radio host}} Rush Limbaugh {{contended that the}} events were being blown out of proportion, stating that [...] "this is no {{different}} than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>these</b> people are being fired at every day. I'm talking about people having a good time, these people, you ever heard of emotional release? You ever heard of emotional release?" [...] Conservative talk show host Michael Savage said, [...] "Instead of putting joysticks, I {{would have liked to have}} seen dynamite put in their orifices", and that [...] "we need more of the humiliation tactics, not less." [...] He repeatedly referred to Abu Ghraib prison as [...] "Grab-an-Arab" [...] prison.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Sit down, pray, Miss Blossom. There {{is no time}} to waste. What do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about <b>these</b> children? Why did {{you send}} them here?' ...|$|R
60|$|HAROLD. Hang you, John! Haven't you {{any human}} sympathy? Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how <b>these</b> things come about? It's like a spark in a straw-yard.|$|R
2500|$|Flagstad {{was first}} noticed by Otto Hermann Kahn, then Chairman {{of the board}} of the Metropolitan Opera, on a trip to Scandinavia in 1929, and Met {{management}} made overtures soon after. Their letters were never answered, however. At the time, Flagstad had just met her soon to be second husband and had even briefly considered giving up opera altogether. Then, in the summer of 1934, when the Met needed a replacement for Frida Leider, Flagstad agreed to audition for conductor Artur Bodanzky and Met general manager Giulio Gatti-Casazza in StMoritz in August 1934, and she was engaged immediately. Upon leaving StMoritz, Bodanzky's parting words for Flagstad were [...] "Come to New York as soon as <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> roles (Isolde, the three Brünnhildes, Leonore in Fidelio, and the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier). And above all do not go and get fat! Your slender, youthful figure is not the least reason you were engaged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{account of}} his not being a house-burner or an assassin, I suppose. That would have made him commonplace. Where did <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And will you, on {{the faith}} of such men as <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> {{soldiers}} to be," [...] said Edith, [...] "take a part of such dreadful moment?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have," [...] said Legree, with a grim, terrible calmness, [...] "done--just--that--thing, Tom, unless you'll {{tell me what}} <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about <b>these</b> yer gals!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know no such thing," [...] {{returned}} Barberry coldly. [...] "I {{bought the}} outfit from <b>you,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it. <b>These</b> gentlemen <b>know</b> it also." ...|$|R
6000|$|She shuddered as I {{pronounced}} the name, then, looking me straight between the eyes--"How come <b>you</b> to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> things?" [...] she inquired.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{then we must}} {{trouble you}} for that corn. In a {{condition}} of primitive simplicity there are no rights of property, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>These</b> are 'hollow conventionalities.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] said Walkirk, hesitating, [...] "that {{they will}} not like that. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> country people are very {{particular}} about leave-taking, and {{all that sort of}} thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|As her visitor was going, Bertha {{suddenly}} said, [...] "Wait a minute," [...] and, {{going to}} her hand-bag, brought out an envelope addressed in Congdon's big scrawling hand. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} been here three weeks ago, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how <b>these</b> things get put off." [...] He coughed again behind his large red hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> Hammond, <b>these</b> Ghazis do attack us, in {{all sorts}} of places--as I have found, to my cost--and these villages abound with these fanatics." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "For {{anyone who}} has seen Scary Chicken, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>these</b> guys are well humoured and quick-witted fellas that take what they can get, and laugh about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; it's shocking," [...] {{said his}} companion. [...] "At any rate, you mustn't say such things, {{even if you}} think them. I can't let you go too far, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>These</b> young people think it heavenly, here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All trueit is so ordered, as was {{revealed}} to me lately, but I {{did not know}} until to-day that the marching would be with me, or that I should march at all. How did <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|L. (having {{received}} {{and considered the}} report). You have got on pretty well children: but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> were easy figures you have been trying. Wait till I have drawn you out the plans of some crystals of snow! ...|$|E
6000|$|The Colonel {{laughed a}} little to himself, and said, consolingly, [...] "Well, well, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> all <b>these</b> country things are new to her. You must be patient with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, do {{what you}} like. I never trouble myself, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> about <b>these</b> matters;" [...] and Mr. Grey {{refreshed}} himself, after this domestic attack, {{with a glass of}} claret.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they will}} have every thing out on deck," [...] says the lady, delighted with the {{increasing}} sensation. [...] "I tell <b>you</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>these</b> custom house officers." ...|$|R
6000|$|BROADBENT [complacently]. Well, it was {{a pretty}} obvious move, I should think. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>these</b> fellows have plenty of shrewdness in spite of their Irish oddity. [Hodson comes from the house. Larry sits in Doran's chair and reads]. Oh, by the way, Hodson-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How are you, Crewe?" [...] he said hospitably; [...] "we're all friends here--eh, Painter? We don't carry our quarrels {{outside the}} {{swinging}} doors. You know Mr. Crewe--by sight, of course. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> other gentlemen, Crewe? I didn't expect you so early." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> things?" [...] I inquired, {{with sudden}} suspicion. [...] "You never came into {{existence}} until this morning. You are only a character in fiction, anyway. I, myself, created you. How {{is it possible for}} you to know anything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What do you think, Manto?' said Proserpine, as {{that lady}} entered the cabin; 'we propose paying {{a visit to}} Saturn. He has fixed his residence, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> in <b>these</b> regions of twilight.' ...|$|R
60|$|SIR HOWARD. Cicely: you {{are talking}} great {{nonsense}} and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it. <b>These</b> people have no laws to restrain them, which means, in plain English, that they are habitual thieves and murderers.|$|R
