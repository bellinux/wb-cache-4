500|$|The inquest {{was opened}} by Leonard Gorodkin at Manchester Coroner's Court on 8 January 1993. Dr William Lawler, a Home Office pathologist, testified that Capper had {{suffered}} 75—80 per cent burns consistent with having had petrol thrown {{over her and}} set alight, and that her chance of survival had been minimal. [...] "It {{was clear from the}} outset that Suzanne was unlikely to survive. She suffered widespread burns that led to several complications internally." [...] Death was due to complications caused by these burns. The coroner said: [...] "It is clear that this young girl must have suffered a great deal of pain and had no chance of survival. But she did fortunately survive long enough to give information which led to the people mentioned being charged with her death." [...] To Capper's mother and stepfather the coroner said: [...] "I offer you, not just on my behalf but on behalf of the whole nation, my very deepest sympathy and condolences at this tragic happening to <b>your</b> <b>young</b> daughter." ...|$|E
500|$|The verdict {{did nothing}} to assuage the ferocity of the debate. [...] Transcripts of the trial were {{extremely}} popular, and portraits of the implacable young maid were offered for sale from shop windows. [...] A reward was offered for information on anyone who had attacked Gascoyne, but mainly the Grub Street press concerned itself with {{the fallout from the}} affair. [...] The Gazeteer was filled with satirical letters between such authors as Aristarchus, Tacitus, and T. Trueman, Esq. [...] One such, a Canningite called Nikodemus, complained that without gypsies, [...] "what would become of <b>your</b> <b>young</b> nobility and gentry, if there were no bawds to procure young girls of pleasure for them?" [...] Those on Squires's side were not the only ones to come under such attacks; John Hill wrote a short song celebrating his and Gascoyne's role in the affair, and pictures of Canning in the loft, her bodice loosened to reveal her bosom, were readily available. [...] Another showed Wells and Squires held aloft by a broomstick, an obvious allusion to witchcraft.|$|E
