Ferraro became livid and distraught {{when one}} of her daughters voted for Obama in the Massachusetts primary, saying [...] "What is the matter with you? You know Hillary. You have seen my involvement with her." [...] When her daughter responded by noting that Obama was inspirational, Ferraro snapped, [...] "What does he inspire you to do, leave <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> three kids and your practice and go work for Doctors Without Borders?" [...] This {{was seen as an}} example of a generational difference among American women; in contrast to Ferraro's generation, younger women saw nothing special about electing a woman president (especially one with Clinton's past history) compared to what writer Anne Kornblut called [...] "the milestone of electing an African American president". According to Kornblut, younger voters saw [...] "Clinton [...] both a relic of that era and a victim of its success. She was the wrong woman at the wrong time; she was a Clinton; she hadn't gotten there on her own".|$|E

6000|$|... “I {{then thought}} {{to speak for}} you,” Mr. Steele continued, “and I {{interposed}} by saying, ‘There was one, madam, who, at least, would have put his own breast between <b>your</b> <b>husband’s</b> <b>and</b> my Lord Mohun’s sword.

60|$|ST. HERBERT I don't say that. I can see {{you taking}} your {{political}} opinions from <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> thinking them your own.|$|E

6000|$|... "I’m <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> {{my place}} is at home," [...] replied Mr. Simpson. [...] "A man {{can have a}} shave if he likes, can’t he? Where’s my supper?" ...|$|E

6000|$|The 'Quarterly' {{seems to}} assume, that no woman, without gross hypocrisy, can stand by a sister proven {{to have been}} guilty. We can appeal on this subject to all women.
