2500|$|At {{least since}} 1847 and {{in line with}} the Liberals, Bismarck had also been of the professed opinion, that state and church should be {{completely}} separated and [...] "the sphere of the state had to be made secure against the incursions by the church", although his ideas were not as far reaching as in the United States or in Great Britain. He had in mind the traditional position of the Protestant church in Prussia and provoked considerable resistance from conservative Protestants. This became clear in a heated debate with Prussian culture minister von Mühler in 1871 when Bismarck said: [...] "Since <b>you</b> <b>stopped</b> my plans in the Protestant church, I have to go via Rome". [...] In August 1871 at Bad Ems, Bismarck revealed his intention to fight against the Centre Party, to separate state and church, to transfer school inspection to laymen, to abolish religious instruction from schools and to transfer religious affairs to the minister of justice.|$|E
