Harry Slater from Pocket Gamer stated, [...] "It's not exactly the most exciting post-apocalyptic game out there, but if casual is <b>your</b> <b>bag</b> there's a lot to like here." [...] Chris Carter from Destructoid wrote, [...] "I don't want to play it every day forever and ever, but it's definitely worth the time I invested in it."

500|$|The {{reviewer}} for {{the feminist}} magazine Herizons wrote, [...] "Fences and Windows was written {{to be read}} and shared and talked about and carried around in <b>your</b> <b>bag.</b> It is a book that begs you to write in the margins, and highlight relevant quotes because it's filled with stories, insights, shocking statistics, inspiring anecdotes and refreshing critiques. It's small, it's smart and it's jammed with information and ideas that inspire hope and motivate action." [...] Similarly, reviewing for The Guardian, Stuart Christie wrote, [...] "This is a book to be savoured and referred to every so often, even if just to recharge one's moral batteries." [...] In The Globe and Mail, Stan Persky wrote, [...] "What I like about Klein's reflections on the nascent movement that she both participates in and analyzes is that she indulges in minimal rhetorical rah-rah. Nor does she fudge the shortcomings and screwups of the fledgling activists." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} by USA Today, [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was picked out {{as one of}} the best three songs on the Last Train to Paris. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars in his review for the song, stating that {{although}} Dirty Money promised a new sound the song sounded like [...] "Timba–pop, albeit one with a better-than-average hook." [...] He continued, [...] "in Diddy's final-minute rap, [...] a reminder of how he jump-started his journey towards a reported $300m fortune and a butler called Fonzworth Bentley." [...] Matt from Above said it was the Danja-produced beat and the T.I. feature that make the song good. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said [...] "Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye–style automooing. He's quite good at it, too. Adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings. There's a middle bit, and it's like nothing else in the song... It sounds more like someone doing the [...] "I've lost my keys" [...] song, just before they leave the house in the morning. The odd thing is that it was left in there. I mean if minimal is <b>your</b> <b>bag,</b> surely that'd be the first bit to cut?" [...] He awarded in four out of five stars. Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song, saying, [...] "Lyrically and stylistically, it’s a pretty standard club track—over various synth beats, the song covers the usual topics: hot girls dancing, crowds waiting to have fun, and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week... But honestly, we’re just overjoyed this song isn’t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy’s various products." ...|$|E

You grab this and get in a queue and I'll join you when yours comes out." [...] When the bag Baker was carrying was searched in customs, 41,120 tablets of ecstasy and 992.5grams of cocaine were found hidden in false compartments of the suitcase, the largest single illegal drugs haul at Narita airport at that time.|$|E

[...] "I {{just want to go}} back to my quiet life", she told the writer of a blog about comics at The Washington Post. Wellington announced on April 26 that he, too, was dropping out of the movement. [...] "I am aghast that so many people are posting deeply offensive pictures of the Prophet," [...] he wrote. [...] "Y'all go ahead if that's <b>your</b> <b>bag,</b> but count me out." [...] Norris acknowledged, [...] "I said that I wanted to counter fear and then I got afraid." [...] On April 29, Norris suggested that [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] be called off: [...] "Let's call off 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' by changing it to 'Everybody Draw Al Gore Day' instead. Enough Mohammed drawings have already been made to get the point across. At this juncture, such drawings are only hurtful to more liberal and moderate Muslims who have not done anything to endanger our first amendment rights."

2500|$|Reading [...] Rabbi Levi {{taught that}} blessed actions bless {{those who are}} {{responsible}} for them, and cursed actions curse those {{who are responsible for}} them. The Midrash interpreted the words of [...] "A perfect and just weight you shall have," [...] to mean that if one acts justly, one will have something to take and something to give, something to buy and something to sell. Conversely, the Midrash read [...] to teach, [...] "You shall not have (possessions if there are) in <b>your</b> <b>bag</b> diverse weights, a great and a small. You shall not have (possessions if there are) in your house diverse measures, a great and a small." [...] Thus, if one does employ deceitful measures, one will not have anything to take or give, to buy or sell. The Midrash taught that God tells businesspeople that they [...] "may not make" [...] one measure great and another small, but if they do, they [...] "will not make" [...] a profit. The Midrash likened this commandment to that of [...] (20:20 in the NJPS) [...] "You shall not make with Me gods of silver, or gods of gold, you shall not make," [...] for if a person did make gods of silver and gold, then that person {{would not be able to}} afford to have even gods of wood or stone.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Hiyya {{taught that}} the words of [...] "You shall do no unrighteousness in {{judgment}}," [...] apply to judgment in law. But a Midrash noted that [...] already mentioned judgment in law, and questioned why [...] would state the same proposition again and why [...] uses the words, [...] "in judgment, in measures." [...] The Midrash deduced that [...] teaches {{that a person who}} measures is called a judge, and one who falsifies measurements is called by the five names [...] "unrighteous," [...] "hated," [...] "repulsive," [...] "accursed," [...] and an [...] "abomination," [...] and is the cause of these five evils. Rabbi Banya said in the name of Rav Huna that the government comes and attacks that generation whose measures are false. The Midrash found support for this from [...] "A false balance is an abomination to the Lord," [...] which is followed by [...] "When presumption comes, then comes shame." [...] Reading [...] "Shall I be pure with wicked balances?" [...] Rabbi Berekiah said in the name of Rabbi Abba that it is impossible for a generation whose measures are false to be meritorious, for [...] continues, [...] "And with a bag of deceitful weights" [...] (showing that their holdings would be merely illusory). Rabbi Levi taught that Moses also hinted to Israel that a generation with false measures would be attacked. [...] warns, [...] "You shall not have in <b>your</b> <b>bag</b> diverse weights [...] [...] [...] you shall not have in your house diverse measures." [...] But if one does, one will be attacked, as [...] reports, [...] "For all who do such things, even all who do unrighteously, are an abomination to the Lord your God," [...] and then immediately following, [...] says, [...] "Remember what Amalek did to you (attacking Israel) by the way as you came forth out of Egypt." ...|$|E
