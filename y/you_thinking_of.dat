[...] Unlike many children of her age, the young Lady Zhen did not enjoy playing. Once, when she was eight years old, her sisters went to the balcony to watch a group of horse-riding performers outside their house but Lady Zhen did not join in. Her sisters were puzzled so they asked her, and she responded, [...] "Is this something a girl should watch?" [...] When she was nine years old, she became interested in scholarly arts and started reading books and using her brothers' writing materials. Her brothers told her, [...] "You should be learning what women traditionally do (such as weaving). When you picked up reading, were <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> becoming a female academician?" [...] Lady Zhen replied, [...] "I heard that virtuous women in history learnt from the successes and failures of those who lived before them. If they didn't read, how did they learn all that?" ...|$|E

Speaking {{was a matter}} of great effort for me, whether I was too tired or too sleepy, I can’t tell. “No, <b>you</b> were not <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> yourself. <b>You</b> were <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> a woman, though.” ...|$|R
