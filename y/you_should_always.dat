25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{clippings}} on the wall, Scarn {{had previously}} saved the NFL, the MLB, and the NBA all-star games. Several Billy Joel songs play throughout the episode, such as [...] "Running on Ice" [...] and [...] "Pressure". A Dave Barry page-a-day calendar is {{featured in a}} montage to illustrate the passing of time. Michael mentions both Oceans 11 and Antz in defense of his movie. The latter is featured in a diatribe Michael delivers about Woody Allen and how <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> listen to your fans.|$|E
2500|$|Gerard Way {{also said}} in a November 2009 {{interview}} with Rock Sound that the fourth album would be their defining work. [...] "A friend who heard the record recently said he now {{had no interest in}} listening to our older work anymore, that we had made all our old material redundant. I took it as a compliment, the next thing <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> make the last thing seem unimportant and I think that will happen when we finally release this album." ...|$|E
60|$|L. As many {{as you can}} {{without losing}} your color. But I did not say <b>you</b> <b>should</b> wish to go to balls. I said <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be <b>always</b> wanting to dance.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Should</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{listen to}} the {{opinions}} of others? (Epistemology) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Harry, is {{not that}} rash of <b>you?</b> Younger {{brothers}} <b>should</b> <b>always</b> get money. You're {{the same as a}} younger brother, you know." ...|$|R
2500|$|Speaking to Digital Spy at Disney's 'Share the Magic' Christmas {{party on}} Oxford Street on 6 November 2013, Mutya Buena {{said that she}} is keeping [...] "an open mind" [...] about {{reclaiming}} the Sugababes name again. [...] "You never say never," [...] she said. [...] "I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> have an open mind. And it is our name!" [...] Buena currently owns rights to use the Sugababes name on paper, cardboard and goods made from these materials, stationery and gift wrapping products. In late January 2014 Range contradicted Ewen's statement, saying that the group was merely on hiatus as they follow solo projects. Speaking on if they'd broken up or not, Range stated, [...] "Not officially but we don't have any plans for anything in the near future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carl is characterised as an {{unemployed}} {{man who has}} spent {{five and a half}} years in prison for drug offences. His backstory on the EastEnders website states that he grew up on a tough south London estate with his brothers. Upon his announcement, he was described as confident, dangerous and charming, while many news reports referred to him as a [...] "bad boy" [...] character. Coonan called the character a dark horse, very clever, manipulative and [...] "slippery", and said that Carl is [...] "exciting to play" [...] because he is unpredictable, adding that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> expect the unexpected with Carl. He compared the character to other villains from the series, saying he is [...] "right up there with them." [...] Inside Soap called Carl [...] "nasty" [...] and [...] "evil", and said that he fills the [...] "super-villain" [...] role last taken by Derek, hoping that he would [...] "shake the Square to its foundations." [...] Heat said of Carl, [...] "there's a new baddie in town and he's proper scary." [...] Soaplife reported that Carl would be the show's [...] "toughest bad guy yet". Digital Spy called him [...] "cunning and ruthless", and Jim Shelley from the Daily Mail called him [...] "a violent drug-dealing criminal".|$|E
60|$|HARRY. [Dryly.] It's very {{convenient}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> {{be within}} earshot when you're wanted, amah.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind Pigott. The {{night is}} too fine to waste asleep; besides, <b>you</b> know, one <b>should</b> <b>always</b> look at ruins by moonlight. Please come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, papa! I am so very glad. Not {{to be able}} {{to hinder}} him was so dreadful, when he wanted to pit Lucy and me against you. I could never have looked at <b>you.</b> I <b>should</b> <b>always</b> have felt that you had {{something}} to forgive me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{no right}} to be always running into danger, Francisco. You are not a Venetian, {{and there is no reason}} why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be <b>always</b> running risks greater than those which most Venetians are likely to encounter. You ought to think of us who care for you, if you don't choose to think of yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come now," [...] urged Poirot encouragingly. [...] "Do not fear. Speak your mind. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> pay {{attention}} to your instincts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{help your}} anxiety just at present, aunt Julia; but <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> {{remember}} {{that there will be}} slips between the cup and the lip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eames," [...] said Sir Raffle, [...] "that must be nonsense;--that must be nonsense. There can be {{no reason}} why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> expect to have your own way in everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you're going to say. <b>You</b> hoped we <b>should</b> <b>always</b> remain good friends." [...] This formula, as Lord Warburton uttered it, was {{certainly}} flat enough; {{but then he}} was interested in making it appear so.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> be DOING?' she retorted. 'It is so plebeian. I {{think it}} is much better to be really patrician, and to do nothing but just be oneself, like a walking flower.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may want}} it badly before you are done," [...] he said. [...] "If I were <b>you</b> I <b>should</b> <b>always</b> have it pitched, except {{when you are}} at a village, for {{you can have the}} sacks in as beds, and so keep them under your eye; and if, as you tell me, you are giving out that they contain ammunition, it would seem but a natural step, as you are so able to keep it dry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Montfort {{has plenty}} of friends here," [...] his sister continued. [...] "You are not wanted, and <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> {{remember}} {{those who have been}} our earliest and kindest friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I have a {{right that}} you should say that--I {{have a right}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> say it. I think he has behaved very foolishly, but I don't blame him----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If ye'd {{shared it}} {{it would have}} been two pound ten. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> study your owner in these matters, cap'n. Now, what about bad weather? Any repairs to the sails?" ...|$|E
60|$|The rest of {{the gentlemen}} seeing us striving cried, 'Give it her all'; but I {{absolutely}} refused that. Then one of them said, 'D--n ye, jack, halve it with her; don't <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be <b>always</b> upon even terms with the ladies.' So, in short, he divided it with me, and I brought away thirty guineas, besides about forty-three which I had stole privately, which I was sorry for afterward, {{because he was so}} generous.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{has got a}} good stout hard stem, {{that can}} make a bush of its own when it hasn't {{anything}} to twine upon. I say, Robin, that's just what <b>you</b> women-folk <b>should</b> be, <b>always</b> ready to twine, and yet able to stick up for yourselves when you've got nothing to hang upon.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Netta put {{him away}} from her, not too hastily, but with a {{lingering}} hesitation, and said once more, [...] "But, Mr. Milliter, I can never marry you. You will repent of this yourself by-and-by at your leisure. Just think, how could I ever marry <b>you,</b> when I <b>should</b> <b>always</b> be too frightened of you to call you anything but 'Mr. Milliter!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went with}} ready {{money in my}} hand, when I tempted the man with a cheque to let me have it for {{two hundred and fifty}} pounds. In buying jewelry <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{tell you}} what it is, Gilmore,” one of the midshipmen jestingly said, “if you go on like this we shall send you to Coventry. It is {{unbearable}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> get to the front.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not blame}} you," [...] Surajah replied. [...] "It is {{necessary}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> be vigilant;" [...] and they retired under {{the shade of}} a tree, a hundred and fifty yards from the gate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe it {{was some}} danger {{that he could not}} be {{protected}} against. There's one thing <b>you</b> <b>should</b> know. He <b>always</b> went about armed. His revolver was never out of his pocket. But, by bad luck, he was in his dressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night. Once the bridge was up, I guess he thought he was safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Yes. That is agreed. I {{will be in}} the Ladies’ Gallery to-morrow {{night at}} half-past eleven. If by that time—and you will have had heaps of opportunity—you have made an {{announcement}} to the House in the terms I wish, I shall hand you back your letter with the prettiest thanks, and the best, or at any rate the most suitable, compliment I can think of. I intend to play quite fairly with <b>you.</b> One <b>should</b> <b>always</b> play fairly [...] . when one has the winning cards. The Baron taught me that [...] . amongst other things.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure I {{should be}} glad that <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>should</b> live at Middlemarch, Mrs. Bulstrode," [...] said Mrs. Hackbutt, {{with a slight}} sigh. [...] "Still, we must learn to resign ourselves, {{wherever}} our lot may be cast. Though I am sure {{there will always be}} people in this town who will wish you well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the safest}} {{card in the}} pack," [...] said the latter. [...] "You please everybody; {{especially}} the little brother. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> hold his hand--it looks well for one thing, and if you shut your eyes--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They won't begin {{for a few}} minutes. They're only tuning up again. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> {{escape from}} the hot air {{for a moment or}} two. Besides, you must answer me that question. Did I offend you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is, {{it would}} have been three hundred guineas unless I had come down with the ready. I made the fellow give me twenty per cent. off. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>always</b> {{remember}} this when you are buying jewelry." ...|$|E
6000|$|And I'll {{come to be}} {{cheered and}} scolded myself the moment I've got things a little to rights here. I think imps get into the shelves and drawers, if they're kept long locked, and must be caught like mice. The boys have been very good, and left {{everything}} untouched; but the imps; and to hear people say there aren't any! How happy <b>you</b> and I <b>should</b> <b>always</b> be if it weren't for them! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{make the}} {{difference}} between us too plain. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> wear them <b>always.</b> It was what you were meant for, and, when I married you, I had a notion that I might be able to give you such things some day and take you where other people wear them. Everything, however, is against me now. We may not even keep Prospect, and you are only the wife of a half-ruined prairie farmer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes, when I'm alone." [...] He {{looked at}} Philip. [...] "You think that's a condemnation? You're wrong. I'm {{not afraid of}} my fear. It's folly, the Christian {{argument}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> live <b>always</b> in view of your death. The only way to live is to forget that you're going to die. Death is unimportant. The fear of it should never influence a single action of the wise man. I know that I shall die struggling for breath, and I know that I shall be horribly afraid. I know that I shall {{not be able to}} keep myself from regretting bitterly the life that has brought me to such a pass; but I disown that regret. I now, weak, old, diseased, poor, dying, hold still my soul in my hands, and I regret nothing." ...|$|R
