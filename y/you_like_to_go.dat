500|$|Cunningham {{was born}} at Rathmines, County Dublin, on 7 January 1883, the third of five {{children}} born to Professor Daniel John Cunningham and his wife Elizabeth Cumming Browne, both of Scottish ancestry. General Sir Alan Cunningham was his younger brother. His parents were described as having a [...] "strong intellectual and clerical tradition," [...] both grandfathers having been in the clergy. His father was a Professor of Anatomy at Trinity College, Dublin, whilst his mother stayed at home. Elizabeth Browne, {{with the aid of}} servants and governesses, oversaw much of his upbringing; as a result he reportedly had a [...] "warm and close" [...] relationship with her. After a short introduction to schooling in Dublin he was sent to Edinburgh Academy, where he stayed with his aunts Doodles and Connie May. At the age of ten he received a telegram from his father asking [...] "would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the Navy?" [...] At the time, the family had no maritime connections, and Cunningham only had a vague interest in the sea. Nevertheless, he replied [...] "Yes, I should like to be an Admiral". He was then sent to a Naval Preparatory School, Stubbington House, which specialised in sending pupils through the Dartmouth entrance examinations. Cunningham passed the exams, showing particular strength in mathematics.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Now, that's {{exactly where}} I wish {{to prevent a}} misconception,' said Lady Davenant. 'If <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>you</b> had a reason for liking, and Laura Wing was the reason, wasn't she?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How?' 'Can't {{you feel}} it does? <b>You</b> wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> bare feet again, same as last year, would you? Not really?' ...|$|R
6000|$|You {{recently}} have said, I hear, [...] That <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>To</b> serve as Senator. That's queer! [...] Have you told William Stow? ...|$|R

6000|$|Lord John had at once in this {{connection}} a bright idea. [...] "Shouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back there and take the measure yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems that}} he knows one of the clergymen in Stamford, and will stay at his house. Perhaps <b>you</b> will <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> upstairs now." ...|$|R
50|$|I would <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{been through}} a good deal, lad," [...] said the major, {{slapping}} Walter on the shoulder. [...] "I dare say <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through it again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{and play}} with those children?" [...] I asked, {{pointing}} {{to a group of}} noisy sand levelers not far away.|$|E

6000|$|... "Here {{we are at}} home, {{and perhaps}} <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in. I have some calls which I must make." [...] Then the {{conversation}} was ended, and Lily was alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye-ep. Dad, {{this man}} {{wants to know}} ef Harve's worth his keep. Say, would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> aboard? We'll fix a ladder for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the hospital? They'll {{put you in}} {{a private}} ward, and you can be better looked after than you can here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If, then, {{you tell}} me the truth, my ship is bound for Barbadoes. And if she should go, would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there with us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{into the}} other room, father?" [...] he asked. [...] "I can leave my work quite easily for a time, and I have several books there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see by {{the papers}} that they are showing a very fine war {{spectacle}} {{at one of the}} photo-play houses," [...] announced Luke. [...] "How would <b>you</b> fellows <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and see it?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with us?" [...] I asked, in surprise, and pitying {{from the}} bottom of my heart the man who was so deeply repentant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I think <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{into the}} school-room and {{practise}} {{some of the}} hymns we are to sing to-night," [...] she said, rightly guessing the thing of all others {{that he wanted to}} do.|$|R

But if <b>you</b> would not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> over the house alone, <b>you</b> will <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in company, I hope. You and Grandcourt ought to see it all. And we will ask Deronda <b>to</b> <b>go</b> round with us. He is more learned about it than I am." [...] The baronet was in the most complaisant of humors.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{up and see}} George?" [...] asked Kirk. It {{was hard}} on George, but it was {{imperative}} that this woman be removed somehow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Kestrel; would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there? Your aunt--I {{could write}} to her." [...] Noel {{stared at him}} a moment; a {{struggle}} seemed going on within her.|$|E
6000|$|... "And here, off in {{the western}} part of Scotland," [...] {{continued}} Mr. George, [...] "are a great many mountains. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and see the mountains?" ...|$|E
