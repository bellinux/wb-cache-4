A story reel featuring a sample of Farley's recorded dialogue was leaked to the public in August 2015. DreamWorks then re-cast the voice role to Mike Myers, who insisted on a complete script rewrite, to leave no traces of Farley's version of Shrek.

Owen praised the writing and subversion of expectations, and, though he found some of the twists predictable and felt that the ending needed more groundwork, felt that the final sequence [...] "was worth it for another brown-trouser moment". Bennion felt that the [...] "genius" [...] of the episode was the way that tension was [...] "undercut" [...] with humour, but felt that the humour actually served to raise the tension. He highlighted the joke involving blue paint as particularly funny. Patrick Mulkern, of Radio Times, also praised the mix of humour and horror.|$|E

500|$|Historian H. M. Walbrook {{wrote in}} 1921 that Pinafore [...] "satirizes {{the type of}} {{nautical}} drama of which Douglas Jerrold's Black-Eyed Susan is a typical instance, and the 'God's Englishman' sort of patriotism which consists in shouting a platitude, striking an attitude, and doing {{little or nothing to}} help one's country". G. K. Chesterton agreed that the satire is pointed at the selfishness of [...] "being proud of <b>yourself</b> <b>for</b> being a citizen" [...] of one's country, which requires no virtuous effort of will to resist the [...] "temptations to belong to other nations" [...] but is merely an excuse for pride. In 2005, Australian opera director Stuart Maunder noted the juxtaposition of satire and nationalism in the opera, saying, [...] "they all sing 'He is an Englishman', and you know damn well they're sending it up, but the music is so military... that you can't help but be swept up in that whole jingoism that is the British Empire." [...] In addition, he argued that the song ties this theme into the main satire of class distinctions in the opera: [...] "H.M.S. Pinafore is basically a satire on... the British love of the class system.... f course [...] can marry [...] daughter, because he's British, and therefore he's great'". Jacobs notes that Gilbert is lampooning the tradition of nautical melodrama in which the sailor's [...] "patriotism guarantees his virtue".|$|E

After Drake still could not settle on the direction for the track, Songz came up with the his hook. He explained to MTV News, [...] "The first thing that came to mind was 'I want the money, money and the cars/ Cars and the clothes/ The ho's/ I suppose I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful.' When I'm saying all that, conceptually for me, the deepest part of the record was when I say, 'I suppose.' I supposed that's what success is about. That's what [...] led to believe." [...] After hearing the hook, Drake called it [...] "powerful", commenting, [...] "And it's like, it's almost like it made me feel like it may not be right what I want, you know? All these things, it's like it made me feel young. It kind of made me feel ignorant to the game. But it was an exciting record even though the tempo is slow. That's what I want... The 'I suppose' moment in there is like, it's almost like you're doubting <b>yourself</b> <b>for</b> a second. But {{at the end of the}} day, I just want to be successful.
