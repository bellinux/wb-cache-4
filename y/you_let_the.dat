500|$|The Independents Andy Gill {{awarded a}} four-out-of-five star rating to Syro {{and called it}} [...] "a {{collection}} primarily concerned with the somatic rather than cerebral sides of Richard James' music, overdosing somewhat on staccato, bouncing synth twangs and jittery drum'n'bass beats." [...] "aisatsana [...] ", Syros closing track, drew comparisons to the works of French composer Erik Satie from both The Independent and Drowned in Sound, whose reviewer Tom Fenwick awarded the album a full 10-out-of-10 rating. Summarising the album, Fenwick said that [...] "Syro sees a master craftsman return with renewed inspiration. And while it might not technically be James' most innovative album, it way [...] well be his best … and once <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> hype drain away—what's revealed is pretty much flawless." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{final moments}} linger on Dean [...] "meat-hooked {{in the center}} of what looks like a {{thousand}} mile spiderweb of rusty chains", a scene Kripke described as [...] "M. C. Escher meets Hellraiser". The original vision for the final scene would have placed Dean in a [...] "really nasty, bloody slaughterhouse, hanging from meat hooks". Here, Dean would start screaming as shadows fall over him. Discussions between Kripke, Manners, and Hayden led to the decision to present [...] "one epic glimpse" [...] of Hell, though they avoided aspects such as fire and brimstone to focus on more affordable visuals. Much debate went into the appearance of Hell because of its many variations. Though the scene matched with the many versions of [...] "chains and people being ripped apart", art director John Marcynuk felt they should have made it [...] "a little more mysterious and dark". He commented, [...] "My opinion is, the vaguer the better, because <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> imagination take over. People have different fears, and Hell's such a personal torment." [...] In series writer Sera Gamble's opinion, Dean's location is more of the [...] "waiting room"—the place [...] "they stick you before they hand you the sign-in sheet"—a far cry from what he will experience [...] "once he gets into the first chamber of Hell".|$|E

2500|$|... — Prime Minister David Cameron (who {{enabled the}} Scottish {{independence}} referendum, 2014 {{to be carried}} out) said: [...] "I don't believe that, in the end, [...] try to ignore these questions of nationality, independence, identity... I think it’s right to make your arguments, take them on and then <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> people decide. But that's the way I {{want to do things}} in the United Kingdom. I would never presume to tell people in Spain how to meet these challenges themselves; it's a matter for the Spanish Government and the Spanish Prime Minister." [...] After the consultation he declared that he wanted Spain [...] "to stay united" [...] and that referendums [...] "should be done through the proper constitutional and legal frameworks".|$|E
2500|$|However, the Fu Zi gave a {{completely}} different account of Guo's advice to Cao Cao {{on how to handle}} Liu Bei. Guo Jia told Cao Cao, [...] "Liu Bei has great ambitions and has won the hearts of many people. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu are formidable fighters and they have pledged to serve him with their lives. From what I observe, Liu Bei will never truly submit to anyone, and his intentions are unclear. The people in the past once said, 'If <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> enemy off today, they will become a threat to you for a long time.' You should settle (Liu Bei) soon." [...] At the time, Cao Cao was using Emperor Xian as a figurehead to command respect and had attracted many heroes to serve under him so he did not heed Guo Jia's advice. When Cao Cao later sent Liu Bei with an army to attack Yuan Shu, Guo Jia and Cheng Yu warned Cao, [...] "Liu Bei will rebel if you let him go!" [...] By then, Liu Bei had already left and he really did rebel against Cao Cao as he later seized control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the provincial governor appointed by Cao Cao. Cao Cao regretted not following Guo Jia's advice.|$|E
