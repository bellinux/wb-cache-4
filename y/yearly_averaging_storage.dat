40|$|Abstract: An {{attempt was}} made to explore {{correlation}} between climate variables and Kala-azar prevalence at four highly affected districts in Bangladesh: Mymensingh, Tangail, Pabna, and Rajshahi. The climate variables included were temperature, rainfall and relative humidity. With the rise of <b>yearly</b> <b>average</b> humidity in Mymensingh, Tangail and Rajshahi districts Kala-azar prevalence was significantly increased and with the rise of yearly total rainfall positive but not significant correlation was observed in Mymensingh,Tangail and Rajshahi. In Mymensingh negative correlation was found with <b>yearly</b> <b>average</b> maximum and minimum temperature. Positive association with yearly total rainfall in Mymensingh, Pabna & Rajshahi and <b>yearly</b> <b>average</b> minimum temperature in Rajshahi and <b>yearly</b> <b>average</b> maximum temperature in Tangail was observed. The prevalence of the disease was found to have negative correlation with <b>yearly</b> <b>average</b> maximum temperature in both Pabna & Rajshahi, <b>yearly</b> <b>average</b> minimum temperature in both Tangail & Pabna and yearly total rainfall in Tangail...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} decades, the {{international}} scientific literature {{has focused on}} the assessment and quantification of trends in average temperature and rainfall, underlining changes in time and space sometimes relevant. The changes concern the <b>yearly</b> <b>average</b> values, the seasonal distribution, the daily values, with marked differences both at a continental and national scale. In this paper, with reference to a database containing the records of about 8000 thermometric stations and 12000 rainfall stations for the period 1895 - 1997 for the USA, available on the website of the Institute for Mathematics Applied to Geosciences ([URL] an analysis on the spatial correlation between the <b>yearly</b> <b>average</b> rainfall hc and the mean of the <b>yearly</b> <b>average</b> ground temperature T was performed.

40|$|Study region: : Kathmandu Valley, Capital city of Nepal Study focus: : This study applied three {{hydrological}} models (i. e., SWAT, HBV, and BTOPMC) {{to analyze}} the water balance components and their temporal and seasonal variations in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. The water balance components were investigated using the same precipitation, climatic data, and potential evapotranspiration (PET) as input variables for each model. The yearly and seasonal variations in each component and the interactions among them were analyzed. There was a close agreement between the monthly observed and calibrated runoff at the watershed scale, and all the three models captured well the flow patterns {{for most of the}} seasons. New hydrological insights for the region: : The average annual runoff in the study watershed calculated by the SWAT, HBV, and BTOPMC models was 887, 834, and 865  mm, corresponding to 59 %, 55 %, and 57 % of the annual precipitation, respectively. The average annual evapotranspiration (ET) was 625, 623, and 718  mm, and the estimated <b>yearly</b> <b>average</b> total water <b>storage</b> (TWS) was 5, − 35, and 29  mm, respectively. The long-term average TWS component was similar in all three models. ET had the lowest inter-annual variation and runoff had the greatest inter-annual variation in all models. Predictive analysis using the three models suggested a reasonable range for estimates of runoff, ET, and TWS. Although there was variation in the estimates among the different models, our results indicate a possible range of variation for those values, which is a useful finding for the short- and long-term planning of water resource development projects in the study area. The effects of historical water use, water stress, and climatic projections using multi-model water balance approaches offer a useful direction for future studies to enhance our understanding of anthropogenic effects in the Kathmandu Valley...|$|R
