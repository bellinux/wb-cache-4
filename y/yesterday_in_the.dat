2500|$|In 1998, President Ernesto Zedillo, on the 30th {{anniversary of}} the Tlatelolco massacre, {{authorized}} a congressional investigation into the events of October 2. However, the PRI government continued its recalcitrance and did not release official government documents pertaining to the incident. In a 2002 All Things Considered radio interview with Kate Doyle, director of the Mexican Documentation Project for the US National Security Archive, she described the PRI government's investigations: [...] "I mean, {{there have been a}} number of investigations throughout the years. In fact, former President Miguel de la Madrid was interviewed <b>yesterday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> press, and said that he had asked the military and the interior secretary for documents and for photographs of the demonstrations, and was subjected to tremendous political pressure not to investigate. And when he continued to press, the military and the interior ministry claimed that their files were in disarray and they had nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 01:00 hours, the Soviets {{picked up}} radio {{message from the}} German LVI Corps {{requesting}} a cease-fire and stating that emissaries would come under a white flag to Potsdamer bridge. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 06:00 hours. He was taken to see Lieutenant-General Chuikov at 8:23 am. Chuikov, who had commanded the successful defence of Stalingrad, asked: [...] "You are {{the commander of the}} Berlin garrison?" [...] Weidling replied: [...] "Yes, I am the commander of the LVI Panzer Corps." [...] Chuikov then asked: [...] "Where is Krebs? [...] What did he say?" [...] Weidling replied: [...] "I saw him <b>yesterday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Reich Chancellery." [...] Weidling then added: [...] "I thought he would commit suicide." [...] In the discussions that followed, Weidling agreed to an unconditional surrender of the city of Berlin. He agreed to order the city's defenders to surrender to the Soviets. Under the direction of Chuikov and Soviet General Vasily Sokolovsky (Chief of staff of the 1st Ukrainian Front), Weidling put his order to surrender in writing.|$|E
