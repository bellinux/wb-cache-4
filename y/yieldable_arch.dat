30|$|The {{yieldable}} trapezium support, {{compared with}} the <b>yieldable</b> <b>arch</b> support, behaves poor mechanical performance. However, it still has some advantages under certain conditions: no damage to roof, high utilization ratio of cross-section area, simple structure, easy processing and transportation. When the horizontal stress is not high, and the roadway cross-section is pretty small, yieldable trapezium supports can be applied.|$|E
30|$|The {{yieldable}} circular supports {{are also}} called the yieldable enclosed supports, which include horseshoe-shaped (Fig.  8 c), circle-shaped (Fig.  8 d), and square- or rectangular-shaped types. The <b>yieldable</b> <b>arches</b> and trapezium supports stated above are open in the floor, and cannot control the floor deformation. The yieldable circular supports forms an enclosed ring, which can not only increase their bearing capacity, but also restrain the floor heave effectively. These yieldable circular supports are applicable to roadways in soft rocks with high stresses and large deformation, especially large floor heave.|$|R
30|$|A <b>yieldable</b> steel <b>arch</b> is {{composed}} of a roof beam, legs, and connecting elements (Fig.  8 b). The roof beam is an arc structure, generally consisting {{of one or two}} segments. There are two types of legs: the first one consists of an arc segment in the upper part, and a straight segment in the bottom part; the other one consists of all curved segments. <b>Yieldable</b> steel <b>arches</b> can be divided into three-segment, four-segment, five-segment and more segment types according to the number of segments, in which, three-segment and four-segment types are used widely.|$|R
30|$|Germany {{has some}} of the deepest coal mines in the world, and the leading strata control {{technology}} for deep roadways (Shi et al. 2009, 2013). In the matter of roadway support technology, combined supports with <b>yieldable</b> steel <b>arches</b> and rock bolting, and backfilling beside the roadways and behind the steel arches are well studied and widely applied.|$|R
30|$|Based on the geomechanics {{properties}} of rocks surrounding roadways, a parameter representing the general characteristics of rocks was proposed to classify {{the stability of}} rocks. The surrounding rocks were divided into five grades, and each grade was subdivided into 2 sub-grades. Roadway support patterns and parameters can be determined according to the rock grades. Rock bolts or <b>yieldable</b> steel <b>arches</b> are fit for stable rocks; combined supports with steel arches, rock bolts and cables, are necessary for the instable rocks.|$|R
30|$|The {{combination}} of rock bolting and steel supports {{is commonly used}} in complex roadways. According to the construction sequence, this combination support {{can be divided into}} two types: one is installing bolts (or cables) first, then setting steel supports; another is setting steel supports first, then installing bolts (or cables) between the steel supports. Bolts and cables can be used with various steel supports, such as I-shaped steel supports, <b>yieldable</b> steel <b>arches,</b> and enclosed steel supports. Bolts or cables can individually be combined with steel supports (Tian et al. 2011), bolts and cables can also be together used with steel supports.|$|R
