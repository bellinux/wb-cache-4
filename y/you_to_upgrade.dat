5000|$|In {{reviewing}} the release, Chris Jones wrote, [...] "Ubuntu 15.10 as an operating system for Review is pretty lackluster. There's nothing new as such and there's {{nothing we can}} really say {{that is going to}} change your opinion from its predecessor, 15.04. Therefore, we recommend <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>upgrade</b> either out of habit and according to your regular upgrade schedule rather than out of a specific necessity for a specific feature of this release. Because there is really nothing that could possibly differentiate it from the older, yet still very stable 15.04 release. But if you're going to stick with 15.04 for a little longer, we do recommend that you look at upgrading the kernel to the latest 4.2 branch. It is worth it. If you really want a reason to upgrade? Linux kernel 4.2 would be our sole reason for taking Ubuntu 15.10 into consideration." ...|$|E

50|$|The flying {{machines}} are all {{equipped with a}} turbo booster and blaster, and can be equipped with better turbos, equipment and various weapons to sabotage your opponents' ships. During a race, {{you can pick up}} icons that fix damage sustained to your engine or controls, or extra turbo boosts. You can also shoot at white non-racing ships that turn into one of these icons. As an added risk, there are red icons in the mix, which will cause your controls to go into reverse. In championship mode, there are also cash icons to be picked up, giving <b>you</b> funds <b>to</b> <b>upgrade</b> your ship with more turbos or weapons.|$|R

Important When <b>you</b> <b>upgrade</b> <b>to</b> Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8. 6 (1) the system will reboot {{as part of the}} upgrade process. Therefore, <b>you</b> may want <b>to</b> perform the <b>upgrade</b> during a scheduled down time for your organization to avoid service interruptions. Caution If <b>you</b> <b>upgrade</b> <b>to</b> the U.

50|$|Another {{advantage}} of the surface mounting of all components is that no additional holes or routs are needed to the guitar to fit the unit. This is especially nice if <b>you</b> <b>upgrade</b> <b>to</b> a similar guitar (e.g. from an Epiphone Les Paul to a Gibson Les Paul), as you can move the tremolo from the old guitar to the new without losing any functionality/value of either guitar, since its original bridge/tailpiece can be put back on.|$|R
50|$|During {{battles in}} {{campaign}} mode, the player mobilizes a large variety of customizable units (tanks, aircraft, submarines, and warships) across a hexagon-shaped grid {{in order to}} defeat the opposing Allied or Axis forces controlled by the game's AI. In addition, as time progresses <b>you</b> are able <b>to</b> <b>upgrade</b> individual units either based on experience levels or as a blanket technology upgrade. Experimental weaponry is used in some later battles, including some German jet aircraft like the Messerschmidt Me 262. The map system itself is static but real-time 3-D animations are used to recreate encounters between various types of units, an option that can also be toggled off.|$|R

40|$|Execution Added {{the option}} to submit jobs using slurm. Added the crash_dir {{parameter}} at the project level (i. e. it will be defined when you run setup_project. py and will be stored in $LYMAN_DIR/project. py). This allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> specify where debugging information will be written {{if something goes wrong}} during workflow execution. The previous approach to selecting where crash files would be written was not robust in all execution contexts. Important: if <b>you</b> <b>upgrade</b> <b>to</b> this version and try to rerun something in an existing project, you will get an error. This can be avoided by defining crash_dir in your project file. These files are usually only transiently useful, so the default location for new projects is /tmp/nipype-$USER-crashes.

These tools are cursed and <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> bless them at the temple on the phone. If you use them if they are still cursed, you CAN'T take them off and they use a lot of stamina. If you have all the blessed tools (all cursed tools found and blessed) you can search in the third mine again for Mythic Stones (level 7).

40|$|In {{this lesson}} you will install QGIS software, {{download}} geospatial files like shapefiles and GeoTIFFs, {{and create a}} map out {{of a number of}} vector and raster layers. Quantum or QGIS is an open source alternative to the industry leader, ArcGIS from ESRI. QGIS is multiplatform, which means it runs on Windows, Macs, and Linux and it has many of the functions most commonly used by historians. ArcGIS is prohibitively expensive and only runs on Windows (though software can be purchased to allow it to run on Mac). However, many universities have site licenses, meaning students and employees have access to free copies of the software (try contacting your map librarian, computer services, or the geography department). QGIS is ideal for those without access to a free copy of Arc and it is also a good option for learning basic GIS skills and deciding if <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> install a copy of ArcGIS on your machine. Moreover, any work you do in QGIS can be exported to ArcGIS at a later date if <b>you</b> decide <b>to</b> <b>upgrade.</b> The authors tend to use both and are happy to run QGIS on Mac and Linux computers for basic tasks, but still return to ArcGIS for more advanced work. In many cases it is not lack of functions, but stability issues that bring us back to ArcGIS. For those who are learning Python with the Programming Historian, you will be glad to know that both QGIS and ArcGIS use Python as their main scripting language...|$|R

40|$|Omeka. net is {{a useful}} service for Omeka beginners, {{but there are a}} few reasons why <b>you</b> might want <b>to</b> install your own copy of Omeka. Reasons include: * Upgrades. By {{installing}} Omeka yourself, you can use the latest versions of Omeka as soon as they’re released, without having to wait for Omeka. net <b>to</b> <b>upgrade</b> their system. * Plugins and themes. You can install any plugin or theme you want, without being restricted to those provided by Omeka. net. * Customizations. You can buy a custom domain name, and customize your code to achieve your desired functionality. * Control. You have control over your own backups, and you can update the server yourself so that its security is always up-to-date. * Price. There are many low-cost Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) now, some of which cost only 5 per month. * Storage. Many shared hosting providers now offer unlimited storage. This is useful if you have a large media library. In this tutorial, we’ll be entering a few commands on the command line. This tutorial assumes no prior knowledge of the command line, but if you want a concise primer, consult the Programming Historian introduction to BASH. There are other ways of installing Omeka, of course, some using exclusively GUI tools. Some hosting providers even offer “one-click installs” via their control panels. Many of those methods, however, will install older versions of Omeka which are then harder <b>to</b> <b>upgrade</b> and maintain. The method outlined below may not be the easiest way to install Omeka, but it will give you some good practice with using the command line, which is a skill that will be useful if <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> manually <b>upgrade</b> your install, or manually install other web frameworks. (For example, this installation method is very similar to WordPress’s “Five-Minute Install”.) There are four steps to this process, and it should take about an hour...|$|R
