5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>of</b> superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E

60|$|Naturally <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>of</b> the Mariposa train now. Years ago, {{when you}} {{first came to the}} city as a boy with your way to make, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> it well enough, only too well. The price of a ticket counted in those days, and though <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> the train <b>you</b> couldn't take it, but {{sometimes}} from sheer homesickness you used to wander down to the station on a Friday afternoon after your work, and watch the Mariposa people getting on the train and wish that you could go.|$|R

25|$|Sheriff Bill Presley and his deputies have a {{difficult}} task ahead of them {{as they attempt to}} solve the shocking double murder discovered Sunday morning. Texarkana residents can help in this investigation {{and at the same time}} if they are not careful, they can hinder the investigation and cause the officers to spend many hours following blind trails. Persons who have information which might furnish a clue to the identity of the slayer or slayers or which might indicate a motive for the crime should not divulge such information on street corners or at cold drink stands but should immediately make it available to the officers. Do not spread rumors regardless of how much basis for fact there is in them. Do not say 'I heard' or 'they say', because the chances are that the person listening will repeat your information and enlarge upon it. Before long the story grows to such proportions as to necessitate a detailed investigation by the officers, thereby perhaps pulling them off the true trail and sending them up a blind alley. Stick to facts that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> your own personal knowledge and relay those facts as quickly as possible to the officers.|$|E
500|$|Well, what {{happened}} there is, of course—now all of you must adjust your brains—the biggest work of art there has ever been. The fact that spirits achieve with one act something which we in music could never dream of, that people practise ten years madly, fanatically for a concert. And then die. [...] And that is the greatest work of art that exists for the whole Cosmos. Just imagine {{what happened}} there. There {{are people who are}} so concentrated on this single performance, and then five thousand people are driven to Resurrection. In one moment. I couldn't do that. Compared to that, we are nothing, as composers. [...] It is a crime, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> course, because the people did not agree to it. They did not come to the [...] "concert". That is obvious. And nobody had told them: [...] "You could be killed in the process." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinkner {{thought the}} added musical element {{improved}} the episode, {{because it gave}} insights into each of the characters' psyches. According to Wyman and Pinkner, the [...] "episode {{was supposed to be}} a fantastical episode in the first place, and so the music supports the storytelling". Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt that that was a great way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at right now, with his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>of</b> course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this show. And I did! It's so awesome!" [...] Swerling called it [...] "the longest and possibly most difficult episode of the season" [...] to create.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{verbally}} {{committed to}} Kentucky on August 13, 2010, choosing {{it over his}} other finalists, which were DePaul, Ohio State, and Syracuse. He had officially visited DePaul and Ohio State. On August 24, 2010, he became the number one rated player in the national class of 2011 at Scout.com. [...] The pay-for-play scandal had played out very publicly in the press. Before Davis committed to Kentucky, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that his father, Anthony Davis, Sr. asked Kentucky for $200,000 for a commitment from his son. The report was initially released on Wednesday August 4, 2010 by Sun-Times reporter Michael O'Brien. Citing [...] "a reliable source", he posted the following text [...] "rumors/sources that have Davis choosing Kentucky are also alleging that the commitment cost $200,000." [...] before it was edited to say [...] "rumors that Davis' commitment is for sale have surfaced since he cut his list of schools down about a month ago." [...] and then removed later that day from the Sun-Times high school sports website following a threat from a University of Kentucky lawyer. A Lexington, Kentucky law firm sent a letter under the signature of attorney Stephen L. Barker that expressed a [...] "formal demand that you (O'Brien and the Sun-Times) withdraw the publication from any source from which it has been published, and issue an immediate statement that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no credible evidence indicating {{that there is any}} truth to the 'rumors' referred to in your article." [...] Baker's letter also threatened potential [...] "punitive damages for your malicious and willful actions." [...] Anthony Davis Sr. declined to speak to the Chicago Tribune on August 4 regarding the allegation, although he denied the allegations to the Sun-Times stating [...] "We haven't asked anyone for anything, and no one has offered us anything", on July 30 before the story broke.|$|E

They've got no real basic understanding, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>of</b> the law and even {{business}} law. Obviously they've got no real business sense. A dollar doesn't really have much of a meaning to them, and I think to treat anybody like that is just… it's just not on in this country.", ABC PM, 15 March.|$|E

6000|$|... "It seems {{a strange}} question," [...] Arnold continued, [...] "and yet it {{presents}} itself. I {{was going to}} ask <b>you</b> whether <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> any reason whatsoever why Mr. Weatherley should voluntarily choose to go into hiding?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no idea," [...] Arnold answered. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth," [...] he went on earnestly, [...] "I {{was going to ask}} <b>you</b> whether <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> {{anything}} in his life or affairs which could explain this?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Rev. Briegleb {{delivered}} his eulogy for Crawford [...] "through tear-dimmed eyes," [...] {{as he told}} of Crawford’s generosity to the church. [...] He called Crawford a [...] "true friend" [...] and said the funeral was [...] "the most difficult task I have ever faced in my twenty-five years as a minister." [...] Briegleb later drew attention when he compared the life of Crawford {{to that of the}} Apostle Matthew. [...] Briegleb noted that [...] Matthew had begun as Levi the Politician and said the conversion of Crawford was almost identical to that of the apostle. [...] Briegleb also criticized the press for its coverage of Crawford’s death, noting, [...] "We ought to let the dead sleep." [...] Responding to criticism about taking gifts from such a notorious person, Briegleb said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> any more sinners who have $25,000, send ‘em along; I can use it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And I," [...] said Grant, {{holding out}} his hand, [...] "will stand by you. But tell me now what <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> this man Curtis,--his {{character}} and disposition; it may be some {{clue as to what}} are his methods and his intentions." ...|$|R
