She recalled the belief of her father-in-law, King Francis I, that the court needed to be physically active and constantly entertained.• Catherine wrote to Charles IX: [...] "I heard it said to <b>your</b> <b>grandfather</b> the King that two things were necessary to live in peace with the French and have them love their King: keep them happy, and busy at some exercise, notably tournaments; for the French are accustomed, if there is no war, to exercise themselves and if they are not made to do so they employ themselves to more dangerous [...] ". Quoted in Jollet, 111. She also declared her intention to imitate the Roman emperors, who kept their subjects from mischief by occupying them with games and amusements. She therefore adopted a policy of distracting her nobles from fighting among themselves by laying on irresistible entertainments and sports for them at court.|$|E

Under Griffin's leadership, the party targeted areas with high proportions of skilled white working-class voters, particularly those who were disenchanted with the Labour government. It has attempted to appeal to disaffected Labour voters with slogans such as [...] "We are the Labour Party <b>your</b> <b>Grandfather</b> Voted For". The BNP had little success in gaining support from women, the middle classes, and the more educated.|$|E

2500|$|On September 18, 2006, Allen and Webb debated {{each other}} at the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce. One of the more {{interesting}} aspects of this debate came when Allen was questioned by WUSA-TV anchor Peggy Fox. Fox said: [...] "It has been reported [...] <b>your</b> <b>grandfather</b> Felix, whom you were given your middle name for, was Jewish. Could you please tell us whether your forebears include Jews and, if so, at which point Jewish identity might have ended?" [...] This led to a booing from the crowd and anger from Allen who admonished Fox for [...] "making aspersions" [...] and responded: [...] "To be getting into what religion my mother is, I don't think is relevant...Why is that relevant -- my religion, Jim's religion or the religious beliefs of anyone out there?...My mother is French-Italian with a little Spanish blood in her." [...] The next day, Allen issued a statement both confirming and distancing himself from his mother's Jewish ancestry. The statement read: ...|$|E

[...] The Ansari said, [...] "So where is the fault and loss then?" [...] He said, [...] "You spoke the truth. Do you need something?" [...] He said, [...] "Yes.

2500|$|For Catherine, these {{entertainments}} {{were worth}} their colossal expense, since they served a political purpose. Presiding over the royal government {{at a time}} when the French monarchy was in steep decline, she set out to show not only the French people but foreign courts that the Valois monarchy was as prestigious and magnificent as it had been during the reigns of Francis I and her husband Henry II. At the same time, she believed these elaborate entertainments and sumptuous court rituals, which incorporated martial sports and tournaments of many kinds, would occupy her feuding nobles and distract them from fighting against each other to the detriment of the country and the royal authority.• Catherine wrote to Charles IX: [...] "I heard it said to <b>your</b> <b>grandfather</b> the King that two things were necessary to live in peace with the French and have them love their King: keep them happy, and busy at some exercise, notably tournaments; for the French are accustomed, if there is no war, to exercise themselves and if they are not made to do so they employ themselves to more dangerous [...] ".

[...] He scraped off the bark and then asked X̱i7lánexw [...] if he had a bowl plate and told him to put three rocks in to boil the water. They took the bark of the willow tree, then gave it to the woman to drink. The lead brother told his younger brothers, [...] "You better take <b>your</b> <b>grandfather</b> outside", which they did while the oldest brother stayed with X̱i7lánexw 's wife. Not long after, they heard a baby's cry. He fixed the baby up and taught the woman how to take care of it, and told him about the medicine. He told the man that when he came him, that he had a baby boy. The first baby was a boy, and the next a girl. These two grew up {{together}} and married each other. The next baby was a girl, then a boy, and these did the same. This is where all the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh came from.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{invasion}} {{took place}} between December 1299 and April 1300 due to the military campaign by the Mamluks against the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia who were allied with the Mongols. The Ilkhanate army managed to reach Damascus {{by the end of}} December 1299. Ibn Taymiyyah went with a delegation of Islamic scholars to talk to Ghazan Khan, who was the Khan of the Mongol Ilkhanate of Iran, to plead clemency and to stop his attack on the Muslims. It is reported that none of the scholars said anything to the Khan except Ibn Taymiyyah who said: [...] "You claim that you are Muslim and you have with you Mu'adhdhins, Muftis, Imams and Shaykhs but you invaded us and reached our country for what? While your father and <b>your</b> <b>grandfather,</b> Hulagu were non-believers, they did not attack and they kept their promise. But you promised and broke your promise." [...] By early January 1300 the Mongol allies, the Armenians and Georgians, had caused widespread damage to Damascus and they had taken Syrian prisoners. The Mongols effectively occupied Damascus for the first four months of 1303. Most of the military had fled the city, including most of the civilians. Ibn Taymiyyah however, stayed {{and was one of the}} leaders of the resistance inside Damascus and he went to speak directily to the Mongol Ilkhan Mahmud Ghazan and his vizier Rashid al-Din Tabib. He sought the release of Muslim and dhimmi prisoners which the Mongols had taken in Syria, and after discussion, secured their release.|$|E

2500|$|Paternal {{grandfather}} to Barack Obama, he {{was born}} Onyango Obama. (One source gives 1870–1975 as his dates of birth and death, possibly based on his tombstone in his home village. Barack Obama relates finding in 1988 a British document, based on a 1928 ordinance, recording his grandfather as 35 years old. The date of the document {{was estimated to be}} about 1930, which would mean that his grandfather had been born around 1895.) The Luo are given names related to the circumstances of their birth, and Onyango means [...] "born in the early morning."Onyango was the fifth son of his mother, Nyaoke, who {{was the first of the}} five wives of his father, Obama. Barack Obama relates how his step-grandmother Granny Sarah (Sarah Onyango Obama) describes his grandfather: [...] "Even from the time that he was a boy, <b>your</b> <b>grandfather</b> Onyango was strange. It is said of him that he had ants up his anus, because he could not sit still." [...] As a young man, Onyango learned to speak, read and write in English, the language of British colonial administration in Kenya. Onyango worked as a mission cook and as a local herbalist. He joined the King's African Rifles during World War I. In 1949, Onyango spent at least six months in Kamiti Prison. He was probably tried in a magistrates' court on charges of sedition or being a member of a banned organization. Records do not survive; all such documentation was routinely destroyed after six years by the British colonial administration. He was tortured to extract information about the growing insurgency seeking the independence of Kenya.
