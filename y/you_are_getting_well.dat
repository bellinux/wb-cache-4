6000|$|... "Don't be ungenerous about it, my dear," [...] {{said the}} squire turning to Bell; [...] "Lady Julia {{means to be}} kind. But, my darling," [...] and the squire turned again towards Lily, {{addressing}} her, as was his wont in these days, with an affection that was almost vexatious to her; [...] "but, my darling, why should you not go? A change of scene like that will do you all the good in the world, just when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>well.</b> Mary, tell the girls they ought to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you should}} want me, I {{will come back}} willingly. When you did want me, I was quite happy to come; there was no merit in it. I think you must be afraid, that, now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>well,</b> I may be {{troublesome}} to you; but I should not have been, indeed. I should have come no longer than your weakness and confinement lasted. You owe me nothing; but it is right that you should deal as justly by me as if I was a lady--even the very lady that you love; and if you suspect me of meanly making much of the little I {{have tried to do}} to comfort your sick room, you do yourself more wrong than ever you can do me. That is why I am sorry. That is why I am very sorry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My darling, <b>you</b> have <b>been</b> ill, and <b>you</b> {{have lost}} blood; but now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> quite <b>well.</b> I {{have been very}} unhappy about you; but now I am quite happy, my sweet, sweet child.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, John," [...] replied Milly, {{blushing}} {{in spite}} of--nay, rather more in consequence of--her efforts {{not to do}} so. [...] "I spoke to her some days ago. Indeed, soon after the accident, when we <b>were</b> sure <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to <b>get</b> <b>well.</b> And she did not disapprove." ...|$|R

6000|$|Dear Mr. Glover,--I hope <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> on <b>well,</b> and <b>are</b> by this [...] time on {{your legs}} again.

Of course if we <b>are</b> away, <b>you</b> will wait till our return.

But there is something a bit different about the Lenovo U300s. It feels slightly less indulgent and takes itself a little more seriously, making it potentially more attractive to the business user. It's not perfect, with the reduced size keys on the keyboard being the main bugbear, but <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> a solid, <b>well</b> designed Ultrabook at a very reasonable price." ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is the end}} of 2014. Is it just me or does {{it really}} feel like time is flying by faster every year? Some say that you feel this because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> too old. <b>Well,</b> I do not feel old yet, so I guess time is {{actually}} accelerating. But days just would never get easier no matter how fast time flies, and I believe all my accomplishments {{during the past five years}} would not have been possible without the unreserved support from all the great people around me. First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor Prof. Anna Swan for all the things she taught me, from carbon nanotubes to everyday life. Since I am the kind of person who likes to put loads of pressure on myself, it is lucky for me to have such a flexible and understanding supervisor like Anna, who would trust me with every challenging task but never push me for the deadlines, and would be supportive of me no matter what decisions I make for my future career...|$|R
6000|$|A {{good friend}} of ours--in fact one of our very best--spoke to me here {{a few days ago}} of your having lately had (all unknown to me) a great tribulation of illness; but also told me, to my lively relief, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> {{steadily}} <b>well</b> again and that (thankful at the worst for small mercies after such an ordeal) <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in some degree accessible to the beguilement and consolation of letters. I have only taken time to wonder whether just such a mercy as this may not be even below the worst--but am letting the question rest on the basis of my feeling that you must never, and that you will never, dream of any [...] "acknowledging" [...] of so inevitable a little sign of sympathy. Such dreams, I too well know, only aggravate and hamper the upward struggle, don't in the least lighten or quicken it. Take absolute example by me--who had a very dismal bad illness {{two and a half years}} ago (from out of the blackness of which I haven't even now wholly emerged,) and who reflect with positive complacency on all my letters, the received ones, of that time, that still, and that largely always will, remain unanswered. I want <b>you</b> to <b>be</b> complacent too--though at this rate there won't <b>be</b> much for <b>you</b> to <b>be</b> so about! I really hope you go on smoothly and serenely--and am glad now that I didn't helplessly know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> so stricken. But I wish I had for you a few solid chunks of digestible (that is, mainly good) news--such as, given your constitutional charity, will melt in your mouth. (There are people for whom only the other sort is digestible.) But I somehow in these subdued days--I speak of my own very personal ones--don't make news; I even rather dread breaking out into it, or having it break into me: it's so much oftener-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may well}} give it up," [...] remarked Mr. MacGlue. [...] "The first words she addressed, sir, {{to the man}} who had dragged her out of the very jaws of death were these: 'How dare you meddle with me? why didn't you leave me to die?' Her exact language--I'll take my Bible oath of it. I was so {{provoked}} that I gave her the change back (as the saying is) in her own coin. 'There's the river handy, ma'am,' I said; 'do it again. I, for one, won't stir a hand to save you; I promise you that.' She looked up sharply. 'Are you the man who took me out of the river?' she said. 'God forbid!' says I. 'I'm only the doctor who was fool enough to meddle with you afterward.' She turned to the landlady. 'Who took me out of the river?' she asked. The landlady told her, and mentioned your name. 'Germaine?' she said to herself; 'I know nobody named Germaine; I wonder whether it was the man who spoke to me on the bridge?' 'Yes,' says the landlady; 'Mr. Germaine said he met you on the bridge.' Hearing that, she took a little time to think; and then she asked if she could see Mr. Germaine. 'Whoever he is,' she says, 'he has risked his life to save me, and I ought to thank him for doing that.' 'You can't thank him tonight,' I said; 'I've got him upstairs between life and death, and I've sent for his mother: wait till to-morrow.' She turned on me, looking half frightened, half angry. 'I can't wait,' she says; 'you don't know what you have done among you in bringing me back to life. I must leave this neighborhood; I must be out of Perthshire to-morrow: when does the first coach southward pass this way?' Having {{nothing to do with the}} first coach southward, I referred her to the people of the inn. My business (now I had done with the lady) was upstairs in this room, to see how <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> on. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> on as <b>well</b> as I could wish, and your mother was at your bedside. I went home to see what sick people might be waiting for me in the regular way. When I came back this morning, there was the foolish landlady with a new tale to tell 'Gone!' says she. 'Who's gone?' says I. 'The lady,' says she, 'by the first coach this morning!'" ...|$|R
