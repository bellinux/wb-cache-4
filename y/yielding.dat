5|$|Around 56% of eggs lead to {{successful}} fledging of young, with fieldwork in northeastern Victoria <b>yielding</b> {{an average of}} 2.77 young leaving the nest. The lace monitor (Varanus varius) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) are nest predators. Baby birds may perish by overheating in very hot weather, or by being drowned in the hollows after heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with {{a slight}} golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon {{oxidation}} in air <b>yielding</b> a dark gray oxide layer. Barium has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium {{is very difficult to}} prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.|$|E
5|$|Barium vapor is {{condensed}} {{and packed}} into molds {{in an atmosphere}} of argon. This method is used commercially, <b>yielding</b> ultrapure barium. Commonly sold barium is about 99% pure, with main impurities being strontium and calcium (up to 0.8% and 0.25%) and other contaminants contributing less than 0.1%.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Richter {{suggested}} that the majority's legalistic approach, while <b>yielding</b> a workable construction of {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act, resulted in a dangerous situation in this case because the Act did not specifically address the situation of stateless persons, and the literal approach did not allow for gaps in the legislation to be filled.|$|E
5|$|Dividing a(x) by b(x) {{yields a}} {{remainder}} r0(x) = x3 + (2/3) x2 + (5/3) x − (2/3). In the next step, b(x) is divided by r0(x) <b>yielding</b> a remainder r1(x) = x2 + x + 2. Finally, dividing r0(x) by r1(x) yields a zero remainder, indicating that r1(x) {{is the greatest}} common divisor polynomial of a(x) and b(x), consistent with their factorization.|$|E
5|$|His second {{first-class}} {{season with}} Middlesex {{was much less}} successful than the first; Kartik took only 16 wickets at 34.06 in seven matches, with a best of 4/101 against Derbyshire. He scored 161 runs at 20.12 with a best of 44 against Warwickshire. His one-day form was also lean, <b>yielding</b> six wickets at 33.00 in six matches.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} animal are kept as pets, the most popular being mammals, {{especially}} dogs and cats. Plants are grown for pleasure in gardens and greenhouses, <b>yielding</b> flowers, shade, and decorative foliage; some, such as cactuses, able to tolerate dry conditions, are grown as houseplants.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{estimates}} from the Voyager program missions suggested that Enceladus was composed {{almost entirely of}} water ice. However, based {{on the effects of}} Enceladus's gravity on Cassini, its mass was determined to be much higher than previously thought, <b>yielding</b> a density of 1.61 g/cm3. This density is higher than Saturn's other mid-sized icy satellites, indicating that Enceladus contains a greater percentage of silicates and iron.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2010 at Miller Park, in a 6-1 {{win over}} the Milwaukee Brewers, Bumgarner earned his first career victory by going eight innings without <b>yielding</b> a run. Bumgarner pitched well enough that when Wellemeyer {{returned}} from the disabled list in August, Giants' manager Bruce Bochy chose to use him in the bullpen and leave Bumgarner in the rotation.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent work by Har Gobind Khorana {{identified}} {{the rest of}} the genetic code. Shortly thereafter, Robert W. Holley determined the structure of transfer RNA (tRNA), the adapter molecule that facilitates the process of translating RNA into protein. This work was based upon Ochoa's earlier studies, <b>yielding</b> the latter the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for work on the enzymology of RNA synthesis.|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} can {{be generalized}} to regular polygons with an odd number of sides, <b>yielding</b> a Reuleaux polygon. These are the only curves of constant width whose boundaries are formed by finitely many circular arcs of equal length.|$|E
5|$|The {{aquifers}} of shallow wells with depths varying from , <b>yielding</b> {{little more}} than 2 cubic metres/hour (71 cu ft), vary widely in availability. Deeper aquifers offer larger quantities of water, but its quality is generally brackish. The wadis are generally dry, usually only inundated after rainfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of the metals itself is difficult due to their reactivity. The formation of oxides, nitrides and carbides must be avoided to yield workable metals; this is normally achieved by the Kroll process. The oxides (MO2) are reacted with coal and chlorine to form the chlorides (MCl4). The chlorides of the metals are then reacted with magnesium, <b>yielding</b> magnesium chloride and the metals.|$|E
5|$|The substem {{preceding}} the stem denoted the animal {{from which the}} antibody was obtained. The first monoclonal antibodies were produced in mice (substem -o-, <b>yielding</b> the ending -omab; usually Mus musculus, the house mouse) or other non-human organisms. Neither INN nor USAN has ever been requested for antibodies from rats (theoretically -a-), hamsters (-e-) and primates (-i-).|$|E

As of 30 April 2012, Queen's endowment was valued at C$584.4 million.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{suggests that}} the best solvent for the uranium carbonate processing {{is a mixture of}} carbonate with bicarbonate. At high pH, this results in precipitation of diuranate, which is treated with hydrogen in the presence of nickel <b>yielding</b> an insoluble uranium tetracarbonate.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium traces in diesel fuels are {{the main}} fuel {{component}} in high temperature corrosion. During combustion, vanadium oxidizes and reacts with sodium and sulfur, <b>yielding</b> vanadate compounds with melting points as low as 530°C, which attack the passivation layer on steel and render it susceptible to corrosion. The solid vanadium compounds also abrade engine components.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in this {{chain is}} calc-alkaline, <b>yielding</b> both andesite, dacite, and rhyolite. Three million years ago, {{a change in}} the {{chemistry}} of volcanism occurred, with an increased content of potassium in the rocks. This change in composition geographically coincided with the volcanic activity crossing a lineament known as the Trotus line.|$|E
5|$|Well-explored deposits, {{potentially}} classifiable as reserves, {{include the}} Green River deposits {{in the western}} United States, the Tertiary deposits in Queensland, Australia, deposits in Sweden and Estonia, the El-Lajjun deposit in Jordan, and deposits in France, Germany, Brazil, China, southern Mongolia and Russia. These deposits {{have given rise to}} expectations of <b>yielding</b> at least 40liters of shale oil per tonne of oil shale, using the Fischer Assay.|$|E
5|$|When modern {{medicine}} has identified a drug in a medicinal plant, commercial quantities {{of the drug}} may either be synthesised or extracted from plant material, <b>yielding</b> a pure chemical. Extraction can be practical when the compound in question is complex.|$|E
5|$|After it is dissolved, osmium is {{separated}} from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide. The first method {{is similar to the}} procedure used by Tennant and Wollaston. Both methods are suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, <b>yielding</b> the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques.|$|E
5|$|All {{five seasons}} of Friday Night Lights were filmed in Austin and Pflugerville. With the show <b>yielding</b> roughly $33 {{million a year}} in revenue, other states courted the {{production}} company after the state of Texas failed to pay all the rebates it had promised to the show's producers. The Texas legislature authorized funding to match the offers of other states, and the production company preferred to stay near Austin, so the show remained in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, <b>yielding</b> quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased {{by the presence of}} ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E
5|$|At Theobald's request, Pope Gregory urged Alice {{to come to}} Rome, {{because the}} {{legitimacy}} of her parents' marriage was to be investigated. Alice refused {{to appear before the}} papal tribunal, but renounced her claim to Champagne and Brie for 40,000 livres tournois and estates <b>yielding</b> a yearly income of 2,000 livres in September 1234. In the agreement with Theobald, she also stated that she would not erect fortresses in her estates in Champagne.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Hogan {{had begun}} to lose the trustees' support. At some point soon thereafter, he left the city. In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell {{partially}} capitulated to the trustees, <b>yielding</b> to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments. In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.|$|E
5|$|Dugan's {{original}} 1974 patent {{expired in}} 1991, and the Dugan Speech System patent in 1993. Other manufacturers began to sell automixers incorporating the Dugan algorithm. In 1996, Dugan produced the Model D-1, an automixer for speech-only applications. The Model D-2 returned to having applicability for both speech and music, {{as did the}} Model D-3. In 1997, Dugan licensed his system to Protech Audio of Indian Lake, New York, <b>yielding</b> the Protech 2000 model series.|$|E
5|$|Having {{discovered}} the planet, the astronomers worked {{to discover a}} transit event using the Infrared Array Camera of the Spitzer Space Telescope, as ground-based observations could prove difficult if Gliese 3634 b was a rocky planet. While the observations did not suggest that Gliese 3634 b transited its star, a few orbital parameters were discovered, <b>yielding</b> the planet's true mass, which cannot be collected solely by radial velocity measurements.|$|E
5|$|His 1936–37 {{season was}} {{interrupted}} by injury and he appeared in only the Third and Fourth Tests against England. They were relatively unsuccessful, <b>yielding</b> only 95 runs at 23.75 in four innings without passing fifty. Nevertheless, Australia won the two matches. His debut season for Queensland was moderately successful, with 557 runs {{at an average of}} 37.13, including one century and four fifties. Brown did not taste victory with his home state during the season; the closest Queensland came was a one-wicket loss to New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|In early 2003, {{the first}} {{results of the}} Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) were released, <b>yielding</b> what were {{at the time the}} most {{accurate}} values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific cosmic inflation models, but are consistent with the inflation theory in general. The Planck space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based cosmic microwave background experiments are ongoing.|$|E
