500|$|Coppola's {{first three}} films examine {{feminine}} self-definition and maturation, usually in privileged circumstance. Lost in Translation (2003) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel; Marie Antoinette (2006), a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen, examined her loneliness. Somewhere examines similar themes {{of success and}} isolation, but from a male perspective. The film explores Marco's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame. He appears to suffer from anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes. [...] "He believes he's nothing", summarized film critic Roger Ebert, [...] "and it appears he's correct". The film's opening shot, a Ferrari circling a race-track {{in and out of}} a stationary camera position, its whine and roar rising and falling, establishes the theme of ennui. The sequence's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax, observe and withhold expectations. Coppola said she wanted to hint at this with a simple camera set-up, [...] "so you're alone with this guy and not aware that it's a movie. But I hope it's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out there. Something that gives <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to take a breath".|$|E
500|$|Kat George of VH1 gave a {{positive}} review for the album, describing the scenes as [...] "moving, inspirational and infectious" [...] while also calling them [...] "immaculately produced." [...] She further wrote that [...] "Tight and succinct, there's no filler in the Live At Roseland DVD — it's high {{energy from the}} beginning to the end, and doesn't give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to lag or lose interest." [...] George went on to describe the album as [...] "intimate", which according to her gives [...] "the magic of Beyoncé — even when she's speaking to the masses, she's really speaking to you, and you alone." [...] She finished her review saying that the album gives a personal evening with Beyoncé along with [...] "absolute grace and ultimate humility." [...] Sian-Pierre Regis of MTV described the album as a [...] "glitzy doc-style flick" [...] and noted that Beyoncé shows her [...] "softer" [...] side while also calling her a [...] "gift that keeps on giving." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Melissa Maerz wrote that [...] "According to... DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4... finds Beyoncé telling her life story through her songs... has done a whole lot of amazing things in her life." [...] Gordon Smart of The Sun praised the romance between Beyoncé and Jay-Z during the DVD, noting that it was interesting to see Beyoncé talking about her love life because she has always kept her private life in secret. J. J. Anisiobi and Donna Mcconnell of Daily Mail praised the fact that the DVD shows Beyoncé [...] "from eager five-year-old music fan to a consummate entertainer".|$|E
2500|$|Following the killing, Harambe became {{subject of}} {{multiple}} viral memes. Vox wrote in November that Harambe has an [...] "undeniable status as 2016’s meme of the year." [...] As People magazine wrote: [...] "Harambe continues {{to live on}} in the collective mind of the internet, entering into a rarefied state of venerated meme status." [...] One of the most widespread memes was noted by The Washington Post and New York magazine who observed a proliferation of over-the-top and fake tributes to Harambe. [...] "The idea is, the more intense and more sincere-seeming the expression of mourning is, the funnier the joke." [...] For example, the [...] "Dicks out for Harambe" [...] meme {{can be seen as}} a fake tribute to an incident that would normally engender sincere mourning. As Aja Romano of Vox wrote, [...] "If you were a progressive, the Harambe meme gave <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to mock what you viewed as the hypocritical haranguing of the mainstream while avoiding real issues of social justice; and if you were a conservative, the Harambe meme gave <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to mock liberal hysteria." [...] One meme is a play on conspiracy theories, such as [...] "Bush did Harambe", a reference to the 9/11 conspiracy theories. In Australia, people joked about supporting Harambe's corpse as a write-in candidate on the ballot for the federal election. Public Policy Polling included Harambe in their polling for the U.S. presidential election. The dead gorilla had 5% support in late July 2016 (ahead of Green Party nominee Jill Stein) and 2% in August 2016 (tied with Stein).|$|E

2500|$|By 643, when Emperor Taizong deposed {{his eldest}} son and crown prince Li Chengqian (over Li Chengqian's {{plotting}} to overthrow him) and replaced him with Li Zhi, Zhang was the assistant minister of justice. Emperor Taizong, when selecting staff members for Li Zhi, selected Zhang as an assistant head of the crown prince's household. In 645, during Emperor Taizong's campaign against Goguryeo, Emperor Taizong left Li Zhi at Zhang's home, Ding Prefecture, {{to be in charge}} of logistics, assisted by a number of officials led by the chancellor Gao Shilian, and Zhang was a member of Li Zhi's staff there. Li Zhi told Zhang, [...] "This gives <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to return home in honor." [...] He also gave Zhang supplies to allow him to worship his ancestors, and Zhang took this opportunity to recommend a number of scholars from his home, and while Li Zhi rejected making them officials (on the account that they were too old in age), he gave them rewards. After Emperor Taizong returned to the capital Chang'an after the Goguryeo campaign, he had Zhang serve as surveyor of the Henan region, and after that tour made him the acting assistant head of the executive bureau of government.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{were divided}} on their {{opinions}} of MicroBots gameplay mechanics. [...] IGN's Kristine Steimer {{felt that the}} levels were sometimes imbalanced, and that boss fights were occasionally [...] "a pain in the ass". [...] Steimer did note that the inclusion of puzzle elements were [...] "refreshing". [...] The reviewer from Edge felt that the game's procedurally generated level design did not deliver the desired effect of randomized gameplay. [...] They stated that [...] "the absence of a human touch is keenly felt." [...] The reviewer did note the welcome addition of local cooperative multiplayer. [...] Jason Jasicki, reviewer for Machinima.com also appreciated to addition of cooperative gameplay; he further gave high remarks for the game's [...] "tight controls and customizability." [...] GameSpot's Chris Watters was more critical of gameplay; he called the action [...] "rarely exciting" [...] and [...] "simplistic". [...] Chris Buffa of RunDLC felt that the gameplay did not provide enough new and fresh features to differentiate it from other twin-stick shooters, but praised the addition of cooperative gameplay. [...] He noted that two player cooperative [...] "gives <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to strategize with a friend." [...] Marko Djordjevic of GameFocus criticized {{the pace of the}} levels, but praised the level of customization [...] GameZone's Dakota Grabowski expressed disappointment in the fact online play was omitted, but conceded that local cooperative play that allows the second player to join or leave the game at any time was a welcome addition.|$|E
