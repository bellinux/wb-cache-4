40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the costs and}} determinants of international capital raising for a sample of 427 straight public debt issues made by non-U. S. firms in the U. S. (Yankee) and Eurodollar markets. We model the joint determination of market choice and interest costs using a switching regression model with endogenous switching. We find that firms issue bonds in the highly regulated U. S. market when the estimated interest cost is low relative to the Eurodollar market. Firms issuing <b>Yankee</b> <b>bonds</b> {{are more likely to}} be located in countries that require transparent accounting standards, protect creditor rights, and have strong traditions of law and order. Further, we find that investors are willing to pay higher prices for <b>Yankee</b> <b>bonds</b> issued by firms that have previously met U. S. registration and reporting requirements. Our analysis provides new insights into why foreign firms choose a particular market to raise debt capital, and how relative interest costs, disclosure requirements, creditor protections, and contract characteristics drive the decision.

50|$|Risk of <b>Yankee</b> <b>bond</b> can {{represent}} a win-win opportunity for both issuers and investors. According to Bell (2011), the higher credit risk, {{the higher the}} yield bonds, this reflects on the <b>Yankee</b> <b>bond</b> risk. Yankee Bonds frequently offer higher yields for United State investor compare with the yields that available on comparable, or even lower-rated of bond issues from U.S. issuers. The foreign investors facing credit risk and rate risk, {{due to the fact}} that exchange rates can change quickly and dramatically. Hence, affects the total return for non-United State investors. Yankee bonds avoid from currency risk by using the method issued in dollars.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, {{there is}} a new type bond that has emerge in the {{worldwide}} market called, Reverse <b>Yankee</b> <b>Bond.</b> In general, the Reverse <b>Yankee</b> <b>Bond</b> is a type of bond that has been issued by the US Company, mostly in higher grade outside the US, and its currency been denominated other than the US dollars. This bond is governed by Securities Act of 1933 which later on being registered under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reason why Reverse <b>Yankee</b> <b>Bond</b> is being exist is because US companies have issued a record €45 billion of euro-denominated bonds by taking the advantage of low pricing relative dollars and Europe’s increasing accessibility to international borrowers. The Trump administration has made clear its aim to change the regulatory landscape for businesses, and if the rumoured end to the tax-deductibility of interest expense on debt becomes reality, it would likely lead to further expansion of the reverse-Yankee market. Why? American firms would be incentivized to issue bonds offshore {{in much the same way}} that many currently try to book profits overseas, in order to minimize the tax burden on their onshore profits. There are also three further growth that drives this type of bonds: Globalisation, Currency Volatility and issuing euro-denominated debt.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{mandatory}} risk disclosure {{on the design of}} foreign bank debt. The Basel II and III Accords require the public disclosure of bank regulatory information under the Pillar 3 or market discipline framework. The new information details bank risk exposures and management strategies, capital adequacy and remuneration practices to enhance market discipline through transparency. We target foreign issuers of US (“Yankee”) to test whether banks domiciled in Pillar 3 regimes increase debt raising in an overseas market and face reduced demand from investors for covenants. Pillar 3 reporting reduces the propensity of banks to raise debt capital abroad, a finding that is attenuated when the banks are domiciled in countries with superior creditor rights protections. Pillar 3  reporting increases the imposition of covenants in <b>Yankee</b> <b>bonds,</b> particularly for banks domiciled in countries with weaker debt law enforcement standards and stronger shareholder rights...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine how}} country-level legal and {{institutional}} differences in creditor and shareholder rights shape {{the use of}} bond covenants. Using comprehensive debt covenant information for a sample of <b>Yankee</b> <b>bonds</b> issued by firms from more than 50 countries, we find that bond contracts for firms incorporated in countries with stronger creditor rights use fewer restrictive covenants. This finding suggests that creditor rights laws substitute for debt covenants in reducing the agency cost of debt. On the other hand, bond contracts for firms incorporated in legal regimes with stronger shareholder rights include more covenants, suggesting that greater shareholder rights may actually increase the shareholder-bondholder agency conflict. These results are robust to alternative measures of creditor rights and shareholder rights. We also document that stronger firm-level corporate governance is positively related {{to the use of}} restrictive covenants even after controlling for country institutions.

40|$|Many {{official}} {{groups have}} endorsed the wider use by emerging market borrowers of contract clauses which {{allow for a}} qualified majority of bondholders to restructure repayment terms {{in the event of}} financial distress. Some have argued that such clauses will be associated with moral hazard and increased borrowing costs. This paper addresses this question empirically using primary and secondary market yields and finds no evidence that the presence of collective action clauses increases yields for either higher- or lower-rated issuers. By implication, the perceived benefits from easier restructuring are at least as large as any costs from increased moral hazard.

5000|$|If {{current rates}} {{in a foreign}} company’s own country are higher than the {{comparable}} bond rates in the United States, investors are able to obtain financing capital at a lower cost. <b>Yankee</b> <b>bond</b> was issued by a non-United State entity in the United State market. Thus, when the size of United State bond market increase and more actively trade by United State investors, it will bring more return to the issuers. Besides, Yankee bonds have few potential advantages for foreign firms seeking to raise new capital.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Yankee</b> <b>Bond</b> is a bond {{issued by}} a foreign entity, such as a bank or company, but is issued and traded in the United States and {{denominated}} in U.S. dollars. For instance, Company ABC is headquartered in France. If Company ABC issues bonds in the United States that are denominated in U.S. dollars, the bonds are Yankee bonds. Yankee bonds are normally issued in tranches, a large debt structure financing arrangement {{into a lot of}} portion, each portions have different level of risk, interest rates and maturities, and the value of investment grouping might be extremely high, as much as $1 billion. U.S. investors buy Yankee bonds to branch out into overseas markets. Yankee bonds are same with other bonds which will require the borrower to pay a certain interest rate and principal amount according to the terms of the indenture. Yankee Bonds are administered by the Securities Act of 1933. A non-American company will sell bonds in United States to raise capital from American investors. Therefore, the issuers from non-American company have to register Yankee Bonds with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before offer the bond for sale. Hence, U.S. investors can purchase the securities that issued by foreign entity without worried about the price fluctuation that affected by the changes in currency exchange rates. <b>Yankee</b> <b>bond</b> prices are mostly influenced by the variations of interest rates in U.S. and the financial condition of the issuer.|$|E
50|$|Reverse <b>Yankee</b> <b>Bond</b> {{enters into}} European market by foreign issuers, which has emerged {{for the current}} year in spite of prosaic name. This is because United State (US) {{organizations}} are offering a large and traded into Euro- denominated bonds to reflect diverging monetary policy {{on either side of}} the Atlantic. Besides, US bonds yields sitting well over those in the Euro zone, a large number of blue-chip organizations have sold Reverse Yankees bonds to lock in lower borrowing costs. According to (Merkle, 2016), in year 2015 and year 2016 US based issuers issued record volume of Reserve Yankee Bonds to take benefit of low yields in Europe and the disadvantages of the euro. In 2015, United State (US) was the biggest source of issuers in the Euro bond market and as indicated by Dealogic, U.S. backers had represented 23% of all euro-designated bond issues in 2016.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between capital structure, managerial equity ownership, corporate governance, and firm value in firms suspected of having ‘extreme’ agency problems. Overall, we find that leverage {{plays a role in}} mitigating the problems that result from the separation of control rights from cash flow rights and a lack of corporate governance. Our results also suggest the wealth effect of leverage is confined to specific forms of debt capital and depends upon key firm- and market-specific characteristics. We find that firms headquartered in emerging markets experience average positive abnormal returns of 68 basis points during renewal or reissue of internationally-syndicated term loans. With the exception of initial Eurobond issues, no other form of debt capital, including domestic <b>bonds</b> or <b>Yankee</b> <b>bonds,</b> creates value for outside shareholders of these firms. Moreover, the wealth effect of syndicated term loans is confined to those firms in which management undertakes large ‘discretionary’ expenditures and has levered their cash flow rights into larger control rights through indirect holdings (i. e. pyramids). Finally, our research suggests that cross-sectional studies can lead to false inferences when testing theories tha...|$|R

This study includes two parts: an empirical analysis of macroeconomic {{risks associated with}} infrastructure booms, and {{a case study of}} four emerging economies about their practice of funding infrastructure development. The study shows that (i) there is no empirical evidence that rapid infrastructure growth would undermine contemporary macroeconomic performance, implying that room is created to accommodate infrastructure booms without compromising fiscal and external sustainability; (ii) banks may {{play an important role in}} financing infrastructure, but caution is needed to avoid directed lending and regulatory forbearance that the authorities may use to promote financing; (iii) capital market development is important to accommodate the usually high financing needs, and encouraging private investors to move into infrastructure would require regulatory and institutional improvements; and (iv) public support, including credit guarantees, may help bolster investors'' confidence, but the authorities should carefully monitor and manage fiscal risks.
