40|$|The article {{describes}} the remedy for a misalignment of <b>Y-joint</b> in hemispherical and torispherical heads of the bilobe cargo tank on a Liquefi ed Petroleum Gas Carrier. The misalignment {{is the result of}} connecting relatively thin shells and production diffi culties. The measured rather large shell eccentricity in the <b>Y-joint</b> causes bending moment, which cannot be withstood by shells designed as membrane, and therefore it has to be controlled. The remedy of misalignment is achieved by reinforcement of the <b>Y-joint</b> with inside and outside bars and knees. In this way stress concentration determined by the FEM analysis is reduced within the allowable stress given for secondary stress level...|$|E
40|$|The Composite Cryotank Technology Demonstration (CCTD) project under NASA's Game Changing Development Program (GCDP) {{developed}} space technologies using {{advanced composite}} materials. Under CCTD, NASA funded the Boeing Company {{to design and}} test a number of element-level joint specimens as a precursor to a 2. 4 -m diameter composite cryotank. Preliminary analyses indicated that the <b>y-joint</b> in the cryotank had low margins of safety; hence the <b>y-joint</b> {{was considered to be}} a critical design region. The <b>y-joint</b> design includes a softening strip wedge to reduce localized shear stresses at the skirt/dome interface. In this paper, NASA-developed analytical models will be correlated with the experimental results of a series of positive-peel <b>y-joint</b> specimens from Boeing tests. Initial analytical models over-predicted the experimental strain gage readings in the far-field region by approximately 10 %. The over-prediction was attributed to uncertainty in the elastic properties of the laminate and a mismatch between the thermal expansion of the strain gages and the laminate. The elastic properties of the analytical model were adjusted to account for the strain gage differences. The experimental strain gages also indicated a large non-linear effect in the softening strip region that was not predicted by the analytical model. This non-linear effect was attributed to delamination initiating in the softening strip region at below 20 % of the failure load for the specimen. Because the specimen was contained in a thermally insulated box during cryogenic testing to failure, delamination initiation and progression was not visualized during the test. Several possible failure initiation locations were investigated, and a most likely failure scenario was determined that correlated well with the experimental data. The most likely failure scenario corresponded to damage initiating in the softening strip and delamination extending to the grips at final failure...|$|E
40|$|Tube {{hydroforming}} (THF) is {{a technology}} that guarantees a high final part quality and low manufacturing time and costs with respect to traditional manufacturing processes. In particular it receives much interests in complex shape tubular components forming {{such as in the}} automotive industry. The process consists of a tube placed in a die and filled with a pressurized media which expands the tube till it reaches the desired geometry. The material formability is influenced by the high friction acting between the pressurized tube and the die which does not allow enough material flowing during the process. In the present work, a <b>Y-joint</b> hydroforming FEM model was developed on the base of previously conducted experiments to study the effects of asymmetric friction conditions in the tube feeding zones. The model was validated and then used to study the process. In particular, it was used to simulate a <b>Y-Joint</b> hydroforming process using a full shaped die and evaluating the improvement on the process when asymmetric feeding lengths are adopted...|$|E
40|$|The {{variability}} in fatigue life estimates for welded pipe joints {{commonly found in}} overhead transportation sign support structures has not been characterized to the level necessary for generating accurate fatigue life predictions for these structures. Cracking found in existing sign support structures demands that this variability be quantified to understand the impetus for these cracks. The primary goal of this thesis was to quantify the {{variability in}} the fatigue life of welded round HSS <b>Y-joints.</b> This thesis includes an intensive study on the fatigue life variability of HSS <b>Y-joints</b> in steel and aluminum structures. It also includes a detailed discussion with illustration of experimental fixturing, specimen fabrication, material characteristics, statistical analysis of fatigue testing results, a comparison of experimental failures to typical transportation sign support structure failures, and current design equations for fatigue life prediction. Observations made during the experimental effort illustrate the importance of material selection in the fatigue life of HSS <b>Y-joints.</b> All fabrication of components, besides the test specimens, and testing, besides metal composition tests wer...|$|R

With this method the fatigue resistance could be increased significantly. Furthermore, tubular joints of tripod structures for offshore wind energy converters are analysed with numerical simulations to judge these welded joints with the hot-spot-concept. The stress concentration factor for the treated weld toe geometry was determined numerically and compared to experimental results. ...|$|R
40|$|A fatigue {{analysis}} gives {{an answer to}} the question of whether a structure will resist fatigue throughout its lifetime or not. The hot spot stress approach is one of the methods used to find the solution, by looking at points around the circumference of a weld, and finding the stress values at these points. This master thesis investigates {{fatigue analysis}} using the hot spot stress approach, through a sensitivity analysis By changing what parameters and methods the fatigue analysis uses, several fatigue damage values are calculated for each joint. The design chosen for the study is a single support structure for an offshore wind turbine (OWT) the UpWind reference jacket from Phase I of the Offshore Code Comparison Collaboration Continuation (OC 4) project. [5] The jacket structure supports the NREL 5 -MW reference wind turbine. [6] It consist of K-joints, X-joints and <b>Y-joints.</b> With fatigue damage being the design driving factor, the method for estimating fatigue damage may necessitate different design in the structure. [12] That means that different fatigue damage estimations may result in different costs and a more reliable structure. As anything can be safe and reliable if you just overspend and over-design it, an ideal fatigue analysis can give reliable results, without being too conservative. During the master work, an application was developed in the. NET Framework to work in conjuncture with FEDEM WindPower, a simulation program used for wind turbine systems. The developed application performs all extractions and calculations needed for estimating the fatigue damage using the hot spot stress method. The HSSs calculated are linearly extrapolated structural hot spot stress, with the nominal stress in the chord included for the HSSs on the chord side of the weld. The application performs the fatigue damage estimations using several procedures of the hot spot stress approach. This leads to several fatigue damage values for each joint, giving the basis for the sensitivity analysis concerning the hot spot stress approach. Common for all variations in the options, are the load simulations and the usage of hot spot stress approach, rainflow counting, S-N curve and Palmgren-Miner rule. This is all explained in chapter 2. They also have in common general fixity conditions, chord-end fixity parameter equal to 0. 7, and for the joints with two braces, loads occur in both. The variations consist of the L parameter used in the SCF equations, the order in which maximum fatigue damage concerning one hot spot was kept while the others were excluded, the total number of hot spots around the circumference of the weld, and the choice regarding which equations to use for the SCFs at the crown for axial load. For the choice of equations to use for the SCFs, one can choose between solely geometrical SCFs, and SCFs including nominal stress. Here, both options are used. Only <b>Y-joints</b> are affected by changes in the L parameter after a certain limit, but until this limit is reached it affects all joints. This is because <b>Y-joints</b> are the only ones, regarding the structure analysed and the choices made in this thesis, that have SCFs containing L. K-joints are those joints that are most affected by which order one chooses to keep the maximum value amongst the hot spots. This indicates that the spot most prone to fatigue damage varies more within the K-joints than in the other two joint types. X-joints and K-joints are equally affected by the number of hot spot one uses. Increasing the number of hot spots from 8 to 16 can for several joints give an increase ratio equal to 16 %, the ratio being the fatigue damage estimated using 16 hot spots divided by the fatigue damage estimated using 8 hot spots. Increasing the number of hot spots either gives the same value or a higher value, because increasing the number of hot spots indicates adding hot spots in between the existing ones. The optional SCFs at the crown for axial load are only evaluated for <b>Y-joints.</b> The equations containing nominal stress shows, for most of the joints, much lower fatigue damage estimations than the solely geometrical ones, for L values at 7 and higher. The limited selection of parameters, due to limited amount of time, results in a sensitivity analysis that is not sufficient to come up with a final, clear answer regarding the ultimate fatigue analysis. This thesis is therefore intended to be used, with the developed application, as the basis for a larger sensitivity analysis that could provide further knowledge on the preferable procedure concerning fatigue analysis using the hot spot stress approach. This master thesis has been performed in cooperation with Fedem Technology AS in Trondheim. The app development was assisted by Fedem Technology AS representatives Ole-Ivar Holte, Runar Heggelien Refsnæs and Daniel Zwick. Inge Lotsberg at DNV GL AS has contributed concerning the fatigue analysis, as has Sebastian Schafhirt, who has also helped in relation to the research method.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} cryogenic <b>Y-joint</b> {{testing at}} Langley Research Center (LaRC) {{to validate the}} performance of optical fiber Bragg grating strain sensors for measuring strain at liquid helium temperature (- 240 C). This testing also verified survivability of fiber sensors after experiencing 10 thermal cool-down, warm-up cycles and 400 limit load cycles. Graphite composite skins bonded to a honeycomb substrate in a sandwich configuration comprised the <b>Y-joint</b> specimens. To enable SHM of composite cryotanks for consideration to future spacecraft, a light-weight, durable monitoring technology is needed. The fiber optic distributed Bragg grating strain sensing system developed at LaRC is a viable substitute for conventional strain gauges which are not practical for SHM. This distributed sensing technology uses an Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometer (OFDR). This measurement approach has the advantage that it can measure hundreds of Bragg grating sensors per fiber and the sensors are all written at one frequency, greatly simplifying fiber manufacturing. Fiber optic strain measurements compared well to conventional strain gauge measurements obtained during these tests. These results demonstrated a high potential for a successful implementation of a SHM system incorporating LaRC's fiber optic sensing system on the composite cryotank and other future cryogenic applications...|$|E
40|$|The most {{commonly}} used method for non-destructive testing (NDT) of welded tubulars in underwater locations is magnetic particle inspection (MPI). This method is effective in terms of crack or defect detection, but requires much diver effort. This work examines the use of Hall effect probes for crack detection and measurement in steel specimens and underwater pipelines and structures. A simple theory of magnetic leakage fields is developed, and how such fields relate to crack characteristics. The finite sizes of the Hall probes employed are taken into account, and an analytic expression for the field from a tapered crack is developed. Practical magnetic signals from a cracked Y-jointed tubular are taken, and shown {{to be consistent with}} MPI indications. A double probe system is proposed which enables crack depth measurement to be made irrespective of a knowledge of the crack width or level of magnetisation in the specimen. Experiments using a prototype double probe system show encouraging results on artificial cracks in small specimens, though there is a troubling unknown background bias effect in the measured signals. An instrument using a time differentiated probe signal has been developed which is capable of detecting a crack in a <b>Y-joint</b> at a scan height of up to 5 mm with a level of magnetisation rather less than that used by MPI. A method of continuously monitoring a crack in a <b>Y-joint</b> is also described, using multiple differential pairs of probes. The method is found to give indications consistent and comparable with MPI...|$|E
40|$|Residual {{stress state}} in planar tubular K-joints, in the chord within the gap region {{between the two}} braces, is studied using {{numerical}} weld modelling. The motivation comes from past full-scale fatigue tests on tubular trusses made of various steel grades with sizes typical of bridge trusses, which shows that the cracking occurs at the hot spots located in this region. Residual stress field characterization is {{needed in order to}} assess its role in fatigue cracking, especially for the case of cracks occurring on the compression brace side. Comparison between residual stress field in a <b>Y-joint</b> and a K-joint is made to assess the significance of restraining effect in the gap region. Phase transformations during welding and cooling down are determined and their impact on the final residual stress state is evaluated. Computed residual stresses are compared to the neutron diffraction measurements. Transient thermal field and cooling times substantially affect phase transformations. Therefore, their accurate reproduction in the analysis is important...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} through {{thickness}} transverse residual stress distribution measurements {{in a number}} of components, manufactured from a range of steels, has been carried out. Residual stresses introduced by welding and mechanical deformation have been considered. The geometries consisted of welded T-plate joints, pipe butt joints, tube-on-plate joints, tubular <b>Y-joints</b> and tubular T-joints as well as cold bent tubes and repair welds. In addition, the collected data cover a range of engineering steels including ferritic, austenitic, C-Mn and Cr-Mo steels. The methods used to measure the residual stresses also varied. These included neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction and deep hole drilling techniques. Measured residual stress data, normalised by their respective yield stress have shown an inverse linear correlation versus the normalised depth of the region containing the residual stress (up to 0. 5 of the component thickness). A simplified generic residual stress profile based on a linear fit to the data is proposed for the case of a transverse residual tensile stress field. Whereas the profiles in assessment procedures are case specific the proposed linear profile can be varied to produce a combination of membrane and bending stress distributions to give lower or higher levels of conservatism on stress intensity factors, depending on the amount of case specific data available or the degree of safety required...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the analytical and experimental investigation of fatigue behaviour of monopod tubular joints in air and cold seawater environments. A total of seven joints were tested under cyclic loading. Two specimens - one in air and the other in water - were subjected to pseudo-random loadings. The remaining five specimens - two in air and three in seawater - were tested under constant amplitude sinusoidal loadings. The joints were tested both in as-welded and weld tow ground conditions. The corrosion tests were carried out in natural seawater at 0 °C to simulate the cold ocean environment. [...] From the measured strains during static loading at critical hot spot locations, strain and stress concentration factors were determined and compared with the finite element analysis. The MSC/NASTRAN finite element computer code was used using triangular and quadrilateral flat shell elements. Each element has five degrees of freedom consisting of two in-plane displacements, a normal displacement and bending rotations. [...] The effect of seawater, weld toe grinding, the nature of applied loads and crack growth characteristics are studied in detail. The fatigue lives of the joints for crack initiation, propagation and final failure are determined and compared with those of T or <b>Y-joints</b> from the published literature. For the three joints tested in seawater, the fatigue life for wall penetration are compared with the analytical life estimation using fracture mechanics approach. The fatigue results of all the joints tested are compared with the relevant U. K. DD 55 Q and AWS-XX S-N curves...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of fixed steel offshore platforms {{around the world}} reveal a global fleet that has exceeded or is approaching {{the end of the}} design life. In many operating areas, there is an attraction to continue using these aging facilities due to continued production or as an adjoining structure to facilitate a new field development or expansion. To justify continued life extension of the fixed platform, various integrity assessment techniques are often used. One of the major techniques incorporated is the phenomena of Local Joint Flexibility (LJF). The derivations of existing LJF equations have evolved in many ways, including use of finite element methods to predict the joint behaviour. There has been insufficient credible benchmarking to large scale experimental test data. In the early 1980 s, AMOCO performed the only large scale test results of LJF which, prior to this research, has not been in the public domain. A major objective of this research is to develop a suite of improved LJF equations that have been appropriately benchmarked to large scale tests. In addition, with the issue of the API RP 2 SIM (2014) 1 st Edition and the development of the ISO 19901 - 09 SIM (DIS), this research also provides a basis for further Asset Life Extension (ALE) of an aging fixed offshore platform in terms of ultimate strength by using an improved suite of LJF equations. Furthermore, the research puts the structural assessments such as LJF {{in the context of a}} structural integrity management framework, which enables operators to manage their facilities holistically rather than isolated processes. The research within this thesis critically examined the suitability of the existing LJF equations, reviewed the guidance provided in the existing studies and described their limitations for gapped K-type tubular joints. A comparison study and benchmarking study demonstrated that a proposed finite element model provides a good fit with large scale experimental data (AMOCO) and was used to develop a suite of improved LJF equations for gapped K-type tubular joints. The LJF equations derived from this research were validated against the BOMEL large scale structural frame tests in terms of ultimate strength and demonstrated an improvement on the current MSL- 1 SO equations for uni-planar K-type tubular joints in the ISO 19902. 2007 Fixed Offshore Structures code of practice. This research also provides a basis to update current offshore structures codes and standards for uni-planar gapped K-joints and also provide a standardized methodology for the derivation of LJFs from credible large scale test data for other tubular joint configurations including multiplanar K-joints, T-joints, <b>Y-joints</b> and X-joints. The LJF equations developed in this research will have high impact in terms of the structural integrity management of fixed offshore structures for OGPs globally, as they provide an improvement to the current MSL-ISO joint equations, for gapped uni-planar joints. Offshore structures are now able to operate more safely without compromising structural integrity and incurring costly underwater repairs and inspections as before. OGPs are now able to prioritize limited resources to other areas of concerns based on ALARP principles...|$|R

The project involved the design, analysis, fabrication, {{and testing of}} large-scale (2. 4 -m-diameter precursor and 5. 5 -m-diameter) composite cryotanks. Design features included a one-piece wall design that minimized tank weight, a <b>Y-joint</b> that incorporated an engineered material to alleviate stress concentration under combined loading, and a fluted core cylindrical section that inherently allows for venting and purging. The tanks used out-of-autoclave (OoA) cured graphite/epoxy material and processes to enable large (up to 10 -m-diameter) cryotank fabrication, and thin-ply prepreg to minimize hydrogen permeation through tank walls. Both tanks were fabricated at Boeing using automated fiber placement on breakdown tooling. A fluted core skirt that efficiently carried axial loads and enabled hydrogen purging was included on the 5. 5 -m-diameter tank. Ultrasonic inspection was performed, and a structural health monitoring system was installed to identify any impact damage during ground processing. The precursor and 5. 5 -m-diameter tanks were tested in custom test fixtures at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Marshall Space Flight Center. The testing, which consisted of a sequence of pressure and thermal cycles using liquid hydrogen, was successfully concluded and obtained valuable structural, thermal, and permeation performance data.
