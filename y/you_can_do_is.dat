25|$|The news of {{the victory}} was {{received}} in Britain with the warmest enthusiasm. It was the first certain sign that the mutinies of the summer had not destroyed {{the power and the}} prestige of the Royal Navy. Duncan was at once (21 October) raised to the peerage as Viscount Duncan, of Camperdown, and Baron Duncan, of Lundie in the Shire of Perth (with which came the lands now known as Camperdown Park in Dundee), and there was a strong feeling that the reward was inadequate. Even as early as 18 October his aunt, Lady Mary Duncan, wrote to Henry Dundas, at that time secretary of state for war: Report says my nephew is only made a Viscount. Myself it is nothing, but the whole nation thinks the least <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to give him an English earldom. … Am sure were this properly represented to our good king, who esteems a brave, religious man like himself, would be of my opinion. …. It was not, however, till 1831, many years after Duncan's death, that his son, then bearing his title, was raised to the dignity of an earl, and his other children to the rank and precedence of the children of an earl.|$|E

You'll love it, and it's such a dense show (in {{the best sense}} of the word) that it rewards repeated viewing. Like Scrubs and the British version of The Office, it {{is the sort of}} show that truly deserves to be seen uninterrupted, several episodes at a time, for maximum enjoyment. The laughs-per-minute quotient here is insanely high, making it great value as a home library purchase." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Joseph, {{in review}} of Thriller 25 for PopMatters, {{described}} the track {{listing of the}} reissue as [...] "pleasant" [...] but West's [...] "lazy" [...] remix was the only exception. He added, [...] "You've been {{given the opportunity to}} remix the most iconic single from one of the most iconic albums of all time, and all <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> stick a drum machine on top of the song's original arrangement?". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone disliked the removal of the original bassline, and compared it to [...] "putting Bobby Orr on the ice without a hockey stick". IGN's Todd Gilchrist praised West's remix and stated that it was a [...] "pretty great track". He added, [...] "it almost overplays the track's originally understated drama, his additions enhance the song and demonstrate that in a contemporary context." ...|$|E

500|$|The National Wildlife Federation {{described}} her as [...] "a passionate, articulate, and tireless {{voice for the}} environment". Chairman of the Florida Audubon Society Ed Davison remembered her, saying, [...] "She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be, and she didn't {{give a lot of}} credibility to excuses about why they're not like that. She would give these wonderful, curmudgeonly speeches to which there was no response. You can't holler back to grandmotherly scolding. All <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> shuffle your feet and say, 'Yes, Ma'am.'" [...] She was aware of it; she was reported saying, [...] "People can't be rude to me, this poor little old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me." [...] Her ashes were scattered over the [...] of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in Everglades National Park.|$|E
500|$|Follow the Leader {{received}} generally positive reviews. Stephan Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, saying that it [...] "is an effective follow-up to their first two alt-metal landmarks." [...] Erlewine also said that the songs were [...] "vehicles for the metal grind". Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B–. Reviewer Jim Farber said that the lyrics [...] "provide a new blend of metal and remnants of alt-rock." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times said the album was [...] "choppy", and also said that lead singer Jonathan Davis was [...] "wrestling with self-hatred, violent impulses, parental execration, and a confused sexual identity..." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said that, although Korn [...] "deny they're metal", they [...] "nevertheless demonstrate that the essence of metal ... is self-obliterating volume and self-aggrandizing display." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, while saying that Korn [...] "have an ideal record for those long, black days when all <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> say 'What the Fuck! What the Fuck! What the Fuck!' at bloody murder volume". The album is featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|The {{liner notes}} of Homework {{pay tribute to}} {{a large number of}} musical artists and contain a quote from Brian Wilson. Bangalter stated: [...] "In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty—it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too." [...] When {{questioned}} on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and the rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, [...] "before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The least <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people." [...] The Daft Punk track [...] "Teachers", from Homework, refers to several influences, such as Romanthony and Todd Edwards. Homem-Christo stated: [...] "Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions—the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul—is part of how we sound today." [...] A 2011 Bodytonic podcast featured tracks from all of the artists named in [...] "Teachers", the Brian Wilson speech quoted in the liner notes of Homework, and a Kraftwerk-like 1983 track produced by Daniel Vangarde, father of Bangalter.|$|E

500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would like to be the one who would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> keep your mouth shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|E

On the same day, Interior Minister Rogerio Lobato and Defence Minister Roque Rodriguez resigned, Lobato blaming the crisis on opponents to the government resorting to violence rather than political means. Foreign Minister Ramos-Horta subsequently took over the Defence ministry, while Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar urged Ramos-Horta to act strongly in his new capacity, in the interests of achieving political stability, while emphasising that the United Nations should be prepared to resume greater role.|$|E

2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{expanded to}} include renewed harassment of prominent feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian, who had previously been a target of online harassment {{due in part to}} her YouTube video series Tropes vs. Women in Video Games, which analyzes sexist stereotypes in video games. Sarkeesian's attackers took her critical commentary as unfair and unwarranted, and considered her an interloper. After a new episode of Tropes vs. Women was released on August 24, 2014, Sarkeesian received rape and death threats, and private information including her home address was leaked; she was compelled to flee her home. At the XOXO arts and technology conference in Portland, Oregon, she said, in regard to the accusations that high-profile women were making up the threats against them, that [...] "one of the most radical things <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to actually believe women when they talk about their experiences". [...] "The perpetrators", Sarkeesian went on to say, [...] "do not see themselves as perpetrators at all... They see themselves as noble warriors".|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Havins {{was asked}} if she felt that Babe had been {{redeemed}} since the baby switch. Havins replied, [...] "More or less. That's not {{something that can be}} done overnight; it takes time. And I don't think it's necessarily acts, like one heroic act, that redeem someone." [...] She clarified: It's just showing change. She's very remorseful and there's regret with the whole situation. It's one thing if somebody didn't feel sorry for what they did, but she repented for her sins. Everyone has a past. Everyone makes mistakes. The only thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> move on and try to be a better person from that point forward. When Bianca forgives Babe in 2007 for keeping her child from her, there were viewers who still felt that it was due to Bianca being in love with Babe, and were upset that Bianca could not seem to resist any interaction with her. In a 2007 interview with TV Guide, Havins seemed perplexed that a significant number of viewers had still not forgiven Babe for the baby switch, and felt that the character had been redeeming herself.|$|E
