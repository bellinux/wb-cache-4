500|$|United had {{won four}} of the first five editions of the newly-branded league, and were on course to {{continue}} their domination after opening up a sizeable lead in February 1998. Injuries and poor results however destabilised the team, {{and by the time}} Arsenal visited Old Trafford in March, a title race was looking probable. Wenger was bullish of his team's chances: [...] "I told <b>you</b> <b>last</b> week that the race was not over when the bookmakers stopped betting. Surprise, surprise, they have started taking money again." [...] A goal from Marc Overmars set Arsenal on the way to victory, which put them six points behind with three games in hand.

500|$|In 2005 Lancashire {{starred in}} The Rotters' Club as a {{housewife}} in 1970s Birmingham. Also in 2005 {{she appeared in}} the BBC television film Cherished as Angela Cannings, a British woman who was wrongfully convicted of killing her two baby sons. Lancashire was proud {{to be involved with}} the project, having greatly admired Cannings strength of character during her ordeal, and being able to relate to her sense of anguish as a parent. In December 2005, Lancashire returned to West End theatre, taking on the role of Miss Adelaide in the Donmar Warehouse production of Guys and Dolls at the Piccadilly Theatre. Lancashire was due to stay with the production until March 2006, but due to a severe chest infection made her last appearance on 4 January.

[...] Many critics were unimpressed with the special visual effects which others had found praiseworthy.

2500|$|Cougar Town {{opened to}} mixed reviews from critics. Metacritic gave the series 49 out of 100 {{based on the}} pilot episode, from the 21 reviews it collected, and a user score of 4.5 out of 10 based on 46 votes. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the pilot episode a B, commenting that the show mixes [...] "clinical realism (when did <b>you</b> <b>last</b> hear a C-section scar used as a punchline?) with ridiculous slang (a new boob job is {{referred}} to as gorilla heads), Cougar Town is so brashly vulgar, it's endearing". Tucker also wrote that [...] "the entire show is about getting and having sex... Cougar is so single-minded that this obsession itself becomes funny". Variety stated that the show [...] "does feed into the dual sense of insecurity and self-empowerment that women harbor about getting older ... though, the execution here is consistently about as subtle as a kick to the groin". Los Angeles Times Mary McNamara said that the [...] "maddening thing about Cougar Town is that it isn't completely unfunny or uncharming". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger feels that [...] "Cougar Town is still finding itself, but it's already much better than the title would suggest [...] the show [...] "has to walk a very careful line between making fun of the cougar concept and embracing it" [...] although based on the two episodes [...] "Cougar Town is self-aware enough to pull that off". USA Today was also favorable, saying that the show has [...] "the right cast and good writing".|$|E
2500|$|On August 29, 2006 Sec. Donald Rumsfeld said “Over {{the next}} decades , a {{sentiment}} took root that contended that {{if only the}} growing threats that had begun to emerge in Europe and Asia could be accommodated, then the carnage {{and the destruction of}} then-recent memory of World War I could be avoided. It was a time when a certain amount of cynicism and moral confusion set in among Western democracies. When those who warned about a coming crisis, the rise of fascism and nazism, they were ridiculed or ignored. Indeed, in the decades before World War II, a great many argued that the fascist threat was exaggerated or that it was someone else's problem. Some nations tried to negotiate a separate peace, even as the enemy made its deadly ambitions crystal clear. It was, as Winston Churchill observed, a bit like feeding a crocodile, hoping it would eat <b>you</b> <b>last.</b> ...I recount that history because once again we face similar challenges in efforts to confront the rising threat of a new type of fascism. Today -- another enemy, a different kind of enemy -- has made clear its intentions with attacks in places like New York and Washington, D.C., Bali, London, Madrid, Moscow and so many other places. But some seem not to have learned history's lessons. ...With the growing lethality and the increasing availability of weapons, can we truly afford to believe that somehow, some way, vicious extremists can be appeased? Can folks really continue to think that free countries can negotiate a separate peace with terrorists?" ...|$|E
