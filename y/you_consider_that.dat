25|$|Lou Vincent and his New Zealand flayed a {{substandard}} Zimbabwe to {{all corners}} as they routed {{their way to}} the third highest score of all time in One Day International cricket. Despite the match being shortened to 44 overs a side following the discovery of a damp patch on the Bulawayo pitch, New Zealand hit runs right from the outset, and Zimbabwe did not take a wicket until the 28th over. By then, Vincent and Stephen Fleming had taken the score to 207 – already a fearsome total, and then <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> 16 overs remained. No Zimbabwean bowler escaped the carnage, and it says something that debutant Anthony Ireland recorded the best bowling figures – still conceding 52 runs in his seven overs. Andy Blignaut, regarded as one of Zimbabwe's best bowlers, was dispatched for 96 runs – nine runs off the most expensive of all time. When the dust had settled, New Zealand had made 397 for 5 – one run short of Sri Lanka's nine-year-old record, which was set in 50 overs, and Brendon McCullum had equalled the fastest fifty for New Zealand, off 21 balls.|$|E
500|$|To gain a {{publisher}} for her novel, she sent the manuscript to several literary agents she had discovered in Writer's Digest. Though two turned her down, one agent, Jean Naggar, encouraged Koen to continue finishing the book, believing {{it to be}} [...] "the launching of a major author." [...] Naggar mailed the manuscript to five major publishing companies, with Random House purchasing it for a [...] "whopping" [...] $350,000 in August 1985, which {{was at the time}} a record for a new novelist. Random House's publisher, Howard Kaminsky, wanted to publish [...] "Oprah Winfrey-type books" [...] in the [...] "how-to-be-the-best-you-can-be" [...] genre. He reasoned, [...] "I'm sure that's up there with the highest prices ever paid for the hardcover rights alone to a first novel. But then it is not that big a price when <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> it's such a deserving novel – and it will undoubtedly go for a very large amount in paperback later." ...|$|E

500|$|Cranston's {{performance}} {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. Even prior to the airing of the episode, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the actor's voice would be perfect for an animated television series. VanDerWerff and Carp were amongst the journalists who issued favorable assessments of Cranston's acting. Carp noted that [...] "Cranston's work is even more impressive when <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> he not only plays the hero and villain but manages to be funny as both." [...] In addressing [...] "Part II", Carp concluded that [...] "as early as the stunning {{end of the world}} sequence, the actor plants the hint of suppressed craziness in Spaceman Drake and it was soon obvious that the just crew would not only be manning a mission to help him combat the mutineers but probably get wrapped up in this nut's dream to terra form Mars." [...] For VanDerWerff, [...] "Cranston is the very best kind of guest voice, fully inhabiting his character but also {{having a lot of fun}} with the jokes. It’s a nice reminder of just how funny Cranston can be, and I hope he gets even more bizarre stuff to do next week." [...] Jonah Gardner of Ology later said, [...] "Bryan Cranston remains a god among men." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} to draw {{comparisons}} with The Year of the Sex Olympics and the rise of reality television programmes (soap operas without professional actors), such as Big Brother, Castaway 2000 and Survivor, was the journalist Nancy Banks-Smith [...] in a review {{of the first}} series of the UK version of Big Brother for The Guardian in 2000, a theme she later expounded upon in 2003, writing that the play [...] "foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome". Banks-Smith had long been an admirer of The Year of the Sex Olympics, having written in The Sun following its original broadcast in 1968: [...] "Quite apart from the excellent script and the 'big big' treatment, the play radiated ripples. Is television a substitute for living? Does the spectacle of pain at a distance atrophy sympathy? Can this coffin with knobs on furnish all we need to ask?". Another admirer, the writer and actor Mark Gatiss, has said that upon seeing Big Brother he yelled at the television, [...] "Don't they know what they're doing? [...] It's The Year of the Sex Olympics! Nigel Kneale was right!". When The Year of the Sex Olympics was repeated on BBC Four on 22 May 2003, Paul Hoggart in The Times noted that [...] "in many respects Kneale was right on the money [...] when <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> nothing gets contemporary reality show audiences more excited than an emotional train-wreck on live TV".|$|E
500|$|With {{regard to}} the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated, [...] "It is {{flawlessly}} crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well." [...] He credited the [...] "technical difficulties" [...] with being [...] "so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion" [...] and [...] "found [...] convinced by both the story and the sad saga". He named it his ninth best film of 1997. On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film received [...] "two thumbs up" [...] and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as [...] "a glorious Hollywood epic" [...] and [...] "well worth the wait," [...] and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio [...] "captivating". James Berardinelli stated, [...] "Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, Titanic {{is the kind of}} epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch Titanic, you experience it." [...] It was named his second best film of 1997. Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that [...] "the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy" [...] and that [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> [...] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron". Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded, [...] "To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner {{is one of the most}} magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood." ...|$|E

2500|$|Burton began 1952 by {{starring}} alongside Noel Willman in {{the title}} role of Emmanuel Roblès adventure Montserrat, which opened on 8 April at the Lyric Hammersmith. The play only ran for six weeks but Burton once again won praises from critics. According to Bragg, some of the critics who watched the performance considered it to be Burton's [...] "most convincing role" [...] till then. Tynan lauded Burton's role of Captain Montserrat, noting that he played it [...] "with a variousness which is amazing when <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> it is really little more than a protracted exposition of smouldering dismay".|$|E
2500|$|It was {{a remarkably}} good aim if <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> {{the bomb was}} fired 250yards [...] with no direct line of sight. Technically, it was quite {{brilliant}} and I'm sure that many army crews, if given a similar task, would be very pleased to drop a bomb that close. You've got to park the launch vehicle in an area which is guarded by armed men and you've got {{less than a minute}} to do it. I was very, very surprised at how good it was. If the angle of fire had been moved about five or ten degrees, then those bombs would actually have impacted on Number Ten.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2004 Rolling Stone Album Guide, Mac Randall {{called the}} album and its predecessor, Wonderwall Music, [...] "interesting, though only for {{established}} fans". Richard Ginell of AllMusic {{says that the}} same two albums showed that Harrison defied [...] "pigeonholing" [...] in his projects outside the Beatles, and he writes of Electronic Sound: [...] "Though scoffed at when they were released, these pieces can hold their own and then some with many of those of other, more seriously regarded electronic composers. And when <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> synthesizers were only capable of playing one note {{at a time and}} sounds could not be stored or recalled with the push of a button, the achievement becomes even more remarkable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Journalist Bill Moyers {{reported}} that PBS had obtained {{a copy of}} the [...] "game plan" [...] that was adopted by the industry's trade association, America's Health Insurance Plans which spelled out the industry strategies to [...] "Highlight horror stories of government-run systems." [...] Potter explained, [...] "The industry has always tried to make Americans think that government-run systems are {{the worst thing that could}} possibly happen to them, that even if <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that,</b> you're heading down on the slippery slope towards socialism. So they have used scare tactics for years and years and years, to keep that from happening. If there were a broader program like our Medicare program now, it could potentially reduce the profits of these big companies. So that is their biggest concern." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the War of 1812, Raguet was {{a leading}} inflationist, {{supporting}} deliberate inflation through increasing the available supply of currency and credit. However, his position changed after the Panic of 1819. The Panic also converted Raguet from a protectionist to a leading promoter of free trade. While a state senator, Raguet sent a questionnaire to legislators and prominent citizens in each county of the state {{to determine the extent of}} the depression. One of the questions was [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> the advantages of the banking system outweigh its evils?" [...] Sixteen out of nineteen counties answered in the negative. Raguet concluded that the depression was a result of bank credit expansion and the subsequent contraction as physical money was drained from the bank's vaults. He promoted restrictions on banks and of granting bank charters.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. James E. Barger of Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN) {{testified to}} the HSCA that his {{statistical}} analysis of the impulse patterns captured on the Dallas police recordings showed that the motorcycle with the open microphone was approximately [...] "120 to 138 feet" [...] behind the presidential limousine {{at the time of}} the first shot. When the HSCA asked Weiss about the location of the motorcycle with the open microphone—"Would <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> to be an essential ingredient in the ultimate conclusion of your analysis?"—Weiss answered, [...] "It is an essential component of it, because, if you do not put the motorcycle in the place that it is —the initial point of where it was receiving the —, and if you do not move it at the velocity at which it is being moved on paper in this re-creation, you do not get a good, tight pattern that compares very well with the observed impulses on the police tape recording." ...|$|E

2500|$|Morricone finally {{received}} a second Oscar nomination for The Mission. Morricone's original score lost out to Herbie Hancock's coolly arranged jazz on Bertrand Tavernier's Round Midnight. It was {{considered as a}} surprising win and a controversial one, given {{that much of the}} music in the film was pre-existing. Morricone stated the following during a 2001 interview with The Guardian: [...] "I definitely felt that I should have won for The Mission. Especially when <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> the Oscar-winner that year was Round Midnight, which was not an original score. It had a very good arrangement by Herbie Hancock, but it used existing pieces. So there could be no comparison with The Mission. There was a theft!" [...] His score for The Mission was ranked at number 1 in a poll of the all-time greatest film scores. The top 10 list was compiled by 40 film composers such as Michael Giacchino and Carter Burwell. The score is ranked 23rd on the AFI's list of 25 greatest film scores of all time.|$|E
