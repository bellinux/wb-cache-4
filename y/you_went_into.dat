6000|$|... "No; if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> this, young man, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> it {{with your}} eyes open. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> it with a full {{understanding}} of the risks--because you think the reward, if you are successful, makes the taking of those risks worth while. You and I know that what you are doing isn't really stealing; it's simply a tactful way of getting back my own property. But the judge and jury will have different views." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, no, Basil, be honest; fibbing isn't your forte: I wonder <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the {{insurance}} business; {{you ought to}} have been a lawyer. Go because you like eating, and are hungry, perhaps, or think you may be so before we get to New York.|$|E
