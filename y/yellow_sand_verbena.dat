Upon hatching, the caterpillars wander a short distance and spin silk pads upon which they pass the winter. The larvae immediately seek out the food plant {{at the end of}} their diapause in the spring. After 7 to 10 weeks each larva pupates within a chamber of leaves it glues together with silk. Adults may emerge in about 2 weeks and can live for 3 weeks. The adult flight season may range from late June to early September. Adults feed on nectar from flowers including gumplants (Grindelia spp.), <b>yellow</b> <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> (Abronia latifolia), coyote mints (Monardella spp., especially M. undulata), bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare) and seaside daisy (Erigeron glaucus).|$|E
40|$|The Sand Verbena Moth (Copablepharon fuscum) (Moth) is a {{critically}} imperiled moth known {{to exist in}} only ten populations within a narrow range in the Strait of Georgia of British Columbia in Canada and the Puget Sound of Washington in the United States. Within its range, this moth depends on dune coastal habitat containing relatively large stands of its host plant, the <b>yellow</b> <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> (Abronia latifolia). <b>Yellow</b> <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> only grows near sea level, in sandy coastal areas that lack dense plant cover. The Moth depends on the <b>yellow</b> <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> in all life stages except pupation. Adult moths feed on the nectar of the sand verbena’s trumpet-shaped flower; adults lay eggs in its flowers; and larvae feed on its leaves and flowers. Of its ten populations, four are in British Columbia and six are in Washington. The populations within Canada are likely isolated from each other, and they are isolated from the U. S. populations. The total occupied area of the Canadian populations is approximately 61 hectares (151 acres). The occupied area within the U. S. is unknown, but limited. The entire range of this species measures 220 km by 45 km (137 mi by 28 mi). The Moth is in a precarious situation, {{as it is a}} habitat specialist tied to another habita...|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of a <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> on the Yellowstone Plateau is surprising {{because of the high}} elevation (approximately 7,740 feet, or 2,360 meters) and long, cold winters. Yellowstone <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> is a member of a New World plant family that typically lives in warmer climates such as deserts and tropical areas. The genus Abronia includes about 30 species that primarily occur in warmer areas of the western United States and Mexico. Some botanists speculate that the thermal activity in Yellowstone has made it possible for a <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> to survive the harsh winters here and slowly evolve into a species that is adapted to this climate.|$|R

50|$|Generally {{found in}} sandy, well-drained soil {{in areas with}} low precipitation, it can become a {{striking}} carpet-like groundcover in undisturbed areas after winter rains.

5|$|There {{are dozens}} of species of {{flowering}} plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September. The Yellowstone <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> is a rare flowering plant found only in Yellowstone. It {{is closely related to}} species usually found in much warmer climates, making the <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> an enigma. The estimated 8,000 examples of this rare flowering plant all make their home in the sandy soils on the shores of Yellowstone Lake, well above the waterline.|$|R
40|$|Yellowstone <b>sand</b> <b>verbena,</b> Abronia ammophila Greene, is {{restricted}} to stabilized sand sites that principally lie just above the maximum splash zone along the shoreline of Yellowstone Lake.

A summation of current knowledge regarding the life history of the species is presented, though many aspects still require further elucidation. Historical collections suggest that this species was more widely distributed around the lake in the early years after the park’s establishment. The high level of human activity on the beaches, especially along the northern shoreline of the lake, may have resulted in the extirpation of the <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> from significant portions of its original range.
