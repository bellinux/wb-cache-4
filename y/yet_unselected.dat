50|$|JC Dixon {{emigrated from}} Liverpool to Melbourne in mid-1864, when {{in his early}} twenties. He moved almost {{immediately}} to Sydney, where he worked {{in a variety of}} occupations for several years. In 1868, lured by reports {{of the success of the}} sugar industry in Queensland, Dixon and two fellow members of the Society of Friends visited the Moreton Bay district. The party was guided by timbergetter William Grigor to the Mooloolah Plains, as <b>yet</b> <b>unselected,</b> then returned to Sydney. In 1869 JC Dixon returned to Queensland with four other Friends, all of whom selected land on the Mooloolah River, and commenced sugar cane cultivation. Dixon in partnership with Herbert Everett selected land downstream, which proved a poor choice - their sugar crop was badly damaged by floods. They abandoned the selection and moved to a sugar plantation on Doughboy Creek, near Brisbane. When at Mooloolah, Dixon had heard from a timbergetter about Buderim Mountain. Selling his interest in the Doughboy Creek property to Everett, Dixon made the first application to select land on Buderim Mountain, in June 1870.|$|E
