5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

In 1965, he founded a nursery for children with his wife after she asked him [...] "if you want to atone for the lives <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken,</b> what better way is there than to nurture new lives?" [...] The couple opened a kindergarten in 1969. He continued as a principal of the kindergarten until his retirement. In a 2013 interview with The Australian Harada said: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{voyage to}} Europe {{remained}} eventful. In the Indian Ocean Caesar caught fire and was almost destroyed, and after stopping at Cape Town, the Indiaman visited St Helena, where Amherst, Maxwell {{and the other}} officers {{were introduced to the}} former French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, then a prisoner on the island. At the meeting Bonaparte recalled Maxwell's conduct in the action of November 1811 and commended him on his victory, saying [...] "Vous êtes très méchant. Eh bien! Your government must not blame you for the loss of the Alceste, for <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> one of my frigates".|$|E

500|$|Ternate {{returned}} to Batavia with the castaways, where Amherst chartered the ship Caesar {{for the journey}} to England. During a stop at St Helena, Maxwell met Napoleon, who remembered the action on 29 November 1811 when Alceste had captured La Pomone, and remarked, [...] "...your government must not blame you {{for the loss of}} Alceste, for <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> one of my frigates." [...] The requisite court martial exonerated Maxwell, his officers, and his crew of the loss of Alceste. Maxwell received much praise for his actions, and £1500 from the East India Company. He was knighted in 1818.|$|E
500|$|On October 1, 2007 {{while walking}} in Boston Common, Simon Glik {{observed}} an arrest by Boston police officers John Cunniffe, Peter Savalis, and Jerome Hall-Brewster. Glik began recording the arrest after {{he heard a}} bystander say [...] "ou are hurting him, stop". Because Glik was concerned that the officers were using excessive force, he filmed the encounter with his cell phone. Although Glik was 10 feet away and was not interfering with the arrest, {{one of the officers}} turned to him after placing handcuffs on the suspect and said [...] "I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> enough pictures". Glik replied that he was recording the incident; he said, [...] "I am recording this. I saw you punch him". When the officer determined that this included audio, he placed Glik under arrest for violating the Massachusetts wiretapping law.|$|E
500|$|Two teasers were {{released}} on August 3 featuring Deadpool: one where he promises {{the arrival of}} the trailer and describes Fox as [...] "the studio that inexplicably sewed his fucking mouth shut the first time", and a short tease {{at the end of a}} new trailer for Fox's Fantastic Four. The full trailer was then released, now with completed visual effects.For Halloween, Reynolds released a video with himself in the Deadpool costume, interacting with a group of children dressed as X-Men. He asks them questions such as [...] "How many of <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> a human life?" [...] On December 14, a [...] "12 Days of Deadpool" [...] campaign began with [...] "new images, a featurette, or maybe a new poster" [...] released for the film each day by companies such as People, JoBlo.com, Fandango, and Mashable leading up to the release of a new trailer on Christmas Day.|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{was very}} different. He ought to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> it. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> it <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> been very wrong, and have broken a poor girl's heart. I {{am sure you}} knew that all through." ...|$|R
500|$|In France, {{the action}} had more {{significant}} consequences. The loss of two ships and over 200 cannon {{was a serious}} blow to the French army marshalling in the Balkans. Napoleon himself {{took an interest in}} the engagement and it has been suggested by British historian James Henderson that this action convinced Napoleon of his inability to control the Adriatic Sea, which was vital to launching operations in the Balkans. This action may have been a factor in his decision to abandon plans to invade the Ottoman Empire, and instead to turn his attention on Russia. In the French Navy, the flight of Pauline was deemed cowardly and Captain Montfort was court-martialled and relieved of command. In 1817, when Murray Maxwell visited St Helena on his return from the East Indies where HMS Alceste had been wrecked, Napoleon greeted him with the words [...] "Your government must not blame you for the loss of Alceste, for <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> one of my frigates".|$|E
500|$|Taraki {{was greeted}} by Amin at the airport on his return to Kabul. The flight was {{scheduled}} to land at 2:30 but Amin forced the delay of the landing by an hour as a demonstration to Taraki of his control over the government. Shortly afterward, Taraki sought to neutralize Amin's power and influence by requesting that he serve overseas as an ambassador. Amin turned down the proposal, shouting [...] "You are the one who should quit! Because of drink and old age <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> leave of your senses." [...] The following day Taraki invited Amin to the presidential palace for lunch with him and the Gang of Four. Amin turned down the offer, stating he would prefer their resignation rather than lunching with them. Soviet Ambassador Puzanov managed to persuade Amin to make the visit to the palace along with Sayed Daoud Tarun, the Chief of Police and Nawab Ali (an intelligence officer). Upon arriving at the palace, unknown individuals within the building opened fire on the visitors. Tarun was killed, while Ali sustained an injury and escaped with an unharmed Amin. Shortly afterward, Amin returned to the palace with a contingent of Army officers and placed Taraki under arrest. The Gang of Four, however, had [...] "disappeared" [...] and their whereabouts would remain unknown {{for the duration of}} Amin's 104-day rule.|$|E

Amin turned down the offer, stating he would prefer their resignation rather than lunching with them. Soviet ambassador Puzanov persuaded Amin to make the visit to the Presidential Palace along with Taroon, the Chief of Police and Nawab Ali (an intelligence officer). Upon arriving at the palace, unknown individuals within the building opened fire on the visitors. Taroon was killed, while Ali sustained an injury and escaped, together with Amin, who was unharmed. Shortly afterward, Amin returned to the palace with a contingent of Army officers, and placed Taraki under arrest. The Gang of Four, however, had [...] "disappeared" [...] and their whereabouts would remain unknown {{for the duration of}} Amin's 104-day rule. After Taraki's arrest, Amin reportedly discussed the incident with Leonid Brezhnev, and indirectly asked for the permission to kill Taraki. Brezhnev replied that it was his choice. Amin, who now believed he had the full support of the Soviets, ordered the death of Taraki. Taraki was subsequently suffocated with pillows. The Afghan media would report that the ailing Taraki had died, omitting any mention of his murder.|$|E

500|$|On 5 August, Herff {{praised the}} Bersaglieri, who had defended Halfaya Pass [...] "...with lionlike courage {{until the last}} man against {{stronger}} enemy forces. The greatest part of them died faithful to the flag." [...] Lieutenant Giacinto Cova, a platoon commander in the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment, received a posthumous Gold Medal of Military Valour, Italy's highest award for bravery. The medal citation reported that Cova had organised a counter-attack and was killed attempting to throw a hand-held bomb at a British tank. The British received plaudits from Winston Churchill, who sent a telegram to Wavell betraying his ignorance of events by stating: [...] "Without using the Tiger cubs <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the offensive, advanced , captured Halfaya and Sollum, taken 500 German prisoners and inflicted heavy losses in men and tanks. For this twenty I tanks and 1,000 or 1,500 casualties do not seem too heavy a cost." [...] Churchill ended the message by asking Wavell [...] "What are your dates for bringing Tiger cubs into action?", {{in reference to the}} reinforcements that had arrived at Alexandria on 12 May as part of a convoy code-named Operation Tiger. The 11th Hussar's regimental history notes that [...] "it was clear that no further offensive action would be possible before 7 Arm was fully prepared". The Tiger convoy brought 238 tanks and made it possible to refit the 7th Armoured Division, which had been out of action since February {{as a result of the}} losses it sustained during Operation Compass. Preparations could now be made for Operation Battleaxe and the relief of Tobruk. In the system of British and Commonwealth battle honours, units that served in the Halfaya Pass area between 15 and 27 May were awarded the honour Halfaya 1941 in 1957.|$|E

"The most {{important}} thing to bear in mind when arrested is that you are a volunteer of a revolutionary Army, that you have been captured by an enemy force, that your cause is a just one, that you are right and that the enemy is wrong and that as a soldier <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the chance expected of a soldier and that there is {{nothing to be ashamed of}} in being captured.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 November 2011 Boyd Barrett led the United Left Alliance TDs {{out of the}} Dáil, {{in protest}} against the government's {{decision}} not to hold a debate on the payment of more than €700 million to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders. [...] "You will not even give the parliament {{the right to vote}} on the handover of all the money <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> out of the health service", he objected. On 15 December 2011 he helped launch a nationwide campaign against a proposed household charge being brought in as part of the 2012 Irish budget.|$|E
2500|$|The {{result was}} that, unlike in Afghanistan, the Reagan Doctrine was rather quickly applied in Angola and Nicaragua, with the United States {{providing}} military {{support to the}} UNITA movement in Angola and the [...] "contras" [...] in Nicaragua, but without {{a declaration of war}} against either country. Addressing the Heritage Foundation in October 1989, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi called the Heritage Foundation's efforts [...] "a source of great support. No Angolan will forget your efforts. You have come to Jamba, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> our message to Congress and the Administration". U.S. aid to UNITA began to flow overtly after Congress repealed the Clark Amendment, a long-standing legislative prohibition on military aid to UNITA.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, George II had to {{accompanied}} [...] "Trux" [...] to Hanover. Frederick then summoned him to Silesia. Here, soon afterwards, he {{drew the}} king's anger, for which {{there seemed to be}} more reason, when, in confidence, [...] "Trux" [...] sent an officer to Olmütz, to take charge of deserters. The king then wrote to him. [...] "I believe that you are only fifteen [...] in number, in view of the extraordinary conduct which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> from the officers at Olmütz to demand deserters, be wary, or after so many such cases of discontent, you and I will quarrel."
