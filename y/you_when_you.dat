500|$|The {{novel was}} first {{published}} {{as part of the}} Nouveaux contes philosophiques in late 1832, but by the start of the following year he declared it to be [...] "a wretched miscarriage" [...] and began rewriting it. During the process, Balzac was aided by a grammarian working as a proofreader, who found [...] "a thousand errors" [...] in the text. Once he had returned home, the author [...] "cried with despair and with that rage that takes hold of <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> recognize your faults after working so hard".|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{process was}} a {{collaborative}} effort consisting of Vinnie, Darrell, and Lachman. Themes explored on the album included the brothers' experiences, Darrell commented, [...] "the crumbling of one empire and then starting over... So {{there are a lot}} of lyrics about being reborn in a sense, about it being a new day, moving forward, letting go of the past and becoming something new." [...] This is exemplified in the songs [...] "Reborn", [...] "Wake up", and [...] "Breathing New Life". [...] "Blunt Force Trauma" [...] is about when someone or something comes up behind <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> least expect it, [...] "it could be a situation in your life, it could be a person you know with a beer bottle".|$|E

500|$|Stephen Goode, {{a critic}} for Insight on the News, {{considered}} the piece {{to be the}} beginning of the Pop Art movement, labeling the work [...] "a sign of things to come as other artists tackled common yet sacrosanct items, including the American flag". Lichtenstein, reflecting on his work, told reporters, [...] "The idea of counterfeiting money always occurs to <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do lithography". Despite the assessments of critics, Lichtenstein, in an interview with Joan Marter, considered the work to be [...] "a kind of Cubist dollar bill, not a Pop one". He continued, [...] "The fact it was a ten-dollar-bill at all [...] {{there was some kind of}} Pop influence on me that I wasn't aware of so much. They're really not Pop at all. They're more funny, or humorous, or something".|$|E
500|$|Canada {{entered the}} final facing {{pressure}} {{to defeat the}} Soviets. [...] The Soviet national team's easy victory over the National Hockey League's all-stars in the 1979 Challenge Cup left the Canadians searching to regain command of their rivalry with the Soviets. [...] Coach Scotty Bowman called it a [...] "must win game" [...] for Canada: [...] "We really are favorites in the final. [...] Nobody in this country will tolerate a loss." [...] The players also spoke of their desire to show the Soviets {{that they were the}} world's top hockey nation. During their pre-game preparations, Tikhonov called upon his team to play the finest games of their lives: [...] "Today you got to play so well that the entire Canadian population will talk about you afterwards and remember you for a long time. [...] Play so well that the Canadian fans when they will leave Forum will wait for <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get on the bus after the game and admire you." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the guitar}} riffs, Michele sings about {{becoming}} a future superstar, [...] "Yeah, you may think that I'm a zero/ But hey, everyone you wanna be/ Probably started off like me". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] is [...] "a sunny pop track that finds Lea Michele and Cory Monteith railing against conformity and celebrating their individuality in their verses". Other cast member lyrics include the lyric [...] "You may think I'm a freak show", responded to by Naya Rivera with the spoken [...] "I don't care". The song features self-empowerment lyrics which revolve around revenge fantasies, such as in Monteith's lines - [...] "I could be a superstar / I'll see <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> wash my car". According to Melinda Newman of HitFix the song is about [...] "being a loser now, but turning in to a winner now who never, ever looks back". Aly Semigran of MTV News said the lyrics of the [...] "peppy pop ditty" [...] keep [...] "in tune with the themes of the show".|$|E

500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don’t know what the hell they’re doing and neither will <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get to be a parent. You’ve just got to understand that people are human and they make mistakes," [...] he said. DeLonge remembered learning of his parents' divorce when he discovered scrape marks on the driveway of their home. [...] "Right then, I knew my dad had dragged out his furniture single-handedly," [...] he recalled. He spoke on the song's inspiration in 2001: ...|$|E
500|$|... "DNA" [...] is a mid-tempo electropop and R ballad, which {{incorporates}} {{influences of}} dubstep and runs {{for three minutes}} and 56 seconds. It contains an instrumentation consisted of a guitar riff, skittering and thumping drum beats, and spooky synthesisers accompanied with Little Mix's vocal performance. According to music website Popjustice, the song features [...] "a squeaky door effect" [...] and [...] "Cheiron-style slamming smashy noises." [...] Vicky Newman of the Shields Gazette said that the track has an urban edge to it. The song begins with a tinkling music box before Perrie Edwards starts singing the line [...] "Does he love <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> least expect it," [...] in a low register. After the second chorus, the song almost stops completely before a half-rapped, half-spoken middle eight, followed by a choral breakdown. The choral breakdown, described as [...] "Gothic" [...] by many critics, gives way to brief rave klaxon instrumentation. Viewed as a dark song by Little Mix and music critics alike, [...] "DNA" [...] sees the group depart from their fun and upbeat sound on previous single, [...] "Wings". It has been heavily compared to Katy Perry's [...] "E.T.", which was an influential factor in the song's development.|$|E
500|$|Although not {{exceptional}} in size at , , Taylor was {{a physical}} fullback. He sought contact on every play, accordant with his philosophy: [...] "Football is a contact sport. You've {{got to make}} them respect you. You've got to punish tacklers. You've got to deal out more misery than the tacklers deal out to you." [...] He was widely acknowledged by his peers {{as one of the}} toughest and meanest players in the NFL. Former quarterback Bobby Layne listed him as one of the one of [...] "Pro Football's 11 Meanest Men" [...] in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964. Packers linebacker Ray Nitschke said, [...] "In 15 years with the pros, he's one of the toughest men I ever played against—and we were on the same team. He'd hurt <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> tackled him." [...] He was difficult to tackle, as he fought for every extra yard. Giants linebacker Sam Huff proposed a rule change specifically in Taylor's case; per NFL rules, piling-on after a play invokes an unnecessary roughness penalty, but Huff argued, [...] "You gotta pile on him a little to keep him down." ...|$|E

500|$|In the chorus, Knowles gives {{listeners}} {{a flashback}} to her friskier days and {{admits that she}} is certified neither as a teacher, a preacher nor a doctor, but is willing to perform their various duties regardless. She also sings, [...] "I'm great at writing physical love letters", and [...] "I'm a freak, all day all night". After asking, [...] "Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?", Knowles echoes, [...] "Oh oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh". In the second verse, she continues to sing about {{the ins and outs}} of life to the [...] "pretty somethings", [...] "sexy somethings", [...] "bitter somethings", and [...] "little somethings": [...] "Living in a fastlane, see <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> crash babe", [...] "That body ain’t always gonna get you out of everything", and [...] "Stop living in regret, it’s not over yet". In the bridge, she commands, [...] "Make your life what you decide / Baby, party till the fire marshal shuts this sucker down". The song ends with Knowles giving one her final lessons, [...] "Don’t stop running until it’s finished — it’s up to you, the rest is unwritten".|$|E
500|$|The Houston Astros officially retired Bagwell's jersey number 5 on August 26, 2007, {{prior to}} the start of a game versus the Pittsburgh Pirates. [...] He was the eighth player in Astros history to have his number retired. [...] Two of Bagwell's closest friends and former teammates, Biggio and Brad Ausmus, spoke on his behalf. [...] Said Ausmus, [...] "He was the quintessential teammate. [...] He was a superstar who always put the team before himself. [...] And between he and Bidge (Biggio), they always {{shouldered}} the blame we struggled and tried to deflect the credit when we won." [...] Yastrzemski, Bagwell's childhood hero, delivered a special message: [...] "Congratulations, Jeff, on your number being retired. [...] I begged the Red Sox not to trade <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were in the minors with us. [...] Boston's loss was Houston's gain. [...] See you in Cooperstown." [...] Three first bases were used in the game, each embossed with a commemorative insignia and inscription, [...] "No. 5, Jeff Bagwell jersey retirement, Aug. 26, 2007." [...] One was given to Bagwell and the other two were auctioned to raise funds on behalf of the Astros in Action Foundation.|$|E
500|$|Tancharoen {{hinted that}} the series would {{continue}} Age of Ultrons theme of [...] "diving {{into the world}} of A.I. [...] things may not go as planned". On what makes Aida different from the villain Ultron, Whedon explained that [...] "Aida started as something that was supposed to mimic human behavior. Ultron came out almost a fully fleshed-out creature with his own agenda, where she’s been discovering hers along the way." [...] He added that instead of thousands of robots, the LMDs would be presented as android versions of the other characters in the series. Whedon said of themes that are raised in the second pod, [...] "there are issues of reality and identity. Trust is always an issue in a spy organization. It’s much worse when you don’t know if the person next to you is the person next to <b>you</b> ... <b>When</b> <b>you</b> get into trust, that’s when things get emotional." [...] The pod ends with the Melinda May LMD seemingly destroying herself and all the other known LMDs besides Aida, concluding her specific arc which explored the nature of humanity and identity. Asked if any of these LMDs survived this act, and could carry over to the third pod of the season, Whedon said [...] "We’ll see, but the idea was to put that chapter behind us." ...|$|E

500|$|For Angels fifth season, as with Buffys fourth, Spike {{steps in}} to replace Cordelia {{as a source}} of comedic {{dialogue}} within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where are you now? Where were <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> started and where are you now and {{how do you feel about}} that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E
