A governess called [...] "Miss Kitty" [...] who came from across the Channel, instilled in him the love of - and competence in - the English language. The proctor caught him reading a book by Rimbaud or Mallarmé, and reprimanded him, [...] "Let's have no disorder in your studies!". Cartier-Bresson said, [...] "He used the informal 'tu', which usually meant <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> {{to get a good}} thrashing. But he went on, 'You're going to read in my office.' Well, that wasn't an offer he had to repeat." ...|$|E
2500|$|During development, skeptical {{elements}} of the Air Ministry had expected mature piston-powered aircraft types to exceed {{the capabilities of the}} Meteor in all respects except that of speed; thus, the performance of early Meteors was considered favourable for the interceptor mission, being capable of out-diving the majority of enemy aircraft. The conclusion of in-service trials conducted between the Meteor F.3. and the Hawker Tempest V was that the performance of the Meteor exceeded the Tempest in almost all respects and that, barring some manoeuvrability issues, the Meteor could be considered a capable all-round fighter. Pilots formerly flying piston-engine aircraft often described the Meteor as being exciting to fly. Ex-RAF pilot Norman Tebbit stated of his experience of the Meteor: [...] "Get airborne, up with the wheels, hold it low until <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> 380 knots, pull it up and she would go up, well we thought then, like a rocket".|$|E

Why did Ducie, when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> to quit the Montauk together, so unceremoniously stop you, as <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> {{to get into the}} boat first; is the {{etiquette}} of a man-of-war so rigid as to justify so much rudeness, I had almost called it--?" ...|$|E
