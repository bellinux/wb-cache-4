5|$|The Scalloway Islands {{are a small}} {{archipelago}} at {{the entrance}} to Weisdale Voe in the South West. The North Isles is the name given to the group including Yell, Unst and Fetlar. There are also numerous islands in Yell Sound between the Mainland and <b>Yell</b> <b>and</b> in St. Magnus Bay to the west, especially near the strait of Swarbacks Minn, but the number and diverse locations of the Shetland islands makes further classification difficult.|$|E
5|$|After 5:00 pm, Custer's {{division}} (including Capehart's brigade) remounted, {{and attacked}} a Confederate battery. The battery {{was unable to}} shoot low enough to hit the charging cavalry, and was soon captured. The rebels responded with a Rebel <b>yell,</b> <b>and</b> soon the opposing forces were fighting in close combat using sabers. Because of their position on the field, most of the Union casualties in this encounter belonged to the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry—but {{a large portion of}} the loss was from wounds that were not lethal.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{during the}} fasting month of Ramadan, the Musaher {{of a town}} would <b>yell</b> <b>and</b> beat his drum to wake up the town's {{residents}} for suhoor (lit. 'of dawn')—usually {{very early in the}} morning, ranging from 4-6 am. The meals eaten during this time are light and foods include labaneh, cheese, bread and fried or boiled eggs along with various liquids to drink. The muezzin's call to dawn prayers signaled the beginning of sawm or fasting.|$|E

5|$|Vagaland, {{who grew}} up in Walls, was arguably Shetland's finest poet of the 20th century. Haldane Burgess was a Shetland historian, poet, novelist, violinist, {{linguist}} and socialist and Rhoda Bulter (1929–94) is one of the best-known Shetland poets of recent times. Other 20th and 21st century poets and novelists include Christine De Luca, Robert Alan Jamieson {{who grew up}} in Sandness, the late Lollie Graham of Veensgarth, Stella Sutherland of Bressay, the late William J Tait from <b>Yell</b> <b>and</b> Laureen Johnson.|$|E
25|$|The {{island was}} anciently divided into the parishes of North Yell, Mid <b>Yell,</b> <b>and</b> South Yell. More {{recently}} the parish of North Yell was merged {{with that of}} Fetlar, and Mid <b>Yell</b> <b>and</b> South Yell were amalgamated. In 1991, North Yell was merged with Mid and South Yell to the new civil parish of Yell, leaving Fetlar a parish of its own. The island is still divided into the ecclesiastical parish Mid <b>Yell</b> <b>and</b> the quoad sacra parishes North <b>Yell</b> <b>and</b> South Yell.|$|E
25|$|Each time Joe Louis won a {{fight in}} those {{depression}} years, even before he became champion, thousands of black Americans on relief or W.P.A., and poor, would throng {{out into the streets}} all across the land to march and cheer and <b>yell</b> <b>and</b> cry because of Joe's one-man triumphs. No one else in the United States has ever had such an effect on Negro emotions—or on mine. I marched and cheered and yelled and cried, too.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} roads, the A968 and the B9081. The A968 runs from Ulsta in the south west of the island to Gutcher in the north east, linking the ferry to and from Mainland, Shetland, with those going to Unst and Fetlar. Despite being a listed A road, it is single track in some {{stretches}} with passing places. The B9081 is single track with passing places. It runs along the south coast of <b>Yell,</b> <b>and</b> up its east, {{and part of the}} north east too. The stretch from Mid Yell to Gutcher is replaced by the A968, but it recommences after that.|$|E
25|$|The Stitzel Distillery {{supplied}} much of {{the whiskey}} sold by the Weller wholesale firm. The consolidation coincided with prohibition, during which time the Stitzel-Weller firm was licensed {{by the government to}} produce whiskey for medicinal purposes. One of their labels that was introduced on the market just before prohibition was Old Rip Van Winkle. After prohibition, the brand was not reintroduced until after 1972 when the Stitzel-Weller distillery and its current brand names (including W.L. Weller, Old Fitzgerald, Rebel <b>Yell,</b> <b>and</b> Cabin Still) were sold to other companies. The only brand name the Van Winkle family kept the rights to was the pre-prohibition brand Old Rip Van Winkle.|$|E
25|$|Interactionism is {{the view}} that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally {{interact}} with physical states. This is a position which is very appealing to common-sense intuitions, notwithstanding {{the fact that it}} is very difficult to establish its validity or correctness by way of logical argumentation or empirical proof. It seems to appeal to common-sense because we are surrounded by such everyday occurrences as a child's touching a hot stove (physical event) which causes him to feel pain (mental event) and then <b>yell</b> <b>and</b> scream (physical event) which causes his parents to experience a sensation of fear and protectiveness (mental event) and so on.|$|E

25|$|Kings Dominion {{added another}} {{launched}} roller coaster in 1998, Volcano, The Blast Coaster, {{in the former}} Lost World mountain. The mountain's previous rides had all been removed several years previously, and Volcano gave the mountain a major transformation. Volcano, which was manufactured by Intamin, was the world's first LIM-launched inverted roller coaster. The ride featured two separate launch sections, an Immelman loop {{out of the top}} of the mountain, and three heartline rolls on the way back down. Volcano was themed to the 1997 film Volcano; the other Paramount Parks added inverted or suspended roller coasters themed to Top Gun around the same time. During the next two seasons, Kings Dominion expanded Hurricane Reef behind the Rebel <b>Yell</b> <b>and</b> renamed it WaterWorks. The new portion of WaterWorks includes Pipeline Peak, a set of four enclosed water slides, one of which (the Night Slider) is the world's tallest dark free-fall slide. In 2000, Nick Central opened, replacing Nick Splat City and part of Kidzville.|$|E
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud <b>yell</b> <b>and</b> she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E

500|$|This {{is a list}} of Shetland {{islands in}} Scotland. The Shetland {{archipelago}} is located [...] north of mainland Scotland and the capital Lerwick is almost equidistant from Bergen in Norway and Aberdeen in Scotland. The Shetland archipelago comprises about 300 islands and skerries, of which 16 are inhabited. In addition to the Shetland Mainland the larger islands are Unst, <b>Yell</b> <b>and</b> Fetlar.|$|E
500|$|Peter Brook {{directed}} {{an experimental}} {{production at the}} Round House in 1968, in which the text was [...] "almost wholly abandoned" [...] in favour of mime. According to Margaret Croydon's review, Sycorax was [...] "portrayed by an enormous woman able to expand her face and body to still larger proportions– a fantastic emblem of the grotesque... suddenly... gives a horrendous <b>yell,</b> <b>and</b> Caliban, with black sweater over his head, emerges from between her legs: Evil is born." ...|$|E
500|$|For the film's director, King {{wanted someone}} [...] "who would steer {{us away from}} the {{traditional}} BBC-type costume drama," [...] and [...] "make a period film for an MTV audience". By chance, someone recommended King watch the 2005 film C.R.A.Z.Y. by French-Canadian filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallée, and became immediately interested in hiring him. King offered the job to Vallée on their very first meeting. Though at first expressing disinterest, Vallée agreed to direct after reading the script. He commented, [...] "When I read the script, I saw it's a family drama, a romance, a political plot at the same time." [...] Vallee considered Victoria to be a rebel because [...] "she has this attitude, which is you make noise, you want to <b>yell</b> <b>and</b> yell loudly to your parents and all the people, to authority... 'I'm {{going to do it}} my way.' That's what rock 'n' roll is all about. That's what I liked about her, this energy. [...] was special and had this mystical quality." ...|$|E

500|$|Writer and {{executive}} producer Maurice Hurley thought that [...] "Heart of Glory" [...] was the closest experience he had on the show to directly place his own personal philosophy into a script. He later credited fellow executive producer Rick Berman with helping to write the script for [...] "Heart of Glory", saying [...] "When I had a problem, I could go in and we could sit there, close the door, <b>yell</b> <b>and</b> scream. I'd pace, he'd make suggestions. The two of us made stories work in that room {{that had to be}} shot within a couple of days. We were under enormous time pressure, and we were working hand in glove. We had a wonderful time, on that show, especially." [...] Hurley wrote the screenplay in two days from a story created by Herbert Wright and D. C. Fontana. Because of the delays, the Klingon language portions of the script didn't make any actual sense in translation and were simply Klingon sounding words created by Hurley.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Hitchens {{wrote in}} Slate that {{official}} {{reaction in the}} Westparticularly the United Stateswas too lenient toward the protesters and Muslim community in Denmark, and insufficiently supportive of Denmark {{and the right to}} free speech. He said, [...] "nobody in authority can be found to state the obvious and the necessary—that we stand with the Danes against this defamation and blackmail and sabotage. Instead, all compassion and concern is apparently to be expended upon those who lit the powder trail, and who <b>yell</b> <b>and</b> scream for joy as the embassies of democracies are put to the torch in the capital cities of miserable, fly-blown dictatorships. Let's be sure we haven't hurt the vandals' feelings." [...] William Kristol also wrote that the response of Western leaders, {{with the exception of the}} Danish Prime Minister, was too weak and that the issue was used as an excuse by [...] "those who are threatened by our effort to help liberalize and civilize the Middle East" [...] to fight back against the [...] "assault" [...] on radical Islamists and Middle Eastern dictatorships.|$|E
500|$|Spit {{received}} mixed-to-positive reviews. Rolling Stone gave Spit a {{three out}} of five, called the album [...] "fairly good-natured for an exercise in repetitive maximum aggro". Robert Christgau gave the album a C+, calling it [...] "proof that Korn fans aren't sexist". Roxanne Blanford of AllMusic rated the album 3.5 out of five and wrote, [...] "these young women learned well the lessons of predecessors Joan Jett, Lita Ford, and the current reigning queen of angst-rock, Courtney Love". Teen Ink gave Spit a positive review: [...] "Kittie is a Canadian band made up of four girls who can rock, <b>yell</b> <b>and</b> keep up with any hardcore band out there". Phil McNamara of The Worcester Phoenix wrote that Kittie [...] "can throw down heavy head-banging riffs {{with the best of}} them, and oh yeah -- they're girls". Also, Canadian journalist Martin Popoff is quite happy of a girl band which can rock [...] "heavily and smartly", [...] "sounding like vicious hardcore sirens" [...] avoiding [...] "electronic gunk" [...] with only a slight nod to rap metal.|$|E
