In the original 1995 Super Famicon version of Dragon Quest VI, {{certain types of}} monsters can be randomly recruited if they are defeated with a Monster Master in the party. In the 2010 DS remake, this system has been removed, instead, there are certain Slimes that will join <b>you</b> <b>once</b> you accomplish a specific task. Lizzie still remains recruitable.|$|E

500|$|In {{the run-up}} to the release of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in 2005, Ostrum {{garnered}} a spate of attention that included seeing the film in New York City with NPR as well as being included in VH1's list of [...] "100 Greatest Kid Stars" [...] (placing 78th). [...] On the new film, Ostrum quoted fellow Wonka actor Julie Dawn Cole, saying that [...] "It's sort of like going back to a house that <b>you</b> <b>once</b> lived in and it's been redecorated." [...] Ultimately, the media attention was so pervasive that Ostrum stopped answering his phone, and requested [...] "please, no more interviews." ...|$|E

500|$|On 4 October 1990, Peter Taylor died {{suddenly}} of pulmonary fibrosis while on holiday in Costa De Los Pinos, Majorca, {{at the age}} of 62. When told of Taylor's death by Ron Fenton, Clough apparently did not speak, put the phone down on him and cried heavily. He also, while very upset, made a phone call to the Taylor family. Clough attended the funeral eleven days later and dedicated his 1994 autobiography to Taylor saying [...] "To Peter. Still miss you badly. <b>You</b> <b>once</b> said: 'When you get shot of me there won't be as much laughter in your life'. You were right".|$|E
500|$|In {{one of the}} few {{negative}} reviews, Brian Gibson of Vue Weekly {{described the}} film as [...] "deadly dull" [...] and a [...] "visual overstatement". Other reviews criticised the decision to split the novel into two cinematic parts, with Ben Mortimer of The Daily Telegraph writing [...] "Deathly Hallows– Part 2 isn't a film. It's HALF a film... it's going to feel somewhat emotionless." [...] Other critics wrote of the film's runtime; Alonso Duralde from The Wrap said, [...] "If there's one substantial flaw to the film, it's that this cavalcade of people and places and objects can barely fit in the 130-minute running time." [...] Rebecca Gillie from The Oxford Student gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "at the end of [...] there is nothing that stays with <b>you</b> <b>once</b> you've left the cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|Seacole {{was proud}} of both her Jamaican and Scottish ancestry and called herself a Creole, a term that was {{commonly}} used in a racially neutral sense or {{to refer to the}} children of white settlers with indigenous women. In her autobiography, The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole, she records her bloodline thus: [...] "I am a Creole, and have good Scots blood coursing through my veins. My father was a soldier of an old Scottish family." [...] Legally, she was classified as a mulatto, a multiracial person with limited political rights; Robinson speculates that she may technically have been a quadroon. Seacole emphasises her personal vigour in her autobiography, distancing herself from the contemporary stereotype of the [...] "lazy Creole", She {{was proud of}} her black ancestry, writing, [...] "I have a few shades of deeper brown upon my skin which shows me related – and I am proud of the relationship – to those poor mortals whom <b>you</b> <b>once</b> held enslaved, and whose bodies America still owns." ...|$|E

500|$|Yet another {{interpretation}} is that Dylan is directing the farewell to himself, particularly his acoustic performer self. The opening line [...] "You must leave now" [...] {{can be a}} command, similar to the line [...] "Go away from my window" [...] that opens [...] "It Ain't Me, Babe". But {{it can also be}} an imperative, meaning just that it is necessary that you leave. And the song is as much about new beginnings as it is about endings. The song not only notes the requirement that Baby Blue leave, but also includes the hope that Baby Blue will move forward, in lines such as [...] "Strike another match, go start anew". If Dylan is singing the song to himself, then he himself would be the [...] "vagabond who's rapping at your door / standing in the clothes that <b>you</b> <b>once</b> wore". That is, the new, electric, surrealist Dylan would be the vagabond, not yet having removed the [...] "clothes" [...] of the old protest singer. Alternatively, the vagabond and [...] "stepping stones" [...] referenced in the song have been interpreted as Dylan's folk audience whom he needs to leave behind. He would also be telling himself to [...] "Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you." [...] Others to whom he may be saying farewell in the song are any of the women he had known, the political left or to the illusions of his youth.|$|E

2500|$|Xun You {{was known}} for being a highly {{profound}} and insightful thinker {{who was able to}} hide secrets very well. Since he started accompanying Cao Cao on his military campaigns, he has often helped Cao devise and develop strategic plans. Many people, including his family members and relatives, hardly knew what was on his mind or what he had said. The Wei Shu recorded that Xin Tao (辛韜), a maternal cousin of Xun <b>You,</b> <b>once</b> asked Xun You on why he urged Cao Cao to attack Ji Province. Xun You replied, [...] "Since Zuozhi has come on behalf of Yuan Tan to surrender, it's expected that the Imperial Army will go there to pacify the area. How would I know why?"

Lord Prefect Xun is benevolent and virtuous, he displays wisdom in recommending talents, his personal conduct is flawless, and he is capable of adapting his strategies to suit changes. Meng Ke once said, 'It is a rule that a true royal sovereign should arise in the course of five hundred years, and that during that time there should be men illustrious in their generation.' Lord Prefect Xun is one of such men.

2500|$|The song's melody {{grew out}} of some {{unstructured}} jamming on 7 January 1969 during rehearsal sessions on the sound stage at Twickenham Studios. Over the next few minutes, McCartney introduced some of the lyrics, reworking [...] "Get back to the place you should be" [...] from fellow Beatle George Harrison's [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] into [...] "Get back to where <b>you</b> <b>once</b> belonged". McCartney had played bass on Jackie Lomax's recording of [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] a few months earlier. On 9 January McCartney brought a more developed version of [...] "Get Back" [...] to the group, with the [...] "Sweet Loretta" [...] verse close to its finished version. For the press release to promote the [...] "Get Back" [...] single, McCartney wrote, [...] "We {{were sitting in the}} studio and we made it up out of thin air... we started to write words there and then... when we finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller-coast by." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 31 July 1948, Oksana Kasenkina, a Soviet {{citizen and}} a teacher to the {{children}} of diplomats of the Soviet mission to the United Nations, appealed to the editor of a Russian-language newspaper in New York City for refuge, and arrangements were made to take Kasenkina to Reed Farm in Valley Cottage, which was operated by the White Russian Tolstoy Foundation. Whilst at the Farm, Kasenkina wrote a letter to Soviet Consul-General Jacob Lomakin ending: [...] "I implore you, I implore <b>you</b> <b>once</b> more, don't let me perish here. I am without willpower." [...] On 7 August Lomakin with vice-consul Chepurnykh arrived at the farm. According to Tolstoy Foundation President Mrs. Alexandra Tolstaya, Kasenkina [...] "at her own free will" [...] went with them to the consulate. On 9 August, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Alexander Panyushkin presented a letter of protest to the United States Department of State, alleging that Kasenkina had been kidnapped and held against her will by members of the Tolstoy Foundation. On 11 August, Vyacheslav Molotov handed a protest note to United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union Walter Bedell Smith, in which the accusations were repeated.|$|E
