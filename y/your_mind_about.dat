Culture defines context and is the social totality that defines behavior, knowledge, beliefs and social learning. It is a set of shared values characterizing a specific organization. Fairhurst identifies culture as defining events, people, objects, and concepts. Communication and culture are intertwined. Shared language of a group links together individuals and joins common cultures. Culture influences mental models. [...] "Mental models" [...] are the images in <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> other people, yourself, substance and events.|$|E
2500|$|... Google Play {{features}} over 2.7 million Android applications. Users in over 145 {{countries can}} purchase apps, although Google notes on its support pages that [...] "Paid content {{may not be}} available in some provinces or territories, even if the governing country is listed above." [...] Developers in over 150 locations can distribute apps on Google Play, though not every location supports merchant registration. To distribute apps, developers {{have to pay a}} one-time $25 registration fee for a Google Play Developer Console account. App developers can control which countries an app is distributed to, as well as the pricing for the app and in-app purchases in each country. Developers receive 70% of the application price, while the remaining 30% goes to the distribution partner and operating fees. Developers can set up sales, with the original price striked out and a banner underneath informing users when the sale ends. Google Play allows developers to release early versions of apps to a select group of users, as alpha or beta tests. Developers can also release apps through staged rollouts, in which [...] "your update reaches only a percentage of your users, which you can increase over time." [...] Users can pre-order select apps (as well as movies, music, books, and games) to have the items delivered as soon as they are available. Some network carriers offer billing for Google Play purchases, allowing users to opt for charges in the monthly phone bill rather than on credit cards. Users can request refunds within 48 hours after a purchase if [...] "something you bought isn't working, isn't what you expected, was bought by accident, or you changed <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the purchase". Apps meeting specific usability requirements can qualify as an Android Wear app.|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well, Gerald, {{if you and}} Bob {{have made}} up <b>your</b> <b>minds</b> <b>about</b> it, it is no use my saying no. I am sure I don't {{want to make a}} mollycoddle, as you call it, of him. Of course, uncle will blame me, if any harm comes of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|As we rode off Rube shouted out, 'If {{you change}} <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> again <b>about</b> {{coming with me}} to Missouri, you just drop me a line, Pepita.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Notwithstanding which," [...] said Mr. Bucket, [...] "you get {{a little}} {{doubtful}} and uncomfortable in <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> it, having a very tender mind of your own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Home! Soon {{you will}} have no home to go to except mine--that is, if you don't change <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> me. I have power here--don't you understand? I have power." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It is {{not usually}} advisable,” said Appleby with a smile. “Still, if you change <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the caña {{you can come up}} to the hacienda and ask for me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Kaims!" [...] exclaimed {{the doctor}} {{suddenly}} enlightened. [...] "Pooh! you only mean the Egyptian. Rob, make <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> easy <b>about</b> this. I {{know why he}} met her there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{only one}} answer to that," [...] John insisted cheerfully. [...] "I {{am going to}} lend you fifty pounds while you make <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> up <b>about</b> the young man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With regard, now, to {{the person}} who is the object of these inquiries," [...] he resumed. [...] "Are you {{thoroughly}} clear in <b>your</b> own <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> what you want to know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now tell me," [...] he began, {{as soon as}} Jarvis had disappeared, [...] "what {{is there}} {{at the back of}} <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> my {{presence}} there at Market Burnham that night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't judge. Perhaps I {{really wanted}} to be agreed with. When you have no good ground for making up <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> a thing, it's {{pleasant}} to find your conclusions confirmed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not hurry about marrying. I've {{wondered}} that a {{girl could}} make up her mind to marry any given man. Haven't you ever wished that you had not made up <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, miss," [...] Moran answered. [...] "You {{just make}} <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> easy <b>about</b> Mrs. Fletcher; and now, Lorimer, we'll talk business. You'll {{want a new}} binder if you're putting in much of a crop, and I've got the latest {{machines}} coming in from Toronto." ...|$|R
60|$|There is a {{tremendous}} point there. It can be put into {{the form of a}} maxim: Get <b>your</b> formalities right--never <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the moralities.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{give it to}} him, make <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> easy <b>about</b> that," [...] said Charlie, with {{an ominous}} {{doubling}} up of his fist. [...] "But Rose isn't dangerously ill, is she?" [...] he added anxiously, as Aunt Plenty was seen to trot across the upper hall, shaking a bottle violently as she went.|$|R
6000|$|... "At twelve o'clock precisely, then," [...] was the reply. [...] "I shall hope {{to induce}} {{you to change}} <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> luncheon. It's {{quite a long time}} since we had you at the club. Good-by!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know that, John; but, if you'll take my advice, you'll {{find out}} the truth at once. She has no children, and if you've made up <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> it, you'll do no good by delay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lily,' said Miss Mohun, as {{the elders}} {{walked to the}} house together, 'it strikes me that Rotherwood could satisfy <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> that letter. He would know the handwriting. You {{remember}} a certain brother--very much in law--of Maurice's?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Cleon {{began by}} {{questioning}} {{the worth of}} a democracy: “Personally I have had occasion often enough already to observe that a democracy is incapable of governing others, and I am all the more convinced of this when I see how you are now changing <b>your</b> <b>minds</b> <b>about</b> the Mytilenians.” [...] He also implied the Athenians have become jaded by sophist oratory and questioned the worth of free speech. He described the Athenians as “victims of their own pleasure in listening, and are more like an audience sitting {{at the feet of}} a professional lecturer than a parliament discussing matters of state.” He finishes his speech by urging the populace to not [...] "be traitors to your own selves." ...|$|R
5000|$|David Parkinson of Empire {{rated the}} film {{four out of}} five stars and called it [...] "one of those films where it doesn't really matter what gets written here - you will have made <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> up <b>about</b> Babs one way or the other, but for the rare uninitiated, this is a fine {{introduction}} to her talents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Paul," [...] said Israel, shortly afterwards, [...] "you changed <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> rather queerly <b>about</b> {{catching}} that craft. But {{you thought}} she was drawing us too far up into the land, I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, father," [...] said Tom, {{in answer}} to the gaze. [...] "You needn't trouble <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> {{business}} until you are quite well; everything is settled about that for the present,--about the mill and {{the land and the}} debts." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a little}} {{conversation}} up-stairs between Mrs. Carbuncle and Lucinda, when they were free from the attendance of their joint maid. [...] "It seems to me," [...] said Mrs. Carbuncle, [...] "that you won't make up <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which is {{the same}} as sayin' that you've changed <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> goin' out scoutin'?" [...] he cried sharply, looking me {{squarely}} in the face. [...] "There is no reason why you should go if the job isn't to your likin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} paid every week for what you have done," [...] the young man said. [...] "You won't get another penny out of me, so you set <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> at rest <b>about</b> that." ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{calculate}} intensity, {{a patient}} {{may be asked}} [...] "How much do these memories bother you" [...] and [...] "Are you able to {{put them out of}} <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> and think <b>about</b> something else." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{following}} Letters {{were written}} to Mr. Thomas Dixon, a working cork-cutter of Sunderland, during the agitation for Reform {{in the spring}} of the present year. They contain, in the plainest terms I could use, the substance of what I then desired to say to our English workmen, which was briefly this:--"The reform you desire may give you more influence in Parliament; but your influence there will of course be useless to you,--perhaps worse than useless, until you have wisely made up <b>your</b> <b>minds</b> what you wish Parliament to do for you; and when you have made up <b>your</b> <b>minds</b> <b>about</b> that, you will find, not only that you can do it for yourselves, without the intervention of Parliament; but that eventually nobody but yourselves can do it. And to help you, as far as one of your old friends may, in so making up <b>your</b> <b>minds,</b> such and such things are what {{it seems to me you}} should ask for, and, moreover, strive for with your heart and might." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, my dear,' he said, 'we {{will get}} him, {{and his father}} and mother, to come down {{as soon as he}} gets home. As you have made up <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> it, it is only right that you should have the first chance.' ...|$|E
6000|$|After a silence, {{in which}} they were talking of themselves, he burst out: [...] "But I don't see how Paris could help 'preciating you. I'll bet you're one of the best artists they ever saw.... The way you made up a picture in <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> that juggler!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, please yourselves," [...] {{said the}} skipper; [...] "but mind, no hanky-panky, no coming for drink when my back’s turned; this cask’ll be watched; {{but if you}} do alter <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the beef you can tell the cook to get it for you any time you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Robin," [...] said I, {{breaking}} silence again, {{and using}} the name which had by that time grown familiar, [...] "have you made up <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> yet <b>about</b> taking service with Dr McTougall? Now that we have got Mrs Jones engaged and paid to look after granny, she {{will be able to}} get on pretty well without you, and you shall have time to run over and see her frequently." ...|$|R
30|$|So, here we’re {{going to}} pause the video, and we’re {{going to get}} you to come up with your own example of {{thoughts}} when <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> was moving <b>about</b> freely. The example should be different from the ones that were just mentioned.|$|R
5000|$|Grego Applegate Edwards {{described}} his 2014 release, Sakura Sakura, as [...] "very vibrant free rock, {{a sort of}} Ascension in the metal zone. It is bracing. You will either gravitate towards it by predisposition or not. And that {{has something to do}} with <b>your</b> open <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> a free metal blast or the opposite.". For many years, Edwards played only jazz drums, but recently has started playing rock and punk.|$|R
