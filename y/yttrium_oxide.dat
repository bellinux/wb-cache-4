5|$|Annual world {{production}} of <b>yttrium</b> <b>oxide</b> had reached 600tonnes by 2001; by 2014 it had increased to 7,000 tons. Global reserves of <b>yttrium</b> <b>oxide</b> were estimated in 2014 {{to be more}} than 500,000 tons. The leading countries for these reserves included Australia, Brazil, China, India, and the United States. Only a few tonnes of yttrium metal are produced each year by reducing yttrium fluoride to a metal sponge with calcium magnesium alloy. The temperature of an arc furnace of greater than 1,600°C is sufficient to melt the yttrium.|$|E
5|$|The first {{historical}} {{application of}} lanthanum was in gas lantern mantles. Carl Auer von Welsbach used {{a mixture of}} 60% magnesium oxide, 20% lanthanum oxide, and 20% <b>yttrium</b> <b>oxide,</b> which he called Actinophor and patented in 1885. The original mantles gave a green-tinted light and were not very successful, and his first company, which established a factory in Atzgersdorf in 1887, failed in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium {{has been}} studied as a nodulizer in ductile cast iron, forming the {{graphite}} into compact nodules instead of flakes to increase ductility and fatigue resistance. Having a high melting point, <b>yttrium</b> <b>oxide</b> is used in some ceramic and glass to impart shock resistance and low thermal expansion properties. Those same properties make such glass useful in camera lenses.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} transmission {{electron microscopy}} analysis has revealed that small additions of yttrium hydride to a powder metallurgy Ti- 2. 25 Mo- 1. 5 Fe alloy resulted {{in the formation of}} both chlorine-free <b>yttrium</b> <b>oxides</b> and essentially oxygen-free <b>yttrium</b> chlorides. The <b>oxides</b> and chlorides showed distinctly different morphologies and spatial distribution. Yttrium acted as a potent getter for both oxygen and chlorine. Additionally, the beta-Ti phase was free of nanoscaled alpha-Ti in the presence of yttrium. These microstructural changes contribute to the substantially increased ductility (similar to 90 %) ...|$|R
5|$|Lanthanum oxide {{is a white}} solid {{that can}} be {{prepared}} by direct reaction of its constituent elements. Due to the large size of the La3+ ion, La2O3 adopts a hexagonal 7-coordinate structure that changes to the 6-coordinate structure of scandium oxide (Sc2O3) and <b>yttrium</b> <b>oxide</b> (Y2O3) at high temperature. When it reacts with water, lanthanum hydroxide is formed: {{a lot of heat}} is evolved in the reaction and a hissing sound is heard. Lanthanum hydroxide will react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form the basic carbonate.|$|E
25|$|Although {{a number}} of {{artificial}} garnets were successfully grown, only two became important as diamond simulants. The first was yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG; Y3Al5O12) in the late 1960s. It was (and still is) produced by the Czochralski, or crystal-pulling, process, which involves growth from the melt. An iridium crucible surrounded by an inert atmosphere is used, wherein <b>yttrium</b> <b>oxide</b> and aluminium oxide are melted and mixed together at a carefully controlled temperature near 1980nbsp&°C. A small seed crystal {{is attached to a}} rod, which is lowered over the crucible until the crystal contacts the surface of the melted mixture. The seed crystal acts as a site of nucleation; the temperature is kept steady at a point where the surface of the mixture is just below the melting point. The rod is slowly and continuously rotated and retracted, and the pulled mixture crystallizes as it exits the crucible, forming a single crystal {{in the form of a}} cylindrical boule. The crystal's purity is extremely high, and it typically measures 5nbsp&cm (2nbsp&inches) in diameter and 20nbsp&cm (8nbsp&inches) in length, and weighs 9,000 carats (1.75nbsp&kg).|$|E
500|$|The red {{component}} of color television cathode ray tubes is typically emitted from an yttria (...) or <b>yttrium</b> <b>oxide</b> sulfide (...) host lattice doped with europium (III) cation (Eu3+) phosphors. The red color itself is emitted from the europium while the yttrium collects {{energy from the}} electron gun and passes it to the phosphor. Yttrium compounds can serve as host lattices for doping with different lanthanide cations. Tb3+ {{can be used as}} a doping agent to produce green luminescence. As such yttrium compounds such as yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) are useful for phosphors and are an important {{component of}} white LED light bulbs.|$|E

500|$|In 1843, Carl Gustaf Mosander {{found that}} samples of yttria {{contained}} three oxides: white <b>yttrium</b> <b>oxide</b> (yttria), yellow terbium oxide (confusingly, this was called 'erbia' at the time) and rose-colored erbium oxide (called 'terbia' at the time). A fourth oxide, ytterbium oxide, was isolated in 1878 by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac. New elements were later isolated {{from each of}} those oxides, and each element was named, in some fashion, after Ytterby, the village near the quarry where they were found (see ytterbium, terbium, and erbium). In the following decades, seven other new metals were discovered in [...] "Gadolin's yttria". Since yttria {{was found to be}} a mineral and not an oxide, Martin Heinrich Klaproth renamed it gadolinite in honor of Gadolin.|$|E
500|$|One {{method for}} obtaining pure yttrium from the mixed oxide ores is to {{dissolve}} the oxide in sulfuric acid and fractionate it by ion exchange chromatography. With the addition of oxalic acid, the yttrium oxalate precipitates. The oxalate is converted into the oxide by heating under oxygen. By reacting the resulting <b>yttrium</b> <b>oxide</b> with hydrogen fluoride, yttrium fluoride is obtained. [...] When quaternary ammonium salts are used as extractants, most yttrium {{will remain in the}} aqueous phase. [...] When the counter-ion is nitrate, the light lanthanides are removed, and when the counter-ion is thiocyanate, the heavy lanthanides are removed. In this way, yttrium salts of 99.999% purity are obtained. In the usual situation, where yttrium is in a mixture that is two-thirds heavy-lanthanide, yttrium should be removed as soon as possible to facilitate the separation of the remaining elements.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, {{among the}} {{anhydrous}} rare-earth phosphates, {{it is the}} tetragonal mineral xenotime that incorporates yttrium and the yttrium earths, whereas the monoclinic monazite phase incorporates cerium and the cerium earths preferentially. The smaller size of the yttrium group allows it a greater solid solubility in the rock-forming minerals that comprise Earth's mantle, and thus yttrium and the yttrium earths show less enrichment in Earth's crust relative to chondritic abundance than does cerium and the cerium earths. This has economic consequences: large ore bodies of the cerium earths are known {{around the world and}} are being exploited. Corresponding ore bodies for yttrium tend to be rarer, smaller, and less concentrated. Most of the current supply of yttrium originates in the [...] "ion-absorption clay" [...] ores of Southern China. Some versions provide concentrates containing about 65% <b>yttrium</b> <b>oxide,</b> with the heavy lanthanides being present in ratios reflecting the Oddo–Harkins rule: even-numbered heavy lanthanides at abundances of about 5% each, and odd-numbered lanthanides at abundances of about 1% each. Similar compositions are found in xenotime or gadolinite.|$|E

50|$|Very {{aggressive}} environments require novel materials {{approaches in}} order to combat declines in mechanical properties over time. One method {{researchers have sought to}} use is introducing features to stabilize displaced atoms. This can be done by adding grain boundaries, oversized solutes or small oxide dispersants to minimize defect movement. By doing this, there would be less radiation-induced segregation of elements, which would in turn lead to more ductile grain boundaries and less intergranular stress corrosion cracking. Blocking dislocation and defect movement would also help to increase the resistance to radiation assisted creep. Attempts have been reported of instituting <b>yttrium</b> <b>oxides</b> to block dislocation motion, but it was found that technological implementation posed a greater challenge than expected. Further research is required to continue improving the radiation damage resistance of structural materials used in nuclear power plants.|$|R
