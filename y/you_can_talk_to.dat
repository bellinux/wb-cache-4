500|$|Duncan Preston (who {{appeared}} in Wood's 1981 teleplay Happy Since I Met You) {{was cast in}} weekly roles. He had even turned down {{the chance to play}} Shakespeare and an offer of a world tour as Hotspur in Henry IV, Part One at the same time. Preston later said, [...] "I was at a crossroads and I had the choice of going straight or going off at a tangent with Victoria, I chose the latter and she changed my life". Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] – a documentary presenter – and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is fair enough, but it does mean that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly the sort of man who likes women, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment". Preston said he was cast [...] "because I was so tall".|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Keegan's {{affairs with}} me arn't any affairs of yours, Captain Ussher. When I {{ask you to}} set them right, then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me about them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{never be}} allowed to take you to Uhrig's Cave, or {{anywhere}} else, again," [...] he replied. [...] "I'll come to-morrow evening, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It isn't {{patience}} I want, God knows; it's lungs {{to speak}} loud enough. But you'll {{be at home}} yourself, I suppose, this morning; and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her for me.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not at all. I can eat, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me. Take {{a cup of}} tea at any rate." [...] The Earl rang {{for another}} teacup, and began to butter his toast.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They've {{no thought}} for anything,' said Emmie with contempt. 'You {{go up and}} get dressed, our Matilda. I don't care about him. I can see to things, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him. I shan't.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Mamma,' said Hetta jumping up, 'how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{me in that}} way? As soon as one man doesn't suit, I am to {{give myself}} to another! Oh, mamma, how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> propose it? Nothing on earth will ever induce me to be more to Roger Carbury than I am now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am an {{outsider}} here," [...] {{he said with}} blunt directness; [...] "but perhaps that's a reason why <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me candidly. It's sometimes embarrassing to tell one's intimate friends about one's troubles. Why did you want the money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you let me}} return to-morrow,--just for a few days,--and then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him as you please. I did {{not mean}} to come to stay. I wished him good-bye because I knew that I should not meet him here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Devine made {{a little}} gesture of indifference. [...] "Then, if you should want a few dollars at any time {{you know where to}} come for them.

6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is a very good plan, Osgod. You had best see your father in the morning, and if he {{consents}} to your having the boy, bring him down to the river-bank behind the abbey, where I will be awaiting <b>you,</b> and <b>can</b> there <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him without observation. You are sure that he can be trusted to keep silence regarding what I tell him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where <b>you</b> are. I <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> better {{like this}} {{than when you}} were inside... It was so kind and tender of you to give up half a day's work to come to see me! ... You are Joseph the dreamer of dreams, dear Jude. And a tragic Don Quixote. And {{sometimes}} you are St. Stephen, who, while they were stoning him, could see Heaven opened. Oh, my poor friend and comrade, you'll suffer yet!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means. I {{will call}} {{them up and}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them. But I advise you {{to be careful of}} what you say. The Rover boys come from a family that is rich, and they can make it {{exceedingly}} warm for you if you accuse them wrongfully." ...|$|E
6000|$|Merril smiled curiously. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it's {{a little}} {{difficult}} {{to be sure of}} anything, and as the man will be here very shortly <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him yourself. That, however, will not straighten anything out. The question is, {{what is to be done}} about the wagon-road?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-morning, Mr. Rooper," [...] said Asaph, in a {{loud and}} cheery voice. [...] "I suppose you've come to talk to Mrs. McJimsey about the work you've got to do here to make this house fit to live in. But there ain't no Mrs. McJimsey.

6000|$|However, on this {{occasion}} it was dark earlier than usual, {{on account of the}} clouds and the rain; and the waiter came to light the gas over the table where our party were at supper, before they finished their meal, although it was only a little more than half past nine. This made it very bright and cheerful in the corner, and Mr. George proposed that they should all stay there one hour. [...] "I will write," [...] said he, [...] "and you may read in your books. We will stay here till half past ten, and then, after you have gone <b>to</b> bed, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> yourselves <b>to</b> sleep by telling each other what you have read about in your books." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'His kid's ill, poor chap,' he said briefly. 'Pretty badly too, {{from what}} I can gather. Pneumonia. Waller was up all night. He oughtn't {{to be here}} at all today. He doesn't know what he's doing half the time. He's {{absolutely}} fagged out. Look here, you'd better nip back and do {{as much of the}} work as <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> I shouldn't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him much if I were you. Buck along.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can stay}} here, Everard, can't I, until {{you come up}} to bed?" [...] she pleaded. [...] "And then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sit and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me, and tell me who is here and all about the people. You {{have no idea how}} much better I am. All my music has come back to me, and they say that I play bridge ever so well. I shall love to help you entertain." ...|$|R
