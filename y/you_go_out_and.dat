British organist James Taylor said the Hammond [...] "became popular [...] when people such as Booker T. & the M.G.'s and artists on the Stax Records label came over to London and played gigs." [...] Matthew Fisher first {{encountered}} the Hammond in 1966, having heard the Small Faces' Ian McLagan playing one. When Fisher {{asked if he could}} play it, McLagan told him, [...] "They're yelling out for Hammond players; why don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> buy one for yourself?" [...] Fisher went on to play the organ lines on Procol Harum's [...] "A Whiter Shade of Pale", which topped the UK charts in the summer of 1967. Steve Winwood started his musical career with the Spencer Davis Group playing guitar and piano, but he switched to Hammond when he hired one to record [...] "Gimme Some Lovin'".|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson felt a deep bond {{of sympathy}} {{with the people of}} Jarrow and the loss of the {{shipyard}} which was the life-source of the town. [...] Early in 1934 she led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby Seaham constituency. She records {{that at the end of}} the meeting MacDonald said to her: [...] "Ellen, why don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> preach socialism, which is the only remedy for all this?" [...] This [...] "priceless remark", she says, brought home the [...] "reality and sham... of that warm but so easy sympathy". She became Jarrow's MP [...] in the general election of November 1935, when she won the seat with a majority of 2,360. In the opening debate of the new parliamentary session, on 9 December 1935, she pleaded on behalf of her new constituents: [...] "These are skilled fitters, men who have built destroyers and battleships and the finest passenger ships... The years go on and nothing is done... this is a desperately urgent matter and [...] something should be done to get work to these areas which, Heaven knows, want work." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Till the World Ends" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Dr. Luke and Max Martin, with additional writing by American recording artist Kesha and Alexander Kronlund, and additional production by Billboard. In {{an interview for}} Spin on February 11, 2011, Kesha announced she had co-written the song with Luke and Martin for Femme Fatale. She explained it was inspired by [...] "me imagining [...] and any female musician touring the world. When <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> you're having an amazing, magical night and you don't {{want to go to}} sleep and you want it to last until the world ends." [...] On March 2, 2011, the single's cover art, in which Spears appears sitting on a couch in a sweater and heels, was posted at Deezer.com.

Following the announcement, Kesha spoke to MTV News stating that [...] "I consider myself a songwriter before and above everything else, so it's an honor to write for one of pop music's biggest icons." [...] During an interview with Seacrest, Spears described [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] as [...] "fun. I like it. It's good energy. [...] I'm a vibe person, and I think I love good-mood songs, and if it puts me in a good mood, it clicks for me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, really,' said Sheila, 'it {{seems very}} {{difficult}} to get at the truth sometimes. And when illness is in the house I cannot understand why there should be no one available to answer the door. You must have left it ajar, unsecured, when <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out.</b> <b>And</b> pray, what if Dr Ferguson had been some common tramp? That would have been a nice thing.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Evans' heroin {{addiction}} {{began in the}} late 1950s, and increased following LaFaro's death. His girlfriend Ellaine was also an addict. Evans habitually had to borrow money from friends, and eventually, his electricity and telephone services were shut down. Evans said, [...] "You don't understand. It's like death and transfiguration. Every day you wake in pain like death and then <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> score, and that is transfiguration. Each day becomes all of life in microcosm." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tinderbox {{would be}} later hailed by Jean-Benoît Dunckel of Air. He {{selected}} Tinderbox for his [...] "5 albums forever" [...] list, saying, [...] "They played so well together; I saw them in concert and I never forgot that moment". Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle rated {{it as his}} all-time favourite album [...] Howerdel described it as [...] "one of the spookiest records I've ever heard. Some of the songs on there have such a dense atmosphere. Sometimes when I'm stuck, I'll listen to that. It's like sometimes when you have no inspiration and <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> look at the moon, that's kind of what that record is for me". Jenny Lee Lindberg [...] of Warpaint cited the band among her influences, {{as well as the}} song [...] "Umbrella", initially included in the track listing of the 1986 CD version. She said: [...] "This is a song that my husband and I bonded over – we’d definitely heard it individually before, but one day we were just playing the album and that song stopped us in our tracks… played it on repeat for the whole night. I understand why some people can hear a little Siouxsie in what we do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gartside's {{change in}} beliefs {{directly}} affected {{the music and}} particularly the lyrics of Songs to Remember. In one interview with NME in October 1981 he told the paper, [...] "The politics have moved from an essentialist and reductionist position in which we believed in a history of science which could {{make sense of the}} future to one that realized that what you've got is needs, demands, and desires, and <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> you fight for them. Which means that your music will at points be indexed fairly clearly to Politics with a big 'P' and at other points will cut across it completely." [...] In another interview with The Face the following year Gartside said, [...] "My loss has been political conviction, the idea of a correct understanding of the past, present and future (Marxism). I've always been obsessively concerned that my understanding of political truth should be scientifically grounded. Many songs [...] are about what happens when the anchor points of political, moral or religious understanding fall away." [...] For example, he stated that the track [...] "Faithless" [...] was about [...] "how living without faith brings you both happiness and sadness. I've never had any religion, except maybe politics, although I am interested in having some means of achieving social order and progress." ...|$|E

I knew the hour <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> I {{have been waiting for}} you. You are a doomed man. I have the Plague, and I have breathed in your face. Before twenty-four hours have passed you will be, as I am, a dying man. That is a good piece of vengeance. You may be a better swordsman than I am, but you can't fight with the Plague." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They asked questions, monsieur, {{on every}} {{conceivable}} subject," [...] Pierre continued. [...] "Their interest in your doings was amazing. They asked what meals you {{took in the}} house, at what hour <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> at what hour you returned. Then the shorter of the two wished to take the room above yours. I asked him {{more than double the}} price, but he would have engaged it. Then I told him that I was not sure. There was a gentleman to whom it was offered. They come back this afternoon to know the result." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{said he felt}} {{a little}} lonely after <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> he thought it might cheer him up if {{he went to the}} club. I was to tell you where he had <b>gone</b> if <b>you</b> asked what had become of him. He said it kindly and pleasantly--quite like himself, sir. But, when he came back--if you'll excuse my saying so--I never saw a man in a worse temper. 'Tell my brother I am obliged to him for his hospitality, and I won't take {{advantage}} of it any longer.' That was Mr. Herbert's message. I tried to say a word. He banged the door, and away he went." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{me answer}} your last {{question}} first, sir," [...] the intruder begged. [...] "I was seated alone, several tables away, {{when the couple}} next to <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> having had {{pointed out to me}} the other evening at Claridge's Hotel, and knowing well by repute, the great barrister, Mr. Francis Ledsam, and his friend the world-famed novelist, Mr. Andrew Wilmore, I--er--unobtrusively made my way, half a yard at a time, in your direction--and here I am. I came stealthily, you may object? Without a doubt. If I had come in any other fashion, I should have disturbed a conversation in which I was much interested." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'The {{doctor is}} still with him,' said Mr. Macrae; 'a case of {{concussion}} of the brain, he says it is. But <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> take the air, you must be careful of yourself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Checkers. No, I won't. Can't a man {{who works}} hard all day have a little rest when he comes home? Why don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> play with the other kids on the sidewalk?" ...|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} of his 70th {{birthday}} Jones gave an explanation of his motives for creating the sculptures: [...] "I was living in Chelsea and I had an interest in the female figure and the sexual charge that comes from it. Every Saturday on the King's Road <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> skirts were shorter, the body was being displayed in some new way. And you knew that the following week somebody would up the ante... I was reflecting on and commenting on exactly the same situation that was the source of the feminist movement.
