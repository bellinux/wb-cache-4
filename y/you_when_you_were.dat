500|$|The Houston Astros officially retired Bagwell's jersey number 5 on August 26, 2007, {{prior to}} the start of a game versus the Pittsburgh Pirates. [...] He was the eighth player in Astros history to have his number retired. [...] Two of Bagwell's closest friends and former teammates, Biggio and Brad Ausmus, spoke on his behalf. [...] Said Ausmus, [...] "He was the quintessential teammate. [...] He was a superstar who always put the team before himself. [...] And between he and Bidge (Biggio), they always {{shouldered}} the blame we struggled and tried to deflect the credit when we won." [...] Yastrzemski, Bagwell's childhood hero, delivered a special message: [...] "Congratulations, Jeff, on your number being retired. [...] I begged the Red Sox not to trade <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in the minors with us. [...] Boston's loss was Houston's gain. [...] See you in Cooperstown." [...] Three first bases were used in the game, each embossed with a commemorative insignia and inscription, [...] "No. 5, Jeff Bagwell jersey retirement, Aug. 26, 2007." [...] One was given to Bagwell and the other two were auctioned to raise funds on behalf of the Astros in Action Foundation.|$|E

I always tell them I never was a 'capital-L Libertarian.' I am still 'small-l.' Itâ€™s a philosophy to me, not a party." [...] Elder supported presidential candidates Harry Browne in 2000, George W. Bush in 2004, and John McCain in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Connolly credits one of John Bradshaw's {{publications}} {{with helping}} him {{deal with his}} past demons. [...] "He reckons that if this trauma happened to <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> five or six then, emotionally, that part of you remains five or six. And {{what you have to}} do is carry that five- or six-year-old around with you and try and emotionally help that other part of you. It sounds a bit airy-fairy, but I think he's something of a genius, Mr. Bradshaw." ...|$|E
