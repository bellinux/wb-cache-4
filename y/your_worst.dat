He warned them, [...] "I can be your best friend or <b>your</b> <b>worst</b> enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E

Entire families perished and the death rate is extremely high. This is unacceptable, terrible and very grave.

In the Tibetan regions, the masses are living in such poverty that the elderly and children are dying of starvation or are so weak that {{they are unable to}} fight off diseases and they die.

2500|$|Pro ranking {{points are}} similar to the National {{armateur}} points awards. [...] "A" [...] Pros get the equivalent of National Intermediate points. i.e. 120 for first, 100 points for second etc. [...] "AA" [...] Pro get Expert equivalent points i.e. 240 for first etc. Both like in the amateur classes get participant points if the racer makes the Main. The person with the most points in a season will be District Pro #1, the same is true to become state Pro #1. However, on the national level not only you must receive the most points, you must race in at least 10 nationals plus the Grand Nationals, the ABA's multi-day season ending event, for the best 10 of your finishes will go toward your national rankings. For example, if you participate in 13 national events, your best 10 will be considered and <b>your</b> <b>worst</b> three disregarded. You must meet this qualification on the national level to wear National numbers one though ten on your number plate the following year.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the review}} {{aggregator}} Metacritic, the film {{had an average}} score of 25 out of 100, based on 32 reviews from professional critics. At Rotten Tomatoes, 22% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 122 reviews. The film earned generally negative reviews from movie critics, although some praised Lopez's performance. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said Lopez [...] "holds the screen in a star performance that {{has less to do}} with acting than with embodying a forceful, streetwise woman who stands up for herself", while commenting that its preview had [...] "audience gasping" [...] and [...] "Enough does a better job than most movies of sustaining a mood of palpable physical menace, then confirming <b>your</b> <b>worst</b> fears". On the other hand, Alice King of Entertainment Weekly described the film's plot as [...] "arduously nonsensical" [...] and felt that Lopez lacked connection with her on-screen daughter Tessa Allen, commenting that: [...] "All this to protect a helium-voiced little girl with whom Lopez has so little chemistry, it's as if she's handling garbage rather than a small child." [...] A writer from Contactmusic.com was underwhelmed with the development of the film, noting that the film doesn't [...] "utilize Slim's old friend and romantic interest enough, nor does it develop Slim's real and adopted fathers" [...] while it [...] "uses the tiresome old [...] "kid" [...] cliché. Gracie is, as always, just old enough to understand the situation, but not quite old enough to make an actual impact in the story." [...] However, the writer did praise Lopez in the end sequence, [...] "By the final scenes, despite their obviousness, I was as engrossed in the movie as I could have been, actually rooting for J. Lo to kick some bad guy butt". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Lopez has an image of being sexy and tough, but her appeal as an actress is that she's down to earth and that her emotions are accessible. There's nothing cold about her." [...] Additionally, LaSalle felt that [...] "It's the most tension-producing movie out there right now", stating that [...] "it has the biggest visceral kick, capable of inspiring blood lust in otherwise peaceful viewers.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Stewart Mason of AllMusic gave Balboa Fun*Zone 3 stars out of 5 {{and said that}} Soto and Rikk Agnew's split songwriting and vocal performances [...] "give the album an appealingly varied sound that ranges from the anthemic rocker 'Just Like Before' to the engagingly loose, Johnny Thunders-like 'It's Tattoo Time'. Best of the lot are the two entirely different tunes named after the album title, the smoking hardcore 'Balboa Fun Zone (Riot on the Beach)" [...] and the much poppier, '60s-inspired 'Balboa Fun Zone (It's in <b>Your</b> Touch)'. <b>Worst</b> of the lot is a sloppy, basically pointless cover of John Lennon's 'Instant Karma!' Although there's little that truly stands out besides Agnew's anti-drug anthem 'Alone Against the World', the album is so consistently rocking and good-humored that it's a more entertaining listen than their uneven earlier records." ...|$|R
