What <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as we were}} going up {{yesterday}} afternoon to dress--what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> then is responsible for it. And since it comes to that," [...] I pursued, [...] "I make out for myself now that you're not detached either--unless, that is, simply detached from me. I had indeed a suspicion of that as I passed through the room there." ...|$|E
60|$|I never knew. I used {{to weigh}} every word <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> You never {{gave me a}} sign.|$|E
6000|$|... "One word. Has it any {{connection}} with what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{on that last}} night, {{when we had a}} talk together on spiritualism?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thought no evil of you, George,--except {{that you}} were changed <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> When <b>you</b> came, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Do <b>you</b> not remember?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I think that's {{the nicest}} thing <b>you</b> ever <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> Only, of course, I {{should like to}} think I'm more of the Greek type--pagan, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is a dream-like country, and I never {{imagined}} anything so beautiful. And {{yet it is}} familiar. Do you remember what <b>you</b> once <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at Lone Hollow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I told Ana aught {{that he did}} not know? Did not Ana {{hear the}} last words <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the temple of Amon at Tanis?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} indeed to hear that," [...] I returned. [...] "You know, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{was this the}} {{mistress}} of Bleak House. And I said, yes." ...|$|E
60|$|GERALD. [To LORD ILLINGWORTH.] Do {{speak to}} my mother, Lord Illingworth, before {{you go into the}} music-room. She seems to think, somehow, you don't mean what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} what <b>you</b> once <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about your bosom being on fire," [...] pursued Frank. [...] "I suppose the fire {{has not been}} got under yet, has it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will bear}} your {{instructions}} in mind, father, and indeed they accord with what <b>you</b> before <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and which I {{determined to make}} a guide to my conduct." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Guy, then," [...] she continued, with {{something}} {{very much like}} a blush, [...] "forget all that <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> at any rate for the present. Perhaps later on, when this is all over--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About your height, too, he was," [...] mused the constable. [...] "I {{hope for}} your sake you havenâ€™t been saying to anybody else what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was quite}} beyond me to {{understand}} what she meant. I took a chair, and sat down by her. 'I only know what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> yesterday,' I answered.|$|E
6000|$|Rose had stopped, and in {{the middle}} of the square they stood looking at each other. [...] "Do you {{remember}} what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the last time I saw you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She made, at this, a {{movement}} that drew his eyes to her own, {{and for a moment}} she dimly smiled at him. [...] "That's the nicest thing <b>you</b> ever <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But ever, EVER, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In what way?" [...] she demanded. [...] "I judge {{only by the}} facts, {{the things}} <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> your accusations against Captain Granet. Why should you go {{out of your way}} to {{investigate}} cases of suspected espionage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't feel up <b>to</b> it," [...] <b>said</b> Dorian, listlessly. [...] "But I am awfully {{obliged to}} you for all that <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>You</b> are {{certainly}} my best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I {{really to}} understand, sir," [...] he asked, [...] "that you are serious in what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> last November? Are you {{actually}} resolved to bind me to that incomprehensible condition?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{was not so}} bound before what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the {{shrubbery}} last night? Remember, John, it was {{but last}} night. Have I had a moment to speak to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|JONES. And I said to you, [...] "I'm a bloomin' Conservative," [...] I said; an' <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "You {{look more}} like one of these 'ere Socialists. Take wotever you like," [...] you said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I can; and I do like it, and I {{mean to do}} it. But it isn't {{only about}} that I've come to speak <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>said</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to-day, before Honyman, that was very improper." ...|$|R
60|$|LORD GORING. That is {{the first}} unkind thing <b>you</b> have ever <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> How charmingly <b>you</b> <b>said</b> it! Ten to-morrow.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, I don't mean that. I {{have heard}} that so often, only since breakfast, that it has lost all sense. I mean some of those unexpected, charming things that <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a month ago at Saint Cecilia's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you were}} forever vowing {{that you would}} marry a nobleman, my lady. For <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> once that I should call you so, and ride in the coach with the coroneted panels when I came home on a visit." ...|$|E
60|$|BLUNTSCHLI. If {{you were}} twenty-three when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> those things <b>to</b> <b>me</b> this afternoon, I shall take them seriously.|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[Sharply--raising the {{revolver}} in her hand.] Careful now! Don't try getting too close. I heard what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you'd do <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I! I {{always liked}} you. After what <b>you</b> have just <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I should be insensible indeed if I didn't respect and admire you as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is perhaps}} very foolish {{of me to}} come here," [...] she said, [...] "but I have never quite {{forgotten}} what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the tea-room. It was probably nonsense. If so, please tell me, and let me go." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Goodman, who {{had been}} growing quietly indignant, {{notwithstanding}} a vigorous use of her fan, at this said. 'Fie, fie, Paula! you did like him. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> only {{a week or two}} ago that you should not at all object to marry him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi! young sir," [...] he said, [...] "I've been {{watching}} {{for you and}} thinking of wot <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> You gave me half a quid, you did. Jump in and I'll drive you wherever you want to go, for my fare was only a bob." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because,' said Florence, 'I {{am going}} to be his wife, to give him up my whole heart, and to live with him and die with him. He might think, if <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> him what <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that I am afraid of what is before me, or that you have some cause to be afraid for me. Why, Susan, dear, I love him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{knew all}} that she knew;--all that I knew. You knew all that her mother knew. No, Lord Scroope. It cannot be {{that you should be}} so unutterably a villain. You are your own masther. Unsay what <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and her ears shall never be wounded or her heart broken by a hint of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not she," [...] said Merton Densher. [...] "She {{received}} me just as usual: in that glorious great salone, in {{the dress}} she always wears, from her inveterate {{corner of her}} sofa." [...] And his face for the moment conveyed the scene, just as hers equally embraced it. [...] "Do you remember what <b>you</b> originally <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> of her?" ...|$|R
