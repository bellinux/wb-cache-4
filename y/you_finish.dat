That’s something we desire to emulate." [...] In March 2011, Pinkner confirmed with TVLine that unlike previous Fringe season finales, the third season's finale would not be two hours long.

My guess is that this is the future of books." [...] The book has been compared to economic and political pamphlets of the 17th century, which were frequently used to quickly get ideas about current affairs into circulation.|$|E

Rather than use the [...] "virginity-sexual tango" [...] trope of most historical romance novels, Koen sought to circumvent the [...] "rules" [...] of the genre and concentrate on characterization. Koen engaged in an intensive research period on the eighteenth century using approximately 300 books, which she often obtained from a local university's library. She also traveled briefly to England and France. Koen found writing the novel to be [...] "a very intense thing" [...] and became very attached to her characters, even the villains. She sought to [...] "hook the readers emotionally and make them care. I guess it's soap opera (but) there's a kind of sigh you heave when <b>you</b> <b>finish</b> {{a certain type of}} book.

500|$|Following singer Taylor Swift's win for {{the music}} video [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video, West stormed the stage, grabbed Swift's microphone, and {{declared}} that singer Beyoncé deserved the award for her [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] video. He declared, [...] "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm going to let <b>you</b> <b>finish,</b> but Beyoncé {{had one of the}} best videos of all time." [...] West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident. Following the interruption, the status of Fame Kills was rumored to be in question. A representative from an US urban radio station commented: [...] "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour— urban audiences can be a bit more forgiving than mainstream audiences are. I can see him going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate." [...] Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{have placed}} parts the novel in the mystery genre. Edinger found {{that despite the}} broad genres, the novel is mainly [...] "a thrilling puzzle". She relates the pieces slowly; clues {{are found in the}} story itself, on the map, in words and chapter titles. At {{the end of the book}} {{everything}} is tied together and makes sense. Ann Crewdson of School Library Journal found that each note Miranda receives foreshadows the next event. Each note is [...] "skillfully" [...] integrated into the novel, along with subsequent clues, until the climax is reached and all the clues come together. Stead's editor Lamb agreed with the mystery genre, in that [...] "there's plenty to wonder about after <b>you</b> <b>finish</b> the book. Just as we wonder why our feelings change so suddenly, or why someone like the laughing man appears on the corner one day." [...] Gurdon of The Wall Street Journal concurred with Lamb, adding that although the novel is clearly a mystery, the mystery itself is not revealed until the end where the last note comes and where everything ties together.|$|E

Over the next two years, he created sound effects for , Final Fantasy V, The 7th Saga, Secret of Mana, and Romancing SaGa 2. In 1994, realizing {{that he would never}} get a chance to move up to a real composition duty without some drastic action and feeling concerned about his low pay, he gave Square's vice president, Hironobu Sakaguchi, an ultimatum: let him compose, or he would quit. Sakaguchi assigned the young musician to the team working on Chrono Trigger, telling him that [...] "after <b>you</b> <b>finish</b> it, maybe your salary will go up". Mitsuda was assigned as the sole composer for the game, in the end creating 54 tracks for the final release. Mitsuda drove himself to work hard on the score, frequently working until he passed out, and would awake with ideas for songs such as the ending theme for the game. He worked himself so hard that he developed stomach ulcers and had to be hospitalized, which led Uematsu to finish the remaining tracks for him.|$|E

[...] Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez believed that Liverpool would have won the match had they scored when they were leading 1–0: [...] "If you have clear chances at 1–0 and you score the second goal <b>you</b> <b>finish</b> the game, but we made some mistakes and at the end we conceded in our own goal." [...] Despite the defeat he was proud of his players' efforts: [...] "I say to the players we must be proud because we played a good game, Chelsea controlled the game when they started playing, but we re-organised the team with three midfielders and had some opportunities." ...|$|E

Craig Harris of IGN gave the games a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10, noting that: [...] "Even if <b>you</b> <b>finish</b> the quest, you still might not have all the Pokémon in the game. The challenge to catch 'em all is truly the game's biggest draw". He also commented on {{the popularity of the}} game, especially among children, describing it as a [...] "craze". GameSpot's Peter Bartholow, who gave the games a [...] "great" [...] 8.8 out of 10, cited the graphics and audio as somewhat primitive but stated that these were the games' only drawbacks. He praised the titles' replay value due to their customization and variety, and commented upon their universal appeal: [...] "Under its cuddly exterior, Pokémon is a serious and unique RPG with lots of depth and excellent multiplayer extensions. As an RPG, the game is accessible enough for newcomers to the genre to enjoy, but it will entertain hard-core fans as well. It's easily one of the best Game Boy games to date".|$|E

Later in the evening, during her acceptance speech for winning the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year, Knowles told about her first experience winning her first Video Music Award with Destiny's Child and how much it meant to her. She then called Swift from backstage to complete her acceptance speech. Numerous critics, celebrities, and fans criticized West's actions, including the President of the United States, Barack Obama, who called West a [...] "jackass".
