5000|$|Juego de prenda (lit. game {{of looking}} for the missing bird): There is no limit {{to the number of}} players that can play. Players sit in a circle with the leader in the middle. Each player adopts a name of a tree or flower that is given by the leader. The leader recounts the story of a lost bird that was owned by a king. He or she says, The bird of the king was lost yesterday. Did you find it, Ylang-Ylang? The player who adopted the name of the <b>Ylang-Ylang</b> <b>tree</b> at once answers that he or she has not found it, so the leader {{continues}} to ask the other trees whether the bird has hidden in them. If a player cannot answer after the third count, he or she is made to deposit a thing he or she owns to the leader until the leader has been able to gather a lot of things from the members. The Boy is choosing a tree. The Girl is choosing a flower. The one participants will be a king.|$|E

In 1911, it became a separate religious community district, which divided Sampaloc into two parishes. The created parish is now known as the Old Santa Mesa, which extended from V. Mapa to Sta.

50|$|Inside {{the forests}} off {{the shore of}} Gibney Beach, {{there is also an}} {{abundance}} of plant life. Gibney Beach lies on the eastern coast of the island and is characterized by dry forest vegetation. Cacti such as the Barbed-wire Cactus (Acanthocereus tetragonus), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), Organ Pipe Cactus (Pilosocereus royenii) and Turk's Cap Cactus (Melocactus intortus) are prominent in the area. These cacti grow alongside shrubs, such as Maran (Croton flavens var. rigidula), and thorn bushes like Casha (Acacia tortuosa) and Catch-and-Keep (A. retusa). The thorny nature of these forests make them difficult to navigate. Mangrove forests can also be found off Gibney Beach. Mangrove trees alter the shoreline, changing salinity, tidal inundation and oxygenation of the soil. Red Mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) are the most common and grow in the ocean. They have specialized prop roots that protect shorelines and serve as nurseries for many marine animals. Other mangrove species that {{can be found on the}} coast are the Black Mangrove (Avicennia germinans), White Mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa), and Buttonwood Mangrove (Conocarpus erectus). Other more exotic and beautiful trees can be found in residential areas off Gibney Beach. Gardens often include orchids, heliconia, <b>ylang-ylang</b> <b>trees,</b> and fruit trees such as coconut, star fruit, bananas and mango.|$|R
