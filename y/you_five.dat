500|$|Except for {{the short}} film I Am That Change whose music was {{composed}} by Sai Karthik, Sukumar chose Devi Sri Prasad to compose the soundtrack and background score for the films he directed. Sukumar worked with cinematographer R. Rathnavelu for Arya, Jagadam, and 1: Nenokkadine. When Raju asked Sukumar about the budget to be allotted to Arya, Sukumar said that he first wants Rathnavelu on board. In an interview to The Hindu in March 2012, Rathnavelu said, [...] "Sukumar's speciality is he can give <b>you</b> <b>five</b> different ways to solve every problem you encounter. He {{can get to the}} crux of the problem and figure out the best possible method to resolve it". Because of their friendship with Sukumar, neither Rathnavelu nor Prasad charged any remuneration for his maiden production venture Kumari 21F. For Arya 2, he collaborated with R. D. Rajasekhar. He worked with Venkat R. Prasad and Vijay C Chakravarthy for 100% Love and Nannaku Prematho respectively.|$|E

She bribed me into learning. She would say, 'I really want you to finish this workbook. I'll give <b>you</b> <b>five</b> bucks if you finish it.' That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school. They wanted me to skip {{the next two years}} in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen."

[...] Jobs [...] "was often bullied" [...] and gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.|$|E
