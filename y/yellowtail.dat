5|$|In November 2011, provincial government-appointed {{auditors}} {{backed up}} claims by Ocean Choice International (OCI) {{that they were}} losing millions of dollars each year operating the Marystown fish plant. On December 2, 2011, the company announced that they would permanently close their Marystown and Port Union fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province. The following week OCI asked the provincial government for an exemption to export unprocessed fish in return for nearly doubling the workforce at the company's plant in Fortune. Minister King reacted positively to the proposed idea and said the government would consider it. Negotiations on a deal would become tense, with the minister criticizing the company for using 'pressure tactics' {{to try to get}} a deal. OCI said that they were in damage control all around the world because of Minister King's comments. In February 2012, the government rejected a proposal to drop MPRs for the company, saying that it was not in the best interest of the province. In mid October 2012, workers at the Fortune fish plant voted unanimously in favour of allowing OCI to ship out raw fish to China for processing, in return for 110 full-time jobs at their plant. The FFAW, which represented the workers, opposed the move to ship out the raw product. Dunderdale held a cabinet shuffle on October 19, 2012, and appointed Tourism Minister Derrick Dalley as the new Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. In a news conference held on December 21, 2012, Minister Dalley announced the government would allow Ocean Choice International to ship 75 per cent of its <b>yellowtail</b> flounder quota overseas for processing, along with 100 per cent of its redfish quota. In return a total of 236 year-round jobs, between the Fortune fish plant and on company vessels at sea, for at least five years.|$|E

40|$|In recent years,the {{practice}} of feeding chopped frozen fishes such as sardine,Japanese anchovy and chub mackerel to cultured yellowtail,Seriola quinqueradiata has been widespread among fish-culturists. This type of feeding, that is, frozen feed {{is reported to}} be effective for the weight gain of fed <b>yellowtails</b> and for the prevention of pollution of environmental water and outbreak of bacterial diseases (TANIGUCHI 1983). A question whether <b>yellowtails</b> undergo physiological disturbances when they eat frozen fish meat,has remained. In the present study, examinations were conducted feeding chopped frozen sardin(- 4 to - 2 ℃) to one group and miced thawed sardine (10 to 15 ℃) to another group of young yellowtails(190 g of average body weight) for 20 days. At the end of the experiment, the weight gain was mostly the same in the fish fed the frozen feed and in those fed the thawed feed. Hematological data of red blood cell count, hemoglobin,hematocrit,serous total protein,serous albumin and serous cholesterol did not differ between the two fish groups. Data of serous glucose of fish fed the thawed feed were significantly high. Individual variations in hematological data of fish fed thawed feed were marked.

25|$|The <b>yellowtail</b> scad (Atule mate) (also {{known as}} the {{northern}} <b>yellowtail</b> scad, one-finlet scad, deep trevally and omaka), is an abundant species of small inshore marine fish of the jack family, Carangidae. The species is widespread in the Indo-Pacific region from east Africa {{in the west to}} Hawaii in the east, extending north to Japan and south to Australia. The <b>yellowtail</b> scad is {{the only member of the}} monotypic genus Atule and is distinguished from similar species by a well-developed adipose eyelid and finlet-like extensions of the last rays of the dorsal and anal fins. It inhabits coastal areas such as bays and coral reefs, preying on small fishes and crustaceans. Spawning has been well studied in Hawaii, where fish enter bays to spawn, releasing up to 161,000 eggs each between March and October. The <b>yellowtail</b> scad is an important component of fisheries throughout its range, taken by a number of netting and hook-and-line methods. It is a prized food fish in some regions and is cooked or preserved by a variety of methods.|$|E

40|$|The composition, {{stability}} and biotic factors of social rank in juvenile marine fish schools are demonstrated using juvenile <b>yellowtails,</b> Seriola quinequeradiata (Temminck et Schlegel: Carangidae). According {{to the frequency}} of aggressive behaviour, members within a school were divided into three categories: dominants (10 - 20 %) intermediates (10 - 20 %) and sub-ordinates (60 - 80 %). Social rank was reset with the same hierarchy composition when dominants and intermediates were combined. Observation of individual aggressive behaviour using a video image analysis system revealed that starvation {{and an increase in}} fish densities accelerated aggression only in the dominants. In order to determine the durability of social rank, otoliths of dominant fish in eight experimental groups were labelled and the fish returned to their groups; six dominants appeared after one day and three after one week of rearing, indicating that social rank was maintained for at least one week (binomial distribution; P < 0. 05). Total lengths of dominants were larger than tose of subordinates after one day of rearing, whereas dominants were smaller after one week. Social rank of this species is decided upon by individual aggressive tendency, but is not beneficial for feeding or growth...|$|R

40|$|The harmful raphidophyte Cattonella antiqua {{is known}} as a notorious red-tide causing {{autotrophic}} flagellate. Mass mortalities of mainly cultured <b>yellowtails</b> by C. antiqua in 2009 and 2010 at Yatsushiro Sea, located in Kyushu, the southernmost of the four main islands of Japan, reaching 8. 7 billion Japanese yen(about 80 million US dollar) have been newly reported. There is an urgent need to seek strategies for reducing negative impacts by Chattonella red-tides. In this study, temporal and spatial fluctuations of algicidal bacteria(AB) and growth-inhibiting bacteria(GIB) against C. antiqua in the seawater at southwest of Yatsushiro Sea were investigated in 2012. Densities of AB or GIB ranged between 3. 7 × 10 ¹- 5. 6 × 10 ³CFU mL⁻¹ at 0 m and 1. 4 × 10 ¹- 8. 5 × 10 ²CFU mL⁻¹ at 1 m above the bottom(B- 1 m). Percentages of bacteria that killed or inhibited the growth of C. antiqua within the total culturable bacteria fluctuated between 3. 3 - 17 %(0 m) and 3. 3 - 10 %(B- 1 m). AB and GIB were mostly found as particle-associated form(0 m : 71 %, B- 1 m : 87 %). Partial 16 S rRNA sequencing revealed that all of AB and GIB detected in this study were comprised of α- and γ-proteobacteria as well as the previous study conducted in 2011.

40|$|Whaling {{activity}} in 2 areas was investigated for 3 periods {{from the viewpoint}} of fishing technology. Whaling {{activity in}} Kataura, which is located southwest of the Satsuma peninsula, was investigated for 25 years from 1888 to 1914 using an ancient type of set net. Kunezu, which is located at southwest ofAmami Island, was investigated for 3 periods using modern whaling technology. Whaling in Kataura was conducted using ooshiki-ami, an ancient type of set net. The catch mainly consisted of blue fin tunas and <b>yellowtails,</b> and whales were only caught sometimes. During {{the course of a year}} up to 10 whales were caught. Many aspects of whaling technique were believed to be influenced by the traditional whaling method. Only the inhabitants of the neighboring village of Kataura cut the captured whales; they performed a unique ceremony before carving the whale. These activities were influenced by the whaling technology employed in Arikawa in Nagasaki Prefecture. Whaling in Kunezu, Amami Island, was initiated by a whaling company in 1911 and was continued till 1923. During this period, the number of cetaceans caught decreased each year. Of the 6 types of whales that were caught the number of Humpback whale (Megapetera novaeangliae) captured was the greatest among them. The capture location of the whale was very close to the coast except that of Sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Small scale whaling was conducted again, and a small number of whale was sporadically caught in the following 5 years 1934, 1935, 1957, 1958 and 1961. The whaling station has been closed since 1962. Due to the whaling activities in both areas, a large number of cetaceans were caught during their seasonal migration; therefore they became extinct in a few number of years. This extinction is believed to be due to the modern whaling techniques that were developed during the years that resulted in the capture of many cetaceans in the northern sea. ...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} component of the lodge the central pole around which the whole ceremony revolves. A forked tree is chosen by the sponsor and cut down with respect and prayer, if the tree stump exudes sap it is seen as a good omen, and Crows will bless themselves with its excretion. The tree is then taken to the ceremonial site and hoisted into an upright position so that the crotch of the fork faces east. To one of the branches of the fork a white flag is tied, to the other blue, white to represent the earth and blue for the skies, an offering of tobacco is also attached to help Crows communicate with God. Onto the pole three rings are drawn in charcoal to symbolise the number of days in the dance and the three worlds of the Crow universe, the black of the charcoal representing victory. It is in this way that the post becomes a representation of God, a conduit for the Baaxpée to flow into the dancers. To the central pole are also hung the head of a buffalo and the body of an eagle, patrons who will come to life {{in the minds of the}} dancers during the ceremony. Around this totem are placed twelve posts of cottonwood, around forty feet from the centre, creating the boundaries of the lodge, with the doorway on the east side. The twelve poles are a physical manifestation of Crow spirituality, which when connected by rafters to the central post, represents the Crow’s connection to God, like that of Thomas <b>Yellowtail’s</b> wagon wheel. The twelve posts also represent the twelve months of the year in the Crow life cycle, and by forming a sphere, the circle of life itself. For contemporary Crows who believe both in traditional religious ideas and Christianity, the twelve posts symbolise the twelve apostles, and the three rings on the centre pole the three days that Christ spent in his tomb. It is in these way that the Sun dance lodge is designed to focus and channel the Baaxpée of God, giving the Crow participants visions and blessing for the whole tribe.|$|R
