[...] And I shall blush and look sheepish and say: [...] "So glad you think so. I believe you'll find they'll keep fresh quite a long time, if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> water." [...] Whereupon you, Columbia, with real American gallantry: [...] "Oh, they'll keep for ever, Mr. Lawrence. They couldn't be so cruel as to go and die, such perfectly lovely-colored ideas. Lovely! Thank you ever, ever so much." ...|$|E
60|$|II. In {{the midst}} of your zeal for the Lord, {{remember}} that the visible saint is his; and is privileged in all those spiritual {{things that you have}} in the word and live in the practice of, and that he is to partake thereof, according to his light therein. Quarrel not with him about things that are circumstantial; but receive him in the Lord, as becometh saints: if he will not have communion with you, the neglect is his, not yours. But saith the open profane, why cannot we be reckoned saints also? We have been christened, we go to church, we take the communion.[20] Poor people! This will not do; for so long as in life and conversation you appear to be open profane, we cannot, unless we sin, receive you into our fellowship: for by your ungodly lives you shew that you know not Christ; and while you are such by the word, you are reputed but beasts: now then judge yourselves, if it be not a strange community that consisteth of men and beasts: let beasts be with the beasts, you know yourselves do so; you receive not your horse nor your hog to your table, <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> a room by themselves. Besides I have shewed you before, that for many reasons we cannot have communion with you.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the season}} of {{repairing}} of dykes and ditches in rice chronology, a much more complicated annal than might be thought. This initial stage of it has a certain architectural interest. Every year before planting begins the dykes have all to be re-made strictly in place, for they serve for both dams and bounds to the elaborately partitioned fields. Adjacent mud is therefore carefully plastered over {{the remains of the}} old dyke, which, to the credit of the former builders, is no small fraction of it, and the work then finished off with a sculptor's care. An easier-going peasantry might often forego renewal. Indeed, I cannot but think the farmers take a natural delight in this exalted form of mud pies; they work away on already passable specimens with such a will. But who does quite outgrow his childish delights? And to make of the play of childhood the work of middle life, must be to foil the primal curse to the very letter. What more enchanting pastime than to wade all day in viscous mud, hearing your feet plash when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in,</b> and suck as you draw them out; while the higher part of you is busied building a parapet of gluey soil, smoothing it down on the sides and top, and crowning your masterpiece with a row of sprigs along the crest? And then in the gloaming to trudge homeward, feeling that you have done a meritorious deed after all! When I come to my second childhood, I mean to turn paddyfield farmer myself.|$|E

50|$|This {{project is}} a mixed media {{installation}} and sculpture work. Kyambi {{spent a lot of}} her time in Mexico observing people.

She compares that to her art. That if you shift the art, the same gesture can be read differently. It is about presentation.|$|E

5000|$|He married Françoise Favre, the {{daughter}} of François Favre, a merchant draper and former Eidguenot who was active on the Council and prosecuted in 1547 for accusing Calvin of proclaiming himself bishop of Geneva. Françoise appeared before the consistory (the congregation's governing body of elected officials) the same year, for the offence of dancing. Resisting the authority of Church elders, she claimed the right to punish her was reserved for her husband, Ami, who was in France representing the city before Henry II at the time. Returning to Geneva in September of that year, Perrin famously proclaimed before the court: I understand that you are considering imprisoning my father-in-law and my wife. My said father-in-law is old, my wife is ill; by imprisoning them you will shorten their days, to my great regret, which I have not deserved, and which would be to give me poor recompense for the services I have done you. Therefore I beg you not to imprison them. If they have done wrong, I will bring them here to make such amends {{that you will have}} reason to be content. I pray you to grant me this, since if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> prison, God will aid me to avenge myself for it. Ami Perrin ...|$|E
5000|$|The Belber {{brothers}} {{were all about}} showing America that a bag was all about personality and they did this by spreading the word through handsomely illustrated magazine and newspaper ads. Early precursors to the advertising heyday of Madison Avenue, the Belber advertisements were just {{as much about the}} American dream of social mobility as they were about how to live and dress well. Belber ads were beautifully written, inspirational and aspirational. “With vision and expectancy, your travel plans are born. Matched with magnificence, superbly designed Belber canvas and leather bound luggage gives stately expression to your travel luxury,” reads one for Belber’s revolutionary matched luggage. “Your trunk is brought to your room. You unlock it. Swing it open. There, all your clothes fresh and dainty as when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in.</b> Everything in its place, nothing missed. No unpacking to do, no trouble at all. You are at home and settled at once,” promises another from the 1920s. [...] In the 1940s, to advertise its new collections, the Belber brothers also helped invent the concept of product tie-ins and product placement, partnering with Hollywood Stars such as Ray Milland in the movie The Big Clock (film) and Alan Ladd in the movie Saigon (1948 film).|$|E
5000|$|On his three-year-old debut, Dortmund contested the Grade III Robert B. Lewis Stakes at Santa Anita on February 7 {{in which}} he conceded five pounds to Firing Line. Dortmund took the lead on the backstretch and rallied after being headed by Firing Line on the final turn to regain {{the lead in the}} closing stages and win by a head. Baffert commented, [...] "It looked like that horse was going to go by him, but then he's such a fighter, he just kicked in. You really don't know about these horses until <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> that scenario, and that's twice now that he just fought and came on to win like that. That was him." [...] Four weeks later, Dortmund started 4/5 {{favorite}} for the Grade II San Felipe Stakes at the same track. He took the lead soon after the start, fought off several challengers, and edged away in the straight to win by one and a quarter lengths from Prospect Park. When asked to compare the winner to the Eclipse award winner American Pharoah Baffert said, [...] "It's like asking which kid I love more. They're two different horses." [...] On April 4, Dortmund was stepped up in class and distance for the Grade 1 Santa Anita Derby over nine furlongs and started 3/5 favorite ahead of Prospect Park and four others. He led from the start, went clear of the field in the straight, and won by four and a quarter lengths from his stablemate One Lucky Dane. Garcia commented, [...] "Even though he's won all his races, he's still learning. He can play around a bit, but when someone comes to him, or I ask him to go, he becomes push-button and he just takes off." ...|$|E
