No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
5|$|The song comes first. And all {{of those}} other things that people remember, the imagistic things, are secondary, or {{certainly}} not as important. But I think I’ve become pretty good at sussing out when people's opinions of my work are coming from {{what they think of}} me personally. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do your thing and then let it go out into the world. The rest, you're not in control.|$|E
25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, and <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E

500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E

He instructed the graduating class that [...] "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be honest in a conventional way after that." ...|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{started the}} season with a 27–20 home win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite sitting out {{training}} camp and the preseason in a contract dispute, linebacker Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and a forced fumble. The Giants' defense forced three turnovers and held the Eagles to 83 rushing yards. The Giants' offense scored three touchdowns in a 13-minute span in the third and early fourth quarters, but head coach Bill Parcells felt the offensive performance was lackluster overall: [...] "Our runners didn't run the way we wanted them to. They were a little impatient. There were five or six vivid examples of cutting back too soon. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give the play a chance and let it go where it's supposed to." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 13–15, 2009, Keenan debuted Puscifer at the Pearl Concert Theater in Palms Casino Resort in Paradise, Nevada, with a cabaret-style show so {{abstract}} it is {{not easily}} described.

[...] Keenan—who has had previous experience with this type of entertainment, having fronted a similar show in Los Angeles before achieving fame with Tool—went on to add that [...] "you just can't really describe it, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> see it, then it makes sense." [...] Featuring an ever-changing lineup of artists including Milla Jovovich and Primus drummer Tim Alexander, the show was originally said to have a long-term residency at the Pearl; however, Keenan later revealed that it was to be only a two-show performance.|$|E

500|$|After {{everyone}} {{finds out}} about Martha's situation, {{they try to}} stop her working in the club. Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf {{have to pick up}} the pieces for her in the end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stand back and let it run its course and be there at the end."

I can change directions", he told West Central Tribune's Anne Polta. [...] As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said. [...] "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent." [...] "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said.

[...] She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and said that I really wanted to play this character. I think she would be interesting because it touches back on some of the things I've played as an actress, and that was it. [...] It was so tight in the dialogue, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play with the relationships and find other things going on with the characters to make it seem like there's more depth to what's going on, that there's more of a history between them.|$|E
500|$|The brawling {{continued}} in 1990. During an August 9 game at Shea, Gooden hit Phillies hitters Dickie Thon and Tommy Herr. When Gooden came to bat {{in the fifth}} inning, Phillies pitcher Pat Combs hit Gooden in the knee with a fastball. Phillies outfielder Von Hayes defended Combs after the game, [...] "Gooden better expect retaliation if he keeps hitting guys with [...] fastballs. We've got to protect our players." [...] Gooden charged the mound and tackled Combs. Phillies catcher Darren Daulton followed Gooden and landed a series of punches {{on the back of}} Gooden's head. Darryl Strawberry had been in the Mets clubhouse and rushed the field after Daulton but was himself blindsided by Hayes. Of Daulton, Gooden later said, [...] "Daulton was the guy we wanted most. He's a cheap-shot artist. We learned that about him last year", referring to the September 1989 fight. Six players and Phillies coach Mike Ryan were ejected from the game. Eight players were later fined, including the Mets' Tim Teufel, who said, [...] "It was money well spent.

After the wreck on lap nine, Gilliland cut his thumb on his helmet; the thumb required one stitch but he was confident about driving his backup car. According to Menard, who was involved in the lap nine wreck, [...] "Somebody turned (David) Gilliland; I saw him get sideways underneath me. I was three lanes up and I tried to clear him and didn’t quite make it.” It took 56 minutes and 34 seconds to complete the first race; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E

500|$|Marvel Studios {{developed}} specific {{business practices}} to create its shared universe, including choosing filmmakers that were considered [...] "out-of-left-field", given their previous work. Feige remarked, [...] "You don't {{have to have}} directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have done something singularly sort of awesome," [...] adding [...] "It's worked out well for us when we've taken people [...] that have done very, very good things. Very rarely are one of those good things a big giant blockbuster superhero movie." [...] When hiring directors, the studio usually has [...] "a kernel of {{an idea of what}} we want", which is presented to potential directors {{over the course of several}} meetings to discuss and further expand. [...] "And if over the course of three or four or five meetings they make it way better than what we initially were spewing to them, they usually get the job", according to Feige. Later expanding on this process, Feige explained that before talking to any directors on a film, Marvel Studios often puts together a [...] "lookbook" [...] of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for the film. These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds every [...] "18 months or so" [...] to plan out and develop the phases of the MCU. These lookbooks are not always shown to directors, though, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first.|$|E

Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near {{as bad as the}} fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E

The song was not originally meant for Cyrus to perform, but, once it reached Cyrus, the writing team reworked the lyrics, intending to write an accompanying theme for the clothing line. In order to please audiences, Dr. Luke, Kelly, and Cornish fixated on composing a fun, upbeat song that narrated reflections of Cyrus' personality. To write his contributions to the song, Kelly said he tried to mimic Cyrus' songwriting: [...] "It’s the same song from {{a different point of}} view, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find that unique perspective." [...] Cyrus was pleased with the song and selected it partially due to the need for tracks to appear on The Time of Our Lives. [...] "When I Look at You", written by Shanks and Hillary Lindsey, was initially to be included on Cyrus' succeeding album; it was eventually chosen to promote the 2010 film The Last Song after Cyrus recognized that it fit the film's concept well. According to Cyrus, when she sings [...] "When I Look at You", she thinks of family and love. [...] "It's kind of what this movie is all about", she said. The title track, [...] "The Time of Our Lives", was composed by Dr. Luke, Kelly, Kesha Sebert (known as Ke$ha), and Pebe Sebert.
