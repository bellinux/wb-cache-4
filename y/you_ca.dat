40|$|Introduction : {{relevance}} {{as a basic}} {{property of}} language In his 430 page book `The language instinct', S. Pinker (1994) devotes only five pages to issues related to pragmatics and relevance. The minor role played by pragmatics in this natural history of language is quite surprising. Perhaps we are so accustomed to relevance that, like fish unaware of water, we fail to notice how strong a constraint it is. Relevance is indeed not limited to language. In front of a judge, you {{may be asked to}} give relevant justifications for your actions. If you see somebody in danger and begin to look for four-leaf clovers, your behaviour will probably be perceived as irrelevant : relevant behaviour would be some direct or indirect attempt to ward off danger. If relevance applies to human behaviour in general, it is of special importance when we deal with language : as we shall see, the structure of conversation is a consequence of the requirement that utterances be relevant.

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{solution}} to this problem is the use of public key certificates and certificate authorities (CAs) for them in a public-key infrastructure (PKI) system. The certificate authority (CA) acts as a 'trusted third party' for the communicating users and, using cryptographic binding methods (e.g., digital signatures) represents to both parties involved that the public keys each holds which allegedly belong to the other, actually do so. A digital notary service, if <b>you</b> will. Such <b>CAs</b> can be private organizations providing such assurances, or government agencies, or some combination of the two. However, in a significant sense, this merely moves the key authentication problem back one level for any CA may make a good faith certification of some key but, through error or malice, be mistaken. Any reliance on a defective key certificate 'authenticating' a public key will cause problems. As a result, many people find all PKI designs unacceptably insecure.|$|R

40|$|In three experiments, {{students}} completed sets of three pairwise choices {{in each of}} several domains. The first two pairs in each set were contextual pairs, and the third was the target pair. Context was manipulated by widening the range of values on one dimension and narrowing it on the second dimension. Consistent with previous research, participants on target trials more often chose the alternative whose poorer value was on the widened dimension. Four models explained this effect as (a) decreased weighting of the wide dimension, (b) contextual shift in values, (c) a tendency to equalize responses, or (d) a tendency to add value based on dominance relationships. Path models provided evidence against weight change and response equalization, and manipulation of dominance did not reduce the effect. Results supported the value-shift explanation of trade-off contrast. When choosing between multiattribute alternatives, one is faced {{with the problem of}} having to make trade-offs between values on different attributes.

40|$|Water {{which is}} safe to drink {{straight}} from the tap is taken for granted by many Canadians, {{despite the fact that}} access to safe drinking water is far from universal. Across the country, many communities endure conditions unimaginable to most Canadians: water accessed through pipe systems causes gastrointestinal illness, must be boiled prior to consumption or not used at all, and these drinking water advisories can last anywhere from a few days to several years. First Nations are over-represented in both the number and severity of drinking water advisories, and face considerable barriers in (re-) establishing clean drinking water in their communities. These challenges have been increasingly recognized by all levels of government – this recognition {{led to the development of}} the First Nations Drinking Water Safety Programme and to new legislation creating enforceable drinking water standards on First Nations reserves. Last year’s World Water Day also marked the midpoint of the United Nations Decade for Indigenous Peoples, and honouring the importance of water to the health of Indigenous communities, the Centre for Aboriginal Health Research and partners held the Consensus Conference on Small Water Systems Management for the Promotion of Indigenous Health, March 21 - 23, 2010. This three day event brought together community members, researchers, policy makers, and health and water services professionals to discuss pathways to achieving universal safe drinking water in Canada and abroad. Two themes emerged from the discussions as important to addressing safe drinking water in Canada: collaboration across disciplinary boundaries and greater self-determination among First Nations. In the months following the conference, the Centre for Aboriginal Health Research initiated a workshop series exploring economic and social barriers to safe drinking water experienced by First Nations in British Columbia. Working in partnership with six communities, CAHR delivered workshops on topics specific to local needs. The book that follows shares the proceedings of the conference and a report summarizing the process and findings of the workshop series. On the Centre’s website (www. cahr. uvic. <b>ca)</b> <b>you</b> can also access the video recordings of the conference presentations, as well as a trailer video and a full documentary produced as a result of the conference. It is my hope that these materials open a door to interdisciplinary exploration of the issue and support ‘two-eyed seeing’ where water is concerned...|$|R
