40|$|Abstract. Straw wire {{aircraft}} {{sandwich panel}} {{is a new}} type of composite slab which consist of straw insulation core lamped between two welded wire meshes. Diagonal shear connectors connect two wire meshes to form an integrated frame. The straw insulation core (also known as <b>straw</b> <b>board)</b> is prepared from cut straw agglutinated by magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC). In order to study thermal conductivity of <b>straw</b> <b>board,</b> multi-group models were quantitatively investigated by the CD－DR 3030 A thermal conductivity meter. Five parameters, including the water－cement ratio, cement content, straw gradation, straw length, wettability were considered in the test. The results show that the thermal conductivity of <b>straw</b> <b>board</b> samples is in the range of 0. 08 ~ 0. 12 w/m·k, which indicates that the <b>straw</b> <b>board</b> has a good thermal insulation property. And the water －cement ratio, cement content, straw gradation, straw length, wettability has remarkable effects on the thermal conductivity of <b>straw</b> <b>board...</b>|$|R

The {{beautiful}} <b>yellow</b> <b>straw</b> entering the cylinder; the clear yellow-brown wheat pulsing out at the side; the broken straw, chaff, and dust puffing out on the great stacker; the cheery whistling and calling of the driver; the keen, crisp air, and the bright sun somehow weirdly suggestive of the passage of time.|$|R

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of Q fever occurred in South Wales, United Kingdom, from July 15 through September 30, 2002. To investigate the outbreak a cohort and nested case-control study {{of persons who}} had worked at a cardboard manufacturing plant was conducted. The cohort included 282 employees and subcontractors, of whom 253 (90 %) provided blood samples and 214 (76 %) completed questionnaires. Ninety-five cases of acute Q fever were identified. The epidemic curve and other data suggested an outbreak source likely occurred August 5 – 9, 2002. Employees in the factory’s offices were at greatest risk for infection (odds ratio 3. 46; 95 % confidence interval 1. 38 – 9. 06).
