40|$|This {{graduation}} project {{focuses on}} the city center as a place for people to walk. Everyone knows that walking is the most primary form of mobility in the city. And the {{most of us do}} it every day. It is the most essential way for us to move around. It gives us the opportunity to explore and experience the surrounding environment. But, most certainly, everyone have experienced that some urban environments are less attractive or more difficult to travel through by walking compared with others. Did we ever made the decision not to walk, because of the urban environment? Maybe you felt unsafe or it was just too far to walk or any other reason? At that moment the urban environment could not provide the conditions for you to walk. To be able to walk safely, conveniently, directly and comfortably, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>an</b> urban environment that corresponds to your <b>needs,</b> as <b>a</b> pedestrian. This graduation project researches the required conditions for the urban environment to facilitate and encourage people to walk, especially for city centers. UrbanismArchitectur...|$|R

5000|$|Syntactic {{ambiguity}} {{arises when}} a sentence can have two (or more) different meanings {{because of the}} structure of the sentence—its syntax. This is often due to a modifying expression, such as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear. [...] "He ate the cookies on the couch", for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies. [...] "To get in, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>an</b> entrance fee of $10 or your voucher and your drivers' license." [...] This could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR BOTH your voucher and your license. Or it could mean that you need your license AND you need EITHER ten dollars OR a voucher.

All these we will order to-day in my name, and put them down in your account to me. As to arms, you have your sword, and there is but a brace of pistols to be bought.

"For the present," [...] he went on, [...] "I {{shall have}} no great {{need for an}} interpreter, as I shall {{probably}} {{have little to do}} for some time beyond cruising backwards and forwards on the coast of Egypt to prevent ships from France entering the ports with stores and ammunition, therefore I shall be able to give you employment which I think that you will like. One of the gun-boats captured from the French is a fast sailer. Hassan Bey tells me that when he was at Rhodes he heard great complaints of the piracy that was being carried on among the islands. The Turkish troops in most of these were withdrawn by him to swell his force as he sailed south, and there are now no vessels of war in those waters. The French flag has been driven from the sea, while our work has been too serious to admit of our paying any attention to the Aegean, although, as I knew before I left London, the complaints of merchants and ship-owners of the capture of merchantmen trading with Constantinople and other eastern ports were numerous. At the present moment I can well spare one of the gun-boats; the others will go down to watch the Egyptian coast. I shall therefore commission the Foudre, and re-name her the Tigress. I shall appoint Mr. Wilkinson to the command. Mr. Condor would, of course, have had it, but he has been transferred as third lieutenant to the Theseus, and as Wilkinson is senior midshipman, he will have her. I shall appoint you his second in command. She carries eight guns, and has room for two more, which I shall place on board from those on the walls. Her own guns are fourteen-pounders, and with two eighteens she will be heavily armed. Her complement was fifty-two men. I will give you forty from the Tigre, and will draw fifteen from the Theseus, and five from the Alliance. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> stronger crew with two extra guns; besides, you may want to send landing-parties on shore, or to cut out piratical craft, and ought therefore to be strong-handed." ...|$|E
