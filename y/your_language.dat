500|$|My French Coach and My Spanish Coach have {{received}} generally favorable reviews from several video game publications. On Metacritic, a website that compiles scores from various video game reviews, My Spanish Coach received a 73/100, based on seven reviews. In {{a review of}} the DS versions of both games, IGN called them a [...] "great learning experience" [...] and a more entertaining alternative to traditional methods of learning French and Spanish such as [...] "ours of boring exercises and outdated videos". Eurogamer claimed the games were not substitutes for proper language lessons, but admitted that [...] "as tools for improving <b>your</b> <b>language</b> skills, whether you're starting from scratch or have some basic knowledge, they're great". In {{a review of the}} DS version of My French Coach, Nintendo World Report called the game [...] "not be the hottest game to ever sit in your DS, but it is an unusually polished product that achieves the edutainment holy grail – it makes learning easy and fun". During the 2007 Christmas holiday season, video game retailer GameStop recommended My Spanish Coach for [...] "The Academic Gamer". My Spanish Coach led all Nintendo DS games in sales during the week of August 15, 2008 to August 21, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{was also}} ejected from a {{baseball}} game by an umpire [...] "for cursing him out in sign language." [...] According to some accounts, the umpire was Hank O'Day, who knew sign language. [...] After Taylor's tirade, O'Day reportedly {{stepped in front of}} the plate and signed the following comments back at Taylor: [...] "Listen, smart guy... I've spent all my spare time this past week learning <b>your</b> <b>language.</b> [...] You can't call me a blind bat any more. [...] Now, go take a shower... you're out of the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the early}} 1980s progressed {{it became clear}} that the new {{generation}} of rockers were not like anything before: Los Violadores pioneering punk in Latin America; Virus oxygenating rock with their new-wave sound, followed by Cosméticos with a similar style Sumo's punkish reggae-rock developing a fanatical cult following (Luca Prodan sung mostly in English, which reduced his band's radio exposure yet their fame expanded unabated); and Soda Stereo the buzz of the underground. ZAS introduced the phrase [...] "rock en tu idioma" [...] (rock in <b>your</b> <b>language).</b> Los Abuelos de la Nada and newcomers G.I.T. found quick success outside Argentina, a preview of things to come.|$|E

2500|$|On a more literal level, Laurent Lebec {{states that}} [...] "I {{had no idea}} where we were going with the music when we started doing these songs [...] he changes were pretty {{subconscious}} at first, then looking back we realized what was happening and we just went with it." [...] He continues to add [...] "when we were touring for our last album, The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw, even if we had a 75-minute-long set, we could only play five songs because they were all so long, and that can be tiring for an audience." [...] They are also intent on making it clear that the album is not simply negative in message. [...] "The title also pays tribute to how amazing touring most often feels. It's also a tribute to the joy that burns inside when you reach a place and people who don't speak <b>your</b> <b>language</b> are rooting for your songs and welcoming you into their unique environment".|$|E
2500|$|In {{line with}} these new {{interests}} and activities, Lake accepted an offer in 1903 to become professor (ordinarius) of New Testament exegesis and early Christian literature at the Leiden University, the oldest university in the Netherlands. [...] He taught there for ten years, from 1904 until 1914. [...] His inaugural lecture, which he delivered in English, was on [...] "The Influence of Textual Criticism on the Exegesis of the New Testament." [...] At {{the close of the}} lecture he looked his students in the face. [...] "I am very sorry," [...] he said, [...] "that for a few months I shall be handicapped by my inability to use <b>your</b> <b>language,</b> but I hope that by next September I shall {{be in a position to}} lecture in Dutch, at least partially, even though it may be necessary to apologize for frequent solecisms, and for an imperfect pronunciation." [...] He kept his promise and quickly learned to lecture in Dutch. [...] The lecture was published in 1904 and has proven to be a seminal study; though, as Elliott has noted: [...] "It has taken nearly a century for his general thesis that textual variants must be used as an invaluable source for our study of the history of the church to bear fruit in a determined way." ...|$|E
