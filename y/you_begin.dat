5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where <b>you</b> <b>begin.</b> You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a time}} in my {{life when}} I wasn't popular and {{accepted}} by kids in school. I was made fun of with braces and kinky hair, and being from a multicultural family, etcetera... And it really hurts when you're that age, but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in activities like a sport, <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> to be accepted for what you do, and your personality and who you are, instead of your clothes and how you look and the name designer brands you have on.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{accounts of}} Blue Licks {{describe it as}} a place where animals gathered to lick the salt deposits flowing from the springs in the area. The Reverend James Smith provides this account in his 1795–97 diary: As you approach the Licks, at the distance of 4 or 5 miles from it, <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> to perceive the change. The earth seems to be worn away; the roots of the trees lie naked and bare; the rocks forsaken of the earth, that once covered them, lie naked on the neighboring hills, and roads of an amazing size, in all directions, unite at the Licks, as their common center. Here immense herds of buffalo used formerly to meet and with their fighting, scraping etc., have worn away the ground to what it is at present.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{has been}} noted for its poignant {{exploration}} of different forms of courage. Scout's impulsive inclination to fight students who insult Atticus reflects her attempt {{to stand up for}} him and defend him. [...] Atticus is the moral center of the novel, however, and he teaches Jem {{one of the most significant}} lessons of courage. [...] In a statement that both foreshadows Atticus' motivation for defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose, who is determined to break herself of a morphine addiction, Atticus tells Jem that courage is [...] "when you're licked before <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> but <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> anyway and you see it through no matter what".|$|E

500|$|When {{asked what}} caused the {{explosion}} of the popularity of rock 'n roll {{that took place in the}} 1950s, with him and a handful of others, mainly him, Berry said, [...] "Well, actually they begin to listen to it, you see, because certain stations played certain music. The music that we, the blacks, played, the cultures were so far apart, we would have to have a play station in order to play it. The cultures begin to come together, and <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> to see one another's vein of life, then the music came together." ...|$|E

500|$|Connelly's {{portrayal}} of Sarah polarized critics and received strong criticism from some reviewers. Critic Kirk Honeycutt referred to Connelly as [...] "a bland and minimally talented young actress" [...] Writing for The Miami News, Jon Marlowe stated, [...] "Connelly {{is simply the}} wrong person for the right job. She has a squeaky voice that begins to grate on you; when she cries, {{you can see the}} onions in her eyes." [...] Contrary to these negative views, an anonymous review in St. Petersburg Times praised her acting saying, [...] "Connelly makes the entire experience seem real. She acts so naturally around the puppets that <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> to believe in their life-like qualities." ...|$|E

[...] "Where I End and <b>You</b> <b>Begin</b> (The Sky is Falling In)" [...] is a rock song with [...] "walls" [...] of ondes Martenot and rhythm section influenced by New Order. Yorke described [...] "We Suck Young Blood (Your Time is Up)" [...] as a [...] "slave ship tune" [...] with a [...] "freeform jazz nightmare" [...] break, and is [...] "not to be taken seriously." [...] With ill-timed, [...] "zombie-like" [...] handclaps, the song satirises Hollywood culture and its [...] "constant desire to stay young and fleece people, suck their energy." ...|$|E
500|$|Khánh {{presided over}} their trial of Đính {{and his colleagues}} on 28 May 1964. The generals were interrogated for {{five and a half}} hours, mostly about details of their coup against Diệm, rather than the {{original}} charge of promoting neutralism. As all of the officers were involved in Diệm's overthrow, the hearings did not reveal any new information. The court deliberated for over nine hours, and when it reconvened for the verdict, Khánh stated, [...] "We ask that once <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody". The tribunal then [...] "congratulated" [...] the generals, but found that they were of [...] "lax morality" [...] and unqualified to command due to a [...] "lack of a clear political concept". They were chastised for being [...] "inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility" [...] and of letting [...] "their subordinates take advantage of their positions". Đính's quartet were allowed to remain in Đà Lạt under surveillance.|$|E

500|$|In the UK, BBC DJ John Peel called [...] "Ding Dong" [...] "repetitive and dull" [...] {{and accused}} Harrison of complacency, while the NMEs Bob Woffinden derided Dark Horse as [...] "Just stuff and nonsense", adding: [...] "You keep looking for saving graces, for words of enthusiasm {{to pass on}} – 'Ding Dong', <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> to think, for all its inane lyrics, has some spirit, {{but it really is}} very slight." [...] Harrison's {{standing}} there was not helped by the presence of [...] "I Don't Care Anymore" [...] on the B-side, due to its casual delivery and the literal message in the song title. In a more favourable review, for Melody Maker, Chris Irwin wrote of the single: [...] "We’ve come to expect something with more substance than this glorified nursery rhyme from {{one of the most important}} musicians of the decade. True, it’s catchy with a full chunky sound to bounce it along, but with an undeniable infectiousness of the sort normally associated with chicken pox or measles ... Curiously, records of such banality have a habit of selling in their zillions and this is bound to be a biggie. Hit." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} {{before he was}} executed, Bundy granted an interview to James Dobson, a psychologist {{and founder of the}} Christian evangelical organization Focus on the Family. He used the opportunity to make new statements about violence in the media and the pornographic [...] "roots" [...] of his crimes. [...] "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. [...] "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it." [...] Violence in the media, he said, [...] "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys [...] "down the road to being Ted Bundys." [...] The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave. [...] "You are going to kill me," [...] he said, [...] "and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the album's low-budget release, Shields boasted, [...] "We {{know more}} about how the record {{industry}} works than our record company half the time. We do. I'm not joking." [...] That winter the band toured Europe, an event music critic David Cavanagh described as a [...] "unique chapter in live music". To recreate the higher tones from Loveless, Shields employed American flautist Anna Quimby. According {{to a friend of}} the band, [...] "She had a little skirt on, black tights...she was a little indie girl. But when she blew into the flute, it was like fucking Woodstock". NME editor Danny Kelly attended a show he described as [...] "more like torture than entertainment, I had a half pint of lager; they hit their first note and it was so loud that it sent the glass hurtling". A US spring tour followed, during which Shields and Butcher tested their audiences' ability to sustain noise played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the American tour, [...] "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over." [...] The tour saw My Bloody Valentine accused of criminal negligence by the music press, who took exception to the long period of extreme noise played during [...] "You Made Me Realise", referring to it as [...] "the holocaust". In December 2000 Mojo magazine rated the tour as the second loudest in history.|$|E

500|$|The generals were {{secretly}} interrogated {{for five}} and a half hours, mostly about details of their coup against Diệm, rather than the original charge of promoting neutralism. As all of the officers were involved in the plot against Diệm, this did not reveal any information new to them. The court deliberated for over nine hours, and when it reconvened for the verdict, Khánh stated, [...] "We ask that once <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody". The tribunal then [...] "congratulated" [...] the generals, but found that they were of [...] "lax morality" [...] and unqualified to command due to a [...] "lack of a clear political concept". They were chastised for being [...] "inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility" [...] and of letting [...] "their subordinates take advantage of their positions". Khánh also assailed Dinh, claiming that he had derogatorily compared Khánh to Gamal Abdel Nasser in a meeting with Diệm. The four imprisoned generals were allowed to remain in Da Lat under surveillance with their families. However, there were reports that the trial ended in a festive manner akin to a party, as the officers shook hands and made up with one another. All four generals were barred from commanding troops for a period; Kim was banned for six years, and Don 18 months. Offices were prepared for the quartet so that they could participate in [...] "research and planning". Worried that the group of idle officers would plot against him, Khánh made some preliminary arrangements to send them to the United States for military study, but this fell through.|$|E
500|$|To placate anxious fans, Broussard {{decided to}} create another trailer for E3 2001—it was the first public look at the game in three years. The video showed {{a couple of minutes}} of in-game footage, which notably showed the player moving in what appears to be Las Vegas and a certain level of {{interactivity}} (the player buys a sandwich from a vending machine and pushes each individual button on a keypad with Duke's outstretched finger). The trailer was impressive, and Duke Nukem was the talk of the convention; IGN reported on the game's graphics, saying, [...] "Characters come to life with picturesque facial animations that are synced perfectly with speech, hair that swings as they bob their heads, eyes that follow gazes, and more. The particle effects system, meanwhile, boasts impressive explosion effects with shimmering fire, shattered glass, and blood spilt in every direction [...] Add in real-time lighting effects, interactive environments, and a variation in locales unequaled in any other first-person shooter and <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> to see and understand why Duke Nukem Forever {{has been one of the}} most hotly anticipated titles over the last couple of years." [...] Duke Nukem Forever looked as good or better than most games, and staff at 3D Realms recalled a sense of elation after the presentation; [...] "The video was just being eaten up by people," [...] one said. [...] "We were so far ahead of other people at the time." [...] While many of the staff expected Broussard to make a push for finishing the game, however, he still did not have a finished product in mind. Following the death of one of Gathering of Developers' co-founders and continuing financial problems, the publishers' Texas-based offices were shut down and absorbed into parent company Take-Two Interactive.|$|E
