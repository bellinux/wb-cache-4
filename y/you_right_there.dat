2500|$|As part of this, Sting and Luger {{went up to}} rivals and Four Horsemen members Ric Flair and Arn Anderson {{some time}} after Bash at the Beach {{and asked them to}} team with him, saying that they needed to put aside their {{differences}} for the good of WCW. Flair and Anderson agreed and the four wrestlers composed Team WCW for the annual WarGames match at Fall Brawl in September 1996. They would be facing the nWo's team of Hall, Nash, Hogan, and a fourth member yet to be determined. On the Nitro prior to the event, however, the nWo played a trick on WCW claiming that Sting was joining their side. A vignette was shown where the nWo had a recording of Sting's voice playing in its limousine as Luger was being lured into the parking lot. Once he was there a man dressed as Sting, played by Jeff Farmer, attacked him and the crowd at home was led to believe that Sting had joined up with the nWo and would be their fourth man against what was now a three-man WCW team. Sting, however, was not at that edition of Nitro and showed up at Fall Brawl just as his teammates declared that they would face the nWo by themselves. Sting told Luger that he did not attack him, but Luger refused to believe him. Later, during the match, Sting entered as the fourth and final man for Team WCW, after the impostor Sting had entered for the nWo. Once in the ring, Sting immediately took out all four members of the nWo. He then stopped, turned to Luger, and angrily said to him, [...] "Is that good enough for <b>you</b> <b>right</b> <b>there?</b> Is that proof enough?" [...] Sting then gave Luger an obscene gesture {{and walked out of the}} match, leaving Team WCW at a four-on-three disadvantage which they did not overcome. The next night on Nitro, Sting came out unannounced during the middle of the show with no music or entrance pyrotechnics. He entered the ring and, with his back turned to the camera side of the audience, launched into an angry tirade about what had transpired over the last week: ...|$|E

[...] He continued on about the song stating that [...] "It's a perfect country song, gets <b>you</b> <b>right</b> <b>there,</b> even brings up a tear or two if you're in the mood." [...] Unwin concluded by commenting on Rimes growing up and maturing by stating [...] "we love, a mature, talented and affecting songwriter, {{who is also a}} human being. Sounds naff, right? Maybe, until you hear the songs." [...] Alan Light of The New York Times stated [...] "It’s unclear though how Spitfire will be received by country music fans. Having left Nashville for Los Angeles, become fodder for the scandal sheets and recorded an album that doesn’t sound like the glossy hits on country radio, Ms. Rimes is far from a sure thing commercially." [...] Light also added that “Spitfire... represents the boldest steps — in both music and lyrics — of her career.” ...|$|E
