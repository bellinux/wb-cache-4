5000|$|Nursery Crimes left Au Go Go {{and joined}} Survival Records, and in 1990 they {{released}} another EP, Marked by Time, which {{was produced by}} Kaj Dahlstrom. For the European market, the group provided a compilation album, What Do <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> (<b>Anyway)?</b> on Normal Records. In April 1991 they issued their second single, [...] "Eleanor Rigby", a cover version of The Beatles' 1966 song. Knight was replaced on lead guitar by James Masson, who added piano.|$|R
6000|$|... "I felt a hankerin', anyway, {{after some}} of the old people of the Castor; for, after having had all that money divided among us, it made me feel as if we belonged to the same family. I suppose that was one reason why I felt a sort of drawing to <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>Anyway,</b> I <b>knew</b> where <b>you</b> lived, and I came right here, and arrived this morning. After I'd taken a room at the hotel, I asked for your house and came {{straight}} here." ...|$|R

5000|$|After fellow CBS {{newscaster}} and Texan, Dan Rather, was {{switched from}} the White House beat to hosting the documentary show, CBS Reports, in 1974, the October 13, 1974 {{edition of the}} Doonesbury comic strip featured a joking fantasy scene in which Schieffer, his successor, haltingly comments on the transition: [...] "It was the affiliatesthey just couldn't take him. I mean let's face it, Dan wasn't exactly MR. TACT!. I dunno.... Maybe it's just {{as well in the}} long run, I mean, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>Anyway,</b> this is Robert Schieffer at the White House...."

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said--"I {{know it was}} a liberty--I made it out {{you were}} no {{business}} man, only a stone-broke painter; that half the time <b>you</b> didn't <b>know</b> anything, <b>anyway,</b> particularly money and accounts.

25|$|Almost {{everyone}} I've {{talked to}} says, 'We're gonna move to Houston.' What I'm hearing, {{which is sort}} of scary, is they all want to stay in Texas... Everybody is so overwhelmed by the hospitality, and so many {{of the people in the}} arenas here, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> were underprivileged <b>anyway,</b> so this (as she chuckles slightly) is working very well for them.|$|R

She was a fine woman, and she had two lovers.' ('You little round-faced scamp!' thought Miss Amanda. 'Are {{you going to tell}} that child all my love-affairs? And what do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about them, <b>anyway?</b> I never confided in you.

60|$|Peter Rabbit, as <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> is {{very fond}} of stories. In this respect he is very like some other folks I <b>know.</b> <b>Anyway,</b> he never misses {{a chance for a}} story if he can help it. He had {{discovered}} that Digger the Badger and Old Man Coyote, both of whom had come to the Green Meadows from the Far West, were full of stories about their neighbors of the distant prairies, folk whom Peter never had seen. Sometimes when he had nothing else to do, Old Man Coyote would come over to the dear Old Briar-patch and tell stories to Peter, who sat safe behind the brambles. Perhaps Old Man Coyote hoped that Peter would become so interested that he would forget and come out of the dear Old Briar-patch. But Peter never did.|$|R

5000|$|Throughout the {{two weeks}} in which Joan Wolfe resided within the {{abandoned}} cricket pavilion, Sangret visited her with increasing frequency; often when {{he should have been}} at base. He regularly brought food for he and Joan to eat together as they discussed their future plans, including the marriage Wolfe evidently yearned for. When they could not meet, Wolfe would send letters to Sangret that would be read to him by a Sergeant Charles Hicks, who would then compose Sangret's replies. The tone and style of Wolfe's letters to Sangret is typically naïve, yet optimistic, and is reminiscent of the letter she had composed on 26 July, with repeated references to her time spent in his company, her hopes for marriage, her general loneliness (which Wolfe is known to have referred to as her [...] "penance"), and her desire to be in his company. On at least one occasion, however, Wolfe does hark toward her frustration at Sangret's apparently repeated accusations of infidelity, to which she wrote: [...] "You know I am in a safe place now anyway, and you {{will not be able to}} accuse me of going out with other soldiers. I have never done it since I have <b>known</b> <b>you</b> <b>anyway,</b> but you are so damned jealous you think it; but still we will forget all that now and look forward to the future, when we are married." ...|$|R
40|$|Dr. Jones: It {{looks like}} Jenny {{is in the}} 97 th {{percentile}} for her age and gender. This means that she's definitely overweight, but <b>you</b> probably <b>knew</b> that <b>anyway.</b> Ms. Smith: Yes, I knew that and so does she. We figure she's about 40 pounds overweight. We've tried various diets and some exercise programs, but haven't really gotten anywhere. Now what? Do you have any recommendations? Dr. Jones: Yes, I certainly do… This conversation and thousands very much like it have occurred much more frequently {{in the last few}} years than they did a couple of decades ago. As the incidence of childhood and adolescent obesity has tripled in the past 25 years, efforts to understand what to do about this incredibly frustrating and debilitating problem have also increased. 1 2 The purposes of this paper are to evaluate the four primary options currently available to treat pediatric obesity and to make clear recommendations that families can use with their overweight child. VIABLE OPTIONS Four options exist on a continuum from the most widely available to the most intensive treatments: information; outpatient treatment (primarily via cognitive-behavior therapy [CBT]); bariatric surgery; and immersion programs. Immersion is considered most intensive because it involves a 24 -hour a day commitment, often for an extended period of time in an environment other than home. Bariatric surgery can involve a relatively permanent change in the digestive system that requires extended focus to maintain adequate nutrition and health...|$|R
