500|$|There {{was wide}} {{commentary}} {{in the news}} media about the social situation in and around Moston. Writing in The Times, Jon Ronson focused on Manchester's apparent economic imbalance, pointing out that while [...] "superficially, it is a city of growth" [...] — hosting international environmental conferences in 1993 and bidding to host the 2000 Olympic Games — this could not disguise the realities of the poor quality of [...] "built-to-collapse" [...] housing, the city council's policy on homelessness, poverty, street violence and drug culture, all of which played parts in the events leading up to Capper's murder. The city, he said, had violent 'no-go' areas, where [...] "you can expect to be mugged," [...] created through drug abuse and hopelessness, and populated by people who [...] "don't work, have no money, and rarely leave the houses that they find themselves living in before dark." [...] Ronson highlighted a city of contrasts, where [...] "expensive canal-side cafes are springing up faster than <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>count</b> them: the joke around town is that you can sip cappuccino all day and gaze out at the corpses floating past." [...] David Ward, writing in The Guardian, similarly drew attention to the housing policies, and quoted an older Moston resident as saying: [...] "These people are moving in and out every three months. They're illiterate half of them — just shagging and having kids." [...] The Daily Mail – in what Barker and Petley called [...] "ideological overdrive" [...] – described Capper's killers as [...] "the product of a society that tolerates petty crime, the break-up of families and feckless spending... Most of Suzanne's tormentors were on social security... an underclass which is a grave threat to Britain's future." [...] Author Carol Anne Davis agreed that when looking for answers about how this crime came about one need only [...] "look at the upbringings of these women who were single parents to three children by their mid twenties, had teenage boyfriends who were barely legal and who supported themselves through drug dealing and theft." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff {{is widely}} seen as an iconic and revolutionary figure in history of Ajax, Barça, and the Oranje. David Winner, the author of , wrote about Cruyff's {{influential}} career in the football world, [...] "There have been lots of brilliant football figures down the years, but none has been as significant as Johan Cruyff. As a player with Ajax, Barcelona and the Netherlands, he put himself in the pantheon along with greats such as Pelé, Diego Maradona, Ferenc Puskás, Lionel Messi and Zinedine Zidane. As coach at Ajax and Barcelona, he built thrilling sides, nurtured a remarkable number of genius players and influenced {{many of the most}} important teams in the world. The all-conquering Spain and Barcelona of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, brilliant Bayern Munich and Germany of today, AC Milan of the late 1980s and many other memorable champions would have been unthinkable without Cruyff. Once radical and revolutionary, Cruyffian principles have become standard throughout the modern game. His blueprint for developing young players has been copied all over the world." [...] Gabriele summed up Cruyff's footballing greatness: “There may have been better players {{in the history of the}} game, though I doubt <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>count</b> them on more than one hand. And there may have been better managers, too, if only because his coaching career only lasted 10 and a half years (during which he won 14 trophies, not a bad return). But it's tough to argue that any man has exerted a greater influence – on the pitch and on the bench – on the game as we know it today.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Linney first {{appeared}} in minor roles in a few early 1990s films, including Lorenzo's Oil (1992) and Dave (1993), before coming to prominence in the public television miniseries Tales of the City in 1993. She was then cast {{in a series of}} high-profile thrillers, including Congo (1995), Primal Fear (1996) and Absolute Power (1997). She made her Hollywood breakthrough in 1998, playing Jim Carrey's on-screen wife in The Truman Show, for which she received critical acclaim. Linney was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the 2000 film <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Count</b> On Me.

In 2003, Linney appeared in several notable films, including The Life of David Gale, Love Actually, and Mystic River. The latter film earned her a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Her 2004 performance in Kinsey, again as the title character's wife, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 2005, Linney starred in the horror film The Exorcism of Emily Rose and the comedy-drama The Squid and the Whale. For the latter role, she received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy. In 2006, Linney appeared in the political satire Man of the Year, the comedy Driving Lessons (starring Rupert Grint of Harry Potter fame), and the Australian drama Jindabyne by Ray Lawrence.

2500|$|The New Zealand Herald {{gave the}} record four stars out of five, stating that [...] "aside from disconcerting lyrics {{throughout}} which are droll and sometimes sharply witty – there are blasts {{of their more}} recent musical menace here too: 'Two Minutes' is mad but disciplined guitar thrash; 'Moreover' and 'Smash' are crafted Erasehead-grind metallic pop; the brooding 'Down to This' rides on electrostatic and repeated guitar and keyboard phrases. Smart, sharp, approachable and economic, Wire again give art-rock a very good name." [...] The Kansas City Star commented, [...] "virtually all aspects of Wire's varied history are covered, creating a stylistic best-of composed of new material. It may be the band's best work since 1979's 154. [...] If influence were sufficient currency to buy one's way into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Wire would be a contender. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>count</b> bands as diverse as R.E.M., Guided By Voices, the Manic Street Preachers, Minor Threat and the Cure as among those who confess a fondness for Wire that extends to inspiration. Red Barked Tree demonstrates that Wire can be a sustained influence; it's a most worthy addition to the band's estimable catalog." [...] The Independent gave the album a 4-star rating, stated that [...] "on this showing, the feral rage of [...] punk youth has matured into a pleasingly poised disaffection, with no loss of acuity," [...] while The Guardian, reviewing a live performance, concluded that Red Barked Tree sees Wire [...] "operating at full strength. Theirs are succinct and eloquent songs; in a long career Wire continue to deal in short, sharp shocks." [...] The review by Tim Klingbiel on Australian music website FasterLouder noted that [...] "From seething political references to prophetic statements about the environment, Red Barked Tree deals {{with a range of}} subjects in a magnificently compelling and thought provoking way", and that the record [...] "serves as an indication that Wire have returned to form in a massive way, and remain just as relevant today as they were 35 years ago". By contrast, longtime music critic Robert Christgau remarked in a two-star review, [...] "Even formalists get the grays – well, especially formalists." [...] AllMusic reviewer [...] "j. poet" [...] considered the album [...] "another strong effort" [...] but commented, [...] "While Wire is still making music that shatters expectations, after 30 years they're sounding a lot like the mainstream rockers they once despised." [...] Mojo placed the album at number 48 on its list of the [...] "Top 50 Albums of 2011". Classic Rock reviewer John Doran awarded the album 8 points out of 10 and defined it [...] "yet another post-80s success of Wire." ...|$|E
