500|$|In a four-star review, Allmusic editor Alex Henderson called Coltrane for Lovers [...] "an {{excellent}} {{collection that}} has no problem reminding us just how warm and expressive his ballad playing could be." [...] After discussing how Coltrane's ballad-playing has been undervalued in comparison to his more experimental recordings, in a December 21, 2001 article for The New York Times, writer Ben Ratliff wrote that [...] "This collection ... presents all the argument you need." [...] Some, however, have criticized the album and Verve negatively for repackaging Coltrane material for an unnecessary cash-in compilation. In [...] The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD, Richard Cook and Brian Morton gave the album {{one out of four}} stars and commented, [...] "Oh, for goodness' sake! We're tempted to tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> contains a previously unreleased rehearsal of Ascension, which we have long regarded as excellent make-out music, but it does not. Needless to say, the music is fine ... It's the concept we have problems with. Avoid." ...|$|E

The sequel is a straight-up, cookie-cutter platformer without any real Simpson-y touches to satisfy fans of the show; Bart finds himself wandering through generic side-scrolling levels, with a Simpsons character showing up every now and then to remind <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is an actual licensed product and not just a ROM hack." ...|$|E

Because this right now is the greatest country on Earth." [...] The Atlantic described the speech as the best of the night and called it a speech [...] "for the ages", a qualification echoed in other publications. David Smith of The Guardian called it a [...] "profound, moving and devastating riposte to Donald Trump".|$|E

[...] The album was publicly disowned by Rimes four days after its 2001 release, with Rimes stating that: [...] "his album was made without my creative input, it consists largely of unfinished material and songs that didn't make other albums ...

Meanwhile, producer RedOne described it as Gaga's [...] "freedom album" [...] as her manager, Troy Carter, felt her public image would begin to change after the release of Born This Way. A few months after the announcement, Gaga exclaimed that she had finished writing songs for the album: [...] "It came so quickly. I've been working on it for months, and I feel very strongly that it's finished right now. Some artists take years. I don't. I write music every day."

2500|$|There are those, however, who {{deny that}} Jesus was a pacifist and state that Jesus never {{said not to}} fight, citing {{examples}} from the New Testament. One such instance portrays an angry Jesus driving dishonest market traders from the temple. [...] A frequently quoted passage is Luke 22:36: [...] "He said to them, 'But now, {{the one who has}} a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.'" [...] Pacifists have typically explained that verse as Jesus fulfilling prophecy, since in the next verse, Jesus continues to say: [...] "It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment." [...] Others have interpreted the non-pacifist statements in the New Testament to be related to self-defense or to be metaphorical and state that on no occasion did Jesus shed blood or urge others to shed blood.|$|E

[...] "I’m still {{coming to terms with}} this phenomenon of Lianca," [...] she replied, [...] "with the devotion that I’m shown as a couple on TV, and the whole concept of fans. The letters that I get are heart breaking. It’s horrible that even now in the 21st century [...] feel the need to hide.

[...] She continued, [...] "I never really thought about it before--it doesn’t occur to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> medieval type of mentality occurs. It’s horrifying what happens." [...] Sosnovska did, however, see the decision to be out as a personal choice. [...] "I don’t blame people who choose not be out," [...] she said. She donated her time to fan sponsored fundraisers that raised money for several charities connected to the Lena and Bianca storylines. Over $20,000 had been raised for the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project. Sosnovska stated, [...] "I would never have known what a powerful tool TV could be, especially daytime. It’s frightening to the extent it’s a huge responsibility on the producers, directors, and actors to influence minds. You can’t underestimate the force of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} return in February 2000, at Bash at the Beach on July 9, Hogan was {{involved}} in a controversial work with Vince Russo. Hogan was scheduled to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match, there was a backstage dispute between Hogan and Russo; Hogan wanted to take the title, but Russo was going to have Jarrett win, and lose it to Booker T. Russo told Hogan {{that he was going to}} have Jarrett lie down for him, simulating a real conflict, although Jarrett was not told it was a work. When the bell rang, Jarrett lay down in the middle of the ring while Russo threw the WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt in the ring and yelled at Hogan from ringside to pin Jarrett. A visibly confused Hogan complied with a foot on Jarrett's chest after getting on the microphone and telling Russo, [...] "Is this your idea, Russo? That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in, because of bullshit like this!" [...] After winning and being announced as the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Hogan immediately took the WCW title belt. Moments later, Russo returned to the ring, angrily proclaiming, [...] "I can guarantee <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the last time you will ever see that piece of shit in a WCW stadium!" [...] This is also when the public discovered, through Russo, the [...] "creative control" [...] clause that Hogan had, which meant that Hogan was able to control what would happen with his own character and be able to do so without anyone else being able to tell him no. In his Bash at the Beach shoot promo, Russo said that he was arguing with Hogan all day prior to the event in the back because he wanted to use the clause in the Jarrett match, saying, [...] "That means that, in the middle of this ring, when [...] knew it was bullshit, he beats Jeff Jarrett!". Since Hogan refused to job to Jarrett, a new WCW World Heavyweight Championship was created, setting the stage for a title match between Booker T and Jarrett later that night.|$|E
