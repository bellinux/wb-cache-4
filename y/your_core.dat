500|$|The {{negative}} reviews generally {{disliked the}} film's Cold War-period setting, using various adjectives {{to describe it}} such as [...] "stuffy", [...] "stiff", [...] "bor", [...] "oddly hollow", [...] "embalmed", [...] "truncated", and [...] "psychic suffocation". They cited the film's much-advertised reverence of the source material as a fault, referring to the story as [...] "trapped" [...] in a faithful representation of Alan Moore's graphic novel. [...] "Watchmen is a bore [...] It sinks {{under the weight of}} its reverence for the original," [...] wrote Philip Kennicott of The Washington Post. Devin Gordon wrote for Newsweek, [...] "That's the trouble with loyalty. Too little, and you alienate <b>your</b> <b>core</b> fans. Too much, and you lose everyone—and everything—else." [...] Owen Gleiberman's Entertainment Weekly review reads, [...] "Snyder treats each image with the same stuffy hermetic reverence. He doesn't move the camera or let the scenes breathe. He crams the film with bits and pieces, trapping his actors like bugs wriggling in the frame." [...] " [...] never pause to develop a vision of his own. The result is oddly hollow and disjointed; the actors moving stiffly from one overdetermined tableau to another," [...] said Noah Berlatsky of the Chicago Reader. David Edelstein of New York agrees: [...] "They've made the most reverent adaptation of a graphic novel ever. But this kind of reverence kills what it seeks to preserve. The movie is embalmed." [...] A reviewer in The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "Watching 'Watchmen' is the spiritual equivalent of being whacked on the skull for 163 minutes. The reverence is inert, the violence noxious, the mythology murky, the tone grandiose, the texture glutinous." [...] Donald Clarke of The Irish Times was similarly dismissive: [...] "Snyder, director of the unsubtle 300, has squinted hard at the source material {{and turned it into a}} colossal animated storyboard, augmented by indifferent performances and moronically obvious music cues." [...] The trade magazines Variety and The Hollywood Reporter were even less taken with the film. Variety's Justin Chang commented that, [...] "The movie is ultimately undone by its own reverence; there's simply no room for these characters and stories to breathe of their own accord, and even the most fastidiously replicated scenes can feel glib and truncated," [...] and Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter writing, [...] "The real disappointment is that the film does not transport an audience to another world, as 300 did. Nor does the third-rate Chandler-esque narration by Rorschach help...Looks like we have the first real flop of 2009." ...|$|E

60|$|Of all Shakespeare’s {{historical}} plays, Antony and Cleopatra {{is by far}} {{the most}} wonderful. There is not one in which he has followed history so minutely, and yet there are few in which he impresses the notion of angelic strength so much;—perhaps none in which he impresses it more strongly. This is greatly owing to the manner in which the fiery force is sustained throughout, and to the numerous momentary flashes of nature counteracting the historic abstraction.
