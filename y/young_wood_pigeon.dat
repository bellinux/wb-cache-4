50|$|The Bonin <b>wood</b> <b>pigeons</b> usually mated in {{the trees}} or in the forests. Their eggs were {{particularly}} vulnerable to crows and other natural predators. They each normally laid two eggs and the eggs usually took 17 to 19 days to hatch into a <b>young</b> Bonin <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon,</b> just like extant <b>wood</b> <b>pigeons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most of its diet is vegetable, {{round and}} fleshy leaves from Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae, and cruciferous {{vegetables}} taken from open fields or gardens and lawns; young shoots and seedlings are favoured, {{and it will}} take grain, pine nuts, and certain fruits and berries. In the autumn they also eat figs and acorns, and in winter buds of trees and bushes. They will also eat larvae, ants, and small worms. They need open water to drink and bathe in. This species can be an agricultural pest, and it is often shot, being a legal quarry species in most European countries. It is wary in rural areas, but often quite tame where it is not persecuted. <b>Young</b> common <b>wood</b> <b>pigeons</b> swiftly become fat, {{as a result of the}} crop milk they are fed by their parents. This is an extremely rich, sweet fluid that is produced in the adult birds' crops during the breeding season.|$|R
50|$|The Azores <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{is found}} mainly in wooded areas. The {{largest number of}} {{breeding}} members are found in March. Like the other islander race of common <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> and some species of Macaronesian or Pacific Islands <b>wood</b> <b>pigeons,</b> the Azores have a low rate of reproduction, less than the common <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon.</b> The Azores <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> lays one white egg.|$|R
50|$|The Madeiran <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba palumbus maderensis) was a {{subspecies}} of the <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba palumbus) {{endemic to}} Madeira (Portugal), and {{found in the}} island's Laurel forest habitat.|$|R
50|$|Columba janthina {{is a type}} of <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> that {{normally}} habitates on a Camellia japonica Linne but lives on a Machilus thunbergii forest in Korea. For that reason, the distribution of the Machilus thunbergii and the Japanese <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> are closely related and the preservation of Machilus thunbergii is directly connected with protection of Japanese <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon.</b> Environment of Japanese <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> is in silver magnolia of seaside to eat fruits of a silver magnolia between the late July and the late August. The growing site of silver magnolia which is naturally growing in the coast of Sa-dong, Nam-myeon, Ulleungdo Island, is the representative place of the Japanese wood pigeon's migration. Therefore, this region is designated and is protected as a Natural Monument in order to protect Japanese <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Madeiran <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> closely {{resembled the}} <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> of {{mainland}} Europe, but the plumage was somewhat darker, {{especially on the}} upperparts and under wing-coverts. The vinous-pink of the breast was more extensive.|$|R
50|$|The Azores <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{closely resembles}} the {{mainland}} <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> subspecies of Africa, Columba palumbus excelsa. Its plumage is somewhat darker and conspicuous, with slightly brighter colour than the European subspecies (Columba palumbus palumbus), {{especially on the}} upper parts and the underwing coverts. The bill is orange to yellow and the coloring is paler at the tip, and the eyes are pale yellow. It has white neck markings and iridescent green and purple patches on the neck and breast. The neck feathers stiffen to form white spots {{on the sides of}} the neck, with more extension than the European common <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon,</b> but similar to Columba palumbus casiotis. The Azores <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> also has white in the wings and a more extensive green iridescence on the nape. The common <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> may be distinguished from other pigeons by its larger size.|$|R
50|$|The Ryukyu <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba jouyi), {{otherwise}} known as the silver-banded or silver-crescented pigeon is an extinct species of bird in the Columba genus in the family Columbidae. This <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> was endemic to the Laurel forest habitat.|$|R

40|$|Mycobacterium paratuberculosis {{is known}} to cause Johne's disease, a granulomatous ileitis in ruminants, and may be {{involved}} in some cases of Crohn's disease. Like M. paratuberculosis, the <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> strain of Mycobacterium avium may also show mycobactin dependence on primary isolation that is attenuated on further subculturing. A <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> strain, M. avium restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) type A/I, is also capable of causing granulomatous ileitis in experimental animal models but is not known to cause disease in humans. M. avium RFLP type A is associated with disease in immunocompromised hosts. Three DNA probes, pMB 22 and the two subclones pMB 22 /S 4 and pMB/S 12, were found to be capable of distinguishing among M. paratuberculosis, M. avium type A, and M. avium type A/I (<b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> strain) on the basis of RFLPs. These DNA probes were used to identify two mycobacterial isolates (M. paratuberculosis and M. avium type A/I, <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> strain) derived from the intestinal tissues of two patients with Crohn's disease. In addition, the <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> strain ofM. avium was identified from a patient with ulcerative colitis, andM. avium RFLP type A was identified from a patient with colonic carcinoma. This {{is the first time that}} M. avium A/I (<b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> strain) {{is known to}} have been isolated from human tissue. There are too few isolates to speculate about the etiological significance of mycobacteria and inflammatory bowel disease, but it is reasonable to conjecture that M. paratuberculosis may be responsible for some cases of Crohn's disease and that the woo...|$|R
50|$|The German ornithologist Ernst Schmitz {{lived on}} the island of Madeira by 1896-1906, a time when the Madeiran <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> was already rare. Despite great efforts, Schmitz managed to collect only a few {{specimens}} and eggs. In May 1924, no Madeiran <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> was found, nor was any seen in later years, not even by local pigeon hunters. This subspecies is most likely extinct now.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, {{seven of}} the nine islands of the Azores were surveyed. The survey gave density {{estimates}} of 14.52 birds/km2 on Terceira and 5.14 birds/km2 on the other six islands. Azores <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> densities in the Azores were still much {{lower than those of}} the common <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> in mainland Europe. Populations in the Azores may now be limited by the availability of breeding habitat and over-winter food supply. There are strong differences between <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> abundance on the different islands of the archipelago, notably with densities on the island of Terceira being higher than on any of the other islands. In 1905, The German ornithologist Ernst Hartert identified it as a subspecies.|$|R
