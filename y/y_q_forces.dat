40|$|It is {{a natural}} {{consequence}} of fundamental properties of the Casson invariant that the Rokhlin invariant µ(M) of an amphichiral integral homology 3 –sphere M vanishes. In this paper, we give a new direct proof of this vanishing property. For such an M, we construct a manifold pair (<b>Y,</b> <b>Q)</b> of dimensions 6 and 3 equipped with some additional structure (6 –dimensional spin e-manifold), such that Q ∼ = M ∐ M ∐ (−M), and (<b>Y,</b> <b>Q)</b> ∼ = (−Y, −Q). We prove that (<b>Y,</b> <b>Q)</b> bounds a 7 –dimensional spin e–manifold (Z, X) by studying the cobordism group of 6 – dimensional spin e-manifolds and the Z/ 2 –actions on the two–point configuration space of M{pt. For any such (Z, X), the signature of X vanishes, and this implies µ(M) = 0. The idea {{of the construction of}} (<b>Y,</b> <b>Q)</b> comes from the definition of the Kontsevich–Kuperberg–Thurston invariant for rational homology 3 –spheres. 57 M 27; 57 N 70, 57 R 20, 55 R 8...|$|R

A follow-up study showed that most celiacs have anti-avenin antibodies (AVAs), with a specificity and sensitivity comparable to anti-gliadin antibodies. A subsequent study found that these AVAs did not result from cross-reaction with wheat. However, recently {{it has been found}} that AVAs drop as soon as Triticeae glutens are removed from the diet. Anti-avenin antibodies declined in treated celiacs on an oat diet in 136 individuals, suggesting oats can be involved in celiac disease when wheat is present, but are not involved when wheat is removed from the diet. The study, however, did find an increased number of patients with higher intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs, a type of white bloodcell) in the oat-eating cohort. Regardless of whether or not this observation is a direct allergic immune response, by itself this is essentially benign.|$|R
