40|$|Some experimentation, {{particularly}} on trees in orchards, requires the superimposition Of {{a new set}} of treatments on an existing experiment, {{on the assumption that the}} effects of the new treatments do not interact with those of the old. Different approaches to the randomization of such new treatments were considered by Preece, Bailey and Patterson, who investigated in detail the case when one Latin square is superimposed on another to produce a Graeco-Latin square. For non-orthogonal superimpositions the theory is in general much more complicated. However, this paper shows that fairly simple randomization results are obtainable for certain balanced superimpositions of one <b>Youden</b> <b>square</b> on another (i) when each <b>Youden</b> <b>square</b> is of size (t - 1) x t and (ii) when each <b>Youden</b> <b>square</b> is of size k x t, where t is a prime power of the form 4 s - 1 and k = 2 s - 1 or k = 2 s. In each case, t is the number of treatments in each <b>Youden</b> <b>square.</b> The valid randomization procedure obtained for the second case is unlike any previously known randomization procedure and is unlikely to be acceptable in practice; it is, however, an excellent indication of the difficulties that arise when randomization is attempted in unusual circumstances...|$|E

40|$|The {{robustness}} of {{incomplete block}} designs {{to the loss}} of all observations in a block is investigated in terms of the efficiency of the residual design. Previous results use the eigenvalues of the information matrix of the treatment effects to determine the overall efficiency of the implemented design, relative to the complete design, in terms of the average variance of pair-wise treatment comparisons. Here we use a simple generalized inverse of this information matrix to identify the variances of the individual pair-wise treatment comparisons and show the effects of the loss of a block on specific treatment comparisons. We determine results for balanced incomplete block (BIB) designs and <b>Youden</b> <b>square</b> designs and show that, although the overall efficiency remains high when a block is lost, comparisons of two treatments that appear in the missing block can be quite seriously affected. The efficiencies of individual treatment comparisons in a BIB design are shown to depend on the number of treatments, the number of blocks used in the initial design and the number of treatments in a block. However, we also show that, for a single replicate of a <b>Youden</b> <b>square,</b> the efficiencies of individual treatment comparisons depend only {{on the size of the}} block that is lost and not on the number of treatments being compared...|$|E

The goats fed RM had the highest serum and urinary phosphorous values (5. 34 ± 1. 71 and 156. 9 ± 85. 5 mmol/L, respectively), while the animals that received CP had the lowest values for blood and urine phosphorous (2. 29 ± 0. 36 and 2. 02 ± 1. 24 mmol/L, respectively).

The urine from one animal that received WM diet and from another that received RM diet presented triple phosphate crystals, while the urine from the goats receiving CP did not present any of these crystals.

Limonene linearly decreased (P = 0. 03) F. necrophorum populations, and the optimal dietary concentration for limonene was 40 mg/kg DM. Limonene did not affect ruminal degradation rate of lysine, NH 3 concentration, or VFA profiles in ruminal fluid. Limonene was useful for reducing ruminal concentrations of F. necrophorum.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the effect of}} propionate (C 3) and casein (CN) on whole-body and mammary metabolism of energetic nutrients. Three multiparous Holstein cows fitted with both duodenal and ruminal cannulas were used in 2 replicated <b>Youden</b> <b>squares</b> with 14 -d periods. Effects of CN (743 g/d in the duodenum) and C 3 (1, 042 g/d in the rumen) infusions, either separately or in combination as supplements to a grass silage diet, were tested in a factorial arrangement. The control diet provided 97 % of energy and protein requirements. Within each period, blood samples were taken (d 11) from the carotid artery and the right mammary vein to determine net uptake of energetic nutrients. Plasma blood flow was calculated using the Fick principle (based on Phe and Tyr). On d 13, [6, 6 -(2) H(2) ]glucose was infused in the jugular vein to determine whole-body glucose rate of appearance (Ra) based on enrichments in arterial plasma. Both C 3 and CN treatments increased whole-body Ra (17 % and 13 %, respectively) but only CN increased milk (18 %) and lactose (14 %) yields, suggesting no direct link between whole-body Ra and milk yield. When CN was infused alone, the apparent ratio of conversion of CN carbon into glucose carbon was 0. 31 but, when allowance was made for the CN required to support the extra milk protein output, the ratio increased to 0. 40, closer to the theoretical ratio (0. 48). This may relate to the observed increases in arterial glucagon concentrations for CN alone. Conversely, the apparent conversion of infused C 3 carbon alone to glucose was low (0. 31). With C 3, mammary plasma flow increased as did uptakes of lactate, Ala, and Glu whereas the uptake for beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) decreased. Mammary net carbon balance suggested an increase with C 3 treatment in glucose, lactate, Ala, and Glu oxidation within the mammary gland. Mammary glucose uptake did not increase with CN treatment, despite an increase in glucose arteriovenous difference and extraction rate, because plasma flow decreased (- 17 %). Whereas CN, alone or in combination with C 3, increased both lactose and protein yields, only mammary AA (and BHBA in CN alone) uptake increased because plasma flow decreased (- 17 %). These {{data suggest that the}} observed variations of milk lactose yield (and other milk components) are linked to metabolic interchanges between several energetic nutrients at both the whole-body and mammary levels and are not explained by increases in whole-body glucose availability...|$|R

It was concluded that protein feedstuff affects ileal AA digestibility and {{is closely related to}} dietary fiber characteristics, and a 4 -percentage unit reduction in dietary CP had no effect on ileal AA digestibility in growing pigs...|$|E
40|$|Objective Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the content of digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) {{as well as the}} apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of crude protein (CP) and amino acids (AA) in barley grains obtained from Australia, France or Canada. Methods In Exp. 1, 18 growing barrows (Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire; 31. 5 ± 3. 2 kg) were individually placed in stainless-steel metabolism crates (1. 4 × 0. 7 × 0. 6 m) and randomly allotted to 1 of 3 test diets. In Exp. 2, eight crossbred pigs (30. 9 ± 1. 8 kg) were allotted to a replicate 3 × 4 <b>Youden</b> <b>Square</b> designed experiment with three periods and four diets. Two pigs received each diet during each test period. The diets included one nitrogen-free diet and three test diets. Results The relative amounts of gross energy (GE), CP, and all AA in the Canadian barley were higher than those in Australian and French barley while higher concentrations of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, total dietary fiber, insoluble dietary fiber and β-glucan as well as lower concentrations of GE and ether extract were observed in the French barley compared with the other two barley sources. The DE and ME as well as the SID of histidine, isoleucine, leucine and phenylalanine in Canadian barley were higher (p< 0. 05) than those in French barley but did not differ from Australian barley. Conclusion Differences in the chemical composition, energy content and the SID and AID of AA were observed among barley sources obtained from three countries. The feeding value of barley from Canada and Australia was superior to barley obtained from France which is important information in developing feeding systems for growing pigs where imported grains are used...|$|E
40|$|In an {{experiment}} with 18 lactating Chios ewes, {{the replacement of}} barley grain, wheat grain, sugar beet pulp and lucerne meal with fermented olive wastes (FOW), maize grain and soybean meal was used to formulate diets that allowed the net energy (NE) for lactation (NE 1) density of FOW to be calculated. In the experiment, which lasted 8 weeks, ewes were allocated, after equal distribution for milk yield, body weight (BW) and lactation number, into three treatments of 6 ewes each in a <b>Youden</b> <b>square</b> experimental design with 4 consecutive periods of 14 days. Ewes in all groups were offered a concentrate mixture ad libitum (1. 12 kg/ewe/day, dry matter (DM) basis) and lucerne hay (0. 90 kg/ewe/day, DM basis). FOW {{were added to the}} concentrate mixture at inclusion levels (on an as-fed basis) of 0, 100 and 200 kg/t for treatments FOWO, FOW 100 and FOW 200, respectively. There were no differences among groups in milk protein (60. 0 g/kg), lactose (53. 0 g/kg) or ash (9. 6 g/kg) contents, but milk fat content increased linearly (P < 0. 01) with increasing dietary levels of FOW. Average milk yield (1 137 g/day) and yields of components tended (P < 0. 10) to decrease with increased FOW feeding. The best estimate of the NE 1 density of FOW was 2. 55 MJ/kg DM at 2. 7 ×M NE intake, a value only slightly lower than that of 2. 62 at 2. 7 ×M based upon a Van Soest et al. (1984) discount from equations of Van Es (1978), who suggested 3. 00 MJ/kg DM at 1. 1 ×M of NE intake. FOW is a low protein, high fibre and low NE 1 feedstuff that will be of limited value in rations of high producing lactating ewes...|$|E

Supplementation of protein to calves grazing actively growing pastures has been shown to increase animal performance. The role of protein supplementation is to stimulate: 1) forage intake and digestibility, 2) microbial protein (MP) synthesis in ruminal fluid and 3) provide adequate amount of undigested intake protein (UIP), which together with MP will be absorbed in the small intestine to meet the protein requirements for ruminant tissue growth. The purpose of the research reported here was to evaluate the effect of different sources of organic nutrients and their blends on feed intake, digestibility, and digesta flow using stocker heifers grazing bermudagrass. Seven Brahman heifers (average initial BW 230 kg) were assigned to seven supplement treatments during three 15 d periods in a 3 X 7 <b>Youden</b> <b>square</b> design while grazing late season bermudagrass pasture. Supplements consisted of the following: minerals only (MIN), corn (CRN), corn gluten meal (GLU), cottonseed meal (CSM), feather meal (FEA), corn gluten/feather meal (GFE) or corn gluten/cottonseed/ feather meal (GCF) all contained Bovatec. The protein containing supplements were formulated to contain 35 % CP and 2. 5 Mcal ME/kg, and were individually fed at. 2 % BW per day. Lanthanum and chromium were dosed to serve as flow markers and to estimate fecal output. Single pulse doses of CO-EDTA (solution), ytterbium (forage), and samarium (supplement) were used to estimate turnover rate parameters. Extent of digestion was determined using INDF. Intake was calculated from the estimated fecal output and digestibility. There was a significant effect (P. 05) were detected on fiber digestibility; nor on flow of OM, NDF, and INDF to duodenum; nor on turnover rate parameters due to treatments. The only significant differences (P <. 05) found in turnover rate parameters were due to site and marker. These data implied that flow and composition of feed amino acids escaping to the duodenum have a nutritional effect in regulating forage intake...|$|E
40|$|Effects of the {{presence}} of β-glucans and resistant starch in diets on nutrient and fiber degradability of rapeseed meal [RSM] (Brassica napus) and Distillers Dried Grain with Solubles (DDGS) were tested in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement. Two basal diets, containing either 500 g/kg RSM or DDGS and ~ 400 g/kg corn starch were formulated to meet or exceed nutrient requirements of growing pigs. Corn starch was partly replaced with the β-glucan-extract (β-GLUC; 60 g/kg w/w) or completely replaced with retrograded tapioca (RG; 400 g/kg w/w), resulting in 6 dietary treatments. A total of 10 crossbred barrows (initial body weight, 28 ± 1. 4 kg (SD); Duroc × Large White/Landrace; Hypor, Inc., Regina, SK, Canada) were fed the 6 experimental diets. In total, 46 observations were obtained in 10 pigs over 7 periods in an incomplete 10 × 7 <b>Youden</b> <b>square.</b> Each of 7 sequential 14 days experimental periods consisted of a 9 days adaption to the diets followed by 2 days collection of feces, 2 days collection of ileal digesta for digestibility measurements, and 1 day collection of ileal digesta for the measurement of retention time. Pigs were weighed weekly during the experiment after consuming their morning meal. Feces were collected from 08. 00 to 17. 00 h using bags attached to rings glued around the anus. Bags were collected within 1 h after defecation and immediately frozen (- 20 °C). Ileal digesta for digestibility measurements were collected from 08. 00 to 17. 00 h into plastic bags (10 cm in length and 4 cm in diameter). The bags were removed when filled approximately 70 % with digesta, or after a maximum of 1 h, and immediately frozen (- 20 °C). For retention time measurements, on day 14 of each experimental collection, 3. 4 g Cr as Cr 2 O 3 (solid phase marker) and 3. 4 g Co as Co (II) -EDTA (soluble phase marker) were mixed into the morning meal. Digesta were collected at 45, 90, 180, 270, 360, 540, and 720 min after feed consumption. For more information see publicatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of graded inclusions of wheat bran (0 %, 9. 65 %, 48. 25 % wheat bran) and two growth stages (from 32. 5 to 47. 2 kg and 59. 4 to 78. 7 kg, respectively) on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID), apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and hindgut fermentation of nutrients and energy in growing pigs. Six light pigs (initial body weight [BW] 32. 5 ± 2. 1 kg) and six heavy pigs (initial BW 59. 4 ± 3. 2 kg) were surgically prepared with a T-cannula in the distal ileum. A difference method was used to calculate the nutrient and energy digestibility of wheat bran by means of comparison with a basal diet consisting of corn-soybean meal (0 % wheat bran). Two additional diets were formulated by replacing 9. 65 % and 48. 25 % wheat bran by the basal diet, respectively. Each group of pigs was allotted to a 6 × 3 <b>Youden</b> <b>square</b> design, and pigs were fed to three experimental diets during three 11 -d periods. Hindgut fermentation values were calculated as the differences between ATTD and AID values. For the wheat bran diets, the AID and ATTD of dry matter (DM), ash, organic matter (OM), carbohydrates (CHO), gross energy (GE), and digestible energy (DE) decreased with increasing inclusion levels of wheat bran (p< 0. 05). While only AID of CHO and ATTD of DM, ash, OM, CHO, GE, and DE content differed (p< 0. 05) when considering the BW effect. For the wheat bran ingredient, there was a wider variation effect (p< 0. 01) on the nutrient and energy digestibility of wheat bran in 9. 65 % inclusion level due to the coefficient of variation (CV) of the nutrient and energy digestibility being higher at 9. 65 % compared to 48. 25 % inclusion level of wheat bran. Digestible energy content of wheat bran at 48. 25 % inclusion level (4. 8 and 6. 7 MJ/kg of DM, respectively) fermented by hindgut was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than that in 9. 65 % wheat bran inclusion level (2. 56 and 2. 12 MJ/kg of DM, respectively), which was also affected (p< 0. 05) by two growth stages. This increase in hindgut fermentation caused the difference in ileal DE (p< 0. 05) to disappear at total tract level. All in all, increasing wheat bran levels in diets negatively influences the digestibility of some nutrients in pigs, while it positively affects the DE fermentation in the hindgut...|$|E

Effects of {{limonene}} on ruminal fusobacterium necrophorum concentrations, fermentation, and lysine degradation in cattle. Journal of Animal Science, 94 (8), 3420 - 3430. doi: 10. 2527 /jas 2016 - 0455 Previous {{in vitro}} {{data showed that}} Fusobacterium necrophorum was inhibited by limonene. We further evaluated effects of limonene on growth of F. necrophorum in vitro {{as well as on}} ruminal concentrations of F. necrophorum in vivo. With in vitro cultivation in anaerobic brain-heart infusion broth, limonene decreased growth of F. necrophorum. Thymol also reduced growth of F. necrophorum, but it was less effective than limonene. Tylosin effectively reduced growth of F. necrophorum in vitro. Although the response over fermentation times and concentrations of antimicrobials differed somewhat between tylosin and limonene, the 2 antimicrobial agents yielded similar inhibitory effects on growth of F. necrophorum at concentrations ranging from 6 to 24 mg/L. The effects of limonene on ruminal F. necrophorum concentration in vivo were tested in 7 ruminally cannulated heifers (225 kg initial BW) used in a 7 × 4 <b>Youden</b> <b>square</b> design. Treatments included: 1) control, 2) limonene at 10 mg/kg diet DM, 3) limonene at 20 mg/kg diet DM, 4) limonene at 40 mg/kg diet DM, 5) limonene at 80 mg/kg diet DM, 6) CRINA-L (a blend of essential oil components) at 180 mg/kg diet DM, and 7) tylosin at 12 mg/kg diet DM. Each period included 11 d with 10 d washouts between periods. Samples of ruminal contents were collected before treatment initiation and after 4, 7, and 10 d of treatment for measuring F. necrophorum by the most probable number method using selective culture medium. Limonene linearly decreased (P = 0. 03) ruminal F. necrophorum concentration, with the lowest concentration achieved with 40 mg of limonene/kg dietary DM. Limonene tended (P ? 0. 07) to linearly reduce ruminal molar proportions of propionate and valerate while tending to linearly increase (P ? 0. 10) those of butyrate and 2 -methyl butyrate. Limonene did not affect ruminal NH 3 concentrations or degradation rates of lysine. Neither CRINA-L (P = 0. 52) nor tylosin (P = 0. 19) affected ruminal F. necrophorum concentrations. CRINA-L significantly decreased ruminal concentrations of NH 3 and molar proportions of 3 -methyl butyrate, whereas tylosin significantly decreased molar proportions of propionate while increasing those of butyrate and tending to increase those of acetate. Limonene supplementation reduced ruminal concentrations of F. necrophorum suggesting that it may have the potential to reduce the prevalence of liver abscesses, although {{further research is needed to}} assess the effect of limonene in feedlot cattle. © 2016 American Society of Animal Science.
