5000|$|I {{was told}} that at Disney the actor <b>was</b> told <b>to</b> play it like a cartoon with all that exaggeration. In Lord of the Rings, I had the actors play it straight. The {{rotoscope}} {{in the past has}} been used in scenes and then exaggerated. The action becomes cartoony. The question then comes up that if <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cartoony, why animate? ...It is the traditional method of rotoscoping but the approach is untraditional. Its a rotoscope realism unlike anything thats been seen. It really is a unique thing for animation. The number of characters moving in a scene is staggering. In The Lord of the Rings, you have hundreds of people in the scene. We have cels with a thousand people on them. It was so complex sometimes wed only get one cel a week from an artist. It turned out that the simple shots were the ones that only had four people in them. Ralph Bakshi ...|$|R
5000|$|This open {{promotion}} of certain viewpoints resulted in criticism from journalism professors and other newspaper editors, who worried that negative news about {{topics such as}} the military and business might not be covered. Dean Nelson, director of the journalism program at Point Loma Nazarene University, argued, [...] "Now if <b>youre</b> saying <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the cheerleaders of the military, why would you report on this guy thats taking bribes?... Wheres the cheerleading there?" [...] {{a reference to the}} Union-Tribunes Pulitzer Prize winning coverage of the Duke Cunningham bribery scandal. A New York Times writer added, [...] "There is a growing worry that the falling value and failing business models of many American newspapers could lead to a situation where moneyed interests buy papers and use them to prosecute a political and commercial agenda. That future appears to have arrived in San Diego." ...|$|R
5000|$|Auf der Maur and Corgan became pen pals. Following {{months of}} no contact, Auf der Maur {{sent a letter}} to Corgan {{requesting}} that Tinker open for The Smashing Pumpkins during their next tour date in Montreal. Corgan accepted her request and Tinker performed the largest show of their career, to 2,500 people, opening for The Smashing Pumpkins at Métropolis on November 30, 1993. Corgan, Auf der Maur recalled, [...] "patted me on the back. He said, Youre a really good bass player. <b>Youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in my band one day. It felt like a dream come true - exactly the kind of confidence boost I needed." ...|$|E
5000|$|Marshalls {{performance}} {{received a}} positive response from Passions cast members, while her exit {{was the subject of}} criticism. Ross felt that Marshall had the most demanding role on the soap opera, and commended her ability to make [...] "Liz wanting to have sex {{in the middle of the}} tsunami" [...] look believable. During the filming of the show, Ross said she used to watch Marshall and take notes on how to improve her own acting. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ross criticized the decision to remove Marshall, and said, [...] "When youre an actress of her caliber and kind to everyone and plan Christmas parties and celebrate everyones birthday and know your lines and are the most darling girl that ever breathed, of course <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fired!" [...] Rodney Van Johnson, who portrayed T. C. Russell, said that he was disappointed when the show began removing its racially diverse actors, feeling that it was a sign of its imminent cancellation.|$|E
5000|$|The band also {{revealed}} that within their concept album trilogy, Holy Wood serves as prequel to Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar despite the latter two preceding Holy Wood in release date. Each album contains its own distinct storyline, which can be linked {{together to create a}} larger overarching storyline encompassing all three. Manson has offered this {{much in the way of}} an interpretation: [...] "Wood is about wanting to fit into a world that didnt want me, and fighting really hard to get there. albums deepest elements are idealism and the desire to start a revolution. If you begin with Holy Wood, then Mechanical Animals really talks about how that revolution gets taken away from you and turned into a product, and then Antichrist Superstar is where youre given a choice to decide if <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> controlled by the power that you created or if you want to destroy yourself and then start over.

5000|$|After {{the episode}} aired, Parker and Stone {{received}} feedback that audiences felt [...] "Starvin Marvin" [...] was especially unkind to Struthers. Although {{they did not}} speak to her themselves, the duo received word that Struthers was {{a fan of the}} show until [...] "Starvin Marvin" [...] aired, after which she was very upset and reportedly reacted emotionally over her portrayal. Struthers was particularly saddened by the fact that her character steals food from the same starving children she had been working to help. Parker and Stone were slightly remorseful when they learned of her reaction and have said they did not have anything against Struthers personally. Nevertheless, Struthers was portrayed in an even less flattering way in the third season episode [...] "Starvin Marvin in Space" [...] as a Jabba the Hutt-like creature. In a DVD commentary track, Parker said of Struthers, [...] "Dude, youre really setting yourself up if <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that fat and go on the air talking about children. ... We dont think shes a bad person, shes probably nice to try to do this, but cut down on the Twinkies a little bit before going on the air." ...|$|E
5000|$|EuroGamer {{summarised}} {{by saying}} [...] "This {{may not be}} the revolution the Formula 1 subgenre has been waiting for, but youre not likely to find many Wii owners complaining." [...] GameSpot summarised the game by saying, [...] "If youre looking for an arcade-style racer with a Formula 1 badge, then F1 2009 may fit the bill and is likely to keep you busy for quite some time. Unfortunately, if youre looking for a game that captures the essence and challenge of the pinnacle of motorsport, <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disappointed." [...] GameZone recommended that customers play the game before they bought it, while IGN said that [...] "for fans of the sport deprived of an F1 game for so many years this does just enough to satiate the thirst." [...] VideoGamer.com looked forward to the games sequel, F1 2010, to be released on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC, stating that [...] "theres undoubtedly something better coming next year, on platforms that can do the sport justice." [...] VideoGamer.com summarised the general consensus by stating, [...] "This is a perfectly competent racer, one of the best on the Wii, but its not a classic {{by any stretch of the}} imagination." ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{writing the}} album, Wentz drew lyrical {{inspiration}} from rapper Lil Wayne, whom he called [...] "the best lyricist of 2006." [...] Speaking of Infinity on Highs lyrical themes, Wentz stated, [...] "On the last record, the lyrics were about This is where {{were going to}} be a year from now, and this is what <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> saying about us. But this time, we realized that a lot of bands should spend less time running their mouths and more time writing their songs." [...] In 2013, Wentz reflected, [...] "on a record like Infinity on High, I feel like I tried really hard to explain my perspective - and when I look back on it in hindsight I think it’s an extremely unrelatable record. Critics felt that much of the lyrics address the bands rise to fame and the pressure of maintaining a loyal fanbase. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that [...] "The only top-ten acts that talk about fame as much as Fall Out Boy does are rappers, although their take on selling records is less conflicted." [...] Cory Apar of Allmusic opined that [...] "Wentz lyrics are oftentimes resentful, full of fame-induced angst, and really emphasize his need to drive home his position that stardom has not changed the band." ...|$|E

5000|$|Saaab Stories was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, based on 9 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Chris Bosman of Consequence of Sound gave the album three out of five stars, saying [...] "With such {{a limited amount of}} time to work with on SAAAB Stories, it’s a disappointment that Bronson chose to cede time to a cast that, with the exception of Prodigy and Raekwon, doesn’t live up to Bronsolinio. Instead, we get a Harry Fraud production showcase, with limited Action highlights — a moderately enjoyable listen that’s nasty, but unsatisfying." [...] Chris Dart of Exclaim! gave the album a seven out of ten, saying [...] "If you were hoping Action Bronsons major label debut, SAAAB Stories, would be another Blue Chips, <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a little disappointed. Sure, hes still using food as a metaphor for just about everything and referencing obscure athletes, but his delivery is slower and more deliberate than on most of his previous outings. The lush instrumentals from Harry Fraud dont lend themselves to the sort of liquid wordplay present on Bronsons earlier efforts. Instead, the whole thing gets darker and more ominous; his threats and boasts take on a new edge. Its not that Bronson is less lyrical than before, its just that everything is more measured." ...|$|E
40|$|FORWARD: Message from Editorial Staff and Designer, Jocelyn Kornfeld Nearly 100 submissions. That???s {{what the}} {{editorial}} {{staff of the}} Island Fox had to choose from to create this year???s journal. When {{we looked at the}} pieces collectively we realized that each of them deals, in some way with discovery whether it???s self-discovery learning to cope with death, love, and depression, dealing with family, or becoming politically active. Each of us, as college students and human beings, can relate to all of these issues. Our hope is that as you read the Island Fox, you find something you can connect with. The chosen pieces were submitted to our graphic designer, Jocelyn Kornfeld, who was given free range with design and layout. How you see things on the pages is all hers ??? she is the creative genius behind the scenes. The only caveat was that she keep the format of everything the same way it was when the pieces were originally submitted. Her task was tough: she had to see how the pieces were interconnected. The end result is this Island Fox, and we believe that it represents this year???s submissions well. page 5 Whether or not you have pieces in this year???s journal, if <b>you???re</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here next year, make sure you submit! It???s a diffcult task to narrow down the submissions into something that will fit into just over a hundred pages. Creativity comes in all shapes and colors, so next year???s journal maybe the perfect fit for your work. And no mater what, whether you submit or not, keep on writing. Do what you love. Make it a good one, The 2008 Island Fox Staf...|$|E

The naval {{lieutenant}} is a Frenchman who cracks up the English and runs down the French: the hackneyed old Shaw touch. The characters are second-rate middle class, instead of being dukes and millionaires. The heroine gets kicked through the mud: real mud. Theres no plot. All the old stage conventions and puppets without the old ingenuity and the old enjoyment. And a feeble air of intellectual pretentiousness kept up all through to persuade you that if the author hasnt written a good play it's because hes too clever to stoop to anything so commonplace.
