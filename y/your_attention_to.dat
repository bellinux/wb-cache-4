25|$|I deem it {{important}} to direct <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Article 2 of the Constitutional Amendments of the United States—'the {{right of the people}} to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.' This you should comply with immediately. Every (local) union should have a rifle club. I strongly advise you to provide every member with the latest improved rifle, which can be obtained from the factory at a nominal price. I entreat you to take action on this important question, so that in two years we can hear the inspiring music of the martial tread of 25,000 armed men in the ranks of labor.|$|E
500|$|... "Animal" [...] {{was written}} by Miike Snow's three members, Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt, in {{collaboration}} with Henrik Jonback. In an interview with Dustin Fitzharris of Out, Wyatt explained that the song has an ambiguous meaning, [...] "It can deal with addiction. It can deal with just the basic instincts – {{some of them are}} wonderful {{and some of them are}} very dangerous." [...] In a separate interview with Joe Zadeh for Clash, Wyatt deemed it a [...] "very simple song" [...] and elaborated on its subject matter, [...] "Directing <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> man's underlying nature and how sometimes things in society just don't work out to meet your needs. And a lot of people end up feeling very dissatisfied. And the way people feel the need to fit into certain circumstances without even thinking about what they want." [...] "Animal" [...] was recorded at Robotberget, the band's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden. The band produced the track and then mixed it with Anders Hvenare.|$|E

2500|$|Reform {{movements}} {{for treatment}} {{of the mentally ill}} were related in this period to other progressive causes: abolitionism, temperance, and voter reforms. After returning to America, in 1840-41 Dix conducted a statewide investigation of care for the mentally ill poor in Massachusetts. [...] In most cases, towns contracted with local individuals to care for mentally ill people who could not care for themselves and lacked family/friends to do so. Unregulated and underfunded, this system resulted in widespread abuse. Dix published the results in a fiery report, a Memorial, to the state legislature. [...] "I proceed, Gentlemen, briefly to call <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the present state of Insane Persons confined within this Commonwealth, in cages, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience." [...] Her lobbying resulted in a bill to expand the state's mental hospital in Worcester.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding a citizen’s {{obedience}} to authority, Socrates {{says that a}} lawful authority, either human or divine, should always be obeyed. That in a conflict of {{obedience to}} such authorities, obeying divine authority supersedes obeying human authority: [...] "Gentlemen, I am your grateful and devoted servant, but I owe a greater obedience to the [...] god than to you; and, as long as I draw breath and have my faculties, I shall never stop practicing philosophy". That, as spokesman for the Oracle at Delphi, he is to spur the Athenians to greater awareness of ethics and moral conduct, and always shall question and argue, even if his accusers — Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus — withdraw their accusations against him. Therefore, the philosopher Socrates of Athens asks his fellow citizens: [...] "Are you not ashamed that you give <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> acquiring {{as much money as}} possible, and similarly with reputation and honour, and give no attention or thought to truth and understanding, and the perfection of your soul?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Rias has {{received}} generally positive critical reception. Jeff Chuang of Japanator.com reviewed Rias positively, complimenting her character design in general, writing that [...] "the character's [...] silhouette works {{so well that}} {{the shape of her}} hair draws <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> her fierce, but perfect face", and the voice acting portrays her as a [...] "cool beauty" [...] well. He opined that this was a good thing, as [...] "High School DxD features Rias an awful lot - both in terms of marketing material and also how the anime puts her in some pretty cool still shots." [...] Similarly, Davey C. Jones of Active Anime found Rias to be [...] "phenomenal", finding the [...] "extremely sexy smoking hot redhead" [...] to be [...] "mysterious, sexy, brazen, and coy all at once." [...] He also praised the English dub and breadth of the characters. Sheena McNeil of Sequential Tart also commended the diversity and character designs in the High School DxD anime, including Rias.|$|E

2500|$|The Mufti opposed all {{immigration}} of Jews into Palestine, {{and during the}} war he campaigned against the transfer of Jewish refugees to Palestine. No evidence has been forthcoming to show he was opposed to transferring Jews to countries outside the Middle East. The Mufti’s numerous letters appealing to various governmental authorities to prevent Jewish refugees from emigrating to Palestine have been republished and widely cited as documentary evidence of his participative support for the Nazi genocide. For instance, Husseini intervened on 13 May 1943, before the meeting with Himmler when he was informed of the Holocaust, with the German Foreign Office to block possible transfers of Jews from Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania to Palestine, after reports reached him that 4,000 Jewish children accompanied by 500 adults had managed to reach Palestine. He asked that the Foreign Minister [...] "to do his utmost" [...] to block all such proposals and this request was complied with. According to Idith Zertal, none of the documents presented at Eichmann's trial prove {{that it was the}} Mufti's interference, in these 'acts of total evil,' that prevented the children's rescue. [...] In June 1943 the Mufti recommended to the Hungarian minister {{that it would be better}} to send Jews in Hungary to concentration camps in Poland rather than let them find asylum in Palestine. [...] A year later, on 25 July 1944 [...] he wrote to the Hungarian foreign minister to register his objection to the release of certificates for 900 Jewish children and 100 adults for transfer from Hungary, fearing they might end up in Palestine. He suggested that if such transfers of population were deemed necessary, then:I ask your Excellency to permit me to draw <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the necessity of preventing the Jews from leaving your country for Palestine, and if there are reasons which make their removal necessary, it would be indispensable and infinitely preferable to send them to other countries where they would find themselves under active control, for example, in Poland, thus avoiding danger and preventing damage." ...|$|E
