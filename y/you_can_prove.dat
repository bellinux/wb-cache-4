25|$|Jan van Mill has {{described}} βN as a 'three headed monster' — the three heads being a smiling and friendly head (the behaviour {{under the assumption}} of the continuum hypothesis), the ugly head of independence which constantly tries to confuse you (determining what behaviour is possible in different models of set theory), and the third head is the smallest of all (what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> about it in ZFC). It has relatively recently been observed that this characterisation isn't quite right - there {{is in fact a}} fourth head of βN, in which forcing axioms and Ramsey type axioms give properties of βN almost diametrically opposed to those under the continuum hypothesis, giving very few maps from N* indeed. Examples of these axioms include the combination of Martin's axiom and the Open colouring axiom which, for example, prove that (N*)2 ≠ N*, while the continuum hypothesis implies the opposite.|$|E

I issue that challenge, I issue it to you, I issue it to the Palestinian Authority, I issue it to Noam Chomsky to Edward Said, every word in my book is accurate and you can't just simply say it's false without documenting it. Tell me one thing in the book now that is false? ...|$|E

2500|$|Rappleyea {{pointed out}} that, while the Butler Act {{prohibited}} {{the teaching of}} the theory of evolution, the state required teachers to use a textbook that explicitly described and endorsed the theory of evolution, and that teachers were, therefore, effectively required to break the law. Scopes mentioned that while he couldn't remember whether he had actually taught evolution in class, he had, however, gone through the evolution chart and chapter with the class. Scopes added to the group: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> that I've taught evolution and that I can qualify as a defendant, then I'll be willing to stand trial." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, sir,' says I, 'then {{you must}} divorce her. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> what you say, you may {{certainly}} get that done, and then, I suppose, you are free.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you tell}} me of {{anything}} that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> really <b>prove,</b> I will show you why," [...] he said. To this he added a suggestion that was most unwise, namely, that she should consult his father.|$|R
6000|$|... "The latter, sir, was {{a matter}} for the future, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>prove</b> what a man will do; so we'll let that pass. As for the former--the letter which you say I brought--you'll {{remember}} that you searched me at Maidstone--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have to reply, Signore, {{and honored}} father," [...] he coolly answered, [...] "that Balthazar hath right cleverly related a tale that hath been ingeniously devised. That I am Bartolo, I repeat to <b>thee,</b> <b>can</b> be <b>proved</b> by a hundred living tongues in Italy.--Thou best knowest who Bartolo Contini is, Doge of Genoa.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> {{that you}} are so, sir," [...] Mr. Tufton said, wearily, [...] "you are the Marquis of Langdale--that is to say, if your father is deceased.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ozma {{ordered the}} boy's arrest," [...] said Dorothy, [...] "and {{of course she}} knew what she was doing. But if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> Ojo is {{innocent}} they will set him free at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{a square}} sale, so square that I can see by the vendor's looks he would sooner realize half-value than countenance {{anything}} irregular.

6000|$|... "You {{may be of}} {{valuable}} assistance to me," [...] went on Ralph. [...] "I may have that man arrested. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> that he bound and gagged me, and locked {{me up in the}} closet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> {{what you}} say?" [...] queried Belding, {{in the same}} cool, unemotional tone. It struck him strangely at the moment what little {{knowledge}} this man had of the West and of Western character.|$|E
6000|$|... "And, I suppose, {{what you}} now {{want is to}} saddle the debts on the entire property? If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> really <b>prove</b> that the debts were {{incurred}} for your father's benefit, I should think you might do that. But has your sister refused to pay the half? They can't be heavy. Won't Miss Lynch agree to pay the half herself?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Murder... murder... <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>prove</b> it was murder? [...] I didn't {{think you}} could prove it was murder. She was dying in any event.|$|R

6000|$|... "That won't do, Brady; {{you told}} me {{distinctly}} that Reynolds and Macdermot swore together to kill the man; and you must swear to that in court. Why the barrister has been told that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is an {{important}} fact, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> it; for, though it might not technically acquit you, it would have {{its effect on the}} commander-in-chief, when he comes to decide on the sentence of this court." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{not easy}} to give a lie unless <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> it a lie. I made her realise this, and she bit her lip in vexation. Dame! What a pretty viper I thought her at that moment! ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} a meta-theoretical statement: Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never <b>prove</b> it.

40|$|Few statisticians {{have not}} met the {{frustration}} of facing a problem which cries out for statistical treatment but where there is blank refusal to use such methods.
