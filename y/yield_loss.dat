5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major <b>yield</b> <b>loss</b> in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies {{on the size of the}} pest infestation, the timing, and the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial <b>yield</b> <b>loss</b> depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage is early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of crop <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> {{is needed for}} the improvement of production systems that contribute to the incomes of rural families and food security worldwide. However, efforts to quantify <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> and identify their causes are still limited, especially for perennial crops. Our objectives were to quantify primary <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> (incurred in the current year of production) and secondary <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> (resulting from negative impacts of the previous year) of coffee due to pests and diseases, and to identify the most important predictors of coffee <b>yields</b> and <b>yield</b> <b>losses.</b> We established an experimental coffee parcel with full-sun exposure that consisted of six treatments, which were defined as different sequences of pesticide applications. The trial lasted three years (2013 – 2015) and yield components, dead productive branches, and foliar pests and diseases were assessed as predictors of yield. First, we calculated <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> by comparing actual yields of specific treatments with the estimated attainable yield obtained in plots which always had chemical protection. Second, we used structural equation modeling to identify the most important predictors. Results showed that pests and diseases led to high primary <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> (26 %) and even higher secondary <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> (38 %). We identified the fruiting nodes and the dead productive branches as the most important and useful predictors of <b>yields</b> and <b>yield</b> <b>losses.</b> These predictors could be added in existing mechanistic models of coffee, or can be used to develop new linear mixed models to estimate <b>yield</b> <b>losses.</b> Estimated <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> can then be related to production factors to identify corrective actions that farmers can implement to reduce losses. The experimental and modeling approaches of this study could also be applied in other perennial crops to assess <b>yield</b> <b>losses.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

When infection was before flowering, <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> of individual plants amounted to nearly 100 % in the three cultivars studies. Plants that became infected during flowering had <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> of 75 – 90 %.

25|$|Species within Orobanchaceae (broomrapes) {{are some}} of the most {{economically}} destructive species on Earth. Species of Striga (witchweeds) are estimated to cost billions of dollars a year in crop <b>yield</b> <b>loss</b> annually, infesting over 50 million hectares of cultivated land within Sub-Saharan Africa alone. Striga infects both grasses and grains, including corn, rice and Sorghum, undoubtedly some of the most important food crops. Orobanche also threatens a wide range of important crops, including peas, chickpeas, tomatoes, carrots, and varieties of the genus Brassica (cabbages). <b>Yield</b> <b>loss</b> from Orobanche can reach 100%; despite extensive research, no method of control has been entirely successful.|$|E
25|$|To {{properly}} manage {{damaged and}} infested areas, {{it is necessary}} to thoroughly work these areas and destroy plants left in the ground for the following harvest. Weeds in the infested areas should be destroyed, equipment should be cleaned, and infested fields should not be used for at least three years. Water stresses should be avoided in order to prevent <b>yield</b> <b>loss</b> due to water-stressed sugarbeets.|$|E
25|$|These {{individuals}} then {{suck the}} sap from the sugarbeet roots, which {{causes them to}} lose their color, wilt, and die. Infestation is apparent where they appear as circular patches in which plants and leaves are wilted and dying.

40|$|The use of {{intercropping}} as {{an integrated}} pest management (IPM) tool to reduce population densities of pests of field grown vegetables, and the growth and yields of cabbage and clover cover crops grown in the Netherlands, were investigated. In the first 2 experiments, the clover (Trifolium repens cv. Pertina or T. subterraneum cv. Geraldton) crop significantly reduced pest damage of fresh market cabbage cv. Minicole. The associated <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> due to competition with the cover crop were 15 - 24 %. In other experiments designed to investigate these <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> in cabbage for storage (cv. Slawdena), the losses were 18 - 43 %. The decrease in weight/head was reduced by decreasing the row distance from 0. 75 to 0. 50 m, although <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> were still high. Delaying the sowing of the clover crop, or transplanting the cabbage into a rotary cultivated strip in the clover stand instead of transplanting in the clover stand itself, did not reduce <b>yield</b> <b>losses.</b> It is suggested that intercropping with clover as an IPM tool is not suitable at present for cabbage crops in the Netherlands...|$|R
25|$|To improve {{tenderness}} of beef, it {{is often}} aged (i.e., stored refrigerated) to allow endogenous proteolytic enzymes to weaken structural and myofibrillar proteins. Wet aging is accomplished using vacuum packaging to reduce spoilage and <b>yield</b> <b>loss.</b> Dry aging involves hanging primals (usually ribs or loins) in humidity-controlled coolers. Outer surfaces dry out and can support growth of molds (and spoilage bacteria, if too humid), resulting in trim and evaporative losses.|$|E
25|$|Oats {{can also}} be left {{standing}} until completely ripe and then combined with a grain head. This causes greater field losses as the grain falls from the heads, and to harvesting losses, as the grain is threshed out by the reel. Without a draper head, there is also more damage to the straw, since it is not properly oriented as it enters the combine's throat. Overall <b>yield</b> <b>loss</b> is 10–15% compared to proper swathing.|$|E
25|$|Beet curly top virus (BCTV) {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1888 in the Western {{parts of the}} United States. The virus wasn’t fully recognized until 1907 when people started {{to realize that the}} virus was affecting their crops which led to increasing <b>yield</b> <b>loss.</b> As the BCTV began to surface and multiply within the United States, it affected many states (California, Idaho, Utah, and Washington) located in the Western area. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), many crops were destroyed from the disease and led to a considerable economic loss. The BCTV has also been known to affect other countries including Mexico, South America, and the Old World (the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East).|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{potential}} for some crop weeds {{to be used as}} a food source, many can also prove harmful to crops, both directly and indirectly. Crop weeds can inhibit the growth of crops, contaminate harvested crops and often spread rapidly. They can also host crop pests such as aphids, fungal rots and viruses. Cost increases and <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> occur as a result. Striga, one of the main cereal crop weeds in Sub-Saharan Africa, commonly causes <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> of 40-100% and accounts for around $7 billion in losses annually. Around 100 million hectares of land in Sub-Saharan Africa are affected by striga. Barnyard grass has been identified as a culprit in global rice <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> and certain species have been known to mimic rice.|$|R

25|$|The BCTV {{caused many}} {{problems}} for farmers. When the virus was first recognized in 1907, California farmers were detrimentally affected {{and had a}} large <b>yield</b> <b>loss</b> in crops. Other states including Idaho were also greatly affected by the virus. The BCTV nearly wiped out Idaho’s sugar beet industry until they effectively developed sugar beets that were resistant to the virus in 1935. From the early 1900s till now, farmers are still having difficulties in containing this virus. In 2001, the Central Valley located in California had an enormous loss in crops valuing up to millions of dollars. In 2002, the bean production located in the Columbian basin of Washington State was also afflicted with the virus and encountered many losses.|$|E

50|$|White rust can be {{a devastating}} disease on many {{important}} agricultural crops throughout the world. Seventeen races of white rust have been identified worldwide, each {{with a high level}} of host specificity. White rust is an economically important foliar disease, causing substantial <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> and eventual death of various crops. <b>Yield</b> <b>losses</b> of up to 20 percent have been recorded in canola fields, and white rust is considered the most important foliar disease of Brassicacae species in Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Phomopsis {{stem canker}} of {{sunflower}} {{is a serious}} disease caused by Phomopsis helianthi (sexual stage = Diaporthe helianthi), it was first observed in Europe in the late 1970s followed by U.S. in 1980s. Some of the earliest reports of this disease came from certain areas of Ohio State. After careful studies and examinations, {{they were able to}} detect pycnidia of Phomopsis spp. Emergence of this new disease became more and more apparent with increased number of reports {{from all over the world}} including Rumania in 1985, Hungary in 1983, France in 1985, and Iran in 1988. Relatively recently, Stem cankers were observed on sunflower plants growing in a field in Illinois. This is also becoming an emerging problem in Australian sunflower plants with <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> reaching up to 40%. Since the fungus is highly specific to sunflower, it will be difficult to find it in areas without major sunflower production. Disease is most severe in high temperatures and high rainfall leading to significantly high <b>yield</b> <b>losses.</b> NSA crop surveys show significant <b>yield</b> <b>losses</b> in Minnesota (22% infected plants in 2007)as well as North Dakota with an incidence of over 40% plants infected. <b>Yield</b> <b>losses</b> usually go higher with lodging ...|$|R
