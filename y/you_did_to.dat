Passing sentence, Mr Justice Latham said, [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> Celine has caused revulsion in the minds of all right-thinking people. You are a dangerous man and I will so report to the Home Secretary." [...] Latham subsequently set a minimum term of twenty years, which was later endorsed by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Bingham, and on 4 November 1998, the Home Secretary informed Morgan of the length of the sentence he must serve.|$|E

We {{talked a lot about}} what I felt the song needed in order to reach as many young people as possible. I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> me, you don't even know how much stronger I am.' ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is a [...] "melancholic and mature farewell" [...] to a failed {{relationship}}. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone wrote Rihanna [...] "slow-boiling" [...] interprets the line [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> me was a crime". According to Jude Rogers of BBC Music the lyrics of the song hint towards her failed relationship with Brown. A reviewer of Plugged In wrote that the lyrics that allude to this are [...] "And I let you reach me one more time/But that’s enough." [...] According to the reviewer, she later admits that the she was blind by her emotional confusion, [...] "your love ain’t the kind you can keep." [...] Jon Pareless of The New York Times wrote that Rihanna compares her love to a crime scene in the [...] "elegiac" [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] which features the couplet [...] "Prints, pictures and white outlines / Are all that's left {{at the scene of}} a cold case love".|$|E
500|$|During one scene, a {{frustrated}} Tom Cruise angrily {{jumps up and}} down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress Katie Holmes. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior. In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor Harrison Ford leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the Indiana Jones films. This is a reference to the twelfth season episode [...] "The China Probrem", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A cartoon image of film director Tim Burton is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice, and for his tendency to feature film actor Johnny Depp in so many of his films that he should [...] "just have sex with him [...] already". Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain Taco Bell, particularly enchiritos, {{which is one of the}} many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character. [...] Also, when the celebrities are discussing who to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as [...] "her," [...] to which the discussion goes [...] "her who?" [...] "her" [...] "oh...her." [...] This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks [...] "what did I ever do to you" [...] and Rick answers [...] "it wasn't what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> me, it was what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> her" [...] Steve: [...] "her? oh...her" ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 1999, Tracey Emin {{created a}} number of monoprint {{drawings}} featuring textual references about Diana's public and private life for Temple of Diana, a themed exhibition at The Blue Gallery, London. Works such as They Wanted You To Be Destroyed (1999) related to Diana's bulimia, while others included affectionate texts such as Love Was on Your Side and Diana's Dress with puffy sleeves. Another text praised her selflessness – The things <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> help other people, showing Diana in protective clothing walking through a minefield in Angola – while another referenced the conspiracy theories. Of her drawings, Emin maintained [...] "They're quite sentimental... and there's nothing cynical about it whatsoever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Melodically, [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath" [...] {{consists}} of an up-tempo common time signature of 112 beats per minute. It uses a simple three-note chord progression of D–Fm–E. The style of the production and arrangement were compared to songs by Gloria Gaynor, according to Robert Copsey from Digital Spy. Lyrically, the song's theme and content was described as [...] "Scherzinger staving off an ex’s advances" [...] and {{making it clear that}} the relationship is officially over. As well as incorporating elements of club music, her tone is scornful on lines such as [...] "You can’t touch me now, there’s no feeling left/ If you think I’m comin’ back, don’t hold your breath/ What <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> me, boy I can’t forget".|$|E

He was also cast in the 2004 series Strange, as a blind priest who possessed {{knowledge}} of the Devil. Previously, he had appeared as a guest on the quiz show Have I Got News For You and was subsequently described by presenter Angus Deayton as the funniest guest in the series' history. A particular highlight was when Baker gave an anecdotal account of how, while entering a recording studio in Wales, he was accosted {{by a member of the}} public who told Baker: [...] "I will never forgive you, nor will my wife, for what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> our grammar schools." [...] Baker responded with: [...] "What are you talking about, you daft bugger?" [...] to which the stranger replied: [...] "I'm so sorry. For a moment I thought you were Shirley Williams." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 1999 at {{the height}} of Emin's Turner Prize fame, she created a number of monoprint {{drawings}} inspired by the public and private life of Princess Diana for a themed exhibition called Temple of Diana held at The Blue Gallery, London. Works such as They Wanted You To Be Destroyed (1999) related to Princess Diana's bulimia eating disorder, while other monoprints included affectionate texts such as Love Was on Your Side and a description of Princess Diana's dress with puffy sleeves. Other drawings highlighted The things <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> help other people written next to a drawing by Emin of Diana, Princess of Wales in protective clothing walking through a minefield in Angola. Another work was a delicate sketch of a rose drawn next to the phrase [...] "It makes perfect sence to know they killed you" [...] (with Emin's trademark spelling mistakes) referring to the conspiracy theories surrounding Princess Diana's death. Emin herself described the drawings, saying they [...] "could be considered quite scrappy, fresh, kind of naive looking drawings" [...] and [...] "It's pretty difficult for me to do drawings not about me and about someone else. But I have did have a lot of ideas. They're quite sentimental I think and there's nothing cynical about it whatsoever." ...|$|E
2500|$|By this time, however, Odoacer had to {{have lost}} all hope of victory. A {{large-scale}} sortie out of Ravenna {{on the night of}} 9/10 July 491 ended in failure with the death of his commander-in-chief Livilia along with the best of his Herulian soldiers. On 29 August 492, the Goths were about to assemble enough ships at Rimini to set up an effective blockade of Ravenna. Despite these decisive losses, the war dragged on until 25 February 493 when John, bishop of Ravenna, was able to negotiate a treaty between Theoderic and Odoacer to occupy Ravenna together and share joint rule. After a three-year siege, Theoderic entered the city on 5 March; Odoacer was dead ten days later, slain by Theoderic while they shared a meal. Theoderic had plotted to have a group of his followers kill him while the two kings were feasting together in the imperial palace of Honorius [...] "Ad Laurentum" [...] ("At the Laurel Grove"); when this plan went astray, Theoderic drew his sword and struck him on the collarbone. In response to Odoacer's dying question, [...] "Where is God?" [...] Theoderic cried, [...] "This is what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> my friends." [...] Theoderic was said to have stood over the body of his dead rival and exclaimed, [...] "There certainly wasn't a bone in this wretched fellow." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} {{according}} to some authorities, Israel fought Sihon {{in the month of}} Elul, celebrated the Festival in Tishri, and after the Festival fought Og. The Midrash inferred this from the similarity of the expression in [...] "And you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents," [...] which speaks of an act that was to follow the celebration of a Festival, and the expression in [...] "and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people." [...] The Midrash inferred that God assembled the Amorites to deliver them into the Israelites' hands, as [...] says, [...] "and the Lord said to Moses: ‘Fear him not; for I have delivered him into your hand." [...] The Midrash taught that Moses was afraid, as he thought that perhaps the Israelites had committed a trespass in the war against Sihon, or had soiled themselves by the commission of some transgression. God reassured Moses that he need not fear, for the Israelites had shown themselves perfectly righteous. The Midrash taught that there was not a mighty man in the world more difficult to overcome than Og, as [...] says, [...] "only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim." [...] The Midrash told that Og had been the only survivor of the strong men whom Amraphel and his colleagues had slain, as may be inferred from [...] which reports that Amraphel [...] "smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim," [...] and one may read [...] to indicate that Og lived near Ashteroth. The Midrash taught that Og was the refuse among the Rephaim, like a hard olive that escapes being mashed in the olive press. The Midrash inferred this from [...] which reports that [...] "there came one who had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew," [...] and the Midrash identified the man who had escaped as Og, as [...] describes him as a remnant, saying, [...] "only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim." [...] The Midrash taught that Og intended that Abram should go out and be killed. God rewarded Og for delivering the message by allowing him to live all the years from Abraham to Moses, but God collected Og's debt to God for his evil intention toward Abraham by causing Og to fall by the hand of Abraham's descendants. On coming to make war with Og, Moses was afraid, thinking that he was only 120 years old, while Og was more than 500 years old, and if Og had not possessed some merit, he would not have lived all those years. So God told Moses (in the words of [...] ), [...] "fear him not; for I have delivered him into your land," [...] implying that Moses should slay Og with his own hand. The Midrash noted that in [...] God told Moses to [...] "do to him as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> Sihon," [...] and [...] reports that the Israelites [...] "utterly destroyed them," [...] but [...] reports, [...] "All the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves." [...] The Midrash concluded that the Israelites utterly destroyed the people so as not to derive any benefit from them.|$|E
