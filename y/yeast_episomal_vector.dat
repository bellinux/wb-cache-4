Accordingly, we sought to optimize the conditions for polyplex-mediated transfection for effective delivery of <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> into the cytoplasm of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. <b>Episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> were complexed with the commercially available transfection reagents Lipofectamine 2000, FuGEND HD and jetPEI.

No cytotoxicity and the highest transfection yield were observed when the ratio of transfection reagent to <b>episomal</b> <b>vector</b> was 4 (v/wt) in the cases of Lipofectamine 2000 and FuGENE HD, and 2 in the case of jetPEI. Of the three transfection reagents tested, jetPEI showed the highest transfection efficiency without any cytotoxicity.

40|$|Extrachromosomal, or <b>episomal,</b> <b>vectors</b> offer {{a number}} of {{advantages}} for therapeutic and scientific applications compared to integrating vectors. Extrachromosomal vectors persist in the nucleus without the requirement to integrate into the host genome, hence avoiding the recent concerns surrounding the genotoxic effects of vector integration. By avoiding integration, <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> avoid vector rearrangement, which can occur at integration, and also avoid any effect of surrounding DNA activity on transgene expression ("position effect"). Extrachromosomal vectors offer a very high transgene capacity, allowing either the incorporation of large promoter and regulatory elements into an expression cassette, {{or the use of}} complete genomic loci of up to 100 kb or larger as transgenes. Whole genomic loci transgenes offer an elegant means to express genes under physiological and developmental-stage regulation, to express multiple transcript variants from a single locus, and to express multiple genes from a single tract of genomic DNA. The combined advantages of <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> of prolonged transgene persistence in the absence of vector integration, avoiding silencing by flanking heterochromatin, and high capacity, facilitating delivery and expression of genomic DNA transgenes, will be reviewed here and potential therapeutic and scientific uses outlined...|$|R

40|$|The circular, {{single-stranded}} (ss) DNA genomes {{of plant}} viruses in the families Geminiviridae and Nanoviridae are replicated within {{the nucleus of}} a host cell by a mechanism called rolling circle replication (RCR). Although this process relies almost exclusively on the replication machinery of the host cell, initiation occurs via {{the interaction of the}} viral replication initiation protein (Rep) with regulatory DNA sequences within the viral genome. The use of a virus-based episomal amplification technology as a plant bioreactor platform exploits the process of Rep-mediated RCR for the high-level amplification of virus-based episomes in plants and subsequent expression of heterologous proteins; such an approach offers advantages over existing gene expression technologies. This PhD thesis describes research towards the development of a virus-based episomal amplification system for use in sugarcane. Such a crop is ideally suited for a plant bioreactor system due to the efficient high-level production of plant biomass and the existence of established production, harvesting and processing infrastructure. In order to rapidly assess the potential of a virus-based episomal amplification system in sugarcane, a transient assay system was established. Sugarcane callus was identified as the most suitable cell preparation; providing rapid cell regeneration, uniform experimental samples and upon isolation, total DNA suitable for Southern analysis. This assay system once established, proved effective in rapidly identifying virus-based episomes capable of undergoing RCR within sugarcane host cells. This transient assay system was then used to test the functionality of a virus-based episomal amplification system based on the ssDNA virus, Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) in sugarcane. BBTV-based <b>episomal</b> amplification <b>vectors</b> were constructed with a reporter gene expression cassette flanked by two copies of the BBTV regulatory DNA sequences. The <b>episomal</b> amplification <b>vectors</b> were bombarded into sugarcane and banana host cells in various combinations and evidence of RCR was assessed through Southern blot analysis. RCR products were identified in banana host cells bombarded with the BBTV-based <b>episomal</b> amplification <b>vectors</b> in combination with vectors encoding BBTV Master-Rep (M Rep). RCR products were not identified within sugarcane cells bombarded with the same construct combinations. Integrated InPAct (In Plant Activation) <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> based on BBTV were then employed to confirm the transient results, in addition, the functionality of an InPAct vector based on an alternate virus, Tobacco yellow dwarf virus (TYDV) was also assessed. InPAct vectors based on BBTV were constructed with an untranslatable expression cassette for integration within the sugarcane genome. Transient experiments were performed to assess the ability of BBTV M-Rep and TYDV Rep to initiate RCR of their respective InPAct vectors. Visual observation of GFP expression indicated that BBTV M-Rep was capable of initiating RCR of the BBTVbased InPAct vectors within banana host cells but no evidence was observed in sugarcane host cells. TYDV Rep was capable of initiating RCR of the TYDV-based InPAct vector within sugarcane host cells with a 100 -fold {{increase in the number of}} fluorescent foci compared to cells bombarded with the TYDV InPAct vector alone. The BBTV-based InPAct vector was stably integrated within the sugarcane genome and the ability for BBTV M-Rep to initiate episome formation and RCR was assessed by Southern blot analysis. Evidence of BBTV M-Rep mediated RCR was not detected within the transgenic sugarcane bombarded with BBTV M-Rep. Transgenic sugarcane containing the TYDV-based InPAct vectors was assessed for the ability to be activated by TYDV Rep and undergo RCR. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that TYDV Rep was capable of recognising the integrated TYDVbased InPAct vector and RCR was detected within the transgenic sugarcane. The observation that <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> based on TYDV were functional within sugarcane host cells and BBTV-based vectors were not, was unexpected. It had been hypothesised that an <b>episomal</b> <b>vector</b> based on a monocot-infecting virus would replicate in an alternate monocot host, while an <b>episomal</b> <b>vector</b> based on a dicot infecting virus would not. Virus replication is thought to be host-specific however most host range studies have been conducted with full length infectious clones and not deconstructed virus-based episomes. The implication that viral Reps may be functional in plant cells of non-host species was then investigated. The ability for viral Reps to recognise their cognate IR and initiate RCR of virus-based episomes in different host cells was assessed through cross-replication experiments. Four ssDNA plant viruses; BBTV, TYDV, Chloris striate mosaic virus (CSMV) and Tomato leaf curl virus - Australia (ToLCV-Au) were assessed via Southern blot analysis for their ability to initiate both autonomous replication of infectious clones and episomal amplification within three different plant hosts; tobacco, sugarcane and banana. Results from cross replication studies indicated a complex interaction between viral and host replication components. BBTV infectious clones and <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> were restricted to replication within banana host cells providing a clear indication that <b>episomal</b> amplification <b>vectors</b> based on BBTV are restricted to Musa spp. BBTV M-Rep was unable to recognise the viral regulatory DNA sequences of the other three ssDNA viruses. TYDV infectious clones and <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> were capable of replicating within all three host cells tested, indicating that TYDV is capable of undergoing RCR within a broad range of plant hosts. TYDV Rep was also capable of recognising the viral regulatory DNA sequences of both CSMV and BBTV given favourable conditions within specific plant hosts. Replication of the CSMV infectious clone was not detected in any of the three host cells, although fidelity of this clone requires further confirmation. CSMV <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> were functional within banana host cells only, indicating that although closely related to TYDV, <b>episomal</b> amplification <b>vectors</b> based on CSMV have a restricted host range. CSMV Rep could not initiate RCR of <b>episomal</b> amplification <b>vectors</b> containing the viral regulatory DNA regions of the other three viruses in any of the plant host cells. ToLCV-Au infectious clones were capable of replicating within banana and tobacco host cells. <b>Episomal</b> amplification <b>vectors</b> based on ToLCV-Au extended the host range to sugarcane. ToLCV-Au Rep was unable to recognise the viral regulatory DNA sequences of the other three viruses in any of the plant host cells. The ability for a viral Rep to recognise its own cognate regulatory DNA sequences within alternate plant host cells is variable. <b>Episomal</b> amplification <b>vectors</b> based on TYDV and ToLCV-Au appear to be the most suitable for the further development of a virusbased bioreactor system in sugarcane. This study details the initial steps taken towards the development of a virus-based episomal amplification system in sugarcane. In doing so, fundamental knowledge into the mechanisms involved in Rep recognition of viral regulatory DNA sequences has been gathered. These research findings will provide a solid foundation for the further development of a sugarcane-based bioreactor...|$|R

40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{infection is}} the most common sexually transmitted disease in the world and is related to the etiology of cervical cancer. The most common high-risk HPV types are 16 and 18; however, the second most prevalent type in the Midwestern region of Brazil is HPV- 33. New vaccine strategies against HPV have shown that virus-like particles (VLP) of the major capsid protein (L 1) induce efficient production of antibodies, which confer protection against the same viral type. The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is an efficient and inexpensive expression system for the production of high levels of heterologous proteins stably using a wild-type gene in combination with an integrative vector. It was recently demonstrated that P. pastoris can produce the HPV- 16 L 1 protein by using an <b>episomal</b> <b>vector</b> associated with the optimized L 1 gene. However, the use of an <b>episomal</b> <b>vector</b> is not appropriate for protein production on an industrial scale. In the present study, the vectors were integrated into the Pichia genome and the results were positive for L 1 gene transcription and protein production, both intracellularly and in the extracellular environment. Despite the great potential for expression by the P. pastoris system, our results suggest a low yield of L 1 recombinant protein, which, however, does not make this system unworkable. The achievement of stable clones containing the expression cassettes integrated in the genome may permit optimizations that could enable the establishment of a platform for the production of VLP-based vaccines...|$|R

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were derived via transfection with <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> carrying hOCT 4, hSOX 2, hKLF 2, hL-MYC, hLIN 28 and shTP 53 genes. M 146 I-iPSCs were free of genomically integrated reprogramming genes, had the specific mutation but no additional genomic aberrancies, expressed the expected pluripotency markers and displayed in vitro differentiation potential to the three germ layers. The reported M 146 I-iPSCs line may be a useful resource for in vitro modeling of familial AD...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{the effect of the}} kanamycin resistance gene (Kmr) on 2 μm-based plasmid maintenance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The influence of this marker gene on the loss of the stable model-vectors proved to be constant, as well as independent of carbon source and culture growth rates. In strains for GALUAS - driven heterologous protein production introduction of Kmr resulted in curing of the <b>yeast</b> <b>episomal</b> plasmid (YEp) from the population in a small number of generations. Application of selective pressure on the strain producing recombinant penicillin G amidase (rPGA) did not provide the expected increase of protein yield. The influence of genetic elements for heterologous protein production on vector stability was examined, and the most destabilizing factors prove to be the presence and expression of the foreign gene...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{heterologous}} gene dosage {{as well as}} Salmonella typhimurium strain variability on immune response toward both the heterologous antigen, the nontoxic mutant of the Escherichia coli heat- labile enterotoxin LTK 63, and the carrier Salmonella strain have been analyzed. Effects of a single integration into the host DNA and different- copy-number <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> were compared in S. typhimurium Δcya Δcrp Δasd strains of two different serotypes, UK- 1 and SR- 11. Expression of the enterotoxin in the different Salmonella isolates in vitro was found to vary considerably and, for the <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors,</b> to correlate with the plasmid copy number. LTK 63 -specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies were highest in mice immunized with the high-level-expression strain. High anti-LTK 63 IgG and IgA titers were found to correspond to higher anti-Salmonella immunity, suggesting that LTK 63 exerts an adjuvant effect on response to the carrier. Statistically significant differences in anti-LTK 63 immune response were observed between groups of mice immunized with the attenuated Δcya Δcrp UK- 1 and SR- 11 derivatives producing the antigen at the same rate. These data indicate that the same attenuation in S. typhimurium strains of different genetic backgrounds can influence significantly the immune response toward the heterologous antigen. Moreover, delivery of the LTK 63 enterotoxin to the immune system by attenuated S. typhimurium strains is effective only when synthesis of the antigen is very high during the initial phase of invasion, while persistence of the S. typhimurium strain in deep tissues has only marginal influence...|$|R
