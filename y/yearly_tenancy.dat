60|$|Mr. Tom Smallways was a green-grocer {{by trade}} and a {{gardener}} by disposition; his little wife Jessica saw to the shop, and Heaven had planned {{him for a}} peaceful world. Unfortunately Heaven had not planned a peaceful world for him. He lived {{in a world of}} obstinate and incessant change, and in parts where its operations were unsparingly conspicuous. Vicissitude was in the very soil he tilled; even his garden was upon a <b>yearly</b> <b>tenancy,</b> and overshadowed by a huge board that proclaimed it not so much a garden as an eligible building site. He was horticulture under notice to quit, the last patch of country in a district flooded by new and (other) things. He did his best to console himself, to imagine matters near the turn of the tide.|$|E
50|$|The moat house {{continued}} to be let to a succession of farming tenants {{over the course of}} the 18th century. In June 1715 the ‘Manor House’ with all lands appertaining and 'three water grist mills' with fishing rights were leased to Mathew White of Great Appleby. In 1753 the land and water mills were given to William Cooper. A few years later in April 1753 an agreement was drawn up leasing the lands to Joseph Wilkes of Overseal. By the early 19th century the lands were being let on a <b>yearly</b> <b>tenancy</b> first to the Wilkes, then Thomas Heafield and Thomas Taverner, local yeoman farmers, a further indication perhaps that the house itself may have been left unoccupied.|$|E
40|$|The Law of Judgments and the {{jurisdiction}} of the sheriff in selling land, considered with reference to the complaints of the County Down people on the subject: (1) that the Law of Judgments operates unequally and harshly on leasehold interests and upon <b>yearly</b> <b>tenancies,</b> (2) That {{the jurisdiction}} of the sheriff in selling leasehold and <b>yearly</b> <b>tenancies</b> under the writ of ?fieri facias? is burdensome and oppressive, (3) That the creditor who involves the tenant in the heaviest law costs can get an unjust priority over other creditors, (4) That the judgment creditor can in many cases confiscate the rights of the widowed mother and the younger brothers and sisters of the tenant, (5) That sales by ?fieri facias? is a new procedure that has sprung out of the Land Ac...|$|R
5000|$|The {{landmark}} 1948 Act {{was enacted}} {{at a time}} when war-time food rationing was still in force and sought to encourage long-term investment by tenants by granting them lifetime security of tenure. Under the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 security was extended to spouses and relatives of tenants for two successions, providing that they had been earning the majority of their income from the holding for five years. Succession rights were however withdrawn for new tenancies in 1984 and this was consolidated in the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986. These two statutes also laid down rules for the determination of rents by the arbitration process. The 1986 statute covered tenancies over agricultural land where the land was used for a trade or business and the definition of [...] "agriculture" [...] in section 96(1) was wide enough to include various uses that in themselves were not agricultural but were deemed so if ancillary to agriculture (e.g. woodlands). The essence of the code was to establish complex constraints on the landlord's ability to give notice to quit, whilst also converting fixed term <b>tenancies</b> into <b>yearly</b> <b>tenancies</b> {{at the conclusion of the}} fixed term. In addition, there was a uniform rent ascertainment scheme contained in section 12.|$|R
50|$|That Act was altered with {{effect from}} 18 October 2006 by the Regulatory Reform (Agricultural Tenancies)(England and Wales) Order 2006 SI 2006/2805, which also {{contains}} changes to the 1986 Act. Tenancies granted after 18 October 2006 over agricultural land used for a trade or business will fall within the limited protection of the 1995 Act so as to enjoy (provided the term is {{more than two years}} in length or there is a <b>yearly</b> <b>tenancy)</b> a mandatory minimum twelve months written notice to quit, including in respect of fixed terms. There is for all tenancies within the scope of the Act a mandatory tenants' right to remove fixtures and buildings (section 8) together with compensation for improvements (Part III). The rent review provisions in Part II may be the subject of choice to a much greater extent than previously. Disputes under the Act are usually, by the terms of Part IV, the subject of statutory arbitration controlled by the framework of the Arbitration Act 1996.|$|E
