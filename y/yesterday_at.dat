He wrote two further plays, After You with the Milk and Malacca Linda, in which he revisited the colonial Malaya of his youth. At 2013 neither has been staged in the West End.|$|E

2500|$|On October 3, 1890, the New Haven Morning News reported: [...] "The {{opening of}} Rosemary Hall {{took place at}} Wallingford <b>yesterday</b> ... <b>at</b> the {{beautiful}} Rosemary Farms, which have been the property of Mrs. Choate's family for five generations. ... Rev. Edward Everett Hale addressed the school girls in his inimitable way, at once attractive and helpful. 'Never forget,' said he, 'that {{it is a great}} art to do what you do well. If you limp, limp well, and if you dance, dance well'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rose {{attended}} numerous social functions, {{many with}} the English aristocracy, while {{she lived in}} London either accompanied by Harry or alone. The Times in 1910 reported that “Viscount Bridport, the Duchess of Devonshire, Earl Howe, Lord Ornathwaite, Lady Russell and Mrs. Gordon Selfridge were among the many present <b>yesterday</b> <b>at</b> the musical and dramatic matinee given at the Criterion Theatre. [...] The couple together also saw Anna Pavlova dance with her partner [...] Michael Mordkin at a special private performance.|$|E
2500|$|On {{behalf of}} the Emperor, Prime Minister Count Eduard Taaffe issued a {{statement}} at noon that Rudolf had died [...] "due to a rupture of an aneurism of the heart". The Imperial family and court were still {{under the impression that}} he had been poisoned and it appears that even Mary's mother, Baroness Helene Vetsera, initially believed this. It was only when the court medical commission headed by Dr. Widerhofer arrived in Mayerling that afternoon that a more accurate cause of death was established, and not until 6 a.m. the following morning, when Widerhofer made his report to the Emperor, that the true state of affairs became known. The official gazette of Vienna still reported the original story that day: [...] "His Royal and Imperial Highness, Crown Prince Archduke Rudolf, died <b>yesterday</b> <b>at</b> his hunting lodge of Mayerling, near Baden, from the rupture of an aneurism of the heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film {{received}} positive reviews upon {{release and}} currently holds a 91% [...] "Fresh" [...] rating {{on the website}} Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.7/10. Roger Ebert gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, writing that the film [...] "provides a good time, high style, a loving salute to an earlier period of filmmaking". The New York Times chief critic of the era, Vincent Canby, pointed out that [...] "had Dame Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express been made into a movie 40 years ago (when it was published here as [...] "Murder on the Calais Coach"), it would have been photographed in black-and-white on a back lot in Burbank or Culver City, with one or two stars and a dozen character actors and studio contract players. Its running time would have been around 67 minutes and {{it could have been a}} very respectable B-picture. Murder on the Orient Express wasn't made into a movie 40 years ago, and after you see the Sidney Lumet production that opened <b>yesterday</b> <b>at</b> the Coronet, you may be both surprised and glad it wasn't. An earlier adaptation could have interfered with plans to produce this terrifically entertaining super-valentine to a kind of whodunit that may well be one of the last fixed points in our inflationary universe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Promoter Joseph E. Levine was {{the crucial}} U.S. figure in {{exploiting}} the opportunities offered by foreign genre production. In 1956, low-budget producer Richard Kay acquired a Japanese creature feature, Godzilla, for $30,000. Levine financed {{the shooting of}} new footage with American actor Raymond Burr that was edited into the film—the total cost to the U.S. partnership was less than $100,000. The Americanized version, Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, was distributed on the East Coast by Levine's Embassy Pictures. Levine himself {{came up with a}} string of taglines: [...] "Fantastic beyond comprehension, beyond compare—Astounding beyond belief!", [...] "Terror staggers the mind as the gargantuan creature of the sea surges up on a tidal wave of destruction to wreak vengeance on the Earth!", and many more. Godzilla, King of the Monsters! was a B-market hit, grossing over $2million in its original run. In 1959, Embassy acquired the worldwide rights to a cheaply made movie starring an American-born bodybuilder as one of the original superheroes. Steve Reeves had appeared in all of two films previously; his debut was in the independent production Jail Bait (1954), directed by Ed Wood On top of a $125,000 purchase price for his import, Levine then spent $1.5million on advertising and publicity, a virtually unprecedented amount. The New York Times was nonplussed: [...] "Hercules, an Italianmade spectacle film dubbed in English, is the kind of picture that normally would draw little more than yawns in the film market. It would have, that is, had it not been that promoter Joseph E. Levine has launched the movie throughout the country with a deafening barrage of publicity. The exploitation film, which has been taken over by Warner Brothers for distribution, opened <b>yesterday</b> <b>at</b> 135 theatres in the New York area alone." [...] Levine counted on opening-weekend box office for his profits, booking the film [...] "into as many cinemas as he could for a week's run, then withdrawing it before poor word-of-mouth withdrew it for him." [...] The strategy was a smashing success: the film earned $4.7million in domestic rentals alone. Just as valuable to the bottom line, it was even more successful overseas. Within a few decades, Hollywood would be dominated by both movies and an exploitation philosophy very like Levine's.|$|E
