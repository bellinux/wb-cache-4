His bill was not broad like mine but more like the bills of other birds, and his feet were like the feet of Mr. Grouse and Bob White. They were made for scratching, and there was nothing between the toes. You see, Old Mother Nature was experimenting. She made everybody a little different from everybody else and then started them forth in the Great World to shift for themselves and to find out what they really needed that they hadn't got.|$|R
500|$|Musically, it is a pop {{and country}} album. According to About.com, each of Cyrus' songs {{incorporate}} her [...] "husky twang". The up-tempo songs are mainly performed by Montana and ballads are kept at a minimum. Songs like [...] "You'll Always Find <b>Your</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Back</b> Home", [...] "Let's Get Crazy", and [...] "Spotlight" [...] {{are the most}} true to pop. [...] "Let's Get Crazy" [...] carries a groove and creates a beat from paparazzi flashbulbs. Cyrus' songs are more mid-tempo. [...] "Hoedown Throwdown" [...] is an instructional dance song that mixes country and hip-hop. [...] "The Climb" [...] has solid, clear vocals and is a standard-issue power ballad that places piano solos between chiming electric guitars. [...] "Crazier" [...] is a waltzing ballad that has Swift in relaxed soprano vocals.|$|E
500|$|Several {{other artists}} {{appear on the}} soundtrack. Billy Ray Cyrus' song on the album, [...] "Back to Tennessee", is the title track of his {{eleventh}} studio album. Written by Cyrus, Tamara Dunn and Matthew Wilder, the song reflects the desire of both Cyrus and his character in the film, Robbie Ray Stewart, {{to return to their}} roots. Disney artist Steve Rushton sings [...] "Everything I Want" [...] and [...] "Game Over". Rascal Flatts perform acoustic versions of previous efforts originally released on Feels Like Today (2004) and Me and My Gang (2006). When approached about participating in the soundtrack, Taylor Swift sent her ballad [...] "Crazier" [...] because it [...] "was perfect to fall in love to".

500|$|Swift contributed backing vocals to John Mayer's [...] "Half of My Heart", {{a single}} {{featured}} on his fourth album, Battle Studies (2009).

The romantic comedy, released the following year, saw her play the ditzy girlfriend of a high school jock, a role in which Los Angeles Times found [...] "serious comedic potential". In a scathing review, the critic for Variety deemed her [...] "entirely undirected", arguing that [...] "she needs to find a skilled director to tamp her down and channel her obviously abundant energy".|$|E

From there most walkers would probably want to go to Hartfell. On the return leg head back to Birnock Cloves just to the south of Swatte Fell summit and from there down Birnock Water back to Moffat Well. [...] The sulphurous waters of Moffat Well were believed to have healing properties and during the Victorian era the high demand for this led to the water being piped down from the well to a specially built bath house in the town centre (now the Town Hall).|$|R
500|$|... "Alive" [...] is not [...] "the type of music" [...] that Lopez {{is used to}} making. According to Lopez, {{she knew}} that there was {{something}} [...] "inside of me that I have to offer to this [...] And then, you know, things happen. Things have a weird way of happening naturally and organically when they're supposed to. And I feel that this song was just meant to be, for this movie. Basically, I wrote the song for me to go through all these kinds of things as an actress with this character. You draw from all different experiences in <b>your</b> life. From <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to the present, to whatever, to make it really true and honest". [...] "Alive" [...] means [...] "the world" [...] to Lopez because of its positive message {{and the fact that it}} was something that she created with Judd.|$|R

500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} explores {{a variety of}} concepts. With the {{exception}} of [...] "You'll Always Find <b>Your</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Back</b> Home", which speaks about staying grounded and relying on family, Montana's songs describe the [...] "glitzy-world" [...] and privileges of a celebrity. [...] "Let's Get Crazy" [...] centers on having fun at a party. [...] "The Good Life" [...] is a [...] "sugar-coated celebration of Gucci handbags and Prada shoes". [...] "The Best of Both Worlds" [...] explicitly alludes to Cyrus' character's double life as Montana: regular adolescent that moved from Nashville, Tennessee to Malibu, California by day and pop star by night. In the song, Montana talks about the privileges and advantages that are faced in leading in two lives with references to Orlando Bloom, concerts, friendship and film premieres. The songs Cyrus performs as herself are more reflective, personal, and sentimental. [...] "Hoedown Throwdown" [...] {{is a tribute to}} down-home fun. [...] "The Climb" [...] describes life as a difficult but rewarding journey. [...] "Butterfly Fly Away" [...] is a father-daughter duet by Miley and Billy Ray Cyrus about the coming of age.

5000|$|Tiki-taka {{has been}} {{variously}} described as [...] "a {{style of play}} based on making <b>your</b> <b>way</b> to the <b>back</b> of the net through short passing and movement", a [...] "short passing style in which the ball is worked carefully through various channels", and a [...] "nonsensical phrase {{that has come to}} mean short passing, patience and possession above all else". The style involves roaming movement and positional interchange amongst midfielders, moving the ball in intricate patterns, and sharp, one or two-touch passing. Tiki-taka is [...] "both defensive and offensive in equal measure" [...] - the team is always in possession, so doesn't need to switch between defending and attacking. Commentators have contrasted tiki-taka with [...] "Route One physicality" [...] and with the higher-tempo passing of Barcelona and Arsène Wenger's 2007-08 Arsenal side, which employed Cesc Fàbregas as the only channel between defence and attack. Tiki-taka is associated with flair, creativity, and touch, but can also be taken to a [...] "slow, directionless extreme" [...] that sacrifices effectiveness for aesthetics.|$|R

Four days before the album's release, [...] "Head for a Breakdown" [...] was made available for streaming on the Consequence of Sound website.
