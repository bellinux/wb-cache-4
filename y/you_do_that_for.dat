500|$|The vice {{president}} of Ferris Aircraft and a long-time love interest of Hal Jordan. One pseudonymous writer citing unnamed sources said Lively was among five leading contenders that included Eva Green, Keri Russell, Diane Kruger and Jennifer Garner. About her stunt work in which she rehearsed with stunt coordinator Gary Powell (Casino Royale, The Bourne Ultimatum, Quantum of Solace), gymnastic acrobats from Cirque du Soleil and used aerial stunt rigs created for The Matrix, Lively explained, [...] "Our director likes it real—the fights close and dirty... I'm 40 feet in the air, spiraling around. That's the best workout you can ever do because it's all core... <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> ten minutes and you should see your body the next day! It's so exhilarating, so thrilling—and nauseating".|$|E
2500|$|The {{product was}} code named the VIC-40 as the {{successor}} to the popular VIC-20. The team that constructed it consisted of Yash Terakura, Shiraz Shivji, Bob Russell, Bob Yannes and David A. Ziembicki. The design, prototypes, and some sample software were finished {{in time for the}} show, after the team had worked tirelessly over both Thanksgiving and Christmas weekends. The machine used the same case, same-sized motherboard, and same Commodore BASIC 2.0 in ROM as the VIC-20. BASIC also served as the user interface shell and was available immediately on startup at the READY prompt. When the product was to be presented, the VIC-40 product was renamed C64. The C64 made an impressive debut at the January 1982 Consumer Electronics Show, as recalled by Production Engineer David A. Ziembicki: [...] "All we saw at our booth were Atari people with their mouths dropping open, saying, 'How can <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> $595?'" [...] The answer was vertical integration; due to Commodore's ownership of MOS Technology's semiconductor fabrication facilities, each C64 had an estimated production cost of [...]|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>for,</b> Higgs?" [...] I asked petulantly, as he {{finished}} off another case, I think it was his twentieth.|$|R
6000|$|She was {{polishing}} tools, {{and though}} he had not wished to show himself, he could not resist speaking in to her through the half-open door. [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>for,</b> Marty?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Could <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> your grandmere?' I once asked, as {{she stopped}} for breath, because this tale always excited her. She crossed herself devoutly, and {{answered}} with fire in her eyes, and a resolute gesture {{of her little}} brown hands,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take a fatherly good night, my dear," [...] said he, kissing {{me on the}} forehead, [...] "and so to rest. These are late {{hours for}} working and thinking. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> all of us, all day long, little housekeeper!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you darling angel child," [...] cried Jane Hubbard joyfully. [...] "Did <b>you</b> really <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> my sake? Now I {{know you}} love me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{temptation to}} lie? I don't {{recommend}} <b>you</b> to <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> when I'm misinformed I'm {{as dangerous as}} a poisoned rat. I don't mean to crow over you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> yourself, Mr. Davies," [...] Elizabeth said almost roughly. [...] "I mean {{it will be}} more appreciated," [...] and {{she turned}} upon her heel.|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{have done}} me a service,' I said, 'which makes us closer friends than ever. I shall say more about this, and about other matters of some {{interest}} {{to both of}} us, later in the day. I want you now to lend me Mr. Armadale's letter (which I promise to bring back) and to wait here till I return. Will <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me, Mr. Bashwood?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's thrue, dear Martin; it's too thrue. Will {{you do me}} a great great favour, Martin"--and {{she rose}} up a little and turned her moist clear eye full upon him--"will you show your thrue love to your poor Anty, by a rale lasting kindness, but one that'll be giving you much much throuble and pain? Afther I'm dead and gone--long long after I'm in my cold grave, will <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me, Martin?".|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, sir," [...] Jack said; [...] "you know I've {{over fifty}} pounds laid by--and money can't {{be better spent}} than for the children. The strike can't last over a month, or six weeks at the outside, and maybe not that. I'll give you three pounds a week, if you will kindly hand it over to Mrs. Street, and say it's been sent you. But it's to go to feeding children. Let me see; the soup don't cost above a penny a bowl, and say a halfpenny for a hunch of bread. So that will give {{a good many of}} 'em a dinner every day. Will <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You made me go {{off with}} him in the night, like a--like a--! Oh, Tetchen, was that {{treating}} me as though I had been your own? Would <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> your own child?" ...|$|R
60|$|LORD W. [Grasping his hand] My dear chap, certainly. Go and {{interview}} this blighter, and then bring him round here. <b>You</b> can <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> one. I'd {{very much like}} to see him, as a matter of fact.|$|R
6000|$|... "You cannot help me; {{there is}} no help for an error like mine. Sometime, if ever the thought of me is a greater pain than {{it is at this}} moment, you can forgive me. Yes, <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Sir Robert, I will {{be quite}} frank with you. I want you to {{withdraw}} the report that you had intended to lay before the House, {{on the ground that}} you have reasons to believe that the Commissioners have been prejudiced or misinformed, or something. Then I want you {{to say a few words}} to the effect that the Government is going to reconsider the question, and that you have reason to believe that the Canal, if completed, will be of great international value. You know the sort of things ministers say in cases of this kind. A few ordinary platitudes will do. In modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good platitude. It makes the whole world kin. Will <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Son," [...] went on Ramiro, [...] "be {{wise and}} {{hold your hand}} before <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> which all hell itself would cry shame upon you. You think that I have been your enemy, {{but it is not}} so; all this while I have striven to work you good, but how can I talk lying thus like a calf before its butcher? Take the swords, both of them, and let me sit up, and I will tell you all my plans for the {{advantage}} of us both. Or if you wish it, thrust on and make an end. I will not plead for my life with you; it is not worthy of an hidalgo of Spain. Moreover, what is life to me who have known so many sorrows that I should seek to cling to it? Oh! God, who seest all, receive my soul, and I pray Thee pardon this youth his horrible crime, for he is mad and foolish, and will live to sorrow for the deed." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{scene that}} ensued I am {{powerless}} to describe. My pen is unequal to it. The doctor arose, {{not so much}} angry as astonished, white and incredulous. [...] "What did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for,</b> any way?" [...] he asked, glaring fiercely at my brother-in-law. Charles was all abject apology. He began by profusely expressing his regret, and offering to make any suitable reparation, monetary or otherwise. Then he revealed his whole hand. He admitted that he was Sir Charles Vandrift, the famous millionaire, {{and that he had}} suffered egregiously from the endless machinations of a certain Colonel Clay, a machiavellian rogue, who had hounded him relentlessly round the capitals of Europe. He described in graphic detail how the impostor got himself up with wigs and wax, so as to deceive even those who knew him intimately; and then he threw himself on Dr. Quackenboss's mercy, as {{a man who had been}} cruelly taken in so often that he could not help suspecting the best of men falsely. Mrs. Quackenboss admitted it was natural to have suspicions--"Especially," [...] she said, with candour, [...] "as you're not the first to observe the notable way Elihu's hair seems to originate from his forehead," [...] and she pulled it up to show us. But Elihu himself sulked on in the dumps: his dignity was offended. [...] "If you wanted to know," [...] he said, [...] "you might as well have asked me. Assault and battery is not the right way to test whether a citizen's hair is primitive or acquired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Croup," [...] said he, [...] "I {{heard you}} swear once, and I never heard anybody swear better, {{and with more}} conscience. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> {{swearing}} <b>for</b> me, and now I {{want to ask you}} if you will be willing to swear for me again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} beside the question, Brentwood," [...] Bertie drawled. [...] "You're {{as bad as}} Hanover, intruding the moral element. I haven't said that {{anything}} is right or wrong. It's all a rotten game, I know; and my sole kick is that you fellows are squealing now that you're down and labour's taking a gouge out of you. Of course I've taken the profits from the gouging and, thanks to you, gentlemen, without having personally to do the dirty work. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me--oh, believe me, not because I am more virtuous than you, but because my good father and his various brothers left {{me a lot of}} money with which to pay for the dirty work." ...|$|R
5000|$|Stevens is a professing Christian, {{and plays}} the guitar at his local Baptist Church. Stevens once quoted [...] "If you're a Christian, God has given you certain {{capabilities}} to do a job, {{to earn a}} living. The Bible teaches <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should <b>do</b> <b>that</b> as if <b>you</b> were <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> Him, because <b>you</b> are, and that's my attitude".|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{dare say}} you never store your {{furniture}} in Altruria. But {{here we have}} hundreds of storage warehouses of all sorts and sizes, packed with furniture that people put into them {{when they go to}} Europe, or get sick to death of servants and the whole bother of house-keeping; and that's what we did; and then, as my husband says, we browsed about for a year or two. First, we tried hotelling it, and we took a hotel apartment furnished, and dined at the hotel table, until I certainly thought I should go off, I got so tired of it. Then we hired a suite in one of the family hotels {{that there are so many}} of, and got out enough of our things to furnish it, and had our meals in our rooms; they let <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> the same price, often they are glad to have you, for the dining-room is so packed. But everything got to tasting just the same as everything else, and my husband had the dyspepsia so bad he couldn't half attend to business, and I suffered from indigestion myself, cooped up in a few small rooms, that way; and the dog almost died; and finally we gave that up, and took an apartment, and got out our things--the storage cost as much as the rent of a small house--and put them into it, and had a caterer send in the meals as they do in Europe. But it isn't the same here as it is in Europe, and we got so sick of it in a month that I thought I should scream when I saw the same old dishes coming on the table, day after day. We had to keep one servant--excuse me, Mr. Homos: domestic--anyway, to look after the table and the parlor and chamber work, and my husband said we might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, and so we got in a cook; and, bad as it is, it's twenty million times better than anything else you can do. Servants are a plague, but you have got to have them, and so I have resigned myself to the will of Providence. If they don't like it, neither do I, and so I fancy it's about as broad as it's long." [...] I have found this is a favorite phrase of Mrs. Makely's, and that it seems to give her a great deal of comfort.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm after no one," [...] replied Barney. [...] "I {{tell you}} I'm a stranger, and I lost my way in your infernal mountains. All I wish {{is to be}} set upon the right road to Tann, and if <b>you</b> will <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me <b>you</b> shall be well paid for your trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And if they <b>do</b> not, <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> them, eh, Mrs. Mac-Candlish? ha, ha, ha! But {{this young}} man that I inquire after was upwards of six feet high, had a dark frock, with metal buttons, light-brown hair unpowdered, blue eyes, and a {{straight}} nose, travelled on foot, had no servant or baggage; you surely can remember having seen such a traveller?' ...|$|R
5000|$|I drive Coty {{a little}} bit crazy, because it's always not {{signature}} enough. I go back and say things like, 'Can we push the sandalwood {{a little bit}} more, can we make a tiny bit more sexy?' To translate that into actual chemistry is a difficult thing. Then they go back and say, 'What does she mean by sexy?' And I'm like, 'You know if you take that little piece that smells {{a little bit like}} wood but has a little bit of musk? But I just want you to {{add a little bit of}} sweetness. Can <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me?' And then I think we are in the right direction. And then they come with one or two variations and I say, 'No, that's not it.' It's a long process.|$|E
5000|$|Baker telegraphed Isaac J. Wistar, his San Francisco law partner, who {{was back}} in Philadelphia, {{and asked him to}} help recruit and {{organize}} the regiment. When Wistar asked about rank, Baker replied, “I cannot at this moment accept military rank without jeopardizing my seat in the Senate. But you know my relations with Lincoln, and if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me, I can assure you that within six months I shall be a Major-General and you shall have a Brigadier-General’s commission and a satisfactory command under me.” Baker wrote to Lincoln on June 11, asking that he be given a command that would “not make him second to everybody.” [...] His efforts paid off; on July 31, Lincoln sent the Senate names of men he was recommending for appointments as brigadier generals. On the list, besides Charles Stone, Ulysses Grant and others, was Edward Baker.|$|E
5000|$|Lowe {{was arrested}} by British police in April 2004 for {{trafficking}} £117,000 worth of crack cocaine, he denied the charges. The exact charge was 'attempting to possess 1.17 kg (2.5 lb) of crack cocaine with intent to supply'. The Prosecution claimed he signed for the package under the fake name of [...] "Kevin Brown" [...] and intended to profit financially from knowingly trafficking the drugs. Lowe countered that the fake name was to avoid paparazzi {{and that he had}} no idea about the contents of the package: [...] "I am Jamaican, maybe you think differently. If I am a mate and you said, 'can <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me', I am not going to think anything bad of you." [...] Lowe said in a police interview: [...] "I thought he was a friend". In February 2005 he was cleared as the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want <b>you</b> to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> mantel <b>for</b> me," [...] she said. [...] "I don't {{know what}} you mean by 'low relief,' but I know it would be up to these, and they are right!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye; and {{we talked}} a deal about thee, for he says he never saw a woman a bit like thee. 'I shall turn Methodist some day,' he said, 'when she preaches out of doors, and go to hear her.' And I said, 'Nay, sir, <b>you</b> can't <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> Conference has forbid the women preaching, and she's given it up, all but talking to the people a bit in their houses.'" ...|$|R
