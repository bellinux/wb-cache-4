I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E

25|$|Davidson's work is {{well noted}} for its unity, as he has brought a similar {{approach}} {{to a wide variety}} of philosophical problems. Radical interpretation is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves imagining that you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not understand at all. How could you come to understand the language? One suggestion is that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is that sentence, or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its truth value, this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the biconditional (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning.|$|E

Eisenberg's performance in particular was criticized [...] by comic book fans and film reviewers, later earning him the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor.

When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics.

500|$|John Lasseter, {{executive}} producer of Bolt, decided to make [...] "I Thought I Lost You" [...] the theme for Bolt, since it lyrically summarized the film's plot. He said, [...] " [...] so sums up {{the theme of this}} film. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>a</b> dog and its owner and they both were separated, but they love each other so much — there's such an emotional payoff when these characters get reunited, and I think that's what this song's about." [...] Lasseter thought that solely the song worked, but it worked better for the film. [...] "I Thought I Lost You" [...] is one of two songs on the Bolt soundtrack and was released to Radio Disney to promote Bolt and its accompanying soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|During the Dublin sessions, Eno {{was sent}} tapes of the {{previous}} two months' work, which he called a [...] "total disaster". Joining U2 in the studio, he stripped away what he thought to be excessive overdubbing. The group believes his intervention saved the album. Eno theorised that the band {{was too close to}} their music, explaining, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> piece of music terribly well and the mix changes and the bass guitar goes very quiet, you still hear the bass. You're so accustomed to it being there that you compensate and remake it in your mind." [...] Eno also assisted them through a crisis point one month before the recording deadline; he recalled that [...] "everything seemed like a mess", and he insisted the band take a two-week holiday. The break gave them a clearer perspective and added decisiveness.|$|E

500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), {{but it was more than}} a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>a</b> lot of girls would have gone through with , and she stuck to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to do it. That scene [...] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, they stuck up for each other and [...] great friends, all the way through." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, the Icelandic donor {{died and}} his penis was surgically removed {{so that it}} could be added to the museum's collection. The penectomy was not entirely {{successful}} and left the penis [...] "a greyish-brown, shrivelled mass". According to Sigurður, [...] "I should have stretched it and sewn it at the back to keep it in more or less a normal position". Instead, it [...] "went directly into the formaldehyde". Although disappointed with the results, Sigurður expressed confidence that [...] "I will get a younger and a bigger and better one soon." [...] Visitors' most common reaction to the preserved human penis is [...] "that it's very old, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>a</b> bit shrunken, and the male members [...] say 'oh, I hope mine will not look like this when I get old. Sigurður has considered donating his own penis to the museum when he dies but said that it depends on his wife: [...] "If she dies first, my specimen would go in here. If I die first, well I can't say. She might say no." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 15, 1996, Yankovic began {{recording}} the lead single for the album, [...] "Amish Paradise". Yankovic felt that parodying Coolio would pay off, because Coolio had [...] "such an identifiable image {{that a lot}} of things could be done [...] ". He noted, [...] "I like to play around with people that have some- <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>a</b> lot of style as opposed to somebody who's kind of homogonized [...] and bland and has no personality, and Coolio certainly kind of sticks out in a crowd." [...] Yankovic felt that juxtaposing the original song's [...] "gangsta" [...] themes with the Amish lifestyle would produce a humorous end result. After Yankovic revealed to his label that he would be doing a Coolio parody, they requested that the album artwork for the release also parody Coolio. Yankovic had been toying with the name Bad Hair Day for a time and felt that he could adequately use the name and lampoon Coolio – who was known for his distinct hair style – at the same time. The final parody recorded for the album, [...] "Syndicated Inc.", is a parody of [...] "Misery" [...] by Soul Asylum, a loving ode to syndicated television.|$|E

500|$|Muhney {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters. I have been told by many of my cast members that the role to play is Adam. They say, [...] "If I were to have a choice, the character I would want to play is your role, Adam." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dragon Quest Slime has {{received}} positive reception from critics and fans, {{being called the}} [...] "most prolific" [...] of all the [...] "memorable" [...] monsters from the series {{and is one of}} the most recognizable characters in gaming. The Slime has also been called cute and charming by several critics, especially when reviewing Rocket Slime. GamesRadar listed it as the most lovable blob in video games, calling them the [...] "equivalent of training wheels" [...] due to how easy they are to defeat typically, but also saying that their weird smile makes players think twice about killing them. They also listed it as a character they wished they knew less about. They stated that while they started out as nothing more than things for players to kill and not feel guilty about, the playable role of a Slime in the [...] series made them realize they were more than just generic enemies. In the January 2010 issue of Nintendo Power, the editors listed the Slime among its Favorite Punching Bags, a list including Goombas and Octoroks. They wrote that [...] "The Slimes are just so cute and friendly-looking, it's almost hard to slay them. But <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>a</b> hero's gotta do what a hero's gotta do." ...|$|E
500|$|The Devil <b>You</b> <b>Know,</b> <b>a</b> {{small-scale}} production that Lawrence had filmed for in 2005, {{was her first}} release of 2013. She then reprised the role of Everdeen in , the second installment in the Hunger Games film series. While performing the film's underwater stunts, she suffered from an ear infection {{that resulted in a}} brief loss of hearing. With box office earnings of $864.9 million, the film remains her highest-grossing release. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice believed that Lawrence's portrayal of Everdeen made her an ideal role model, and wrote that [...] "there's no sanctimony or pretense of false modesty in the way Lawrence plays her". She took on a supporting role in Russell's ensemble crime drama American Hustle (2013) as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, the neurotic wife of con man Irving Rosenfeld (portrayed by Christian Bale). Inspired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Abscam sting operation, the film is set against the backdrop of political corruption in 1970s New Jersey. Lawrence did little research for the part, and based her performance on knowledge of the era from the films and television shows she had seen. Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent praised her as [...] "funny and acerbic", especially for an improvised scene in which she aggressively kisses her husband's mistress (played by Amy Adams) on the lips. Lawrence's performance won her the Golden Globe and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress, in addition to a third Academy Award nomination, her first in the supporting category.|$|E
