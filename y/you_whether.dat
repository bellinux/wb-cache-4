500|$|In that film, {{the initial}} {{conception}} of Palpatine was superseded by his depiction as a dictatorial ruler adept {{in the dark}} side of the Force. The Emperor was inspired by the villain Ming the Merciless from the Flash Gordon comic books. The rise of Palpatine involving an ambitious and ruthless politician dismantling a democratic republic to achieve supreme power is in part inspired by the real-world examples of Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Benito Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler. Other elements of the character come from Richard Nixon. Lucas said, [...] "The whole point of the movies, the underlying element that makes the movies work, is that <b>you,</b> <b>whether</b> you go backwards or forwards, you start out in a democracy, and democracy turns into a dictatorship, and then the rebels make it back into a democracy." ...|$|E
500|$|Cope {{took his}} sinking {{fortunes}} in stride. In writing to Osborn about the articles, {{he laughed at}} the outcome, saying, [...] "It will now rest largely with <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> or not I am {{supposed to be a}} liar and am actuated by jealousy and disappointment. I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of Monoclonius sphenocerus." [...] Cope was well aware of his enemies and was carefree enough to name a species after a combination of [...] "Cope" [...] and [...] "hater", Anisonchus cophater. Through his years of financial hardship, he was able to continue publishing papers—his most productive years were 1884 and 1885, with 79 and 62 papers published, respectively. The 1880s marked the publication of two of the best-known fossil taxa described by Cope: the pelycosaur Edaphosaurus in 1882 and the early dinosaur Coelophysis in 1889. In 1889, he succeeded Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania. The small yearly stipend was enough for Cope's family to move back into one of the townhouses he had been forced to relinquish earlier.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} book to Nigella Express {{was released}} in the UK in September 2007, US in November 2007, and in Australia in 2008. Sharing the same name as the television series, the book became another best-seller in the UK, and was outselling television chef Jamie Oliver by 100,000 copies, according to Waterstone's. It was reported that over 490,000 copies had been sold by mid-December in the UK. Furthermore, the book was number one for a period on Amazon UK's bestselling books, and was ninth on their overall list of Christmas bestsellers in any category. Paul Levy of The Guardian wrote that {{the tone of the}} recipes was [...] "just right. One of the appealing things about Nigella's brief introductions to each of them is that she thinks not just as cook, but as eater, and tells <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> they're messy, sticky or fussy." [...] In January 2008, Lawson was estimated to have sold more than 3 million books worldwide. Her Christmas book {{was released in}} October 2008 and the television show in December of the same year.
