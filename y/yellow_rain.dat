500|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} {{the death of}} Maria Dorantes, an illegal immigrant from Mexico living in the San Joaquin Valley near Fresno, California who was found dead, with her face partially eaten away, after <b>yellow</b> <b>rain</b> fell from the sky. Maria was {{the object of the}} love of two brothers, Eladio (Raymond Cruz) and Soledad Buente; Soledad blames his brother for her death. The migrants believe that the so-called [...] "Chupacabra" [...] was responsible for her death, despite the fact that none of the circumstances of the death resemble anything close to reports of the Chupacabra. Mulder, assisted on the case by Mexican-American INS agent Conrad Lozano, is able to track down and interrogate Eladio, who frightens the other migrants. Meanwhile, Scully discovers that Maria was killed by a fungal growth known as Aspergillus.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>rain</b> was {{the subject}} of a 1981 {{political}} incident in which the United States Secretary of State Alexander Haig accused the Soviet Union of supplying T-2 mycotoxin to the Communist states in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia for use in counterinsurgency warfare. Refugees described many different forms of attacks, including a sticky yellow liquid falling from planes or helicopters, which was dubbed [...] "yellow rain". The U.S. government alleged that over ten thousand people had been killed in attacks using these chemical weapons.|$|E
2500|$|On September 24, 2012, in a podcast titled [...] "The Fact of the Matter", {{the program}} ran a segment about the <b>yellow</b> <b>rain</b> {{incidents}} in Laos and surrounding {{countries in the}} 1970s. Included in the story was an interview with Hmong veteran and refugee Eng Yang, with his niece Kao Kalia Yang serving as translator. After hearing the segment, Kao Kalia Yang and others complained that her uncle's viewpoints had been dismissed or edited out, that interviewer Robert Krulwich had treated them callously, and that the overall approach to the story had been racist. The complaints prompted several rounds of allegation, apology, rebuttal, and edits to the podcast, as well as commentary in various sources such as the public radio newspaper Current.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in the 1970s, local {{residents}} became concerned by {{pollution in the}} area. The proximity of homes and schools to heavy industry led to a long battle between residents and factory owners.

The red flag was out {{for over two}} hours before the track dried and the cars were started again under a yellow condition. However, after just running 1 lap under <b>yellow</b> the <b>rain</b> started falling again. Rusty Wallace was VERY close to running out of gas so he was pushed around by Dale Earnhardt so that he wouldn't run out of gas. Once the field was given the white flag Earnhardt backed off.

50|$|In 2012 the science-themed show Radiolab aired an {{interview}} with Hmong refugee Eng Yang and his niece, author Kao Kalia Yang, to discuss Eng Yang's experience with <b>yellow</b> <b>rain.</b> The hosts took the position that <b>yellow</b> <b>rain</b> was unlikely {{to have been a}} chemical agent. The episode prompted a backlash among some listeners, who criticized Robert Krulwich for insensitivity, racism, and their disregard for Yang's personal experience with the region in question. The negative response prompted host Krulwich to issue an apology for his handling of the interview.|$|E

5000|$|Currently, {{two main}} {{viewpoints}} {{exist on the}} <b>yellow</b> <b>rain</b> controversy. One viewpoint sees these allegations as supported by insufficient evidence, or as having been completely refuted. For instance, a 1992 review published in Politics and the Life Sciences described the idea of <b>yellow</b> <b>rain</b> as a biological agent as conclusively disproved and called for an assessment by the US government of the mistakes made in this episode, stating that [...] "the present approach of sweeping the matter under the rug and hoping people will forget about it could be counterproductive." [...] Similarly, a 1997 review {{of the history of}} biological warfare published in the Journal of the American Medical Association stated that the <b>yellow</b> <b>rain</b> allegations are [...] "widely regarded as erroneous", a 2001 review in the Annual Reviews in Microbiology described them as [...] "unsubstantiated for many reasons", and a 2003 article in Annual Review of Phytopathology described them as [...] "largely discredited". A 2003 review of the history of biological warfare described these allegations as one of many cases where states have produced propaganda containing false or unsubstantiated accusations of the use of biological weapons by their enemies.|$|E

500|$|There {{were four}} main {{individual}} classifications contested in the 2015 Tour de France, {{as well as}} a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses returned to the Tour {{for the first time since}} the 2008 edition. For all stage finishes, excluding the two time trial stages, the three first finishers of stages earned bonuses of 10, 6 and 4 seconds respectively. Of the reintroduction, race director Christian Prudhomme said: [...] "We want to open up the race, we want the race to be decided on any day of the Tour." [...] If a crash had happened within the final [...] of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a <b>yellow</b> jersey. <b>Rain</b> on the final stage forced the final times of the general classification to be taken on the first crossing of the finish line before the ten laps of the cobbled Champs-Élysées. Riders were required to cross the finish line on the final lap to receive their times.|$|R
50|$|Mitchell Peters (born 1935) {{is former}} {{principal}} timpanist and percussionist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. He has composed well-known pieces for the marimba such as <b>Yellow</b> After the <b>Rain</b> and Sea Refractions; {{it is said}} that these works were composed because Peters felt that {{there was a lack of}} musically interesting material that would introduce his students to four-mallet marimba techniques. Several of his snare drum and timpani etude books are in common use as well. He began his career in the army orchestra. He later was principal percussionist of Dallas Symphony before taking the principal percussion position in the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1969. When principal timpanist William Kraft retired in 1981 to pursue his career as a composer, Peters stepped up to assume the role as timpanist, a position he occupied through the Los Angeles Philharmonic's 2005/2006 season. Peters is well known for his prodigious sightreading ability.|$|R

5000|$|Henry Wilde, {{a retired}} US Foreign Service Officer, has drawn {{parallels}} {{between the use of}} <b>yellow</b> <b>rain</b> allegations by the US government against the Soviet Union and the later exaggerated allegations on the topic of Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. Wilde considers it likely that states may again [...] "use rumors and false or planted intelligence of such weapons use for propaganda purposes." [...] and calls {{for the establishment of a}} more rigorous inspection process to deal with such claims. Similar concerns were expressed in a 2006 review published by the World Organisation for Animal Health, which compared the American <b>yellow</b> <b>rain</b> accusations to other cold-war accusations from the Soviet Union and Cuba, as well as to more recent mistaken intelligence on Iraqi weapons capabilities, concluding that such unjustified accusations have encouraged the development of biological weapons and increased the risk that they might be used, as they have discredited arms-control efforts.|$|E

5000|$|According to U.S. State Department analysts, {{another reason}} the Soviet Union [...] "promoted the AIDS {{disinformation}} {{may have been}} its attempt to distract international attention away from its own offensive biological warfare program, which monitored for decades." [...] In addition to anthrax, the Soviets were believed to have developed tularemia, the plague, and cholera for biological warfare purposes, as well as botulinum toxin, enterotoxins, and mycotoxins. An alternative {{explanation is that the}} operation may have been in retaliation for American accusations that the Soviets used chemical weapons in Southeast Asia, later dubbed the <b>yellow</b> <b>rain</b> incident.|$|E
5000|$|Analyses of {{putative}} [...] "yellow rain" [...] samples by the British, French and Swedish governments {{confirmed the}} presence of pollen and failed to find any trace of mycotoxins. Toxicology studies questioned the reliability of reports stating that mycotoxins had been detected in alleged victims up to two months after exposure, since these compounds are unstable {{in the body and}} are cleared from the blood in just a few hours. [...] An autopsy on a Khmer Rouge fighter named Chan Mann, a victim of a putative <b>yellow</b> <b>rain</b> attack in 1982, turned up traces of mycotoxins, but also aflatoxin, Blackwater Fever, and malaria.|$|E
5000|$|For many years, the Neo Hom {{resistance}} and political movement {{played a key}} role in resistance to the Vietnam People's Army in Laos following the U.S. withdrawal in 1975.

Additionally, a spiritual leader Zong Zoua Her, as well as other Hmong leaders,including Pa Kao Her, (or Pa Khao Her, rallied some of their followers in an additional factionalized guerrilla resistance movement called Chao Fa (RPA: Caub Fab, Pahawh Hmong: [...] ). These events led to the <b>yellow</b> <b>rain</b> controversy, when the United States accused the Soviet Union of supplying and using chemical weapons in this conflict.|$|E
