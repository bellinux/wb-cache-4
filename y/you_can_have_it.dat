500|$|Speaking in 2000 {{about this}} first session, Harrison {{said that the}} music sounded [...] "really nice" [...] in the room, [...] "with all these nice {{acoustics}} and piano, and no echo on anything", but he was shocked during the playback when he heard how Spector had recorded the track. In Leng's words, Spector [...] " [...] his full armory of reverb-flooded production values" [...] on [...] "Wah-Wah". Harrison dismissed the result as [...] "horrible", and recalled that when Clapton said he liked the way it sounded, he replied, [...] "Well, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> on your album, then." [...] Although Harrison said [...] "I grew to like it", he subsequently reverted to his original opinion that the song, like much of All Things Must Pass, was overproduced. Overdubs {{on many of the}} album's basic tracks were carried out at either Abbey Road or Trident Studios, without Spector's assistance, and completed by 12 August. After receiving Harrison's initial mixes, Spector wrote back with suggestions for each song; in the case of [...] "Wah-Wah", these included the addition of a saxophone solo by Keys, and backing vocals. As well as overdubbing his slide guitar solos, Harrison sang all the various vocal parts, crediting himself as [...] "the George O'Hara-Smith Singers" [...] on the album sleeve.|$|E
2500|$|As {{opposition}} leader, Livni {{noted in}} a 2009 Knesset speech that she herself did not support Yitzhak Rabin's policies at the time. [...] "The dispute is around {{the question of whether}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> both ways—maintaining Israel as a Jewish state and keeping the entire Land of Israel," [...] she said. Political analysts see Livni's speech at the 2003 commemoration rally for Rabin as a turning point in her political career when she became more popular among the Israeli peace camp. She delivered a speech which many found deeply moving in which she said the day Rabin was murdered was [...] "the day that the skies fell down on me because of what happened to us, to all the citizens of Israel." [...] As foreign minister, Livni would again attend the memorial for Rabin in 2009. Labor Party officials were not keen on this idea, fearing that her appearance would cost them votes. Some Kadima officials also seemed reluctant, fearing her appearance at left-wing event would send some votes Likud's way. Livni attended the memorial for Rabin in 2009.|$|E
