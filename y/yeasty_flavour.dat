When beer is left unfiltered, the yeast that fermented the wort, and turned the sugar in the barley into alcohol, remains in suspension in the liquid. The yeast that remains suspended in the beer creates a cloudy appearance, and can have a <b>yeasty</b> <b>flavour.</b> Finings are used to clear the beer of yeast [...] - [...] there are a variety of agents used as finings, including silicon dioxide, gelatin, polyclar, and isinglass.|$|E

Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts are a major group of microorganisms associated with fermented products. Some of the microorganisms, known as probiotics, confer health properties to human health. Thus, many different types of fermented foods and beverages containing probiotics are produced around the world to support wellness and health. In recent years, there has been increased interest in the development of fermented functional plant-based foods and beverages due to a surge in scientific research of the products. Further, there is evidence that probiotic microorganisms can grow well in plant-based substrates. Water kefir is a sparkling fermented beverage with an acidic, sweet, slightly alcoholic taste, and a <b>yeasty</b> <b>flavour.</b> Water kefir fermentation can be achieved by the inoculation of water kefir grains as a starter culture into a solution containing sugar. Kefir grains consist of a symbiotic starter culture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts contained in a polysaccharide matrix. Microorganisms present in kefir grains are recognized as probiotics. The majority of previous studies have focused on the isolation and identification of water kefir cultures responsible for fermentation. There is, therefore, scanty information on the fermentation of plant-based water kefir beverages. The main objective of this study was to develop fermented black tea beverage using water kefir grains as a starter culture. Fermentation of black tea infusions as single and mixed substrate with carrot juice using water kefir grains were investigated. Microflora of water kefir grains used consisted of symbiotic starter culture of lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus spp. and Lactobacillus spp.) and a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The study was conducted in three main phases. The first phase investigated the effect of sucrose concentration (5 % and 10 %) and fermentation temperature (25 °C and 30 °C) in black tea water kefir fermentation for 72 h. Meanwhile, the effect of added carrot juice (5 %, 10 %, and 15 %) on kefir beverage during secondary fermentation (24 h) at 25 °C was investigated in the second phase. The stability of the final black tea water kefir beverage formulation during storage (4 °C) for four weeks was investigated in phase three. Samples of black tea water kefir beverages were subjected to various analyses during fermentation and storage (4 °C) for 4 weeks: titratable acidity, total soluble solids (°Brix), colour, viable cell counts of constituent starter culture, sensory evaluation, sugars, organic acids, antioxidants, and pH was also measured...|$|E

Kefir is a {{traditional}} fermented milk that is carbonated, has a sharp acidic taste, <b>yeasty</b> <b>flavour</b> and contains a low percentage alcohol (less than 2 % (v/v)). The beverage is manufactured by fermenting milk with Kefir grains, comprised of microorganisms, polysaccharides and milk proteins. The microbial population of Kefir grains primarily include lactic acid bacteria (LAB), namely lactococci and lactobacilli, yeasts, Acetobacter and filamentous fungi. Kefir exhibits antimicrobial activity in vitro against some fungi, and Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria. Although the exact cause of this inhibition in Kefir is not known, the ability of LAB to inhibit the growth of closely related bacteria is well known. This inhibition of pathogenic and spoilage microbes {{may be due to}} the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, carbon dioxide or bacteriocins. Acid is not the only contributor to the antimicrobial activity of Kefir and Kefir grains, and bacteriocins may play a role in the inhibitory activity. The bacteriocin producer Lactobacillus plantarum ST 8 KF, isolated from Kefir and Kefir grains, produces a bacteriocin 3. 5 kDa in size. The mode of activity of bacteriocin ST 8 KF (bacST 8 KF) is thought to be bacteriostatic in exponential cultures of Enterococcus faecalis E 88, Lactobacillus casei LHS, Lactobacillus curvatus DF 38, Lactobacillus sakei DSM 20017, Lactobacillus salivarius 241 and Listeria innocua F and LMG 13568. The peptide is sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and does not adsorb to the surface of the producer cell. The bacteriocin is stable between pH 2. 0 and 10. 0, and for 20 min at 121 °C. Maximum bacteriocin activity was observed in modified MRS medium supplemented with glucose or saccharose, meat extract, KH 2 PO 4, glycerol, thiamine or cyanocobalamin, or in modified MRS medium without tri-ammonium citrate. Maximum levels of adsorption of bacST 8 KF (80 %) to Lb. casei LHS and Lb. sakei DSM 20017 were recorded. Adsorption (80 %) of the bacteriocin to Lactobacillus paraplantarum ATCC 700211 T and Streptococcus caprinus ATCC 700066, which are not sensitive to the bacteriocin was also recorded. Optimal adsorption to E. faecalis E 88 was recorded at 25 °C at pH 2. 0, and to L. innocua LMG 13568 at 4 °C, 10 °C and 25 °C at pH 6. 0. Potassium ions, MgCl 2, Tris, NH 4 - citrate, Na-acetate, Na 2 CO 3, EDTA and SDS led to decreased adsorption to both sensitive strains, while NaCl and mercaptoethanol resulted decreased adsorption to E. faecalis E 88, but not to L. innocua LMG 13568. Methanol resulted in lower levels of adsorption to L. innocua LMG 13568 but not to E. faecalis E 88. Triton X- 100 and Triton X- 114 increased the adsorption of bacST 8 KF by 40 %, and ethanol and chloroform had no effect on bacteriocin adsorption. The growth of Lb. plantarum ST 8 KF and L. innocua LMG 13568 in a mixed culture resulted in an increase of bacST 8 KF production. Cells treated with bacST 8 KF secreted DNA and galactosidase. As bacST 8 KF remains stable under a variety of conditions, the bacteriocin may have application, if awarded GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status, in various food products as a natural additive or preservative. The genes encoding bacteriocin production are located on a 3. 9 kilo base (kb) plasmid. Curing of the plasmid resulted in a mutant strain of Lb. plantarum ST 8 KF, and the Lb. plantarum strains ST 8 KF(+) and ST 8 KF(-) differed with regards to antibiotic resistance and carbohydrate fermentation reactions. The wild type and the cured strain were incorporated into Kefir grains during mass cultivation. The survival of the bacST 8 KF sensitive Enterococcus mundtii ST 4 SA added to the milk during Kefir production using the enriched mass cultured grains was monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Enterococcus mundtii ST 4 SA was present in higher numbers in the ST 8 KF(-) Kefir system when compared to the ST 8 KF(+) system. It can, therefore, be concluded that Lb. plantarum ST 8 KF(+) contributes to the antimicrobial activity of Kefir through the production of bacteriocin ST 8 KF...|$|E
