500|$|Although Sibelius {{informed}} {{his secretary}} in late August 1945 that the symphony had been burned, the matter remained a secret {{confined to the}} composer's private circle. During the remaining years of his life, Sibelius {{from time to time}} hinted that the Eighth Symphony project was still alive. In August 1945 he wrote to Basil Cameron: [...] "I have finished my eighth symphony several times, but I am still not satisfied with it. I will be delighted to hand it over to <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> time comes." [...] In fact, after the burning he had altogether abandoned creative composing; in 1951, when the Royal Philharmonic Society requested a work to mark the 1951 Festival of Britain, Sibelius declined. As late as 1953 he told his secretary Levas that he was working on the symphony [...] "in his mind"; only in 1954 did he admit, {{in a letter to the}} widow of his friend Adolf Paul, that it would never be completed. Sibelius died on 20 September 1957; the next day his daughter Eva Paloheimo announced publicly that the Eighth Symphony did not exist. The burning of the manuscript became generally known later, when Aino revealed the fact to the composer's biographer Erik W. Tawaststjerna.|$|E
500|$|Although the European films {{allowed him}} to travel {{and gave him a}} {{constant}} source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he [...] "knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless". One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying [...] "I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that [...] "I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her". An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film Where Were <b>You</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> Lights Went Out?, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would [...] "listen... politely, then do it my own way, as if the conversation had never taken place"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called [...] "limp", and Christopher Young described as [...] "such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy".|$|E

2500|$|On January 11, 1857 Heber C. Kimball, {{a member}} of the First Presidency, spoke about the adulterers within the church and warned that [...] "hey are worthy of death, and they will get it. That time is near by, and God has spoken from the heavens, and when certain things are about right, we shall make a public example of those characters, ...and the time is just at our doors." [...] In the meantime, rather than atoning for sins with blood, Kimball taught that it was {{possible}} to at least partially atone for sins by means other than blood, and encouraged covenant breakers to [...] "pay all you can, that there may not be much against <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> accounts are settled up." ...|$|E
2500|$|The comedian/lyricist Tom Lehrer penned {{a number}} of humorous and well known songs {{relating}} to nuclear weapons. His song Who's Next? took {{up the issue of}} nuclear proliferation, chronicling the acquisition of nuclear weapons by various nations, then theorizing on [...] "Who's Next," [...] ending with Luxembourg, Monaco, and Alabama becoming nuclear powers, while We Will All Go Together When We Go looked at the brighter side of nuclear holocaust (not having to mourn over the death of others, since [...] "if the bomb that drops on you gets your friends and neighbors too, there'll be nobody left behind to grieve"). It assumes that the entire planet will be instantaneously wiped clean by nuclear fire, and bypasses the much grimmer idea of radiation poisoning. [...] A third song by Lehrer, So Long Mom (A Song From World War III), was introduced as existing because, [...] "If any songs are {{going to come out of}} World War III, we had better start writing them now," [...] and tells the tale of a young soldier marching off to nuclear war, promising his mother that [...] "Although I may roam, I'll come back to my home/ Although it may be a pile of debris" [...] and also satirizing the likely extremely short duration of a major nuclear war ("And I'll look for <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> war is over/ An hour and a half from now!").|$|E
2500|$|The September 11 {{attacks of}} 2001 and the {{economic}} recession helped move country music back into the spotlight. Many country artists, such as Alan Jackson with his ballad on terrorist attacks, [...] "Where Were <b>You</b> (<b>When</b> <b>the</b> World Stopped Turning)", wrote songs that celebrated the military, highlighted the gospel, and emphasized home and family values over wealth. Alt-Country singer Ryan Adams song [...] "New York, New York" [...] pays tribute to New York City, and it's popular music video (which was shot 4 days before the attacks) shows Adams playing {{in front of the}} Manhattan skyline, Along with several shots of the city. In contrast, more rock-oriented country singers took more direct aim at the attacks' perpetrators; Toby Keith's [...] "The Angry American (Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue)" [...] threatened to [...] "a boot in" [...] the posterior of the enemy, while Charlie Daniels's [...] "This Ain't No Rag, It's a Flag" [...] promised to [...] "hunt" [...] the perpetrators [...] "down like a mad dog hound." [...] These songs gained such recognition that it put Country music back into popular culture. The influence of rock music in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s as artists like Eric Church, Jason Aldean, and Brantley Gilbert have had success; Aaron Lewis, former frontman for the rock group Staind, had a moderately successful entry into country music in 2011 and 2012. Also rising in the late 2000s and early 2010s was the insertion of rap and spoken-word elements into country songs; artists such as Cowboy Troy and Colt Ford have focused almost exclusively on country rap (also known as hick hop) while other, more mainstream artists (such as Big & Rich and Jason Aldean) have used it on occasion.|$|E
