25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the longer <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it seemed like a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic understood why Aguilera was {{dissatisfied with the}} release of the material, calling the songs [...] "pre-professional" [...] and [...] "generic early-'90s dance-pop". He noted that Just Be Free did not match the quality of her self-titled debut album due to its [...] "bland" [...] production. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a D-rating, citing the album's production and describing the content as [...] "teen-jailbait" [...] due to lyrics such as [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> with me tonight".|$|E

He also stated that the library commission is the biggest installation he has done to date.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} week, Jackson and Presley had another argument. Newspaper reports had been {{suggesting}} that if Elvis were alive, {{he would not}} approve of his daughter's marriage. Annoyed, Jackson reportedly suggested that the couple could find out by holding a séance to contact the deceased [...] "King of Rock 'n' Roll". During the session they would ask his opinion of the union. Presley felt the idea was tasteless and, upon Jackson's continuing to push the idea, warned, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> on this particular road, they're gonna need a medium to contact you in the Great Beyond, because I'm about to put you there, right now." [...] The two supposedly never spoke of the incident again.|$|E

500|$|One black {{motorist}} {{observed in}} the early 1940s that while black travelers felt free in the mornings, by the early afternoon a [...] "small cloud" [...] had appeared. By the late afternoon, [...] "it casts a shadow of apprehension on our hearts and sours us a little. 'Where,' it asks us, 'will <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> tonight?'". They often had to spend hours in the evening trying to find somewhere to stay, sometimes resorting to sleeping in haylofts or in their own cars if they could not find anywhere. One alternative, if it was available, was to arrange in advance to sleep at the homes of black friends in towns or cities along their route. However, this meant detours and an abandonment of the spontaneity that for many was a key attraction of motoring.|$|E
500|$|Betrayal is the {{secondary}} theme of The Wild Bunch. [...] The characters suffer from {{their knowledge of}} having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate, thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ("$10,000 cuts {{an awful lot of}} family ties"). However, Bishop says, [...] "When you side with a man, <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> with him, and if you can't do that you're like some animal." [...] Such oppositional ideas lead to the film's violent conclusion, as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable. Bishop remembers his betrayals, most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton (in flashback) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery (ostensibly to guard the hostages). Critic David Weddle writes that [...] "like that of Conrad's Lord Jim, Pike Bishop's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish." ...|$|E

In a later review of the North American release they cited disappointment at not being able to undertake quests, calling it [...] "a Final Fantasy game where <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> at home and send other people out to play Final Fantasy", and felt that elements of the game were repetitive. However, they praised the presentation and felt the game could be [...] "engaging if [...] put enough time into it". 1UP.com compared the game to Animal Crossing but with a distinct RPG feel, and praised the game for its depth. Other reviewers felt it had a [...] "plodding" [...] pace, but had a soundtrack that is [...] "quite good". Some wished the game ran in progressive scan mode, a deficit rectified in a later update.|$|E

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante {{continued}} {{to write and}} record solo material. He had been doing so {{since the age of}} nine, but had never considered releasing his material to the public. That was until several of his friends—including Johnny Depp, Perry Farrell, Gibby Haynes and former Red Hot Chili Peppers band mate Flea—encouraged him to release the material he wrote in his spare time during the Blood Sugar Sex Magik sessions. Frusciante began working on final cuts of the songs he had been writing, and producing them at his home in mid-1992. The production process, however, became hampered by his increasingly severe addiction to heroin. Usually Just a T-Shirt was recorded in the order it appears, with the final tracks being recorded shortly prior to Frusciante's departure from the Chili Peppers. Frusciante's use of heroin and cocaine became more extreme during the final stages of recording in late 1993; he began viewing drugs as the only way to [...] "make sure <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, a Baptist {{minister}} from San Bernardino, California criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging {{women in the}} sex industry to quit. He commended Veitch [...] "for her zeal and desire to reach the lost for Christ", but asked, [...] "How can <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> in the industry and {{have a relationship with}} God?", and quoted , a Bible verse that states that a person cannot serve two masters. In response to the idea that strippers should quit their jobs before attending a church, Veitch said, [...] "Do we ask gluttons to stop eating too much before they come to church?" [...] At the 2006 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, photographer Michael Grecco photographed Veitch, Albee, and Huerter and included the image in his 2007 book [...] In the image caption, he called the trio a [...] "devout Christian trinity". Philip Sherwell of the Calgary Herald called the organization's evangelism [...] "America's most unusual Christian outreach operation". A journalist for UK newspaper The Observer compared JC's Girls to XXXchurch.com, writing in 2006 that both of [...] "these ministries are in some way reforming the church as well as their would-be followers." ...|$|E
500|$|Saadiq's songwriting is {{characterized}} by straightforward romanticism, positive exhortations, pining ballads, and message songs. Christgau interpreted Saadiq's persona on the album to be [...] "a romantic who stays true to the deliberate simplicity" [...] of the song titles, but [...] "never threatens to assume the fetal position if he doesn't get the extreme cuddling he craves." [...] Patrick Varine of the Observer-Dispatch asserted that Saadiq deviates significantly from contemporary R lyrics: [...] "there are no thinly-veiled food-sex metaphors or pimp fantasies". His songwriting also paraphrases classic soul lyrics and, on the album's slower songs, expresses tightly coiled emotions. Saadiq said that some songs were written about his life experiences. He described the album as [...] "basically a series of love songs about music, how falling in love can be easy, but staying true to it can be tricky." [...] He elaborated on this interpretation in an interview for the Chicago Tribune: [...] "You {{have to watch out}} for those curves. [...] music comes out, and how do <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> true to what you love? I’m not saying everything has to sound like a '60s record to stay true, but you should never take the relationship lightly." ...|$|E

500|$|Frusciante {{developed}} serious drug habits while touring {{with the}} band during the previous four years. He {{said that when he}} [...] "found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show, that inspired me to be a pothead". Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana, but he began to use heroin and {{was on the verge of}} full-scale addiction. Upon returning to California in the summer of 1992, Frusciante entered a deep depression, feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play guitar. For a long time, he focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency. His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: [...] "I was very sad, and I was always happy when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guilty—I was always really proud to be an addict." [...] Frusciante openly admitted to being a [...] "junkie", believing that drugs were the only way of [...] "making sure <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E

And I told her, 'Don't worry, they hijacked the plane, they're gonna take you for a ride, you go to their country, and you come back. <b>You</b> <b>stay</b> there for vacation.' You don't know what to say—what are you gonna say? I kept on saying the same things, 'Be calm.' And she was crying and—you know—more or less crying and screaming and yelling." [...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and {{told him she was}} preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, four and a half minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah dialed in the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C. Bradshaw, on the phone with her husband, said [...] "Everyone is running up to first class. I've got to go. Bye." [...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E
500|$|Minh instead {{arrived to}} find that the {{brothers}} were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 {{on the night of the}} coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Diệm and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant Ðỗ Thơ, Diệm's aide-de-camp, who happened to be a nephew of Colonel Đỗ Mậu, the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and Xuân Vy, head of Nhu's Republican Youth. After the coup, General Paul Harkins, the head of the US presence in Vietnam, inspected the tunnel and noted that it [...] "was so far down that I didn't want to go down to walk up the thing". The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif, the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting Land Rover. Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citroën sedan. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Diệm that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Nguyễn Khánh in the Central Highlands. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Diệm was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that [...] "You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill <b>you.</b> <b>Stay</b> with me and I will protect you." [...] Another story holds that Diệm said [...] "We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?" [...] Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.|$|E
