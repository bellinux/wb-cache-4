His posture is well formed and suggests that the 6th century artist knew this asana. He sits on a lotus with a stalk shown as if coming out of the earth, his legs are crossed symmetrically. Two Nagas flank the lotus and express their reverence with a namaste posture. The great yogi is being approached by various Vedic and Puranic gods and goddesses, as well as monks and sadhus, <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> halo around him that keeps them at bay, as if they admire it but do not wish to disturb his meditation.|$|E

25|$|Bloom's work is {{not easily}} categorized, <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> thread that links all of his {{published}} material. He was concerned with preserving a philosophical {{way of life for}} future generations. He strove to do this through both scholarly and popular writing. His writings may be placed into two categories: scholarly (e.g., Plato's Republic) and popular political commentary (e.g., The Closing of the American Mind). On the surface, this is a valid distinction, yet closer examinations of Bloom’s works reveal a direct connection between the two types of expression, which reflect his view of philosophy {{and the role of the}} philosopher in political life.|$|E
25|$|Chimnabai I was {{knowledgeable}} in Bharatanatyam and Carnatic music, {{and brought}} a troupe with her comprising two dancers, two nattuvanars (leaders of Bharatanatyam concerts) and two teachers (Khandwani 2002). Others followed later, including Nattuvanar Appaswamy and his dancer wife Kantimati, who had studied with Kannusamy and Vadively, {{two members of the}} Tanjore Quartet. After the death of Appaswamy in 1939, Kantimati and their son, Guru Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar, left Baroda to teach in Lucknow, and then worked in the film industry in South India until Sayajirao's successor, Pratapsinhrao Gaekwad recalled the family to Baroda in 1949 to teach in the Music Department in the Kalavan Palace, later absorbed into the Maharaja Sayajirao University (Gaston 1996: 158-160). Later Guruvarya Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar established his own Institute, the Tanjore Dance Music & Art Research Centre at Baroda with his son Guru Shri Ramesh Tanjorkar and Guru Smt. Leela R. Tanjorkar (Kubernath Tanjorkar's family is devoted to Bharatnatyam dance now including their grandsons Rajesh and Ashish). So {{what we have here is}} a tradition of very distinguished Bharatanatyam dancers and teachers, members of a family considered an offshoot of the Tanjore Quartet bani (stylistic schools; Gaston 1996: 159), already established in Gujarat by the time Mrinalini set up her own academy. <b>Yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sense that what she did was not new.|$|E

[...] However, death is not completely democratic because [...] "if circumstances prevented them from achieving great fame, circumstances also saved them from committing great crimes. <b>Yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> special pathos in these obscure tombs; the crude inscriptions on the clumsy monuments are so poignant a reminder of the vain longing of all men, however humble, to be loved and to be remembered." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, NIST {{researchers}} presented {{evidence that}} an isotropic non-crystalline metallic phase (dubbed [...] "q-glass") could be grown from the melt. This phase {{is the first}} phase, or [...] "primary phase", to form in the Al-Fe-Si system during rapid cooling. Interestingly, experimental evidence indicates that this phase forms by a first-order transition. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles, which grow spherically with a uniform growth rate in all directions. The diffraction pattern shows {{it to be an}} isotropic glassy phase. <b>Yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> nucleation barrier, which implies an interfacial discontinuity (or internal surface) between the glass and the melt.|$|E

[...] <b>Yet,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> debate over which type of terrier was bred with bulldogs {{in order to create}} the Bull and Terrier. For instance, Joseph L.

Carl Semencic, on the other hand, held that a variety of terriers produced the Bull and Terrier.|$|E

2500|$|Using English {{words in}} daily conversation, advertising, and {{entertainment}} {{is seen as}} trendy and cool. However this use can often lead to misunderstandings due to problems with pronunciation, grammar or vocabulary. Modern use of Konglish has already created a linguistic divide between North Korea and South Korea. North Korean defectors can have trouble integrating into South Korean society {{because much of the}} Konglish used there is not used in North Korea. This can lead to confusion, misunderstandings and delay integration into the society. This is not the sole cause of the linguistic divide between the two nations as some Korean words are also used differently between the two countries. While Konglish problems exist between the North and South they also exist between the metropolitan and rural. Ahn Jung-hyo a Korean-English translator who is the author of [...] "A False English Dictionary" [...] was noted for saying that improper use of Konglish in other countries is likely to bring shame to Korea. However, John Huer, a columnist for Korea Times, noted Konglish usage as one of his [...] "10 Most Wonderful Things About Korea". He felt that it was both inventive and clever. After that article Huer criticized Koreans for their bad English and improper use of loanwords, though. Modern Konglish usage could even be viewed as art, <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> difference between a cultural use of a word like [...] "Fighting!" [...] and the bad grammar and vocabulary seen on signs, packages, and TV around Korea. Sebastian Harrisan has suggested that calling these kinds of things Konglish masks the problem with English education in Korea. The Korean government has been criticized by civic groups for their use of Konglish in slogans and focusing too much on English education. They feel that the heavy focus on English will damage the Korean language and doesn't benefit international competitiveness. In contrast, Jasper Kim, a law professor at Ewha Womans University, wrote that Konglish is necessary in a global context and that strict adherence to grammatical rules shouldn't trump getting the message across.|$|E
