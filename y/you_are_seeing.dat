2500|$|After the Iraq invasion, U.S. {{troops were}} {{criticized for not}} {{protecting}} the historical artifacts and treasures located at the National Museum of Iraq. When asked at the time why U.S. troops did not actively seek to stop the lawlessness, Rumsfeld replied, [...] "Stuff happens... and it's untidy and freedom's untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things. They're also free {{to live their lives}} and do wonderful things. And that's what's going to happen here." [...] He further commented that, [...] "The images <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> on television <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> over, and over, and over, and it's the same picture of some person walking out of some building with a vase, and you see it 20 times, and you think, [...] "My goodness, were there that many vases?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Palestinian {{researcher}} Khaled Al-Hroub {{has criticized}} {{what he called}} the [...] "Taliban-like steps" [...] Hamas has taken: [...] "The Islamization that has been forced upon the Gaza Strip—the suppression of social, cultural, and press freedoms that do not suit Hamas's view—is an egregious deed that must be opposed. It is the reenactment, under a religious guise, of the experience of [...] totalitarian regimes and dictatorships." [...] Hamas officials denied having any plans to impose Islamic law. One legislator stated that [...] "hat <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> are incidents, not policy" [...] and that [...] "we believe in persuasion".|$|E
2500|$|... (1913 Buffalo, New York, USA - 1967 New York, New York, USA) was an Abstract Expressionist artist {{notable for}} {{painting}} nearly “pure” monochromes over a considerable {{span of time}} (roughly from 1952 to his death in 1967), in red or blue, and lastly and most (in)famously, in black. Like the Johns works mentioned below, Reinhardt’s [...] contained faint indications of geometrical shape, but the actual dilineations are not readily visible until the viewer spends time with the work. This tends to encourage a state of contemplative meditation in the viewer, and to create uncertainty about perception; in terms of Frank Stella's famous quote, you may question whether [...] "what you see" [...] is actually what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing.</b>|$|E

2500|$|On December 7, Pitt beat Penn State 22–21. [...] Also, #2 Navy {{played in}} the annual Army–Navy Game in Philadelphia. [...] American {{television}} viewers were introduced to instant replay after Army's quarterback Rollie Stichweh scored on a two-yard run for the game's first score.

[...] This is not live...". [...] Staubach went on to lead Navy to a 21-15 win, after which the players then voted to accept an invitation to play #1 Texas in the Cotton Bowl. [...] In the final AP Poll, the top five remained unchanged, confirming a showdown between the #1 and #2 teams in Dallas.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of Lopez's image, Andrew Barker of Variety observed: [...] "Despite a {{carefully}} cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles [...] "I'm Real" [...] and [...] "Jenny From the Block". She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick {{either as a}} primary gig. She established herself as an oft-provocative sex symbol while her demeanor made it abundantly clear that she's {{not asking you to}} come hither." [...] In 2002, Lynette Holloway of The New York Times described Lopez as overexposed. She wrote: [...] "Forgive yourself if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> Jennifer Lopez in your sleep. She is everywhere." [...] Holloway noted her image to be [...] "a dash of ghetto fabulousness" [...] and [...] "middle-class respectability" [...] for mass appeal. Entertainment Weekly observed a change in her public profile upon joining American Idol in 2011, writing: [...] "Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth [...]" [...] Lopez is considered an icon of popular culture. Television presenter Ray Martin describes her as a [...] "showbiz phenomenon".|$|E
2500|$|He has refined the {{explanation}} by shifting to {{the example of}} a [...] "Movitype" [...] screen, often used for advertisements and announcements in public places. A Movitype screen consists of a matrix—or [...] "raster" [...] as the neuroscientists prefer to call it (from the Latin rastrum, a [...] "rake"; think of the lines on a TV screen as [...] "raked" [...] across)—that is made up of an array of tiny light-sources. A computer-led input can excite these lights so as to give the impression of letters passing from right to left, or even, on the more advanced forms now commonly used in advertisements, to show moving pictures. Maund's point is as follows. It is obvious that there are two ways of describing what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing.</b> We could either adopt the everyday public language and say [...] "I saw some sentences, followed by a picture of a 7-Up can." [...] Although that is a perfectly adequate way of describing the sight, nevertheless, there is a scientific way of describing it which bears no relation whatsoever to this commonsense description. One could ask the electronics engineer to provide us with a computer print-out staged across the seconds that you were watching it of the point-states of the raster of lights. This would no doubt be a long and complex document, with the state of each tiny light-source given its place in the sequence. The interesting aspect of this list is that, although it would give a comprehensive and point-by-point-detailed description {{of the state of the}} screen, nowhere in that list would there be a mention of [...] "English sentences" [...] or [...] "a 7-Up can".|$|E
6000|$|... "It is odd," [...] he admitted, frankly. [...] "I {{will try}} {{to explain it to}} you but it will sound very bald, and I do not think that you will understand. I watched you a few nights ago out on the roof at Blenheim House. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> looking across the house-tops and you didn't seem to <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> {{anything}} at all really, and yet all the time I knew that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> things I couldn't, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> understanding and appreciating something which I knew nothing of, and it worried me.

2500|$|Elvis Presley saw Harris {{perform in}} Memphis {{in the early}} 1950s. According to Henry Glover, Harris's record producer, Elvis [...] "copied many of the vocal {{gymnastics}} of Wynonie {{as well as the}} physical gyrations. When you saw Elvis, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> a mild version of Wynonie". Harris remarked in a 1956 interview that Elvis's hip movements were stirring controversy in a way his own never did: [...] "Many people have been giving him trouble for swinging his hips. I swing mine and have no trouble. He's got publicity I could not buy".|$|R

"Sir," [...] said Mr. Moulder, {{having become}} very red about the cheeks and chin, [...] "I and this gentleman {{are going to}} have a bit of supper, and it ain't {{accustomed}} to smoke in commercial rooms during meals.

6000|$|But was I {{a gloomy}} and distempered man, if, upon such a morn as that, I {{stood on the}} little bridge across a certain brook, and watched the water run, with {{something}} of a sigh? Or if, when the schoolboy beside me lamented that the floods would surely be out, and his day's fishing spoiled, I said to him--"Ah, my boy, {{that is a little}} matter. Look at what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> now, and understand what barbarism and waste mean. Look at all that beautiful water which God has sent us hither off the Atlantic, without trouble or expense to us. Thousands, and tens of thousands, of gallons will run under this bridge to-day; and what shall we do with it? Nothing. And yet: think only of the mills which that water would have turned. Think how it might have kept up health and cleanliness in poor creatures packed away in the back streets of the nearest town, or even in London itself. Think even how country folk, in many parts of England, in three months' time, may be crying out for rain, and afraid of short crops, and fever, and scarlatina, and cattle-plague, for want of the very water which we are now letting run back, wasted, into the sea from whence it came. And yet we call ourselves a civilised people." ...|$|E

6000|$|I waste {{no time in}} {{explaining}} again how reduced I am {{to the use of}} this machinery by the absolute physical effect on my poor old organism of the huge tension and oppression of our conditions here--to say nothing of the moral effect, with which the other is of course intensely mixed. I can tell you better thus moreover than by any weaker art what huge satisfaction I had yesterday in an hour or two of Richard's company; he having generously found time to lunch with me during two or three days that he is snatching away from the Front, under urgency of business. I gathered from him that you hear from him with a certain frequency and perhaps some fulness--I know it's always his desire that you shall; but even so you perhaps scarce take in how [...] "perfectly splendid" [...] he is--though even if you in a manner do I want to put it on record to you, for myself, that I find him unmitigatedly magnificent. It's impossible for me to overstate my impression of his intelligent force, his energy and lucidity, his gallantry and resolution, or of the success the unswerving application of these things is making for him and for his enterprise. Not that I should speak as if he and that were different matters--he is the enterprise, and that, on its side, is his very self; and in fine it is a tremendous tonic--among a good many tonics that we have indeed, thank goodness!--to get the sense of his richly beneficent activity. He seemed extremely well and [...] "fit," [...] and suffered me to ply him with all the questions that one's constant longing here for a nearer view, combined with a kind of shrinking terror of it, given all the misery the greatest nearness seems to reveal, makes one restlessly keep up. What he has probably told you, with emphasis, by letter, is the generalisation most sadly forced upon him--the comparative supportability of the fact of the wounded and the sick beside the desolating view of the ravaged refugees. He can help the former much more than the latter, and the ability to do his special job with success is more or less sustaining and rewarding; but the sight of the wretched people with their villages and homes and resources utterly annihilated, and they simply staring at the blackness of their ruin, with the very clothes on their backs scarce left to them, is clearly something that would quite break the heart if one could afford to let it. If he isn't able to give you the detail of much of that tragedy, so much the better for you--save indeed for your thereby losing too some examples of how he succeeds in occasional mitigations quand même, thanks to the positive, the quite blest, ferocity of his passion not to fail of any service he can with the least conceivability render. He was most interesting, he was altogether admirable, as to his attitude in the matter of going outside of the strict job of carrying the military sick and wounded, and them only, as the ancient [...] "Geneva Conventions" [...] confine a Red Cross Ambulance to doing. There has been some perfunctory protest, not long since, {{on the part of some}} blank agent of that (Red Cross) body, in relation to his picking up stricken and helpless civilians and seeing them as far as possible on their way to some desperate refuge or relief; whereupon he had given this critic full in the face the whole philosophy of his proceedings and intentions, letting the personage know that when the Germans ruthlessly broke every Geneva Convention by attempting to shell him and his cars and his wounded whenever they could spy a chance, he was absolutely for doing in mercy and assistance what they do in their dire brutality, and might be depended upon to convey not only every suffering civilian but any armed and trudging soldiers whom a blest chance might offer him. His remonstrant visitor remained blank and speechless, but at the same time duly impressed or even floored, and Dick will have, I think, so far as any further or more serious protest is concerned, an absolutely free hand. The Germans have violated with the last cynicism both the letter and the spirit of every agreement they ever signed, and it's little enough that the poor retaliation left us, not that [...] "in kind," [...] which I think we may describe ourselves as despising, but that in mere reparation of their ravage and mere scrappy aid to ourselves, should be compassed by us when we can compass it.... Richard told me yesterday that the aspect of London struck him as having undergone a great change since his last rush over--in the sense of the greater flagrancy of the pressure of the War; and one feels that perfectly on the spot and without having to go away and come back for it. There corresponds with it doubtless a much tighter screw-up of the whole public consciousness, worked upon by all kinds of phenomena that are very penetrating here, but that doubtless are reduced to some vagueness as reported to you across the sea--when reported at all, as most of them can't be. Goodbye at any rate for this hour. What I most wanted to give you was the strong side-wind and conveyed virtue of Dick's visit. I hope <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> rather more than less of Alice and Peggy, to whom I succeed in writing pretty often--and perhaps things that if repeated to you, as I trust they sometimes are, help you to some patient allowance for your tremendously attached old friend, ...|$|E
