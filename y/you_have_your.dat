The singer also discussed the meaning of the song by saying, [...] "What I love about this song is, it takes you through this journey. You're flirting and you're talking all of your arrogant [...] Then you climax, and then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> cigarette... This song actually is about singing from the heart, and harmonies and adlibs and arrangement". During the same video, she praised Timberlake and Miguel's work; the clip also showed footage of Beyoncé recording the song in the studio.|$|E

[...] When asked about the music video's concept would redefine the word [...] "freak", commenting: [...] "My general idea was to take the word and show its many faceted sides, twisting and turning it to where there’s really no distinguishing between one freak and another. Usher went there. When you’re engaging in sexual activity, there are many transitions and this is not about what they look like literally, but what they look like metaphorically. It’s about luring people into a situation. Because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> thoughts on a ménage à trois, but then we’re doing it in a non-obvious way." [...] On Minaj and her pairing with Usher, Stansberry said, [...] " [...] had a few looks that I really liked. She played the part, but still was her. If you really listen to her words in the song, you can kinda visualize her outfit." [...] Stansberry also confirmed that R singer Ciara and singer-actor Jamie Foxx would make appearances in the video. In an interview with MTV News on the set of her video for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said that [...] "The video is freaky. And it's a great concept, a great story line," [...] Minaj told MTV News. [...] "It felt just like one of the sequels to Saw. It was dope." [...] Stating that the video had a [...] "secret society" [...] concept, Usher told Access Hollywood that the place symbolized locations where people use to get away from pressures, and also said the movie Eyes Wide Shut was some sort of inspiration of the video. On March 22, 2010 a thirty second preview of the music video was surfaced onto the internet. Two days later on March 24, 2010, Usher premiered the full music video on BET's 106 & Park.|$|E
