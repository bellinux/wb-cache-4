40|$|Abstract: How do {{software}} developers, {{field service}} technicians, and medieval cathedral builders accomplish collaborative work? This paper looks {{at how they}} {{learn from each other}} by building and sharing knowledge across time and space. To illustrate this, we first present Community of Practice (CoP) as a way of understanding collaborative work which puts focus on the community and its social interaction. CoP, introduced by Lave and Wenger (1991), is based on the fundamental belief that dividing theory from practice is unsound. Hence CoP contradicted traditional theories of learning, where learning and working often are conceived as separate processes. Using Orr’s (1996) rendition of service technician’s work, it is shown that stories act as repositories of accumulated wisdom in keeping track of facts, sequences and their context. Representations made by a CoP to aid their work, are termed Reifications which can be stories, tools, artefacts etc. Practice is seen as a duality of Participation and Reification which both require and enable each other. We find however, that CoP based analyses tend to focus on the human actors in that <b>you</b> <b>start</b> out by <b>looking</b> for the communities and what defines them. We also presen...|$|R

40|$|Stopping slash-and-burn Cue: Slash-and-burn {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} forms of agriculture, and in areas with low {{population}} density it can still be a sustainable way of survival. But forest land which has been cleared and cultivated needs a long time to recover; when population increases, recovery times for the land are reduced, and in time it becomes degraded and exhausted. However, changing the methods used by slash-and-burn cultivators is notoriously difficult. Many countries have found that sending in government extension officers to train in better methods simply does not work. Non-government organisations, however, have a better track record when it comes to working closely with communities. They often use a participative approach, helping people to work out their own solutions to their problems, rather than imposing solutions from the outside. One example is the Green Living Movement, an organisation which is working with the Lala people, slash-and-burn cultivators who live in a remote part of Zambia. In our next report, Emmanuel Mutamba of the Green Living Movement talks to Daniel Sikazwe about how the organisation is working with the Lala people to make their management of the forest more sustainable. IN:		?Basically the Lala people ?? OUT:		??can advise the people properly. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 46 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Emmanuel Mutamba hoping a better relationship between Zambia?s forest services and indigenous tribes in the future. Transcript Mutamba	Basically the Lala people in that area are getting most of their livelihoods from the forest, through the use of ?chitemene? which is a slash-and-burn system of agriculture, which has resurfaced after a while. During the beginning of the 1990 s, we saw the chitemene system coming back to life after the government policy changed towards agriculture. People were no longer able to get free inputs through government loans, so they reverted back to what was almost dying, the chitemene system. Now it is in full force and the threat on the forest is quite high. So this {{is one of the}} areas that we are really working towards, to help our communities start looking at sustainable management systems. Sikazwe	And these sustainable management systems, you work with the community. But then getting those people together requires some very good skills on your part. Just what are some of these specific methods that you are using to work with the community there? Mutamba	In this case we are looking at an area where people are cut off from the main areas of economic activity, so you have to really appreciate that their basic life-supporting system circles around the forest, or the natural resources. And while we are trying to help people manage their resources, we also realise that they have to use them. So we have to strike a balance at conservation and utilisation. So basically those are the systems that we are using. But we are going further. We are not just going there to train the people, we are going there to also learn about the difficulties that people are going through. Then when we start learning the difficulties that people are going through, we create a relationship, and once we create a relationship, we start understanding the intra-conflicts that exist in communities and natural resource management. You go there not as an expert, but as a partner with the people. So you give them what you have learned from school, but if it does not work, it does not work, so you revise what you have learned, you start thinking anew. Sikazwe	Can you give me an example of one method that you have had to re-do or rethink, as you have said, in the joint forest management? Mutamba	Well one of them is the thinking that the chitemene system, for instance, is bad. Just going there and saying, ?The chitemene system is bad! Stop!? is not the best approach. The best approach is that we start looking at why do we say the chitemene system is not sustainable. So we start looking at the issues like the population has increased; it means that we shall have more forest felled in a short period of time, because we are now many. The population has increased, it means that if we all go and attack the forest upstream, which means that the impact on the streams, our water, will be enormous. So <b>you</b> <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> at all these resultants of certain activities. So people start appreciating these issues. Sikazwe	Let me take you back a little. You talked about going to live with the community. What exactly do you mean? Mutamba	Basically what I mean there is you go and stay there, let?s say for a period of three months up to six months. Sikazwe	Do you have specific officers that do that? Mutamba	Yes we have got what we call field volunteers. Most of them have got some skills of some kind, we have had even qualified foresters staying with people in the villages. And they train them on new management systems. They also learn of what the indigenous people do to manage the forest. Then together they come up with workable programmes. Now when these volunteers, field volunteers, come out of the field, then they have quite a wealth of knowledge that they have learned themselves from their experiences. And in future we hope that if these people are sort of employed in the mainstream forest department, then we think that we will have people with the right attitudes who can advise the people properly. End of track. An NGO in Zambia has volunteers living with forest communities, in order to build up trust and work together on alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Cue: Rearing {{livestock}} {{for meat}} and milk production, or for sale, is often recommended {{as a way}} for poor families to escape from poverty. This may be true, but profitable livestock production is not free of cost. In fact, if livestock are to be healthy and productive they need investment, investment of time, resources and money. Dominic Minyoi is a Chief Veterinary Officer working for the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives. He recently spoke to Chris Kakunta about the importance of investment, and why the first priority for livestock farmers is to invest in the health of their new born animals, such as calves and lambs. Allowing a new born animal to feed on its mother?s milk is an extremely important first investment, as it helps to protect the animal against prevailing diseases. IN:		?Once a calf is born ? OUT:		?too late for anybody to intervene. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 16 ?? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dominic Minyoi with advice for livestock keepers on the importance of investing in their animals. Transcript Minyoi	Once a calf is born it must be exposed to colostrum. Colostrum is the first milk that comes from the mother. Within 24 hours of birth that calf should be made to suckle with that one. It gives it all the protection because colostrum carries all the necessary antibodies to protect the calf against the prevailing diseases that are in that area. And also apart from that, most farmers you find they don?t really let the calf suckle. So from birth the calf should be let to suckle until they are satisfied, that?s when the farmers can get the milk. We do know that they rely on this milk as well but the calf needs it more for growth. And as the calf grows up they must at least organise the pasture, even from crop residues. They can put those in the kraal, whatever stover, maize stover that is left, whatever from the groundnuts and beans that can be fed to the animals during the dry season when the feed is inadequate. And it is important {{at this point in time}} that they must de-worm at least twice per year. This is before the rains and after the rains so that when the rains have come in and the grass is mushrooming, the calves have got access to grass; they can put on weight because they won?t have a worm burden. Vaccination is very very important in certain age groups. They can do that for anthrax, they can do that for all the other preventable diseases. Kakunta	Your emphasis has been on the calf. Are you saying when you look after a calf properly, you are guaranteeing that the future animals will be healthy? Minyoi	Definitely, once <b>you</b> <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> after a calf very well that calf will grow into a strong adult. And that strong adult can only be strong if it is also exposed to certain interventions like vaccinations, de-worming, good housing, provision of water, all those are things that should be made available to the animals. In the village set up they can even use troughs, these dug-out canoes; put water in there. The animals will have access to water whenever they feel like drinking water. Not where as of now, they graze somewhere else, they are taken for water somewhere else, and by the time they come back to the kraal they are really thirsty. So we should make these things available to the livestock for them to be able to live within the surroundings instead of venturing out where they might contract a disease through mixing with other cattle. Kakunta	There are certain situations here in Zambia, Dr Minyoi, for instance in the southern part of the country, where we have East Coast Fever, commonly known as Corridor Disease. We are finding that the small-scale farmers? animals are dying, while in the same area the commercial farmers? animals are still healthy. What practical lessons have you learned from such a scenario? Minyoi	What it is, is that to prevent tick-borne diseases, one must dip the animals. And communal dip tanks are there, they exist, but these people are not co-operating, to be able to come together so that they can have their animals dipped. People should be able to invest a bit in livestock, so that they can buy the dip chemicals. And they can approach our officers, our officers can assist them in prescribing what kind of chemicals to buy. They should be doing that twice a month in the rainy season, and once every month in the dry season. Because if they dip regularly, then Corridor Disease will be something that they will hear about but not really their concern. Kakunta	But why do you think the farmers are so reluctant in terms of preventative measures? Does it mean there is a problem somewhere in terms of attitudes? Minyoi	I can attribute this partly to poor extension services. If the extension was good, farmers would have been taught how to look after animals, and then everybody would be taken on board. But what it is now, is that sometimes our extension is failing to reach the people. But where it is reaching some people don?t want to spend, they won?t invest in livestock. Livestock is a business just like any other business, they have to invest. And above all, they should attend to their regular requirements in as far as their health is concerned. Because these animals are just left to herdsmen, and when herdsmen come there is no request for a report. They should also keep their records so that these herdsmen are held accountable. Because what is happening, farmers don?t even know how the animals are, they are just told ?The animal is dead. ? And you can not run a business like that. They must be part and parcel of that livestock-rearing group. They must be able to monitor the animals and see how they are getting on, so that they can report on time. Reporting condition on time, or reporting a situation on time gets one better results than reporting late, because when you report late it may be too late for anybody to intervene. End of track.

The {{advantages}} of LAT E Xare: (just a few reasons) • It’s free and it’s available for many machines. • LAT E Xfiles are just plain text files and are portable. • The typesetting’s better, especially for mathematical equations and formulas. • Style files for many periodicals exist and you produce book quality text. (This makes 3 sense if you want to write journal papers or books.) • LAT E Xis extensible. If you want a new feature, you can look around for a free add-on or write one yourself. • It’s easier to manage your bibliography, your table of contents, your captions, etc. • It originated from the minds of great computer scientists (Donald Knuth (T E X) and Leslie Lamport (LAT E X)). Some disadvantages(?) of LAT E X: • It takes some time to learn, specially if you’re used to WYSIWYG word processors. • Graphics and tables can be tricky the first time around. I can’t think of any more disadvantages! 4 What do I need to start? On Windows-based systems: 1. A text editor to create LAT E Xdocuments.
