500|$|Retrospective reviews on Impossible Princess—both from European and Australasian areas—have {{been much}} more positive, with AllMusic's Chris True {{labelling}} it a [...] "pretty damn good record", and openly criticised the critical reception around the album's early release, deeming it a [...] "shame". Nevertheless, he believed that [...] "Unlike Minogue's early work, this album sounds stronger and has a more natural feel. Her songwriting abilities {{have come a long}} way, and Impossible Princess actually flows together as an album." [...] Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani awarded it four stars, and was impressed with the album's [...] "starkly personal and unified cord", saying it [...] "is the work of an artist willing to take risks, not a pop queen concerned with preserving her reign." [...] Cinquemani added it to the staff choices of their Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums lists. Awarding four stars, Nick Levine from British tabloid Digital Spy commended the mixture of genres and Minogue's input. Although he noticed the material's lack of commercial appeal, he concluded, [...] "Brave, revealing and rarely less than surprising, it's a key piece in the trickier-than-you-think jigsaw puzzle that is Kylie Minogue's recording career." [...] While reviewing her tenth album X (2007), Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commented [...] "For those who still have a copy of her Manic Street Preachers-assisted Impossible Princess, then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most crazed, damn-near perfect dance-pop albums ever created." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez of Billboard {{magazine}} praised Beyoncé's [...] "sexy" [...] vocals on {{the track}} which they hailed as a [...] "slinky club banger". The Washington Post writer Chris Richards described [...] "Blow" [...] as a [...] "strutting, moaning disco vamp". Sal Cinquemani, writing for Slant Magazine {{described it as a}} [...] "post-disco slink". The Quietus writer Mof Gimmers wrote, [...] "The cocaine soul bears down again, with the excellent 'Blow' which grooves along like Kelis on a Friday night, before gnashing its teeth into the gonzo pop of Cameo or Parliament." [...] The Guardians Michael Cragg described it as a [...] "delicious throwback funk" [...] song. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times felt that the [...] "sumptuous" [...] song allowed Beyoncé [...] "to flex her impressive stylistic chops". Spins Anupa Mistry praised the collaboration of Timbaland and Pharrell on the [...] "nimble and funky" [...] track [...] "Blow" [...] as [...] "mighty" [...] and [...] "genius". Similarly, Claire Lobenfeld from Complex who felt that Justin Timberlake and Timbaland [...] "lost their ability to make their distinctive, infectious love-pop" [...] on Timberlake's album The 20/20 Experience, noted that [...] "Blow" [...] proved the opposite: [...] "The two have reinvigorated the overused private-parts-as-candy trope by writing one of Bey's friskiest songs ever. Add some Pharrell production... and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the smoothest pieces of filth of the year." [...] Ryan Dennehy from AbsolutePunk found [...] "trademark" [...] Timbaland production in [...] "Blow" [...] and opined, [...] "Bey wisely co-opts Timbaland himself to deliver a steamy hook that interlocks with her own vocals." [...] Cosmopolitan writer Alex Rees deemed [...] "Blow" [...] an [...] "awesome disco moment".|$|E

"I can't let <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> my daughters," [...] said an {{energetic}} matron to her neighbor from the city, who was seeking for a servant in her summer vacation; [...] "if you hadn't daughters of your own, maybe I would; but my girls ain't {{going to work}} so that your girls may live in idleness." ...|$|E

[...] She rests her cheek against the side of her chair cushion, and speaks with closed eyes, in a weak murmur. Mr. Ashley watches her at first with anxiety, then with a gradual change of countenance until a gleam of intelligence steals into his look of compassion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Ana, she is gone," [...] he said, [...] "and {{that before}} I could bargain for my reward. Well, this I must find in your company. How strange are women, Ana! Here <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{greatest}} of her sex, as you learned in the temple of Amon. And yet she opens beneath the sun of hope and shrivels beneath the shadow of fear, like the touched leaves of that tender plant which grows upon {{the banks of the}} river; she who, with her eyes set on the mystery that is beyond, whereof she hears the whispering winds, should tread both earthly hope and fear beneath her feet, or make of them stepping stones to glory. Were she a man she would do so, but her sex wrecks her, she who thinks more of the kiss of a babe than of all the splendours she might harbour in her breast. Yes, a babe, a single wretched little babe. You had one once, did you not, Ana?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Walter," [...] said he, {{when he took}} {{leave of}} me, [...] "I am very sorry that I did not {{discover}} that the glacier had raked out the bed of a gold mine from the mountains up there and brought it down to you, or at any rate, some valuable iron ore. But I am obliged to say it did not do anything of the sort. But I can {{tell you one thing}} it brought you, and, although it is not of any great commercial value, I should think you could make good use of it here on your place. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the finest deposits of gravel on this bluff that I have met with, and if you were to take out a lot of it and spread it over your driveways and paths, it would make it a great deal pleasanter for you to go about here in bad weather and would wonderfully improve your property. Good roads always give an idea of thrift and prosperity." [...] And then he went away with a valise nearly full of mineral specimens which he assured me were very interesting.|$|E

5000|$|Eight years pass, and the {{childhood}} friends have each formed distinctly opposite personalities. Kit is witty, perceptive, wry and calmer {{in comparison to}} Millie who is intense, self-involved and histrionic. The two {{can be described as}} [...] "frenemies". Millie becomes increasingly difficult and resentful of any diversion from full attention being focused upon herself. When Kit jokes and glowingly reports about her shopping trip with Preston and Millie's only child, Deirdre, Millie impudently retorts [...] "Time <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> your own!" [...] as she swans out.|$|R

6000|$|... "But I am not jealous in that way, sir. I mean I {{want to be}} or do {{something}} splendid as well as they. I can't write poetry or sing like a bird, but I should think I might have my share of glory in some way. I thought perhaps I could paint, and I've tried, but I can only copy I've no power to invent lovely things, and I'm so discouraged, for that is my one accomplishment. Do you think I have any gift that could be cultivated and do me credit like theirs?" [...] she asked so wistfully that her uncle felt {{for a moment as}} if he never could forgive the fairies who endow babies in their cradles for being so niggardly to his girl. But one look into the sweet, open face before him reminded him that the good elves had been very generous and he answered cheerfully: [...] "Yes, I do, for <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best and noblest gifts a woman can possess. Music and poetry are fine things, and I don't wonder you want them, or that you envy the pleasant fame they bring. I've felt just so, and been ready to ask why it didn't please heaven to be more generous to some people, so you needn't be ashamed to tell me all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Having {{arranged}} this much, I {{thought of}} you. I {{know that you}} have several sons. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> from fourteen to sixteen years, and you would like him to take such a position for two or three years, I should be glad indeed to secure such a companion for my nephews. If not, would you do me the favour of looking round among your acquaintances and find us a lad such as we need. He must be a gentleman and a fair type of the boy we are speaking of. I may say that my brother authorizes me to offer in his name, in addition to all expenses, two thousand francs a year to the young gentleman who will thus benefit his sons. I do not think that the political excitement which is agitating Paris need be taken into consideration. Now that great concessions have been made to the representatives of the nation, {{it is not at all}} probable that there will be any recurrence of such popular tumults as that which brought about the capture of the Bastille. But in any case this need not weigh in the decision, as my brother resides for the greater part of the year in his chateau near Dijon in Burgundy, far removed from the troubles in the capital." ...|$|E
60|$|The little stone balcony, which, by {{a popular}} fallacy, is {{supposed}} to be a necessary appurtenance of my window, has long been to me a source of curious interest. The fact that the asperities of our summer weather will not permit me to use it but once or twice in six months does not alter my concern for this incongruous ornament. It affects me as I suppose the conscious possession of a linen coat or a nankeen trousers might affect a sojourner here who has not entirely outgrown his memory of Eastern summer heat and its glorious compensations,--a luxurious providence against a possible but by no means probable contingency. I do no longer wonder at the persistency with which San Franciscans adhere to this architectural superfluity in the face of climatical impossibilities. The balconies in which no one sits, the piazzas on which no one lounges, are timid advances made to a climate whose churlishness we are trying to temper by an ostentation of confidence. Ridiculous as this spectacle is at all seasons, it is never more so than in that bleak interval between sunset and dark, when the shrill scream of the factory whistle seems to have concentrated all the hard, unsympathetic quality of the climate into one vocal expression. Add to this the appearance of one or two pedestrians, manifestly too late for their dinners, and tasting in the shrewish air a bitter premonition of the welcome that awaits them at home, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those ordinary views from my balcony which makes the balcony itself ridiculous.|$|E
