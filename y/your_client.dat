500|$|On September 29, 2009, Randazza {{requested}} that Beck voluntarily {{ask that the}} First Amendment {{be applied to the}} arbitration case, despite its international setting. Randazza made this request because Beck's political commentary favored the United States Constitution over international law. Randazza's September 29, 2009 letter to Beck's attorneys cited statements by Beck in which he indicated he preferred United States law over international law. Beck had said, [...] "Once we sign our rights over to international law, the Constitution is officially dead." [...] Randazza's letter concluded: [...] "I am certain that neither party wishes to see First Amendment rights subordinated to international trademark principles, thus unwittingly proving Mr. Beck's point. Lest this case become an example of international law causing damage to the constitutional rights that both of our clients hold dear, I respectfully request that <b>your</b> <b>client</b> agree to stipulate to the application of American constitutional law to this case." ...|$|E
500|$|His work {{steadily}} {{increased in}} amount and quality throughout the 1920s and '30s. By the 1930s {{he was making}} most of his court appearances in the senior courts such as the High Court of Justice; in 1932 he was advised by his clerk {{that he should not}} be seen in the County Courts, and that he should leave this work for lesser members of the chambers. In 1929 he helped edit several chapters of Smith's Leading Cases (13th ed.) and in 1932 acted as a supervising editor for the 9th edition of Bullen & Leake's Precedents for Pleadings in the King's Bench Division. In 1932 he moved to his own set of chambers in Brick Court, and by 1936 he was earning over £3,000 a year. A notable case was L'Estrange v F Graucob Ltd [...] 2 KB 394, where he successfully argued an exemption clause was incorporated because a contract was signed. This was counter to his work as a judge, where he tried to minimise their impact, but he said that 'If you are an advocate you want <b>your</b> <b>client</b> to win. If you are a judge you don't care who wins exactly. All you are concerned about is justice'.|$|E

[...] Chief Justice John Roberts responded: [...] "It's a case about money. <b>Your</b> <b>client</b> wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case." [...] Mertz emphasized that the torch relay was not school-sponsored; {{that he had not}} stepped on school property at all before unfurling the banner; that [...] "BONG HiTS 4 JESUS" [...] was intended to be—and was regarded as—purely a humorous message; and that the unfurling of the banner did not cause any disruption. Based on these facts, he concludes, his case [...] "does not present the issue of school authority over student expressions on campus or in a school-sponsored activity".|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis of}} this paper is that popular performancemeasures, like the Sharpe ratio and {{information}} ratio, are not designed for <b>your</b> <b>clients</b> needs. The “one size fits all ” approach of these ratios does not recognize the fact that <b>your</b> <b>clients</b> have different ages, different amounts of wealth and different goals. We propose a new two-step procedure for performance measurement that is designed to help the individual investor accom-plish his or her goals.

Pilots don’t {{have to know how to}} build an airplane in order to fly one, and passengers don’t have to know how to fly a plane in order to use them for transportation. Therefore, we will avoid tedious for-mulas and focus on what you need to know in order to get <b>your</b> <b>clients</b> to their destination more effectively and with greater safety.
