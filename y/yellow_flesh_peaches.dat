40|$|Chemical-physical properties, colour parame ters, {{antioxidant}} activities (AA), carotenoid and polyphenol levels (CL) {{in seven}} cultivars of <b>yellow</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>peaches,</b> five cultivars of {{yellow flesh nectarines}} and one cultivar of white flesh nectarines at harvest time and after 7 days of cold storage were evaluated. Peaches had major variability in flesh firmness (FF) and titratable acidity (TA) and lower soluble solid concentration (SSC) than nectarines. Evaluation of ground colour parameters, a*, b* and L*, showed that nectarines had a yellow-orange hue with high lightness, while peaches were darker, tending to red-green. Hydrophilic, lipophilic antioxidant activities of extracts (W-AA and L-AA), carotenoids and polyphenols levels (CL and PL) were evaluated and their relation with commercial maturation. The average of W-AA at harvest time was 11. 0 TEAC, while the L-AA values at harvest time was on average higher in peaches (2. 0 TEAC) than in nectarines (1. 3 TEAC). 'The yellow flesh had higher amounts of total carotenoids (182. 45 ug/l 00 g fw for peaches and 117. 37 ug/ 100 g fw for yellow flesh nectarines). During cold storage, W-AA increased for nectarines (+ 22. 9 % in yellow flesh and + 19. 2 % in white flesh) and peaches as well as polyphenolic compounds (+ 13. 37 %) while, contents of carotenoids decreased (- 8. 7 %) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out on a {{white-fleshed}} peach cultivar (Prunus persica L. Batsch cv. ‘Alba’) and a <b>yellow</b> <b>fleshed</b> <b>peach</b> cultivar (Prunus persica L. Batsch cv. ‘Fire Prince’). Tree canopy was divided into three horizontal layers (lower, mid, upper layer) and the fruits from each layer were separately harvested. Three harvests were performed at 7 -day intervals. Fruit diameter, fresh weight, cover color, firmness and soluble solid content were determined. A discriminant analysis procedure was applied to experimental data and extracted five discriminant functions for each cultivar. Fruit qualitative differences among canopy layers changed throughout the on-tree-ripening process and were less evident on second and third harvest date for Fire Prince and Alba peach cultivars, respectively. Fruit discriminant scores well summarized fruit quality. In addition our results suggest that lower canopy layer {{plays an important role}} in the production of fruits of good quality like the other two canopy layers...|$|R
40|$|Consumers of {{peaches and}} {{nectarines}} often complain of the low eating quality of these fruits that, for commercial purposes, are harvested before their physiological maturation is completed on the tree. The higher quality attained by delaying harvest contradicts the possibility of prolonging shelf-life, particularly for those varieties characterised by a very rapid softening process. In previous works (Tonutti et al., 1998; Bonghi et al., 1999) we have shown that Ultra Low Oxygen (ULO) postharvest treatments (up to 48 h) without refrigeration are effective in reducing the softening rate in Springcrest peaches. Considering the differences existing among peach varieties in terms of ripening physiology, {{the aim of the}} present work was to evaluate the effects of a short-term ULO treatment on white (WF) and <b>yellow</b> (YF) <b>flesh</b> <b>peach</b> varieties harvested at an advanced ripening stage...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{varieties}} of peaches and plums contain {{a mixture of}} phenolics that may possess anticancer activity. Our objectives were to evaluate extracts from a commercial variety of <b>yellow</b> <b>fleshed</b> <b>peach</b> "Rich Lady" (RL) and of the red fleshed plum "Black Splendor" (BS) on tumor breast cells in vitro and in vivo, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind the cancer growth-suppression of the phenolics identified in peach and plum extracts for their chemopreventive potential and to evaluate the tumor growth-suppression in vivo. The RL extract preferentially inhibited the proliferation of the estrogen-independent MDA-MB- 435 breast cancer cells over the estrogen-dependent MCF- 7 or the normal MCF- 10 A breast cells. Similarly, BS extracts, though less effective than RL extracts, showed greater effects on MDA-MB- 435 cells {{compared to the other}} cell lines. Fractionation of RL extracts into different groups of phenolic compounds allowed the identification of a fraction of phenolic acids (F 1) with the major components of chlorogenic and neo-chlorogenic acid with potential in chemoprevention because of the relatively high growth-inhibition exerted on MDA-MB- 435 and low toxicity exerted on MCF- 10 A cells. The F 1 isolated from RL, and its major components, chlorogenic and neo-chlorogenic acids, triggered the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The extrinsic death-receptor pathway involved the activation of caspase- 8 followed by caspase- 6, caspase- 7, and PARP cleavage. By targeting the intrinsic pathway, the pro-apoptotic proteins cytochrome c, EndoG and AIF were released from mitochondria. The relatively higher cell-growth inhibition exerted by neo-chlorogenic acid was associated with its ability to inhibit the pro-survival Akt pathway. In contrast, F 1 isolated from the red flesh genotype BY 00 P 6653, induced apoptosis mainly through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway upon sustained MAPK-ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation. The tumor growth-suppression of RL extracts was confirmed in vivo. Moreover, a dose-dependent decrease in lung metastasis was found, even at doses that showed no effect in tumor growth-suppression. These results suggest that peach phenolics may have potential in therapy and chemoprevention of metastatic breast cancer. Specifically chlorogenic and neo-chlorogenic acids, widely distributed among food plants, may be a useful therapeutic tool for targeting multiple cell signaling pathways in the treatment and chemoprevention of metastatic breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{many studies}} have shown that UV-B {{radiation}} can selectively improve the nutraceutical value of several fruits. On the contrary, few researches investigate the effect of UV-B exposure on the plasticity of cell wall that is responsible for the softening process during shelf life of fruits. This process can vary significantly, according to both UV-B treatment and the fruit species or cultivar. In this study, melting <b>flesh</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>peaches</b> (Prunus persica cv. Fairtime) were exposed for 10 min or 60 min to UV-B radiation (2. 31 W m- 2). Afterwards, the fruits were kept at room temperature up to 36 hours. The activity of some cell wall enzymes, e. g. peroxidases, endo-polygalacturonase, β-galactosidase, endo- 1, 4 -β-D-glucanase/β-D-glucosidase and pectin methylesterase was quantified at different time points. Data will be discussed considering both UV-B treatments and the following storage time points...|$|R
40|$|Anthocyanins are plant {{bioactive}} {{compounds that}} control color of many vegetables, flowers, fruit, roots and other plant parts. In peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch], color {{is a key}} determinant for fruit quality and depends by flovonoids including anthocyanins. These bioactive molecules have potential benefits to human health including protection against cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation and other chronic diseases. The R 2 R 3 -MYB transcription factors (TFs) control the expression of genes for the synthesis of anthocyanin pigments {{with the help of}} co-activators belonging to the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and WD 40 repeat family. In the peach genome, through this study three MYB 10 -like (MYB 10. 1, MYB 10. 2 and MYB 10. 3) and three bHLH-like (bHLH 3, bHLH 33 and GL 3) TFs were identified as best candidates to be the regulators of the anthocyanin accumulation in peach. Among these MYB 10 s, MYB 10. 1 is the highly expressed gene in ripe peach fruits. The accumulation of anthocyanins in <b>yellow</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>peach</b> fruits is highest in the peel, abundant in the part of the mesocarp surrounding the stone and lowest in the mesocarp. The expression of MYB 10. 1 and MYB 10. 3 genes were correlated with anthocyanin levels of different peach parts. They have also positive correlation with the key structural genes of the anthocyanin pathway, like chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone- 3 ?-hydroxylase (F 3 H), dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase (DFR) and UDP-glucose:flavonoid- 3 -O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT). Functions of peach MYB 10 s were tested in tobacco and shown to activate key genes in the anthocyanin pathway when bHLHs were co-expressed as partners. Over-expression of MYB 10. 1 /bHLH 3 and MYB 10. 3 /bHLH 3 activated anthocyanin production by up-regulating NtCHS, NtDFR and NtUFGT while other combinations were not effective. To better understand the role of MYB 10. 1 in anthocyanin synthesis during peach ripening, its coding sequence has been constitutively expressed in tobacco transgenic plants. Its over-expression induce anthocyanin pigmentation in the reproductive parts of transgenic tobacco lines through the up-regulation of transcript levels of many important genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway like phenylalanineammonia-lyase (NtPAL), NtCHS, chalcone isomerase (NtCHI), NtF 3 H, NtDFR, anthocyanin synthase (NtANS) and NtUFGT. The pigment accumulation was always limited to reproductive parts and never present in the vegetative part like stem and leaves. Besides the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis, the ectopic expression of MYB 10. 1 leads to two different types of phenotype in transgenic as compared to WT tobacco. The strong phenotype, called type-I, is characterized by irregular leaf shape and size, reduced plant height, stamens with reduced filament length and non-dehiscing anthers, reduced pistil length, no nectary gland formation and reduced capsule development but pigmented reproductive parts including androecium, gynoecium and petals. On the contrary, so-called type-II plants, have a mild phenotype with regular plant growth and development, but purple seed coats. Surprisingly, the over-expression of MYB 10. 1 altered the floral development in transgenic tobacco lines. In type-I transgenic plants, the over-expression of peach MYB 10. 1 leads to down-regulation of NtMYB 305, a gene similar, but not orthologous, to MYB 10. 1, which is required for floral development. Moreover, MYB 10. 1 up-regulates the expression of jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis (allene oxide synthase, NtAOS) and signaling (NtJAZd) pathway genes as well as 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate oxidase (NtACO), a key gene in ethylene synthesis. Furthermore, NECTARIN 1 (NtNCE 1) that is known to be involved in nectary gland formation, was repressed since its transcription is regulated by NtMYB 305. On the contrary, type-II transgenic plants showed opposite results for NtMYB 305, NtAOS, NtJAZd and NtNEC 1. Therefore, it can be concluded that the over-expression of peach MYB 10. 1 in tobacco not only regulates flavonoid biosynthesis in the reproductive parts but also affects (directly and/or indirectly) other process like vegetative and reproductive development. These new findings will promote further investigation to elucidate more diverse role of R 2 R 3 -MYB TFs. Furthermore, they will promote more and better insights on the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and will aid fruit breeders to introduce new peach cultivars with higher antioxidant level as well as colored fruit...|$|R
