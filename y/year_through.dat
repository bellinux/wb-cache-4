5|$|A hydro-electric {{scheme was}} built in 2016 on Radyr Weir to {{generate}} renewable energy. The Radyr Weir scheme channels more than 500 million cubic metres of water per <b>year</b> <b>through</b> two screw turbines {{and is expected to}} generate 400kW — enough energy to power three of the city’s leisure centres — which will save 700 tonnes of CO2 annually.|$|E
5|$|After Crawford graduated, Professor A. J. Herbertson {{offered him}} {{a job as a}} junior {{demonstrator}} in the university's geography department. Crawford agreed, and served in the teaching position over the ensuing <b>year.</b> <b>Through</b> Herbertson, Crawford was introduced to the geographer Patrick Geddes. Crawford then decided to focus his attentions on archaeology rather than geography even though few professional positions in the field existed in Britain at the time. Looking elsewhere for archaeological employment, he unsuccessfully applied for a Craven Fellowship and for a post at Bombay Museum.|$|E

5|$|Around 1959, M-43 was {{shifted to}} bypass Grand Ledge. The former route through town was {{retained}} {{as a state}} highway, designated Bus. M-43. M-43 was extended from its eastern end in Lansing in 1962 along a section of highway that was formerly part of US16 on Grand River Avenue; the extension to Webberville was made when the I-96 freeway opened that <b>year.</b> <b>Through</b> the Lansing area, M-43 was rerouted off Michigan Avenue downtown.

The traffic through Trondheim–Hell increased; commuter trains terminated at several different stations. From 1930, multiple units were also put into use on the line.|$|E

5|$|Youngs was {{included}} in the inaugural balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936, but received less than 5% of the vote from the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA).

5|$|Bethe left Germany in 1933, {{moving to}} England after {{receiving}} an offer {{for a position}} as lecturer at the University of Manchester for a <b>year</b> <b>through</b> Sommerfeld's connection to William Lawrence Bragg. He moved in with his friend Rudolf Peierls and Peierls' wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because his parents were Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German, {{and did not have}} to eat English food. Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe's interest in nuclear physics. After James Chadwick and Maurice Goldhaber discovered the photodisintegration of deuterium, Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls {{to come up with a}} theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. This they did on the four-hour train ride from Cambridge back to Manchester. Bethe would investigate further in the years ahead.|$|E

The pennant was presented to the team with the best win–loss record each <b>year</b> <b>through</b> the 1968 season, after which the American League Championship Series (ALCS) was introduced to decide the pennant winner. The first modern World Series was played in 1903 and, after a hiatus in 1904, has taken place every season except 1994, when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason. The current American League pennant holders are the Houston Astros who won in October 2017.|$|E
5|$|John Palliser {{crossed the}} Rockies through a pass in 1858 {{that led to}} the {{headwaters}} of the Palliser River, a tributary of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party referred to it as Palliser's River.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake, but had some trouble making their way back to Alberta; the return route that they had chosen proved too dangerous to negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, they made it back over the Rockies later that <b>year</b> <b>through</b> North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up the Elk River.|$|E

Queen Victoria granted the BSAC a royal charter to administer and develop these territories on 29 October 1889, for an initial period of 25 years. This charter included the right to take possession of, deal with, and dispose of land. On 12 September 1890 Rhodes's Pioneer Column reached what was to become Salisbury.|$|E

That same year, members Sooyoung and Hyoyeon were cast into S.M.'s training system through the 2000 S.M. Open Audition, in which Hyoyeon danced for her audition. Yuri was the next Girls' Generation member to become an S.M. trainee after coming second in the 2001 S.M. Youth Best Dancer competition. Yoona was cast the following <b>year</b> <b>through</b> the 2002 S.M. Saturday Open Casting Audition, where she sang and danced to her favorite singers, BoA and Britney Spears.

The Friends of SCPA (commonly known as The Friends), a nonprofit {{organization}} led by parents and members of the business and arts communities, had been a vital source of funding since the school's inception. In 1984, The Friends raised over $400,000 to pay the salaries of the artistic director, technical director, costume designer, and dance, strings, and production teachers. In later years, The Friends raised up to $1million each <b>year</b> <b>through</b> special events, corporate gifts and sponsorships, advertising sales, and other programs to support the artistic needs of the school including staff salaries, production expenses, scholarships for private lessons, and artists in residence.|$|E

5|$|There {{was popular}} {{sentiment}} by fans for the Pirates {{to name the}} stadium after former outfielder Roberto Clemente.

As per the agreement, PNC Bank will pay the Pirates approximately $2million each <b>year</b> <b>through</b> 2020, and also has a full-service PNC branch at the stadium. The total cost of PNC Park was $216million. Shortly after the naming rights deal was announced, the city of Pittsburgh renamed the 6th Street Bridge near {{the southeast corner of}} the site of the park the Roberto Clemente Bridge as a compromise to fans who had wanted the park named after Clemente.|$|E
5|$|There {{were other}} {{financial}} pressures on Frazee, despite his team's success. Ruth, {{fully aware of}} baseball's popularity and his role in it, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per <b>year</b> <b>through</b> 1921. He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures. Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money. Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from {{the purchase of the}} club.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{even before}} the {{increase}} of abuse of the Case Stated procedure, the United Kingdom {{was estimated to be}} losing £500 million a <b>year</b> <b>through</b> the movement of arbitration business to other countries. In response, the Lord Chancellor convened a Commercial Court Users Conference in 1960, and tasked them with reviewing the system; the conclusion was that the status quo should remain. With the increased use of the Case Stated procedure, more calls for reform came. In June 1977 the London Arbitration Group (LAG) was formed, taking it upon itself to make the government aware of the damage current law was causing. In 1978, in reaction to the continued pressure, the Lord Chancellor established a Commercial Court Committee to again look at the issue; their report, in June 1978, recommended changing the system so that appeal was only allowed when either the High Court permitted it, or both parties to the arbitration agreed it was necessary. This was intended to ensure that any new Act of Parliament fulfilled two roles – firstly, decreasing the use of the Case Stated procedure, and secondly, encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions.|$|E
