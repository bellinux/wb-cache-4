Craig Hubbard remarked that [...] "a guy in a mask chasing co-eds with a meat cleaver can be scary, but on some level you're {{thinking}} to yourself <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> kick his ass if you got the drop on him...but when a spooky little girl takes out an entire Delta Force squad, how {{are you supposed to}} deal with that?" [...] While Alma has been compared to the character Samara from The Ring, Craig Hubbard stated that she [...] "... was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts ..."

[...] Hubbard acknowledged that Alma [...] "... admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in Dark Water or Séance", but [...] "... creepy little girls have been freaking [...] out since The Shining."

Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E

500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E

5000|$|Puzder {{has been}} {{critical}} of substantially raising the federal minimum wage, arguing that a $15 per hour minimum wage would increase costs for consumers and increase automation, leading to fewer jobs. He is also reported to oppose raising the $2.13 per hour minimum wage for tipped workers. In an interview published by Fox Business in May 2016, Puzder said: [...] "There are solutions to this problem, and increasing the minimum wage {{is not the best}} solution. If we are going to increase the minimum wage at all, we’ve got to keep a lower minimum wage for entry-level workers, or these people are just going to be shut out of the workforce….The Congressional Budget Office came out with a report last year that said <b>you</b> <b>could</b> raise the minimum wage to about $9 without much impact on jobs, and <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>could</b> do that".

The Rolling Stones' stage manager on the 1969 tour, Chip Monck, explained that [...] "the stage was one metre high – 39 inches for us – and [...] it was on the top of a hill, so all the audience pressure was back upon them".
