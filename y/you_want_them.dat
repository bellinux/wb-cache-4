500|$|As {{a result}} of World War II in the 1940s, Asch and other social psychologists were {{interested}} in propaganda. They wondered: How do you get people to believe what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to believe? How do you get people to believe they should sacrifice for the war effort? ...|$|E
500|$|Hawke has {{repeatedly}} denounced what he perceives {{to be an}} overemphasis placed {{on the importance of}} monogamy in romantic relationships: [...] "People have such a childish view of monogamy and fidelity. 'He's cheated so he's bad, she's cheated so she's bad', as opposed to a recognition that our species is not monogamous...Sexual fidelity can't be the whole thing you hang your relationship on. If you really love somebody <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to grow, but you don't get to define how that happens. They do." ...|$|E

[...] Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of Grimm that [...] "there are moments– just a few stand out– {{when you realize that}} these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to succeed, even if they do not always." [...] Similarly, writing for BroadwayWorld, Elaina Lenertz stated, [...] "Sometimes their silks routines are a bit out of sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from younger kids who are still mastering stunts. Despite this, the performance is very impressive." ...|$|E

500|$|On July 5, Davis {{was sent}} back down {{to make room for}} Josh Hamilton who was coming off the {{disabled}} list. Although he had 15 home runs in 258 at bats, he was leading the American League with 114 strikeouts and had, on June 21, become the quickest player in Major League history to reach 100 strikeouts, requiring only 219 at bats. His batting average was at [...]202. While talking about the Rangers' handling of another player, Julio Borbon, in 2010, Washington mentioned the decision to send Davis down in 2009: [...] "We gave Chris a good amount of time last year. With young players, they can look bad for 100 at bats and then turn it around the next 100 and look exactly like <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to." [...] With the RedHawks, Davis played 44 games, batting [...]327 with six home runs, 12 doubles, and 30 RBI.|$|E
500|$|Concerns {{over the}} animals' safety {{prompted}} an anonymous telephone {{call to the}} Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), which dispatched a representative. Initial tests with shocking had yielded disappointing results, necessitating an increase in voltage. According to Anderson, [...] "Meddings explained that his team were laying the crocodiles down and they weren't doing anything. They were just lying there. The RSPCA man said, well, they would, because of {{the warmth of the}} lamps. So Derek said, 'We've been giving them a touch with an electrode just to make them move.' The guy asked what voltage they were using and Derek said it was about 20 volts, and the guy said, 'Oh, they've got terribly thick skins, you know. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to move, you'll have to pump it up to 60.'" [...] Following an initial investigation of AP Films Studios, the allegations of mistreatment were not pursued further; the RSPCA officer later joined the crocodiles' handler in assisting with the filming.|$|E
500|$|Clemmons {{was arrested}} on July 1, 2009, after he {{appeared}} in a Pierce County court trying to have his bench warrant thrown out. He was charged with second-degree rape of a child, {{as well as being}} a fugitive from Arkansas. At the time of his arrest, Clemmons made religiously themed comments and referred to himself as [...] "the beast". He also told a police officer that President Barack Obama and LeBron James were his brothers, and Oprah Winfrey was his sister. Pierce County prosecutors asserted that Clemmons' recent crimes amounted to a violation of Clemmons' parole in Arkansas, and that he faced years in prison if he was returned to the state. However, the Arkansas Department of Community Correction notified Pierce County on July 22 that they did not intend to ask for his extradition and that he should be adjudicated on his Washington charges. Stephen Penner, a deputy prosecuting attorney in Pierce County, said of the Arkansas decision, [...] "There's a built-in incentive to not following through. In a way, the more violent they are, the less <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> in your community." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{contemporary}} reviews, Peter Paphides {{wrote in}} Melody Maker that the EP was [...] "25 minutes of snowblind glory waiting here if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>them.</b> Each {{of them is}} a towering monument to nothingness". The Alternative Press opined that the EP was not [...] "a progression from the gorgeously devastated Frigid Stars and I couldn't be happier. Codeine have hit upon a formula so pure and righteous it would be tragic for them to deviate from it." [...] The Washington Post gave the album a mixed review, explaining that [...] "There's not a lot going on here, but songs such as [...] "Realize" [...] and [...] "Hard to Find" [...] are hardly nothing." [...] and that tracks such as [...] "W." [...] allow Codeine to achieve [...] "both earthly aggression and unearthly calm." [...] Charles Aaron of Spin, reviewed the single [...] "Realize", stating that the song [...] "inches along as if Codeine's still wondering whether it's worth the effort". The b-side [...] "Broken-hearted Wine" [...] was described as a song that [...] "coolly walks a delicate line between delibitating sadness and cartoon regret." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1986, an {{execution}} date (March 4) {{was set on}} the Chi Omega convictions; the Supreme Court issued a brief stay, but the execution was quickly rescheduled. In April, shortly after the new date (July 2) was announced, Bundy finally confessed to Hagmaier and Nelson what they believed was {{the full range of}} his depredations, including details of what he did to some of his victims after their deaths. He told them that he revisited Taylor Mountain, Issaquah, and other secondary crime scenes, often several times, to lie with his victims and perform sexual acts with their decomposing bodies until putrefaction forced him to stop. In some cases, he drove for several hours each way and remained the entire night. In Utah, he applied makeup to Melissa Smith's lifeless face, and he repeatedly washed Laura Aime's hair. [...] "If you've got time," [...] he told Hagmaier, [...] "they can be anything <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to be." [...] He decapitated approximately twelve of his victims with a hacksaw, and kept at least one group of severed heads—probably the four later found on Taylor Mountain (Rancourt, Parks, Ball and Healy)—in his apartment {{for a period of time}} before disposing of them.|$|E
500|$|Ben, {{although}} extremely well-mannered, has an impeccable {{ability to}} lie and manipulate {{the people around}} him, even when he is at a physical disadvantage. He often speaks in a low, emotionless monotone when at his most unreadable, frequently sprinkling his speech with sarcasm or dry, humorless jokes. He can also be petty and vindictive, {{even to the point}} of murder, when he does not get what he wants. He claims to have been born on the Island, leading to him being thought of as a miracle by the Others, as pregnant women die on the island; but later confesses to Locke that he was lying. He unsuccessfully tries to convince the survivors he is Henry Gale, although succeeds in manipulating Locke to turn against Jack while held prisoner under this guise. While he claims he will not sacrifice innocent lives in order to accomplish his goals, he has been shown to do quite the opposite. In the third-season finale, Ben is informed by Tom Friendly (M. C. Gainey), an Other, that they have captured three of the crash survivors: Sayid Jarrah, Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). When Tom tells Ben they are unwilling to reveal any information about the rest of the survivors, Ben quickly replies [...] "Shoot Kwon... <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to answer questions, kill Kwon - do it now". Conversely, Ben refuses to allow his spy on the freighter to destroy it long before it reaches the Island, as he would not kill anyone who [...] "did not deserve to die". Furthermore, when Locke confronts Ben about causing the freighter to explode, Ben coldly replies, [...] "So?" ...|$|E

"Well, sir," [...] said old Silas, as {{he gave a}} {{preliminary}} puff to the pipe he had just lighted, and so satisfied himself that the draught was all right, [...] "the wind's a-comin', an' so's Christmas.

2500|$|... "Impossible" [...] is a midtempo R ballad {{written by}} Arnthor Birgisson and Ina Wroldsen, {{in the musical}} key of A♭ major with a time {{signature}} in common time and a tempo of 92 beats per minute. The melody is to be played in a moderate tone and tempo. The song's backing track consists of a simple chord progression of A♭E♭D♭Fm7. It was conceived after Shontelle stated that she felt that radio was currently missing a [...] "heartbreak ballad". In an interview with J-14 magazine she said [...] "I {{knew that there was}} no song out there for heartbroken people. I just wanted to put a song out that gave people hope - things may not work out the way <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to, but you can move past it and everything is gonna be okay... draw the strength to carry on past a break up where you're the one in the embarrassing position." [...] Shontelle uses a vocal range from E♭3 to D♭5 in the song. Billboards Michael Menachem described her vocal precision as similar to that of Beyoncé's in [...] "Irreplaceable". Meanwhile, the production, helmed by Birgisson, was compared to Norwegian production team, StarGate who are, coincidentally, the team responsible for producing [...] "Irreplaceable".|$|E
