In a track-by-track interview given by the band on X, bassist Guy Berryman reported that {{in response to the}} band's request, Kraftwerk founding member Ralf Hütter [...] "said something like, 'Yes, you can use it, and thank <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> asking my permission, unlike that bastard Jay-Z'." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, which were {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver Martin Brundle, Nico Rosberg expressed delight about his victory, but also remembered the events of Paris which, as he put it, rendered [...] "everything relative". Replying to Brundle's notion that driving {{the way he did}} earlier in the season would have given him a chance for the championship, Rosberg replied: [...] "Thank <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> that piece of advice, I could figure that out for myself!" [...] Lewis Hamilton on the other hand lamented {{the fact that he was}} unable to follow Rosberg closely on track without damaging his tyres too much, saying that he would have otherwise had the pace to pass him. Third placed Sebastian Vettel called it [...] "a good race", but also [...] "not very exciting", since the Ferrari drivers had been [...] "in no-mans land" [...] behind the Mercedes.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his speech}} on July 20, {{the third day}} of the convention, Cruz congratulated Trump but did not endorse him and told {{listeners}} to [...] "vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution". The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd. The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: [...] "I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> maligning my wife and maligning my father.'" [...] Two months later, on September 23, 2016, Cruz publicly endorsed Trump for president.|$|E
