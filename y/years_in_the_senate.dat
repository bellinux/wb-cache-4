5|$|Senator McCarthy's {{first three}} <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> were unremarkable. McCarthy {{was a popular}} speaker, invited by many {{different}} organizations, covering {{a wide range of}} topics.

He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a small circle of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate.|$|E

He spoke in support of Muslim camel drivers and opposed military training for boys, and continued to oppose elements of the White Australia policy, raising concerns about Australian-born children of Kanaka labourers: [...] "They will have difficulties enough {{in front of them}} in a country that is so rampantly strong on the white Australia policy without our making their case worse."

[...] A Peace Democrat during the Civil War, Bayard spent his early <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in opposition to Republican policies, especially the Reconstruction of the defeated Confederacy. [...] His conservatism extended to financial matters, as he became known as a staunch supporter of the gold standard and an opponent of greenbacks and silver coinage, which he believed would cause inflation. [...] Bayard's conservative politics made him popular in the South and with Eastern financial interests, but never popular enough to obtain the Democratic nomination for President, which he attempted to win in 1876, 1880, and 1884.|$|E

500|$|Horner {{argues that}} the {{position}} of Secretary of State {{was the most important}} non-elective post in government, then often seen as a stepping stone to the presidency, and though Sherman no longer sought to be president, he was aware of the prestige. According to Rhodes, [...] "Sherman was glad to accept the Secretaryship of State. [...] He exchanged two <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> with a doubtful succession for apparently a four years' tenure of the Cabinet head of the new Republican administration, which was undoubtedly a promotion." [...] Rhodes suggested that Hanna did not give credence to warnings about Sherman's mental capacity in early 1897, though some of those tales must have been told by New York businessmen whom he trusted. [...] The stories were not believed by McKinley either; the President-elect in February 1897 called accounts of Sherman's mental decay [...] "the cheap inventions of sensational writers or other evil-disposed or mistaken people".|$|E

[...] In succeeding years after his 1950 speech, McCarthy made additional accusations of Communist infiltration into the State Department, the administration of President Harry S. Truman, the Voice of America, and the U.S. Army. He also used various charges of communism, communist sympathies, disloyalty, or sex crimes to attack a number of politicians and other individuals inside and outside of government. This included a concurrent [...] "Lavender Scare" [...] against suspected homosexuals (as homosexuality was prohibited by law at the time, it was also perceived to increase a person's risk for [...] blackmail).|$|E
