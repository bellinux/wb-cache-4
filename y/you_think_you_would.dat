6000|$|... 'Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> attract attention?' {{said the}} Medical Man. 'Our {{ancestors}} had no great tolerance for anachronisms.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "George {{will see}} to that," [...] said Flora. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be welcome in matting, with an orange cowry round your neck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, {{if there}} had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have been sure to have seen it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, candidly, Miss Reed, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{prefer to}} have old Hannibal, whom you know, as county judge, than a {{stranger}} and a Northern man like ME?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Save us {{from the}} {{consequences}} of our own actions, and from the cruel fairy, Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid!' Do not <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be a little tempted then to tell what you know, laddie?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{other day}} the {{children}} were projecting a purchase, Livy and I to furnish the money--a dollar and a half. Jean discouraged the idea. She said: [...] "We haven't got any money. Children, if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> remember the machine isn't done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! And {{what has}} {{that to do}} with people's liking you? If that was a reason, how many friends do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{rather die}} on a {{moonlight}} night, {{when the sky}} was quite clear, and the wind blowing, as it did last night?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Frank {{laughed at}} this free-and-easy {{way of looking}} at it. [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have killed him, do you, if I had not saved you the trouble?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The Tide (1933) - [...] "If a Messiah Came to Your Town Today, What <b>Would</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think?</b> What <b>Would</b> <b>You</b> Do?".|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{take care}} of me?" [...] she said softly. [...] "I am afraid I am a very ignorant little person. I do not know much about England or English ways, and every one says that things are so {{different}} here." ...|$|R
60|$|I know in {{your heart}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'm right. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> never seek to dissuade me from what I'm {{convinced}} is my duty.|$|R
6000|$|... "I-- er-- {{suppose you}} could," [...] {{answered}} the lawyer, with some hesitation. [...] "But don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{be better off}} out of the State, or in Canada?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} I don't know it?" [...] he answered. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{not have had}} a bullet through your {{forehead}} before now if I was not sure of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And one cent and {{a quarter}} a week," [...] added Mr. George. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> get {{pleasure}} enough out of your chain {{to come to a}} cent {{and a quarter}} a week?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How absurd!" [...] {{burst out}} Alfred, indignantly. [...] "Am I then, so distasteful to <b>you</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> rather wait here and suffer {{a half hour}} longer while I go for assistance? It is only common {{courtesy}} on my part. I {{do not want to}} carry <b>you.</b> I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be quite heavy." ...|$|R
6000|$|And he said, [...] "Very well, Una, I {{am sorry}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> so if <b>you</b> really cared {{anything}} for me. It {{is just as}} well I have found out you don't. I am going away in two days' time and I shall not return in a hurry, Una." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She usually goes to {{bed with}} a play at this hour. It's a horrid habit--going to bed, I mean. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> mind showing me about a little?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{be able to}} {{maintain}} the character? Because you must remember that if detected you might be torn in pieces by the slaves, before the officers could interfere to protect you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We stop at Swindon {{in half an}} hour," [...] said Joan softly. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be wise to get {{out there}} and go {{straight}} back to London, Mr. Marson? Think of all you would avoid!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't take long, dear. I've {{been lucky}} in some {{investments}} {{while you were}} away, and I'm {{going to leave the}} force, and take you over to England, and find a prince for you to marry--if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like to {{hear you}} preach," [...] said he. [...] "Without a penny, indeed! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> dance {{attendance}} upon him {{if he were a}} poor man? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that Laura <b>would</b> ever have looked twice at him? You know as well as I do that she is marrying him only for his money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Except {{when the}} {{carriers}} bring up our bundles of dry clothes, we lie down so soaked that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> scarcely feel the water poured over you. At any rate, if <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> that it <b>would</b> do <b>you</b> good, {{you had better}} order your servant to do it; that is to say, if <b>you</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> slay him, the first morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would.</b> <b>You</b> like {{to fight}} and knock folks round sometimes, but you don't lie, and I don't believe you'd steal," [...] and Nat shook his head decidedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I {{will start}} with you," [...] the woman said. [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{be able to}} find your way a dark night like this? No, sir; I will put you on your way till morning. But, in the first place, which line do you mean to take?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] Beatrice interrupted, [...] "let us {{talk about}} yourself. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be more contented, happier, {{if you were}} to try to arrange for a few--a few demonstrations or lectures over here, as you at first intended? I know that you must find having nothing to do such a strain upon you," [...] she added.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Dick," [...] she {{interrupted}} him, {{fired by}} a new thought, [...] "if I loved Evan as madly as <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> mean so little that I'd be content, {{if it were the}} only way out, for you to have a hunting accident. But you see, I don't. Anyway, there's a brass tack for you to ponder." ...|$|E
6000|$|F.--If you did {{not wish}} to think of the pocopo, and {{speaking}} of man <b>would</b> make <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of it, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not speak of man, <b>would</b> <b>you?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is my wife, sir, {{and that}} is ten times more. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do more for her than I would do,--drink more of Esill? You had better go away, Sir Marmaduke. You can do no good by coming here and talking of your daughter. I {{would have given the}} world to save her;--but she would not be saved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true. None of the {{candidates}} quite satisfies us, but when we have investigated their qualifications fully I may ask <b>you</b> what <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> It <b>would</b> be premature just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a silly question, Major, {{which makes}} me think you ain't so right as I believed. If those brutes had Paris do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be at Versailles? Or, at any rate, that I should? Don't you bother about the war. It's all right, or as right as {{it is likely to}} be for many a long day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we {{will say}} no more about it," [...] Captain Wilson said. [...] "It {{would have been a}} pleasure, both to me and the Hudsons, to have you aft, and I am sure you would be well {{received}} by all the passengers. However, as <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not be comfortable, we will let the matter drop.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Captain Forster, as we {{have just}} agreed that our only chance is to obtain aid {{from one of the}} stations, and as you are the only {{volunteer}} for the service, I do not see that I can decline to accept your offer. At which station do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be most likely to find a force that could help us?" ...|$|E
60|$|What {{though he}} did not belong to your clique! Though you may not approve of his method or his principles, {{recognize}} his magnanimity. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> not like to claim kindredship with him in that, though in no other thing he is like, or likely, to <b>you?</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> lose your reputation so? What you lost at the spile, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> gain at the bung.|$|R
6000|$|... "To tease and annoy him; {{to make a}} {{spectacle}} of yourself and him before those soldiers, Mr. Malone, your uncle, et cetera. <b>Would</b> he like it, <b>think</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> like to remember it a week hence?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Napoleon famously declared, [...] "You {{call these}} baubles, well, {{it is with}} baubles that men are led... Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{be able to make}} men fight by reasoning? Never. That is good only for the scholar in his study. The soldier needs glory, distinctions, rewards." [...] This has been often quoted as [...] "It is with such baubles that men are led." ...|$|R
