"Hotel California" [...] and its lyrics {{have become}} {{absorbed into the}} wider culture around the world, and {{have been used by}} various writers and {{commentators}} to reflect on issues ranging from politics to social media and welfare, or as an observation on a particular situation. The lines [...] "We are programmed to receive / <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> any time you like / But you can never leave!" [...] were used by an economist to refer to how the appeal of an attractive [...] "Hotel California"-type host country to foreign investors may be countered by the cost of exit on leaving the country. A term [...] "The Hotel California Effect" [...] was then used to refer to the negative effect of financial regulations on investment, and the problems foreigner investors faced when getting their money out of China. It has also applied to other ideas such as leaving a service provider or social media network. [...] A book titled Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War Inside Iraq was written about the clandestine operation named after the song title by CIA–US Special Forces teams in Iraqi Kurdistan in the lead-up to the Iraq War.|$|E

"The Deep is {{the latest}} {{composition}} - and we're definitely talking composition here: <b>you</b> <b>can</b> even <b>check</b> <b>out</b> the score online at the sleazeart website, and very interesting it is too - by Kasper Toeplitz for KERNEL, his laptop trio with Eryck Abecassis and Wilfried Wendling. There's plenty {{of information about the}} group and their instrumentation (i.e. software, for the most part) at the sleazeart site, but no amount of background reading and scrutiny of KTT's pdfs (you'll need a smattering of French) <b>can</b> prepare <b>you</b> for the impressive 59'33" [...] of The Deep. Since Paul D. Miller and his chums made Xenakis suddenly hip a few years back, far too many musicians have been quick to claim some kind of Xenakis street cred, but very few compositions pack the clout of Bohor or La Légende d'Eer. Happy to report that The Deep is one of them. Toeplitz has a real feel not only for the large form - which is not simply a question of taking a short form and stretching it out: ask Eliane Radigue, who worked closely with KTT on the realisation of her Elemental II back in 2004 - but for the surface and texture of the sounds he and his playing partners choose to articulate it. Any self-respecting fan of Xenakis, Radigue or EAI for that matter (putting any anti-composer prejudice aside) should check this splendid work out at the earliest opportunity." ...|$|R

500|$|After riders {{board the}} sim-cars and the seat belts are fastened, {{the car that}} they {{designed}} will undergo four different tests: capability, efficiency, responsiveness, and power. In the capability test the car first connects to OnStar, then accelerates past a rain projection and skids out of control. Next, the continuing path disappears and the sim-car turns around to speed up again. A short time later, the sim-car makes a sharp left turn as a lighting bolt strikes. The car then passes by a futuristic city. Following the capability test, the results of which car designs scored {{the best in the}} test are displayed. The sim-car then begins the efficiency test. In the first part, the sim-cars are scanned for [...] "optimum eco-efficiency". The second test performs an aero-dynamic test on the vehicle. Finally, a [...] "hyper-spectrum imaging" [...] takes place. Again, after the test is complete, the best scores are displayed. The third test, responsiveness, is next. The sim-car accelerates around hairpin turns with laser-projected trees. It then enters a tunnel to encounter the 18-wheeler from the original version though it is now shown with lasers. When the vehicle exits the tunnel, the results for the responsiveness test are displayed and all of the test icons are displayed. The final test is power where the sim-car stops for a moment then accelerates through flashing purple arches to a wall with the ride's logo on it leading to the outside portion of the ride. Just after the ride exits the building, a picture of the guests is taken. As the sim-car's speed is increased, it makes a right turn, followed by a wide left, a straight section, and one final long left turn. When the test is complete, the vehicle returns to the loading station where the next riders board. Then, guests use their MagicBand, ticket, or design key that has their Chevrolet Custom Concept Vehicle that they made in the Design Studio to play games and make an ad in the [...] "Chevrolet Showroom." [...] In the showroom, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> also <b>check</b> <b>out</b> some of the newest vehicles Chevrolet has created in their lineup.

5000|$|Trenton Webb {{reviewed}} Dungeon Master Option: High-level Campaigns for Arcane magazine, rating it a 4 out of 10 overall. Webb {{comments that}} [...] "The AD&D system has a fundamental flaw: characters eventually become so potent {{that they can}} cope with anything the world (or alternative planes, or gods) can throw at them. High-level Campaigns seeks to remedy this, aiming to provide new inspiration and sensible controls for ... high-level campaigns." [...] He comments that the [...] "Adventures" [...] section is [...] "an attempt to reinvigorate the level-challenged DM" [...] and calls the [...] "True Dweomers" [...] section [...] "the obligatory additional spell list, with more 'earth-shaking' magic", and suggests that the [...] "High-level Characters" [...] section [...] "suggests extra abilities to give powerful people a truly heroic swagger". [...] Webb concludes that [...] "The Seven Maxims is the most essential section, though it contains little more than solid, common-sense rules that focus the minds of DMs and players", and that [...] "Similar strong-but-simple ideas are crystallised in Magical Duels which is a complex but calculated system with unique spell-on-spell combat rules that make for invigorating battles." [...] Webb contends that [...] "The new powers in High-level Characters fall into two kinds: style and substance. The style side is great, helping PCs to develop nuances of character, but the abilities in the substance part are really trivial things that will be overlooked by referees, but that players will attempt to transform into life-saving skills." [...] Referring to [...] "The Seven Maxims", [...] "Magical Duels", and [...] "High-Level Characters" [...] sections, he states that [...] "These three good chapters constitute {{the majority of the}} book and are recommended reading. The other four chapters, however, fall into the trap of so many TSR supplements and guides; namely that rather than replacing or refining rules, ever more tables and lists are heaped on top of the old." [...] Webb concludes his review by saying: [...] "High-level Campaigns is of interest but by no means essential. The Seven Maxims could add clarity, and Magical Duels might add excitement. Essentially, though, High-level Campaigns is an ideal present for a referee friend. That way <b>you</b> <b>can</b> borrow it, <b>check</b> <b>out</b> the good bits, and avoid that sinking feeling of having paid £12 for another earnest AD&D debate and yet another spell list.|$|R
