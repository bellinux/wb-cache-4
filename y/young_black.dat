5|$|The Birmingham campaign, or Birmingham {{movement}}, was {{a movement}} organized in early 1963 by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to {{bring attention to}} the integration efforts of African Americans in Birmingham, Alabama. Led by Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, Fred Shuttlesworth and others, the campaign of nonviolent direct action culminated in widely publicized confrontations between <b>young</b> <b>black</b> students and white civic authorities, and eventually led the municipal government to change the city's discrimination laws.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} reservation {{wages and}} durations of nonemployment for <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites. Selfreported reservation wages are compared {{for blacks and}} whites before and after controlling for indicators of labor demand such as received wages, weeks worked, or other personal characterlstics. The effects of these reservation wages on durations of nonemployment {{as well as on}} subsequent wages are analyzed as well. The results show that <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> seek jobs and wages which are comparable to those of young whites, but which are higher relative to what <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> obtain. On the other hand, <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> appear at least if not more likely to take specific low-skill jobs, albeit teporariiy. These reservation wages appear to have positive effects on nonemployment durations and subsequent wages for both groups, and explain up to a third of the higher nonemployment durations of <b>young</b> <b>blacks.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Young</b> <b>blacks</b> in America {{have had}} {{significant}} improvements in educational attainment since the early 1980 s. They are completing {{high school and college}} at higher rates than in the past, which has helped to mitigate some of the negative employment effects of past recessions. However, wages for <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> have declined since the late 1970 s, with rates for black men in particular decreasing significantly [...] even for those with college degrees. The wage data also continue to show that <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> have been hit harder than whites during the recent recession and incomplete recovery...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I provide some {{evidence}} {{on the question of}} whether the behavior of unemployed <b>young</b> <b>blacks,</b> whose reservation wages are relatively high and whose jobless spells are very lengthy, reflect rational maximizing choices. To do this, I use a simple income-maximizing job search model to imply employment probabilities and various elasticities which are compared to those which are actually observed for <b>young</b> <b>blacks.</b> The results show that, for reasonable discount rates, the employment probabilities implied by income-maximization are consistent with those observed for <b>young</b> <b>blacks.</b> The elasticities of reservation wages with respect to nonwage income that are implied by income-maximizing are also consistent with those estimated econometrically for this group. This was true despite the many assumptions embodied in this model whose validity fora sample of low-income youth is highly questionable. The evidence thus suggests that <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> are making economically rational choices by choosing high reservation wages and lengthy spells without jobs. ...|$|R

5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved.

And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Black tells Bletcher about Richard Alan Hance (Jeremy Roberts), {{a serial}} killer Black had helped to {{apprehend}} twenty years before. Hance was a disturbed Vietnam War veteran who marked his kills with half a playing card, a custom he picked up during his tours of duty. Black {{was one of a}} number of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who responded to an anonymous tip, leading them to Hance's location — however, the tip was called in by Hance himself and the raid became an ambush. Three agents were killed, and Black was cornered by Hance, who cut open his palm and nearly took Black's life before the <b>young</b> <b>Black</b> was able to overpower and arrest him.|$|E

The data show that education does make a difference. College-educated <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> have higher employment rates than less-educated blacks. However, blacks overall still suffer from lower employment rates than whites.

In May 1964, Boyd invited Robert F. Kennedy to the dedication of the campus chapel as the Kennedy Chapel, which was named after Robert's brother, U.S. President John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated in November 1963. During his visit, Robert Kennedy promoted the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was then under debate in the United States Senate.|$|E

In a flashback, we see a five-year-old Black being dared by his friends to knock the door of the same house; a man named Crocell (Dean Winters) answers and invites Black inside. Crocell is a Second World War veteran, and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black, telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living. Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war, and is dismayed when the <b>young</b> <b>Black</b> dismisses the possibility of ghosts.|$|E

That year, his father told him to come to Washington, D.C. and warned him that if he was elected to Congress he would be under constant political attack at home because the high court would soon have some important decisions dealing with school segregation, according to Justice Black biographer Roger Newman.
