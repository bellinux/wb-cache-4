IGN's Chris Carabott {{wrote that}} [...] "if last week's 'Not in Portland' didn't get <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the Lost hype train then for goodness' sake the equally outstanding 'Flashes Before Your Eyes' hopefully grabbed your attention." [...] Carabott {{went on to}} praise the on-screen chemistry of Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond) and Sonya Walger (Penelope), stating that [...] "their on screen chemistry makes the love between the two characters real and makes their inevitable breakup that much harder to handle." [...] He also complimented the scene between Desmond and Charles, saying that [...] "it's hard not to feel Desmond's heart crushed when Widmore denies him Penelope's hand in marriage." [...] Josh Spiegel, a writer for CinemaBlend.com, had similar praise. He said that for him [...] "it was a nice change of pace to not see Jack, Kate or Sawyer {{on the show and}} focus more on some of the lesser-known castaways." [...] Spiegel {{went on to say that}} the episode was [...] "fantastic". Mania.com's Stephen Lackey wrote that [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] was an [...] "episode has everything die hard LOST fans expect, riveting plot twists, foreshadowing, and as many questions as answers" ...|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, the band's {{style has}} been {{described}} as coming from [...] "the school of Cole Porter, favouring caustic wit over trivial personal problems,... achingly clever lyrics seesaw between superficial gloss, profound sentiment and the incomprehensibly bizarre." [...] Repeated lyrical motifs have become a distinct feature on recent albums. On [...] "My Baby's Taking Me Home" [...] off Lil' Beethoven (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, on the same album, [...] "Your Call Is Very Important To Us", uses a corporation style call-hold message: [...] "Your call is very important to us. [...] Please hold" [...] which is then sung with some additional words: [...] "At first she said your call is very important to us, then she said please, please hold." [...] The only other lyrics in the song are [...] "Red light", [...] "Green light", [...] "I'm Getting Mixed Signals" [...] and [...] "Sorry, I'm Going To Have To Put <b>You</b> <b>Back</b> <b>On</b> Hold". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with young miniature bull riders, particularly 12 year old Caleb Griego, they all had to start out with riding sheep, called mutton busting. It's an initiation almost all prospective young bull riders go through before they ever ride a steer or a bull. It is different than trying to stay on a half ton miniature bull. “Staying on a sheep is more about squeezing with your legs and leaning to the front,” Griego said. [...] "Riding a bull takes a lot more technique. You gotta focus on keeping your legs down and staying over the front the bull." [...] One of his friends added that he feels {{it is harder to}} ride a sheep because the sheep does not kick, and kicking can push <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the rope.|$|E
