500|$|With Kenny Greenberg and Jason Houser {{once again}} as producers, Matthew West began {{recording}} {{for his second}} studio album in early 2005. History, co-produced by West, was released on June 21, 2005 on Universal South Records. The first single off the album, [...] "Next Thing You Know", was released June 20, a day before the album's release. The theme of the title track [...] "History" [...] {{was inspired by a}} R music news headline [...] "Matthew West Makes History", in reference to his first album, Happy. [...] "It's not every day you read a headline like that with <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>in</b> it that calls you a history maker," [...] he said. Beginning on September 14, 2005, he kicked off the 30-city History 101 tour, his first headlining tour, which included guest musicians Shawn McDonald and Paul Wright. He then joined tobyMac's Winter Wonder Slam tour, beginning on December 1, 2005, along with John Reuben, BarlowGirl, GRITS, and DJ Maj. Two additional songs were released off History as singles: [...] "Only Grace" [...] and the title track [...] "History".|$|E

2500|$|Hayden kept a {{considerably}} lower national profile than conventional wisdom would suggest {{for someone who}} spent {{more than half a}} century in Washington, including 42 years in the Senate. This came in part due to a conversation he had with Maryland Congressman Fred Talbott soon after he arrived in Washington in 1912. Talbott told him, [...] "Son, there are two kinds of Congressmen—show horses and work horses. If you want to get <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>in</b> the papers, be a show horse. But if you want to gain the respect of your colleagues, don't do it. Be a work horse." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1918, Isac {{was seeking}} to obtain an amicable {{solution}} to the ethnic conflicts rekindled by the war, {{in the context of}} Austria–Hungary's dissolution, the Aster Revolution, and the advent of a Hungarian Democratic Republic. As early as 1917, Isac signed an open letter, published by Világ, in which he rallied with pacifist thinker Oszkár Jászi (who became Minister of Nationalities in the Aster Revolution), arguing: [...] "For us of the [...] nationalities <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>in</b> recent months has sounded like a reassuring chime of bells, your name has signified to us vigorous defense, and through your writings democratic Hungary has made its voice heard." [...] Historian György Litván notes that this was the type of messages motivating Jászi to [...] "stubbornly" [...] believe that his Danubian Confederation projects could win support from all sides, even though other reactions were already showing their practical limitations and their unpopularity.|$|E
