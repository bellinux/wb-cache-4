25|$|Around 30 que {{have survived}} {{to the present}} day. Most {{of them are in}} Sichuan; a few in Henan and Shandong. According to Ann Paludan, this {{distribution}} may be explained by two reasons. First, there may have been more stone que produced in these regions in the first place, due to the ready availability of stone and the tradition of stone-working craft; meanwhile elsewhere wooden que were built, which have not survived. Second, Sichuan has more remote, hard to access areas, which is exactly where many of the Han Dynasty que have managed to survive. The locations around the imperial capitals, where the Eastern Han imperial mausolea were located, saw more intensive level of destruction over the almost 2000 <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> elapsed since that era, and the que constructed there did not have a chance to survive.|$|E
25|$|In a dark, private lair in a tower {{high above}} the park, the Phantom (now {{revealed}} as Phantasma's owner and mastermind) interacts with an automaton that resembles Christine ("The Aerie"). In spite of the <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> passed and his many successes, the Phantom still longs {{to be reunited with}} her ("Til I Hear You Sing"). Meg intrudes and presses the Phantom for feedback on her performance, but he is distracted by his thoughts of Christine and dismisses Meg as an annoyance. Madame Giry is irritated that the Phantom still seems to think only of Christine after all that she and Meg have done for him over the years. Giry recounts how she and Meg helped smuggle him out of Paris and to a ship departing from Calais, on which they escaped to America. Ignoring her, the Phantom summons Miss Fleck, who appears with two other freak show performers, Dr. Gangle and Mr. Squelch. The Phantom has them dispatch a letter to Christine, inviting her to come and perform at Phantasma ("Giry confronts The Phantom/Til' I Hear You Sing (Reprise)").|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{wrote that}} [...] "Throughout the album, Madonna proves that she's a terrific singer whose voice has {{improved}} over the years." [...] He added, [...] "Not {{one of the}} tracks is second-rate, and the best songs on Something to Remember rank among the best pop music of the '80s and '90s". Neil Strauss of The New York Times felt all the songs on the album [...] "cohere better than a greatest-hits package would" [...] and [...] "they tell a story of their own, of a voice and attitude that have hardened in the dozen <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> elapsed between the bubble-gum-chomping innocence of 1983's 'Crazy for You' and the tortured torch singing of the new 'You'll See'." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "By placing her greatest-hit ballads ('Live to Tell', 'Crazy for You', 'Take a Bow', etc.) in a new context—that is, separated from her more attention-getting dance music—Madonna reinvigorates them, which is just what a good best-of compilation is supposed to do. The three new songs 'You'll See', 'One More Chance', and a wonderfully eerie version of Marvin Gaye's 'I Want You' are consumer enticements that just add to the allure." ...|$|E

[...] Consequently, modern day attempts to reach the hallowed mark by George Brett (.390 in 1980) and Tony Gwynn (.394 in the strike-shortened 1994 season) have generated considerable hype among fans and in the media. [...] Of the seventeen players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have batted [...]400 in a season, fourteen have been elected and two were elected on the first ballot. [...] Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10MLB seasons, and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months. These requirements leave two players ineligible – Barnes and Turner – who did not play in at least 10seasons. [...] Shoeless Joe Jackson is ineligible for the Hall of Fame because he was permanently banned from baseball in 1921 for his involvement in the Black Sox Scandal.|$|E

2500|$|The label [...] "25" [...] (as {{distinct}} from [...] "xxv") {{is used as}} follows: Within a Metonic cycle, years that are 11 years apart have epacts that differ by one day. A month beginning on a date having labels xxiv and xxv impacted together has either 29 or 30 days. If the epacts 24 and 25 both occur within one Metonic cycle, then the new (and full) moons would fall on the same dates for these two years. This is possible for the real moon but is inelegant in a schematic lunar calendar; the dates should repeat only after 19 years. To avoid this, in <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> epacts 25 and with a Golden Number larger than 11, the reckoned new moon falls on the date with the label 25 rather than xxv. Where the labels 25 and xxv are together, {{there is no problem}} since they are the same. This does not move the problem to the pair [...] "25" [...] and [...] "xxvi", because the earliest epact 26 could appear would be in year 23 of the cycle, which lasts only 19 years: there is a saltus lunae in between that makes the new moons fall on separate dates.|$|E
2500|$|As President of the Council or Prime Minister, Thiers {{kept for}} himself {{the title of}} Foreign Minister. His most notable {{accomplishment}} was to obtain from Britain the return of Napoleon's ashes from Saint Helena. The idea was particularly pleasing to Thiers, because he had just begun writing {{a history of the}} Consulate and Empire, in twenty volumes. Rather than making the request public, he wrote to a personal English friend, Lord Clarendon, {{who was a member of}} the British government, saying: [...] "to keep a cadaver as a prisoner is not worthy of you, nor is it possible on the part of a government such as yours. The restitution of these remains is the final act of putting behind us the fifty <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> passed, and will be the seal placed on our reconciliation, and our close alliance." [...] The British Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, considered and accepted the request. The transfer was opposed by some in the French parliament, including Lamartine, who feared that it would stir republican sentiment in France, but it was welcomed by the population. A warship was dispatched to Saint Helena, and Thiers worked on the details of the design of the tomb and the plan of the parade that would carry it to the tomb, constructed within Les Invalides. The return of the ashes was a huge success, attracting enormous crowds in Paris. But by the time it took place Thiers was no longer in the government.|$|E
