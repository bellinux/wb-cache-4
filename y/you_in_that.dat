Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>that.</b> I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E

"Yes, great king, a {{transgression}} overcame <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> {{you were}} so foolish, so muddle-headed, and so unskilled as to kill your father — a righteous man, a righteous king — {{for the sake of}} sovereign rulership. But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma, we accept your confession. For it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma & Discipline of the noble ones when, seeing a transgression as such, one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 2016 ASEAN Summit, Duterte and U.S. President Barack Obama {{planned to}} meet with each other. The United States said that President Obama planned to discuss the 2,400 Filipinos who died during Duterte's war on drugs. Duterte criticized the planned topic of the meeting, saying, [...] "I am no American puppet. I am the {{president}} of a sovereign country and I am not answerable to anyone except the Filipino people. You must be respectful. Do not just throw away questions and statements. Son of a whore, I will curse <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> forum." [...] The vulgar insult prompted the White House to cancel the meeting instead. During a press conference at the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit in China, President Obama discussed the cancellation of the meeting, saying: [...] "I always {{want to make sure that}} if I'm having a meeting, that it's actually productive and we're getting something done." [...] Obama and Duterte later met informally.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara {{interpreted}} the words [...] "knowing {{the mind of}} the most High" [...] in [...] to mean that Balaam knew how to tell the exact moment when God was angry. [...] The Gemara taught that this was related to what Micah meant (in [...] in the haftarah for the parashah) when he told the Israelites (quoting God): [...] "O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; [...] [...] [...] that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord." [...] The Gemara taught that by the words [...] "that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord," [...] God meant to say to the Israelites, [...] "You should know how many acts of charity I performed for <b>you,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> I did not become angry all that time, in the days of wicked Balaam; for had I become angry at that time, no Israelite would have remained alive or been spared." [...] And the Gemara indicated that this is why Balaam told Balak in [...] "How can I curse whom God has not cursed? or how shall I become angry, when the Lord has not become angry?" [...] For Balaam knew that God was not angry at the Israelites. [...] The Gemara thus concluded that for all of the time of the Balaam story, God had not been angry.|$|E
2500|$|Tim Sendra from Allmusic said: [...] "The {{title of}} Carla Bruni's 2008 album, Comme Si de Rien N'Etait (As If Nothing Had Happened), {{is a good}} joke. After all, since her last album Bruni fell into a {{whirlwind}} romance with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and ended up marrying him and becoming the [...] "First Lady" [...] of France. That's a pretty big [...] "something", and indeed it isn't often that the romance of a singer and a president is chronicled on record as it is here—though {{you need to be}} fluent in French to catch the details, since only her cover of '50s pop classic [...] "You Belong to Me" [...] (which is a witty nod to a semi-scandalous trip the couple took to Egypt and other exotic locales before they were wed) is in English. You don't need to know exactly what's going on lyrically, because the intimate-sounding arrangements on the ballads and the light and breezy sound of the more uptempo tunes clue <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> there is romance in the air. Along with the nice arrangements, the best thing about the album is Bruni's intimate and sultry singing. She can purr like a Gainsbourg girl, strut sassily, or croon quite tenderly—sometimes all within the same song. Most of the time she sounds like you always hoped a '60s French bombshell would sound but never quite did (think Bardot or Birkin). Not surprisingly, Bruni appears totally in control throughout the album, which could be down to her having written almost all of the songs herself, or could be down to her new position in the world. Whatever the reason, it makes for quite an improvement over her previous album, No Promises, and fulfills the promise of her charming debut, Quelqu'un M'a Dit. It is probably the best album released by a [...] "First Lady", but beyond that, it's a pleasant, sometimes compelling album by a singer/songwriter with some stories to tell and a lovely way of telling them." [...] BBC said: [...] "Bruni's disc may not win her new fans in the stolidly un-French speaking UK. But removed from the context of her very public private life, this is a charming album." [...] The Telegraph said: [...] "The Premiere Dame may have a colourful past, but her music has always been as classically chic and subtly sexy as her Christian Dior wardrobe." [...] SFGate said: [...] "Even before she married French president Nicolas Sarkozy, Carla Bruni had a thing for prominent men such as Mick Jagger and Donald Trump. So even though the lyrics on her third album, [...] "Comme Si de Rien N'Etait" [...] ("As If Nothing Happened"), were written before her latest romantic coup, it's hard to separate content from context, especially when, in the song [...] "Tu Es Ma Came", the singer describes her lover as [...] "more dangerous than Colombian white". But the mild-mannered music hardly matches the exuberance of lines like that. Slathered with strings, horns, and folk and blues guitars, Bruni's new album is not quite as charming as her 2003 premiere, [...] "Quelqu'un M'a Dit". Still, songs such as [...] "L'Amoureuse" [...] and [...] "Déranger Les Pierres" [...] are quite beautiful, and [...] "Salut Marin", a tribute to her late brother, might represent one of Bruni's finest recorded moments yet." ...|$|E
