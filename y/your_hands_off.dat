500|$|According to Vanderbilt's All-Southern halfback and 1924 captain-elect Gil Reese, [...] "He {{would never}} let them jump on me. Whenever anyone would {{threaten}} me, Bomar was always right there to say 'Keep <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> that boy'. They always did, too. Bomar always looked after me, and he always called back to me when we started on end runs. No one could run interference like Bomar." [...] Bomar and Reese were on an all-time Vanderbilt team in the school's 1934 yearbook, and Bomar was chosen for an Associated Press Southeast Area all-time football team for the era from 1920 to 1969.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have given}} [...] "Tennis the Menace" [...] {{generally}} positive reviews. Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel listed it at number nine on his 2004 {{list of the}} show's [...] "Top 10 Sporting Episodes". Nancy Basile of About.com wrote in her 2003 review that {{the plot of the}} episode [...] "allowed us to see more secondary characters than usual. It also gave Springfield a sense of community that we sometimes don't get in recent seasons. Though the blatant use of guest stars has sweeps written all over it, the tennis stars were funny and able to make fun of themselves. Homer had some wonderful lines, too, such as, 'Take <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> me. [...] They feel like salad tongs.' [...] Overall, a very funny episode." [...] In July 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Agassi's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show.|$|E
500|$|After {{landing at}} Toronto International Airport on May 3, 1969, Hendrix and Terry {{were the last}} to exit the plane. Ruffino was {{carrying}} Hendrix's bags, and he placed them on a counter at the customs station. An agent immediately chastised him, shouting: [...] "If that's not yours, keep <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> it", to which Ruffino replied: [...] "I work for him." [...] The agent repeated the order before asking Hendrix if they were his bags; he confirmed that they were. At 9:30a.m., authorities detained Hendrix after finding {{a small amount of}} what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. A mobile lab was set up to determine what had been found, and at 1:30p.m. Metro police detective Harry Midgley arrested him for illegal possession of narcotics. After being booked and photographed, he was released on $10,000 bail and required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. [...] While they awaited the lab results, Stickells attempted to make contact with Hendrix's manager, Mike Jeffery, who had traveled to Hawaii and was unavailable.|$|E

500|$|Cooder {{recorded}} most of Election Special at Drive-By Studios, {{the living}} room of engineer Martin Pradler's house in North Hollywood. Sessions also took place at Wireland Studios in Chatsworth, California. Pradler later mixed and mastered the album at both recording locations. The album was produced entirely by Cooder. He performed most of the album himself, playing bass, guitar, and mandolin. His son Joachim contributed on drums, and session musician Arnold McCuller sung harmony vocals on the song [...] "Take <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>off</b> It". At Drive-By Studios, Cooder recorded songs in a series of unrehearsed, single-take performances, which he felt helped him channel the songs' respective characters more efficiently. He later said of his approach to developing the songs, [...] "The way I think these songs can work is if you don't ponder over it too hard, because the tunes wanna have a spontaneous-combustion effect. What I want to do is get a certain attitude in the voice, and I can only do that once. By take two, I'm startin' to think about it. By take three, I'm startin' to map it out – it's gone. It's spoiled, y'see? So I need to get through this fast." [...] He first recorded the song [...] "The Wall Street Part of Town" [...] in November 2011. On June 7, 2012, the album's release was announced for a date in August, intended to be a week before the 2012 Republican National Convention.|$|E
500|$|Titled {{after the}} [...] "drinking the Kool-Aid" [...] metaphor, [...] "Kool-Aid" [...] has a dark {{electric}} blues style, noir musical vibes, and lyrics about the politically misguided {{lower middle class}} who support Republican {{tax cuts for the}} rich. The song's narrative follows a young American who accepts the Bush administration's pro-war stance, heads off to a foreign land willing to fight any person of color, and returns to his home jobless. According to writer James C. McKinley, Jr., the song continues a theme Cooder established on Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down: [...] "the idea of poor whites who have been let down by the politicians they have supported." [...] It also paraphrases the lyrics to the Western swing standard [...] "Cocaine Blues", and touches on the controversial stand-your-ground law, which Cooder viewed as [...] "new Jim Crow laws – the stand-your-ground law is already responsible for about 80 shooting deaths of African Americans." [...] "The 90 and the 9" [...] repurposes the gospel hymn of the same name and the worker songs of Joe Hill with apocalyptic themes, an anti-war narrative, and a depiction of modern union workers as part of the lower 99% of income distribution in the US. Cooder was inspired to write the song by military recruitment of high schoolers in his native Los Angeles. [...] "Take <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>off</b> It" [...] has a defiant tone, prominent guitar, and lyrics that rousingly defend constitutional rights.|$|E
500|$|The {{day that}} a new poll showed McCain five points ahead in the state, Bush allied himself on stage with a {{marginal}} and controversial veterans activist named J. Thomas Burch, who accused McCain of having [...] "abandoned the veterans" [...] on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues: [...] "He came home from Vietnam and forgot us." [...] Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush complained was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary and many Republicans thought comparing Bush's truthfulness to Bill Clinton's dishonesty was distasteful smear by McCain." [...] An unidentified party began a semi-underground smear campaign against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, audience plants, and the like. [...] These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh; this misrepresentation {{was thought to be}} an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central), but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. [...] The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with these attacks; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls. During a break in a debate, Bush put his hand on McCain's arm and reiterated that he had no involvement in the attacks; McCain replied, [...] "Don't give me that shit. And take <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> me." ...|$|E
