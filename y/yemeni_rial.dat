50|$|One {{reason for}} khat being {{cultivated}} in Yemen so widely {{is the high}} income it provides for farmers. Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from cultivating khat was about 2.5 million <b>Yemeni</b> <b>rials</b> per hectare, while fruits brought only 0.57 million rials per hectare.

He was wanted by the FBI, Interpol, and the United States Department of State, which had offered 5 million dollars (approximately 1 billion <b>Yemeni</b> <b>Rials)</b> to anyone with information about him.

50|$|As Yemen progressed, it {{developed}} its own legal currency. After the union between the North (the Yemen Arab Republic) and the South (the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen) in 1990, both the northern rial {{and the southern}} dinar remained legal tender during a transitional period, with 1 dinar exchanged for 26 rials. On 11 June 1996, the dinar was withdrawn from circulation. In 1993, the first coins were issued for the Republic of Yemen. The value of the <b>Yemeni</b> <b>rial</b> against the United States dollar dropped significantly compared to 12.01 rials per dollar in early the 1990s. Since the mid-1990s the <b>Yemeni</b> <b>rial</b> has been freely convertible. Though it dropped from YER 20 to approximately YER 215 against the U.S. dollar since then, the rial has been stable for several years. However, since 2010 the Central Bank of Yemen had to intervene several times, resulting in a serious decline of foreign reserves. By late 2013, the Economic Intelligence Unit expects reserves to decline to approximately 1.3 months of imports over the following years, despite information that Saudi Arabia would transfer $1 billion to the Yemeni Central Bank.|$|E

30|$|Locally {{contracted}} voucher distributors identify {{eligible women}} in the community, provide them with information {{on the importance of}} safe motherhood services and sell vouchers to clients at a heavily subsidised price of 200 <b>Yemeni</b> <b>rials</b> (less than one US dollar). A proportion of the vouchers distributed (around 15 %) are currently fully subsidised for those who cannot afford this low fee. The voucher provides free access to the full package of safe motherhood services, including four antenatal care (ANC) visits, safe delivery including management of complications and caesarean section, two postnatal care (PNC) visits and postnatal family planning services. Free transport to a health facility for delivery and, in case of a complication, a contribution towards costs of accommodation and food for a chaperone are also included in the package. A second type of voucher for family planning is distributed for free and entitles women to a free family planning method of her choice, follow up for any complications and removal if and when required.|$|R
40|$|Petroleum subsidy {{reform is}} {{increasingly}} {{seen as an}} opportunity for consolidating public finances and fostering sustainable economic development. Yemen, as the country with the lowest per capita income in the group of countries {{with a high level of}} energy subsidies, started to reduce subsidies in 2010 and is discussing further options for reform. The results of this paper support a comprehensive petroleum subsidy reform in Yemen. Economic growth is projected to accelerate between 0. 1 and 0. 8 percentage points annually as a result of reform. Yet, the design of the reform is critically important, especially for the poor. Outcomes of alternative reform scenarios range from an increase in poverty of 2 to 6 percentage points. A promising strategy combines subsidy reduction with direct transfers of 13, 800 to 19, 700 <b>Yemeni</b> <b>rials</b> annually to the poorest 30 percent of households and enhanced public investments. Investments should focus on the utilities, transport, trade, and construction sectors to integrate economic spaces and create the platform for a restructuring of agricultural, industrial, and service value chains, which should encourage private sector led and job creating growth in the medium term.

This paper investigates the likely implications of declining oil production on Yemenâ€™s equilibrium exchange rate, and discusses policy options to ensure a smooth transition to a non-oil economy.
