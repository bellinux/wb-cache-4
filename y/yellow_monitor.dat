50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of reptile native to the country, ranging from pit vipers to monitor lizards. Some of the more prominent examples include the Bengal monitor, Gloydius himalayanus (a pit viper), the elongated tortoise (Indotestudo elongata), Trimeresurus albolabris septentrionalis, and the <b>yellow</b> <b>monitor.</b> Although the above are found elsewhere in southeast Asia, {{there are quite a}} few reptile species unique to the country, including Sitana fusca and Cyrtodactylus nepalensis.Sitana sivalensis, Japalura tricarinata, the Annapurna ground skink (Scincella capitanea), the lidless skink (Asymblepharus nepalensis), geckos (Cyrtodactylus martinstolli), Shah’s bamboo pit viper (Trimeresurus karanshahi) and the Tibetan pit viper (Gloydius strauchi) are also reptiles found in Nepal.|$|E
50|$|Bengal {{monitors}} {{are usually}} solitary and usually {{found on the}} ground, although the young are often seen on trees. V. b. nebulosus has a greater propensity for tree climbing. The two sympatric species Bengal and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Monitor</b> partially separated their habitat as Bengal Monitor prefers Forest over agricultural areas. Bengal monitors shelter in burrows they dig or crevices in rocks and buildings, whilst clouded monitors prefer tree hollows. Both races will make use of abandoned termite mounds. Bengal monitors, like other varanids, show true sleep at night and are diurnal, becoming active around 6 AM and bask in the morning sun. During winter, in the colder parts of their distribution range, they may take shelter and go {{through a period of}} reduced metabolic activity. They are not territorial, and may change their range seasonally in response to food availability.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to determine if, in a mild autumn when aphid numbers were high, the recommended aphicide treatments derived from earlier trial results were adequate to control BYDV in autumn-sown barley. Investigations on spring barley at Oak Park, 1990 - 1993, showed Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV) can cause reductions in grain yield of up to 1. 4 t/ha. These studies indicated that the risk of infection increased with lateness of sowing date. They also suggested that control of the disease might best be obtained by applying an aphicide at the 4 -leaf stage of growth. The objectives of this investigation were to determine the growth stage at which aphicide should be applied in order to obtain best control of BYDV and to compare the effectiveness of systemic and contact aphicides in controlling the disease. Aphid numbers, species and infectivity with virus <b>yellows</b> were <b>monitored</b> in 20 beet crops between May and July over the period 1990 - 1999. Monitoring was undertaken to provide growers with an aphid-spray warning in order to minimise the risk of virus yellows and to establish aphid-thresholds which if exceeded would necessitate the spraying of crops with insecticide.

In the case of eels these methods have been employed in a variety of marine and estuarine studies. However, telemetric studies of eels in fresh water have been much more limited. Radiotelemetry was used to monitor movements of Anguilla rostrata in Lake Champlain, Vermont, on the US/Canadian border, and of Anguilla anguilla in a small Spanish lake.

40|$|AbstractNowadays {{the higher}} {{occurrence}} of cereal insects is observed. Until recently {{it has been}} considered to be of little economic relevance. Today cereal insects develop better, thanks to the climate warming, simplification of agricultural techniques and extensive farming in large areas. One of the most pervasive species is leaf miners from the Agromyzidae family, which larvae feed on inner side of the cereal leaves. In Poland {{there is more than}} a dozen species of leaf miners (Walczak, 1995). They may occur locally in large numbers, and cause substantial damage to the crops which reduce quality and quantity of the harvest. Larvae of the leaf miner feed on the parenchyma, causing damages (so-called mines). Effective methodology of fighting the insects with chemical means have not been developed yet. Studies of integrated methods of cereals protection carried out so far, have shown that a good practical method of chemical signaling is to control the number of adults trapped on <b>yellow</b> traps. <b>Monitoring</b> of cereal leaf miner flights in winter wheat was carried out in Słupia Wielka and Baborówko (Greater Poland Voivodeship) in the 2011 / 2012 and 2012 / 2013 growing seasons. Yellow traps were placed above the tops of wheat during vegetation period. The number of damaged wheat stems was recorded. Fluctuations in weather conditions during the research affected the dynamics of leaf miner flies considerably. The most common species were: Chromatomyia nigra (Ztt.), Chromatomyia fuscula (Ztt.) and Poemyza superciliosa (Ztt.) ...|$|R

The parasitic wasp Encarsia diaspidicola (Silvestri) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) was brought from Western Samoa into a quarantine containment facility in Hawaii for evaluation and potential release against white peach scale. E. diaspidicola was considered an ideal biological control candidate for release in Hawaii because it is reportedly highly host specific. Host range testing in quarantine with several exotic diaspidids and related taxa, including a native palm scale, indicated that E. dispidicola is unlikely to attack non-target species or cause {{harm to the environment}} if released for control of white peach scale in Hawaii. The Hawaii Department of Agriculture and USDA APHIS issued permits for its release.

30|$|Two {{wavelengths}} {{are considered}} for the optical simulations [15]: one representing the blue LED light (460  nm), {{and the other one}} the converted yellow light (565  nm). It is assumed that only the blue light is absorbed by the phosphor particles, therefore the extinction coefficient of the phosphor particles is set to zero for 565  nm and to 1 × 10 − 3 for λ = 460  nm. Both the blue LED light and the yellow converted light are scattered throughout the CCE. The simulation of this scattering process is based on the scattering model of Mie and considers the particle size distribution of the phosphor as well as the optical properties of both the matrix material and the phosphor. The refractive indexes of the silicone and the phosphor are kept constant at 1.4 and 1.63, respectively, for both wavelengths. Similarly, the mean diameter of the phosphor particles is kept constant at 7.8  μm {{with a standard deviation of}} 4.2  μm. The irradiance distributions both for the blue LED light and the <b>yellow</b> conversion-light are <b>monitored</b> by a detector, which has a hemispherical shape and is centrically placed above the LED package, see Figure  1.|$|R
40|$|Various colors {{have been}} used as Visual Cues to trap insect pests. For example, <b>yellow</b> traps for <b>monitoring</b> and control of the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis) have been in use for a very long time. However, the {{chromatic}} cue of using color traps has never been meticulously investigated. In this study, the spectral sensitivities of the photoreceptors in the compound eyes of B. dorsalis were measured intracellularly, and the theory of receptor quantum catch was applied to study the chromatic cue of fly attracting. Responses to five wavelength categories with peak wavelengths of 370, 380, 490, and 5 10 nm, and one with dual peaks at 350 and 490 nm were recorded. Based on spectral sensitivities, six colored papers were chosen to test the color preference of the fly, and an additional UV preference test was done to confirm the effect of the UV stimuli. It was concluded that UV and green stimuli (spectra: 300 - 380 nm and 500 - 570 nm) would enhance the attractiveness of a colored paper to the oriental fruit fly, and blue stimuli (380 - 500 nm) would diminish the attractiveness.

40|$|Abstract. There {{has been}} a long history for the ice {{disaster}} in the <b>Yellow</b> River, and <b>monitoring</b> methods at present relatively backward. Therefore, an effective real-time monitoring method is especially important. Currently we cannot get some important parameters, for example the ice density, which is needed by the hazard prediction model of early warning accurately and validly. This paper will put forward a new method which is to for access the ice density based on the modified C-V model. By Using the C-V model which is joined with gradient information and accelerating factor, we can identify the target and segment the ice images of Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River which is collected by the UAV. The Yellow River regime is not only more complicated but also have the characteristics of high sediment content. Several sections of Yellow River’s water is muddy. Target is difficult to identify. In addition to this the ice shape is very irregular. Therefor by using of the traditional image edge detection technology and original C-V model can fail to effectively identify ice. Nevertheless, the improved C-V model mentioned above can solve such problems effectively. The experimental results also prove that the algorithm is robust and effective...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop an {{approach}} to use publicly accessible satellite imagery to quantify the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the Yellow River. The suspended sediment in the river affects to the hydrologic, geomorphologic, and ecologic functioning of river floodplains. Commonly used sampling methods are time consuming, labor intensive, and provide only point data. Current studies using re- mote sensing have focused mild waters (e. g. coastal, estuarine, lagoon, lakes and reservoirs) from where the method developed might not be appropriate for highly turbid inland waters. A laboratory spectrum experiment was conducted to investigate the reflective nature of sediment-laden water {{and the impact of}} sediment types on the reflectance. A spectral mixing algorithm based on a spectral linear mixture modeling approach was developed to estimate SSC from reflectance. We found that the models based on the spectral mixing algorithm were able to estimate SSC as high as 20 g/l. A field survey with on-site spectral and SSC measurements was conducted between the river channel and Sanmenxia reservoir on the Yellow River. The results confirmed an exponential relationship between SSC and reflectance. A single-band model was built to estimate SSC using band setting same as the band 4 of Landsat 7 image (760 - 900 nm) (R 2 = 0. 92, RMSE= 0. 241 g/l). The application of the spectral mixing approach to the on-site showed that the models based on the spectral mixing algorithm were performed as better as the single band exponential model (R 2 = 0. 86, RMSE= 0. 280 g/l) but the valid range for application was improved from 1. 99 g/l to 347 g/l. The spectral mixing algorithm was also applied to the Landsat- 7 ETM+ data for remote sense the SSC in the Yellow River. For calibration and validation purpose, the daily SSC measured by the <b>Yellow</b> River Hydrological <b>Monitoring</b> System were associated with Landsat- 7 ETM+ imagery from 1999 to 2010. The results showed that the model based on the spectral mixing algorithm could obtain a more promising relationship (R = 0. 71) between SSC and reflectance than the conventional regression of a particular band (max R = 0. 62). This study provides remote sensing method to estimate SSC with ready-to-use parameters for using Landsat- 7 ETM+ imagery in the Yellow River. It could also provide spectral reference for remote sensing SSC in other highly turbid inland rivers...|$|R
