40|$|In {{tropical}} region, {{in upper}} layers, soils having red or yellow coloration are generally found and are denominated <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils.</b> They {{are rich in}} aluminum hydroxides and ferric hydrates that give an elevated mechanic resistance. When the <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> are used as a construction material in the structural pavement, the exceptional mechanical characteristic reduced the cost over 50 % when associated with the sub-base and base layers, or over 25 % when the <b>lateritic</b> <b>soil</b> is treated with cement.

40|$|<b>Lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> {{are formed}} in the tropics through {{weathering}} processes that favor the formation of iron, aluminum, manganese and titanium oxides. These processes break down silicate minerals into clay minerals such as kaolinite and illite. Iron and aluminum oxides are prominent in <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils,</b> and with the seasonal fluctuation of the water table, these oxides result in the reddish-brown color that is seen in <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils.</b> These soils have served {{for a long time}} as major and sub-base materials for the construction of most highways and walls of residential houses in tropical and sub-tropical countries of the world.

40|$|Of recent, the {{attention}} of most researchers is shifting towards the optimization of building materials by using local contents; the use of indigenous materials; and local industrial by-products unique and abundant in certain localities. This study therefore explored ways in which <b>lateritic</b> <b>soil</b> could be utilised in hollow sandcrete block production in Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria. Sandcrete blocks were made with <b>lateritic</b> <b>soil</b> taken from different sources replacing the conventional fine aggregate (local river sand) in steps of 10 % up to 60 %. Their compressive strengths determined to check for conformity with standard sandcrete block as specified in the Nigerian National Building Code (2006) {{with a view to}} determine the acceptable percentage replacement.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the physical, chemical, and mineralogical composition of <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> in order to use these soils as potential commercial products for industrial application in the future. Five <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> derived from various parent materials in Taiwan, including andesite, diluvium, shale stone, basalt, and Pleistocene deposit, were collected from the Bt 1 level of soil samples. Based on the analyses, the Tungwei soil is an alfisol, whereas other <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> are ultisol. Higher pH value of Tungwei is attributed to the large amounts of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +. Loupi and Pingchen soils would be the older <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> because of the lower active iron ratio. For the iron minerals, the magnetic iron oxides such as major amounts of magnetite and maghemite were found for Tamshui and Tungwei <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils,</b> respectively. Lepidocrocite was only found in Soka soil and intermediate amounts of goethite were detected for Loupi and Pingchen soils. After Mg-saturated and K-saturated processes, major amounts of mixed layer were observed in Loupi and Soka soils, whereas the montmorillonite was only detected in Tungwei soil.

Index properties of the tested <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> revealed them as mostly well graded, comprising both cohesive (silt and clay) and cohesionless (sand and gravel) soil fraction. The geotechnical analyses on the studied <b>lateritic</b> <b>soil</b> revealed a strong compressive strength with a relatively sound dry density which could guarantee a good durability in resulting bricks made from these soil materials. Further test on the strength and durability of the compressed earth bricks (CEBs) made from these <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> revealed a brick with compressive strength ranging between 6. 33 and 15. 57 MPa which is considered to be of good strength coupled with its sound durability strength established over a period of more than one year under a complete cycle of weather and seasonal conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work {{reported}} here is to describe the chemical characters of the manganese nodules produced within the <b>lateritic</b> <b>soil</b> of the Ryukyu Islands. The major and minor components of the manganese nodules, such as manganese,iron, silica, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, copper and nickel were analyzed, and also crystal structure were observed by mean of X-ray diffraction method. The following results were obtained. The characteristics of manganese nodules in the <b>lateritic</b> <b>soil</b> is that they contain ll. 6 %～ 24 - 9 % of manganese dioxide 18. 2 % on the average, which is smaller than in other manganese ore.

40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> to remove {{fluoride}} from {{water has been}} studied. Important issues considered in the study include {{the relation between the}} mineral composition of soils and their ability to remove fluoride, the effect of thermal treatment of the soil on fluoride removal; the predominant fluoride containing species remain in the treated water and the possible mechanism of fluoride removal by <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils.</b> The fluoride removal capacity of thermally treated <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> used in this study is in the range of 22 to 47 mmol/kg. The maximum capacity of 47 mmol/kg was obtained for RGS fired at 500 o C. The results obtained indicate that there is strong correlation between fluoride removal capacity and gibbsite content of the soil. From this it can be concluded that gibbsite is the active component in <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> that strongly influence the fluoride removal capability. Speciation analysis reveals that at low initial fluoride concentrations the dissolution of gibbsite is facilitated by the adsorption of fluoride onto gibbsite. This may result in the formation of aluminum fluoro complexes in water. DOI: [URL]...|$|R
