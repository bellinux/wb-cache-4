Look up the records and see what becomes of the shortstops who get too old to cover all the ground between second base and the foul line. A lot of them camp on third for a while. And why shouldn't they? A man can play third when he can't play short. That's a cinch.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to directing some television work, Bogdanovich returned to acting with a recurring guest {{role on the}} cable television series The Sopranos, playing Dr. Melfi's psychotherapist, also later directing a fifth-season episode. He also voiced the analyst of Bart Simpson's therapist in an episode of The Simpsons, and appeared as himself in the [...] "Robots Versus Wrestlers" [...] episode of How I Met Your Mother along with Arianna Huffington and Will Shortz.

[...] In 2004, Joe Higgins {{described}} Ahern's response to questions as [...] "like playing handball against a hay stack. <b>You</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> dull thud but the ball never comes back to you". Ahern features as one of the main characters portrayed in spoof radio comic strips Gift Grub and Nob Nation. The fortnightly magazine The Phoenix featured [...] "De Diary of a Nortsoide Taoiseach", a satirical column written from Ahern's point of view in a phonetic transliteration of his broad north Dublin accent. His idiosyncratic delivery made Ahern a doyen of satirists and impersonators, from Dermot Morgan (in the 90's) to Mario Rosenstock (RTÉ 2 TV, 2012). Ahern was satirised in a spoof publication Bertie's little book of ethics.|$|E

Should that subduing talisman, the cross, be shattered, the frenzied madness of the ancient warriors, that insane Berserk rage of which Nordic bards have spoken and sung so often, will once more burst into flame. This talisman is fragile, and the day will come when it will collapse miserably. Then the ancient stony gods will rise from the forgotten debris and rub the dust of a thousand years from their eyes, and finally Thor with his giant hammer will jump up and smash the Gothic cathedrals. (...)"Do not smile at my advice – {{the advice of a}} dreamer who warns you against Kantians, Fichteans, and philosophers of nature. Do not smile at the visionary who anticipates the same revolution {{in the realm of the}} visible as has taken place in the spiritual. Thought precedes action as lightning precedes thunder. German thunder is of true Germanic character; it is not very nimble, but rumbles along ponderously. Yet, it will come and when <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> crashing such as never before has been heard in the world's history, then you know that the German thunderbolt has fallen at last. At that uproar the eagles of the air will drop dead, and lions in the remotest deserts of Africa will hide in their royal dens. A play will be performed in Germany which will make the French Revolution look like an innocent idyll." ...|$|E
