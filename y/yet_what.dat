5|$|When {{the group}} {{arrives at the}} picturesque hotel, they find an {{energetic}} young manager Sonny (Dev Patel) but a dilapidated facility, not <b>yet</b> <b>what</b> he had promised. Overwhelmed by the cultural changes, Jean often stays inside at the hotel, while her husband Douglas explores the sights. Graham finds that the area has greatly changed since his youth and disappears on long outings every day. Muriel, despite her xenophobia, starts to appreciate her doctor for his skill and the hotel maid for her good service. Evelyn gets a job advising the staff of a call centre on how to interact with older British customers. Sonny struggles to raise funds to renovate the hotel and sees his girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae), despite his mother's disapproval. Madge joins the Viceroy Club seeking a spouse, where she is surprised to find Norman. She introduces him to Carol (Diana Hardcastle). He admits he is lonely and seeking a companion, and the two begin an affair.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{the first}} {{painting}} by Jean Metzinger to employ the concept of multiple perspective—three {{years had passed since}} he first propounded the idea in Note sur la peinture, published in 1910—L'Oiseau bleu arguably exemplifies the extreme, a maxima, a summum bonum of such pictorial processes, while still maintaining elements of recognizable form; the extreme activity of geometric faceting visible in L'Oiseau bleu is not frenzied to the point that any understandable link between physicality or naturalness is lost. <b>Yet,</b> <b>what</b> is achieved is, of course, fundamentally anti-naturalistic; at great distance from the appearance of the natural world.|$|E
25|$|The Neo Destour regime {{sought to}} run a {{strictly}} structured regime with efficient and equitable state operations, but not with democratic-style politics. In effect, Bourguiba dominated {{the country for the}} next 31 years. He governed with programs yielding stability and economic progress, repressing Islamic fundamentalism, and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. The political culture would be secular, populist, and imbued with a kind of French rationalist vision of the state that was buoyant, touched with élan, even Napoleonic in spirit. Bourguiba then saw an idiosyncratic, eclectic future combining tradition and innovation, Islam with a liberal prosperity. Habib Bourguiba has been compared to Ataturk (Mustafa Kemal) of Turkey, as a unique national modernizing leader. <b>Yet,</b> <b>what</b> may be called an inclination to arbitrary methods when making government decisions, and to a kind of personality cult, detracted from Bourguiba's insight and substantial achievements.|$|E

500|$|Hazlitt was {{so deeply}} {{affected}} by this tragedy that he begins the chapter with a regret {{that he had to}} write about it at all. [...] "To attempt to give a description of the play itself or its effect upon the mind, is mere impertinence". <b>Yet</b> <b>what</b> he did write {{turned out to be a}} major piece of literary criticism that contributed to his general concepts about tragedy and poetry, and made a powerful impression on the poet John Keats.|$|E
500|$|Neuromancer was {{commissioned}} by Terry Carr for the second series of Ace Science Fiction Specials, which was intended to exclusively feature debut novels. Given a year to complete the work, Gibson undertook the actual writing out of [...] "blind animal terror" [...] at the obligation to write an entire novel– a feat which {{he felt he was}} [...] "four or five years away from". After viewing the first 20 minutes of landmark cyberpunk film Blade Runner (1982) which was released when Gibson had written a third of the novel, he [...] "figured [...] was sunk, done for. Everyone would assume I'd copped my visual texture from this astonishingly fine-looking film." [...] He re-wrote the first two-thirds of the book twelve times, feared losing the reader's attention and was convinced that he would be [...] "permanently shamed" [...] following its publication; <b>yet</b> <b>what</b> resulted was a major imaginative leap forward for a first-time novelist.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on 7 November 2007 that Abra would again {{be returning to}} Holby City, in spring 2008. Edmondson revealed that [...] "Abra comes back as a patient because some trauma has happened in Africa {{and he will be}} sponging off Ric." [...] Expanding on this, he explained: [...] "Abra’s in a very fragile state, as he’s suffering from post-traumatic stress. He keeps hurting himself, but no one knows why. Ric’s pretty off with Abra at first, but he agrees to let him stay at his place for a week. Abra used to be a nice guy, but he’s horrible now. Something happened to him on his travels, though even I haven’t been told what it is <b>yet.</b> <b>What</b> I do know is that Abra has a huge machete scar on his back... I imagine he’s been though some horror." [...] He has stated that this appearance in the show will last four or five months, and that he doesn't yet know how the character will be written out this time, beyond there being [...] "some kind of mental-health issue." [...] It emerged that Abra had borne witness to a violent attack on the hospital he was working in the Congo, eventually leading to him checking into a psychiatric unit. After being discovered being treated by his own mother, Kyla and Lola Griffin convinced him to discharge himself and return to Ghana. He returned briefly to Holby in December 2008, when he convinced Kyla to move to Ghana with him, proposing marriage to her.|$|E

500|$|A proclamation: In {{the markets}} {{of the city}} the profits from {{commerce}} are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while the little people from the rural villages {{are not allowed to}} sell their wares. There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, <b>yet</b> <b>what</b> they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this [...] "the boxing of the community family." [...] They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two {{at the end of the}} year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He must have done something to provoke this dispute. Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows, to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations.|$|E

[...] But of my sisters, one in particular, the only dark-haired in the family, has haunted me through life. [...] I no more doubt of her presence and her light touch {{on the issues of}} my life, than I doubt of the breath of wind that flutters the tassel of the biretta on my head. [...] <b>Yet</b> <b>what</b> is strange is not her nearness but her farness".|$|E
2500|$|Though not {{the first}} {{painting}} by Metzinger to employ the concept of multiple perspective—three {{years had passed since}} he first propounded the idea in Note sur la peinture, published in 1910—En Canot arguably exemplifies such pictorial processes, while still maintaining elements of recognizable form (the number [...] "3", perhaps suggestive of a regatta, the woman, the umbrella, the boats); the extreme activity of geometric faceting visible in En Canot is not pushed to the point that any understandable link between physicality or naturalness is lost to the viewer. <b>Yet,</b> <b>what</b> is achieved is fundamentally anti-naturalistic.|$|E

Sobers was the most explosive cricketer of a more staid age, the more mercurial because of the orthodoxy and rigidity around him; Kallis is the most stoic and remorseless cricketer of an era more ostentatious and histrionic. ... Sobers was a cavalier among roundheads; Kallis has steadily become a roundhead among cavaliers.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Willow Song" [...] ("Mia madre aveva una povera ancella") {{which follows}} {{is marked by}} an {{increasing}} orchestral sound, with woodwinds and strings adding to it, <b>yet</b> <b>what</b> compounds the sadness of the piece is the wail-like cries of [...] "Salce" [...] made by Desdemona followed by similarly despairing, yet softer [...] "echoes" [...] played by the English horn. Near {{the end of the}} song, Desdemona's fear, which has been hidden up to this point by a veil of sadness, is made apparent; she mistakes the noise of the wind for that of an intruder. The orchestra immediately builds to a fortissimo, reflecting the genuine worries possessed by Desdemona. The music that gradually lessens with the comforting of Emilia and returns for a final repetition of the theme of the [...] "Willow Song".|$|E

An FBI report dated July 23, 1943, describes Lomax as possessing [...] "an erratic, artistic temperament" [...] and a [...] "bohemian attitude." [...] It says: [...] "He {{has a tendency to}} neglect his work {{over a period of time}} and [...] then just before a deadline he produces excellent results." [...] The file quotes one informant who said that [...] "Lomax was a very peculiar individual, that he seemed to be very absent-minded and that he paid practically no attention to his personal appearance." [...] This same source adds that he suspected Lomax's peculiarity and poor grooming habits came from associating with the [...] "hillbillies who provided him with folk tunes".|$|E

2500|$|And <b>yet</b> <b>what</b> is said {{is one of}} the {{permanent}} truths; it is only in degree that any improvement of society could prevent wastage of human powers; the waste even in a fortunate life, the isolation even of a life rich in intimacy, cannot but be felt deeply, and is the central feeling of tragedy. And anything of value must accept this because it must not prostitute itself; its strength is to be prepared to waste itself, if it does not get its opportunity. A statement of this is certainly non-political because it is true in any society, and yet nearly all the great poetic statements of it are in a way [...] "bourgeois", like this one; they suggest to readers, though they do not say, that for the poor man things cannot be improved even in degree.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Luster of Otaku USA noted Tezuka's [...] "ability to {{simultaneously}} play with narrative devices and {{the emotions of}} his readers"; the former with how he uses different viewpoints, and the latter with Luster first hating Tomura but later pitying her. Luster concluded that the manga is: [...] "sexy, dark, and ultimately kind of tragic". Carlo Santos of Anime News Network called the story gripping, with Tezuka [...] "creating a massive but memorable network of characters", {{as well as with}} its twists and [...] "twisted psychology". Santos also felt that the manga represented Tezuka at his most serious with the focus on action and the ambitious art, with its [...] "wild metaphors and images jump off the page." [...] However, Santos criticized the exaggerated character designs which clashed with the manga's realistic themes, the misogynistic actions of the male characters, and the pacing at certain points. Katie Skelly complimented the contemporary fashion depicted with the character's clothing. She felt that the manga was Tezuka's response to gekiga, but that the [...] "cartoony" [...] character design diminished some of its seriousness. Skelly could also identify with the [...] start of the manga where Tomura's accomplishments are questioned by the public. Chris Kirby of the Fandom Post found Tomura to be an unsympathetic character, but called her compelling to observe in the manga's [...] "dog-eat-dog world of the 60s and 70s". Kirby also complimented Tezuka's ability to pursue multiple ideas and commentary in the manga without losing focus. Lastly he noted the importance of Tezuka's art style, where he uses [...] "experimentation and expression", and which represents a [...] "personal metamorphosis of Tezuka himself." [...] Melinda Beasi of Manga Bookshelf found herself surprisingly sympathetic towards Tomura, saying that Tezuka [...] "treats her with more respect and even affection" [...] compared to Ayako, and that, while the manga is scathing, an [...] "exuberance to Tezuka's writing [...] keeps it from sinking into real darkness." [...] Tom Spurgeon said that Tomura's [...] "awfulness" [...] was [...] "weirdly enjoyable" [...] because of Tezuka's frank portrayal of her. He also felt that Tezuka's art kept the reader's interest with its variety, saying: [...] "It's another sign of a great artist that they can seemingly do whatever they want and <b>yet</b> <b>what</b> they choose to do remains worthwhile." [...] Steve Bennett of ICv2 described the manga as an [...] "unbelievably bleak, unsentimental indictment of human life that makes no attempt to impart anything like a moral", concluding that it is a [...] "compelling work, meant for a genuinely mature audience, skillfully told by [...]" [...] David Brothers of Comics Alliance called Tezuka's art style [...] "eminently readable", with a skillful use of panels and metaphors, and said of Tezuka: [...] "his cartooning is wonderful, his writing relentlessly focused, and his plotting just that right balance of creepy and exciting." [...] Lori Henderson of Manga Village compared Tomura's sociopathic nature to Yuki's from MW, but said that the former is an example of [...] "survival of the fittest", while the latter is a product of his environment. She also calls Tomura inhuman in her ability to evolve and survive, with Mizuno serving as a foil to her and being the only one able to affect her. Henderson concludes that Tomura is a sympathetic character, that the story with Kamaishi was the highlight of the manga, and that the manga is a [...] "great thriller".|$|E
