Upwelling in eastern boundary current systems is a primary driver of ecosystem productivity. Typically, peak upwelling occurs during spring and summer, but winter upwelling may also be important to ecosystem functions. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that winter and spring/summer upwelling, operating through indirect trophic interactions, are important to a suite of top predators in the California Current. To test this hypothesis, we collated information on upwelling, chlorophyll-a concentrations, zooplankton and forage fish, and related these to predator responses including rockfish growth, salmon abundance, seabird productivity and phenology (timing of egg-laying), and whale abundance. Seabird diets served in part as food web indicators. We modeled pathways of response using path analysis and tested for significance of the dominant paths with multiple regression. We found support for the hypothesis that relationships between upwelling and top predator variables were mediated primarily by intermediate trophic levels. Both winter and summer upwelling were important in path models, as were intermediate lower and mid trophic level functional groups represented by chlorophyll-a, zooplankton, and forage fish. Significant pathways of response explained from 50 % to 80 % of the variation of seabird (Cassin’s auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and common murre (Uria aalge)), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) dependent variables, whereas splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa) showed no significant response pathways. Upwelling and trophic responses for salmon were established for both the year of ocean entry and the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>return,</b> with zooplankton important in the year of ocean entry and forage fish important in the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> This study provides one of the first comparative investigations between upwelling and predators, from fish to marine mammals and birds within a geographically restricted area, demonstrates often difficult to establish "bottom-up" trophic interactions, and establishes the importance of seasonality of upwelling to various trophic connections and predator demographic traits. Understanding change in the seasonality of upwelling is therefore required to assess dynamics of commercially and recreationally important upper trophic level species in eastern boundary current ecosystems...|$|E

30|$|The {{literature}} suggests {{there is about}} a 1  % risk per year of a 10  % global agricultural shortfall due to catastrophes such as a large volcanic eruption, a medium asteroid or comet impact, regional nuclear war, abrupt climate change, and extreme weather causing multiple breadbasket failures. This shortfall has an expected mortality of about 500 million people. To prevent such mass starvation, alternate foods can be deployed that utilize stored biomass. This study developed a model with literature values for variables and, where no values existed, used large error bounds to recognize uncertainty. Then Monte Carlo analysis was performed on three interventions: planning, research, and development. The results show that even the upper bound of USD 400 per life saved by these interventions is far lower than what is typically paid to save a life in a less-developed country. Furthermore, every day of delay on the implementation of these interventions costs 100 – 40, 000 expected lives (number of lives saved multiplied by the probability that alternate foods would be required). These interventions plus training would save 1 – 300 million expected lives. In general, these solutions would reduce the possibility of civilization collapse, could assist in providing food outside of catastrophic situations, and would result in billions of dollars per <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b>|$|E

Moreover, considering the differences in earning potentials and opportunities for skill acquisition in different destination countries, the impact of household past migration experience is differentiated by main migrant destinations, namely Greece and Italy. The study also tests for the hypothesis {{of the existence of}} migration cycles, by differentiating the time spent abroad based on the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> The empirical results indicate that household past migration experience exerts a positive impact on the probability of owning a non-farm business. While one additional year in Greece increases the probability of household business ownership by roughly 7 percent, a similar experience in Italy or further destinations raises the probability by over 30 percent. Although past migration experience for the period 1990 - 2000 is positively associated with the likelihood of owning a household enterprise, a similar impact does not materialize for the period 2001 - 2004. The latter finding seems suggestive of the fact that more recent migrants are yet to attain a target level of required savings and skills in order to successfully establish a new business upon return.

40|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{endangered}} and declining western North Atlantic population of the Roseate Tern Sterna dougallii outside the breeding season, when most mortality probably occurs. We used geolocators to track Roseate Terns in 2007 and 2009 and retrieved six units with useful data. In the post-breeding period in July-August, all six birds staged around Cape Cod, close to the breeding site. They started southward migration from 28 August to 14 September and flew directly across the western North Atlantic Ocean to staging areas around Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. We identified five major areas and four minor areas in the West Indies and along {{the north and east}} coasts of South America where birds stopped over for 2 - 24 d during southward and northward migrations. Birds arrived at (Northern Hemisphere) wintering areas from Guyana/Suriname on the north coast of South America to eastern Brazil between 3 October and 2 November. They left wintering areas from 7 - 23 April and arrived back at the breeding area from 5 - 30 May. Although this study is based on data for only six birds, it identifies several stopover and wintering areas that should receive priority for future studies and potential conservation measures. Geolocators did not impair Roseate Terns' ability to raise young in the year the devices were attached, but lower than expected rates of return suggest that the geolocators reduced survival, and most of the birds that returned had lost body-mass and did not breed in the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>return...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceSurface {{erythemal}} {{solar irradiance}} (UV-Ery) from 1960 to 2100 has been derived using radiative transfer calculations and projections of ozone, temperature and cloud change from 14 chemistry climate models (CCM), {{as part of}} the CCMVal- 2 activity of SPARC. Our calculations show the influence of ozone depletion and recovery on erythemal irradiance. In addition, we investigate UV-Ery changes caused by climate changes due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. The latter include effects on both stratospheric ozone and cloud changes. The derived estimates provide a global picture of the likely changes in erythemal irradiance during the 21 st century. Uncertainties arise from the assumed scenarios, different parameterizations - particularly of cloud effects on UV-Ery - and from the diversity in the CCM projections. The calculations suggest that relative to 1980 annually mean UV-Ery in the 2090 s will be on average ~ 12 % lower at high latitudes in both hemispheres, ~ 3 % lower at mid latitudes, and marginally higher (~ 1 %) in the tropics. The largest reduction (~ 16 %) is projected for Antarctica in October. Cloud effects result in additional 2 - 3 % reduction in UV-Ery at high latitudes, but they slightly moderate it at mid-latitudes (~ 1 %). The <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> of erythemal irradiance to values of certain milestones (1965 and 1980) depends largely on the return of column ozone to the corresponding levels and is associated with large uncertainties mainly due to the spread of the model projections. The inclusion of cloud effects in the calculations has only a small effect of the return years. At mid and high latitudes, changes in clouds and stratospheric ozone dynamics due to greenhouse gases will sustain the erythemal irradiance at levels below those in 1965, despite the removal of ozone depleting substances.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Effects of {{the marine}} {{environment}} on age and size at maturity, early marine growth, and abundance of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, were studied at Olsen Creek during 1959 - 77. Chum salmon returned to Olsen Creek as predominately 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -year fish; however, age composition varied from year to year. The mean age composition for the brood years 1956 - 72 for males was 15 %, 66 %, and 19 % for 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -year fish, respectively. Mean age composition for females of the same broods showed slightly higher percentages of older fish: 9 %, 67 %, and 23 % for 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -year fish, respectively. Some 6 -year chum salmon returned to Olsen Creek between 1968 and 1975; but, only in 1973 did the number of 6 -year fish (3 %) represent more than 1 % of the returns. Population sizes tended to be larger during these years, and mean age increased {{as the number of}} fish in a brood increased. Intraseasonally, age of new chum salmon spawners at Olsen Creek decreased as the season progressed. Mean size of older spawners was greater than the mean size of younger spawners; but, the ranges in size of the three age groups overlap each other so size is not a good criterion for estimating age of chum salmon. Measurement of circuli and distances on adult scales were used to estimate growth of chum salmon during their first two years of marine life. Both number of circuli and distances on scales of juvenile chum salmon after their first summer in Prince William Sound were shown to be related to length of the fish. Growth during the first season at sea was not related to age at maturity; however, amount of growth acquired during the second marine season was negatively related to age at maturity. Growth during the first summer at sea was related to sea surface temperatures and marine weather parameters in Prince William Sound and in the northern Gulf of Alaska. Location of chum salmon from Olsen Creek during their second year at sea is unknown. Fluctuations in size (length) at maturity were more similar between fish from different broods returning during the same year than they were for fish that matured at different ages from the same broods. Length at maturity was related to marine weather factors during their last summer at sea in the northern Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. Length at maturity was also related to mean summer sea surface temperature in Prince William Sound during the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> Total survival of each brood was estimated from the ratio of number of progeny (returns) to number of parents (spawners). No direct relationships were found between survival and growth during the first or second season in the sea, sea surface temperatures, or upwelling indices along the coast. However, a highly significant relationship was found between the survival of progeny and mean length of the parents...|$|E

40|$|City of Surakarta, {{known as}} Solo City {{is one of}} cities in Central Java Province traversed by Bengawan Solo River. Heavy {{rainfall}} in upstream area of Bengawan Solo River causes increase in high water level at downstream. Bengawan Solo River will be higher than water level in drainage system which may induce a backwater flow. Since Colonization era, the government has built dikes and barrages against backwater flow and inundation problem. One of the barrages was Demangan Barrage dividing river flow into Bengawan Solo River and Pepe River. It was equipped with total capacity pump of 12, 3 m 3 /s. The inundation is not only caused by the backwater flow coming from Bengawan Solo River, but also surface runoff {{as the result of}} the excess rainfall which cannot be drained gravitationally to the main river if the gate was closed. Therefore, comprehensive study combining hydrology and hydraulics analysis is highly needed in order to achieve more effective flood control management. Hydrology analysis was done to estimate the direct runoff hydrograph from catchment area in Solo City to downstream of Pepe River. While in hydraulics case, hydraulic parameter in downstream of Pepe River influenced by Bengawan Solo River stream was analyzed. Both studies were simulated using software HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 version. The simulation considered drainage channel, gate, pump system and dike in Pepe River downstream. Simulation using 10 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> period in Solo City and average annual water level in Bengawan Solo River showed that Pepe River can flow through the gate, while the highest water level is still below the dike. Simulation considering 10 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> period, water level hydrograph of Bengawan Solo River, existing pump, and gate operation inferred that Pepe River surpassed top of dike.
