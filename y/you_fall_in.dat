[...] A writer of The Harvard Crimson felt that the video has [...] "references to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 'The Great Gatsby,' writing that the [...] "setting feels extravagant and all-encompassing." [...] Kat Boehrer of Complex named it a [...] "mesmerizing video." [...] The Capital FM website {{published}} that the video is [...] "a moody, atmospheric piece of art that is almost guaranteed to make <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> love with the singer."

500|$|... "Crazy in Love" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé for {{the film}} Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and used for its trailer which was {{released}} on July 24, 2014. This slowed-down version was produced by Boots with violin arrangements by Margot, both of whom worked on Beyoncé's fifth studio album. Margot said, [...] "It inspires me to work on other artists' songs [...] it pushes my boundaries {{in a direction that}} I wouldn't necessarily come up with. Obviously I know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, but I knew there was the possibility her vocals would be different. It's almost more vulnerable and beautiful this way, because you do do crazy things when <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> love. To hear the mood reversed and flipped makes it even more powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Baelor" [...] {{marks the}} first {{appearance}} of the German actress Sibel Kekilli, {{in the role of}} the prostitute Shae. Executive producer George R. R. Martin commented that she was extraordinary in her audition, in which she read the scene where Shae meets Tyrion in a tent the night before the battle of the Green Fork. According to Martin, [...] "a lot of beautiful young women read for Shae. [...] But there's another dimension to Shae as well. She's not as practiced and hardened at this as a more seasoned pro. There's still a girl next door quality to her, a sense of vulnerability, playfulness, and, yes, innocence. [...] All of our Shaes were hot as hell. But only a handful of them captured that other quality, maybe three out of twenty, and Sibel was the standout. [...] Watching those auditions, any red-blooded male would want to take every one of our Shae candidates to bed. But Sibel made <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> love with her as well." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Applause" [...] {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Chris Richards of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "It's good. Maybe even slow clap good. Because while so many (too many!) of Gaga's songs {{have been designed}} to boost the esteem of her flock, this song finds her openly pining for the mass-adulation that all superstars need to survive." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard lauded the song's hook and remarked, [...] "As always, Gaga has turned a lofty idea into a jingle for the masses." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, stating that [...] "Lady Gaga makes no secret that she's after mass adoration, and as far as lead singles go, her next grand spectacle is off to a strong start." [...] Carl Williot of Idolator praised the track, saying that it [...] "ticks all the right boxes when it comes to being a balls-to-the-wall pop delight ... this is pop doing what good pop songs should do, which is grab you by the collar from the first listen and make <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> love on the spot." [...] The Huffington Post writer Baggers described it as [...] "pop at its best: instant, euphoric, joyful and impossible to get out of your head".|$|E
500|$|As a mascot character, Crash {{has drawn}} {{numerous}} comparisons to competing mascots such as Mario and Sonic by reviewers. Dave Halverson of GameFan praised Crash's animations, appearance and mannerisms as [...] "100% perfection". A reviewer for Game Revolution praised Crash's [...] "quirky mannerisms" [...] as [...] "always refreshing", and John Broady of GameSpot described Crash as [...] "disarmingly cute and fuzzy". Doug Perry of IGN {{was critical of}} the character, seeing him as [...] "insanely capitalistic", negatively comparing his voice to Luigi of the Mario series and accusing him of being [...] "the most see-through, copycat mascot that ever existed." [...] Louis Bedigian of GameZone also disliked Crash's voice, remarking [...] "it is really annoying to hear a child say, 'Whoa!' every time <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> the water, especially {{when you realize that}} the child's voice is supposed to be Crash". Crash's animations, particularly in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, have been praised as humorous by reviewers. Ryan Davis of GameSpot analyzed Crash's [...] "overextended running style and self-punishing attacks" [...] as establishing him as an [...] "empty-headed but enthusiastic character", and compared his facial contortions to those of comedian Red Skelton. In a poll held by MSN in late 2008 to determine the most iconic video game character, Crash ranked at #8. In the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition from 2011, he was voted as the eleventh best video game character. However, he also ranked eighth on IGN's top 10 list of video game characters who should die, adding {{that it would be a}} mercy killing. IGN editor Colin Moriarty stated that his games add little to innovate the series over the years, rendering the character useless.|$|E
500|$|Although their {{popularity}} continued to decline during the 1990s, their albums still reached gold and platinum status. The 1990 album Pass It on Down featured three number one singles: [...] "Jukebox in My Mind", [...] "Forever's as Far as I'll Go", and [...] "Down Home". According to AllMusic, {{by the time}} the band released 1992's American Pride, [...] "they were among the genre's aging veterans." [...] Richard Carlin of Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary, suggested that the group's harmonies sounded dated to the new audience. [...] "I'm in a Hurry (And Don't Know Why)" [...] became the album's biggest hit, reaching number one; the album's other singles still fared very well, with [...] "Take a Little Trip", [...] "Once Upon a Lifetime", and [...] "Hometown Honeymoon" [...] peaking within the top three. Cheap Seats followed in 1993, with [...] "Reckless" [...] becoming Alabama's final number one, although most of the band's singles afterward peaked within the top ten. The band's 1995 album, In Pictures, represented their eighteenth gold album, more than the total for any other country act to that point. In 1996, the group remained finalists in the Vocal Group of the Year at the Country Music Association Awards. The band released Dancin' on the Boulevard in 1997, exploring R and beach music. Singles [...] "Sad Lookin' Moon" [...] and [...] "Dancin', Shaggin' on the Boulevard" [...] were top five hits in the U.S. and Canada. The following year, the group released For the Record, a two-disc greatest hits compilation that contained two new singles — [...] "How Do <b>You</b> <b>Fall</b> <b>in</b> Love" [...] and [...] "Keepin' Up".

500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film 4 (out of 5) stars, {{saying that it}} was [...] "attention-grabbing from {{inception}} till conclusion. The drama only soars higher and the complex love story gets more and more gripping as the conflict between the characters come to the fore." [...] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave it 4 (out of 5) stars: [...] "At a gracious 3 hours runtime, JTHJ feels like an epic love story. And it is just that. JTHJ is the perfect adieu to a hallmark career. It is the best romantic film made in this generation." [...] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 3.5 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Despite the lovey-dovey nothingness that drives the plot, Jab Tak Hai Jaan has more substance than most romantic films that come out of Bollywood." [...] Meena Iyer of The Times of India rated it 3.5 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "Every frame is picture-perfect, the emotions are well nuanced. But there is one inherent flawthe story by Aditya Chopra is hackneyed." [...] Subhash Jha (also from The Times of India) said, [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan makes <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> love with love all over again." [...] Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan is too tangled to transport you. But I recommend that you see it.

[...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "I'm going with three out of five for the late Yash Chopra's Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Despite its many script problems, it's a consistently watchable film that oozes with feeling and real emotion. A fitting swan song." [...] OPEN magazine gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars, praising Yash Chopra's direction. Ajit Duara called it [...] "a deeply-felt cinematic perspective from 80 years of living." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "As a swan-song for the master director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan might only be a middling effort. But then, sometimes, all we need is a Khan-song." [...] Shabana Ansari of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "If you must, watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan for Shah Rukh, who can still convey love and passion in a fleeting look or a dimpled smile; and for Yash Chopra who gave us some of the most enduring romances of all times." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aragno {{said that}} he and Godard did not want to use 3D as a typical special effect or gimmick. Instead, they wished to use it [...] "to express new things." [...] Several cameras were used, but the {{majority}} was shot on the Canon 5D and the Canon 1DC. Other cameras included GoPros and Lumixes. Aragno used Leica lenses on the Canons [...] "because the Canon lenses are too perfect... How can <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> love with a digitally perfect person? To err is human! The Leica lenses have some involuntary imperfections." [...] The Canon cameras allowed them to shoot most of the film using natural or available light sources. Godard intentionally framed shots for 3D images, such as when the character's shadows are in 2D but the sidewalk is in 3D. The dog in the film is Godard's own pet Roxy Miéville, whom Godard would film whenever he took him for a walk. Godard used consumer cameras from Fujifilm and Sony for these shots. Aragno also shot some footage independently before production officially began, including shots of his two children running around olive trees.|$|E
