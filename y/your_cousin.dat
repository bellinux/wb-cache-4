2500|$|At 5 feet, 11inches, and 185 pounds, Doll {{was small}} for a {{professional}} football player. [...] In a 1954 profile on Doll, a reporter noted, [...] "Don, who's built like a bank clerk, piano tuner, soda jerk, errand boy or -- egad -- even a sports writer doesn't look any more like a pro gridder than <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> Joe." [...] Doll explained how he handled the disparity in size with the players he was required to tackle: [...] "I just throw a shoulder into 'em and hit 'em low. [...] If they are over two tons I aim for their shoelaces. [...] If they're medium sized (around boxcar weight) I hit for the thighs. [...] I'll admit I do not drive 'em back but I stop 'em where they are. ... My size is no detriment in football. [...] I rate as the No. 1 asset the 'desire' to tackle. [...] And I've plenty of that desire." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lov. I {{must make}} a loose from her, there's no other way. Save ye, Mr Failer; is <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> Trice {{stirring}} yet? Answer me quickly, sir, is <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> Trice yet stirring? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{creature}} {{come from}} nobody knows where is not <b>your</b> <b>cousin!</b> How {{do we know}} he is <b>your</b> <b>cousin?</b> He may be a valet who has taken his master's portmanteau, and run away in his postchaise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't boast to <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> of {{what you}} have got, [...] One--two-- [...] Or you'll find you will catch it uncommonly hot, [...] One--two--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sprite!" [...] cried Peter joyously. [...] "I {{missed you}} when <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> passed through here, and I {{thought you had}} gone to the Far North with the rest of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Till {{all this}} trouble about the {{property}} is settled," [...] said he, [...] "it will be much better {{that you should be}} with <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> than living alone in Mrs Buggins' lodgings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you say, Pollio? Will {{you suffer}} this man, who saved your wife, who risked {{his life for}} <b>your</b> <b>cousin,</b> and is, as it seems, <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> by marriage, to be foully {{captured}} and crucified?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lord. Then, in {{obedience}} to your commands; <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> is with child.|$|E
60|$|Burr. What {{noise is}} that? I think I hear <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> Trice's voice.|$|E
6000|$|... 'For yourself, Anne,' {{said her}} mother, 'I {{do not think}} you are much to blame, since I cannot see how you were to know that <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> were going without their father's consent.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] replied Files. [...] "There is not {{a breath}} of wind stirring. But these lovely {{blossoms}} are indeed <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> and answered <b>your</b> question at once, as I knew they would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know well}} enough, Captain Rover. It is useless {{for you to}} deny it," [...] stormed the angry teacher. [...] "You and <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> here are {{responsible}} for bringing those big snowballs into the school." ...|$|R
60|$|Fail. Egad, {{you want}} <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> Isabella's wit {{to bring that}} to pass, madam.|$|E
60|$|Queen. Some suit, I warrant, for <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> Celadon. Leave his {{advancement}} to my care.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the story}} told by <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> (under {{pressure}} of necessity) to Mr. Luker.|$|E
6000|$|... "You think you're smart, don't you?" [...] grumbled Slugger to Jack, when he {{was ready}} to go. [...] "You just wait, Jack Rover! I'm not going to forget you and <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> in a hurry!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all; you are clever {{enough for}} anything: you might {{easily have been}} {{something}} else. And <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> at Quallingham all {{think that you have}} sunk below them in your choice of a profession." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So say I, {{my little}} man,' {{returned}} the Duke, patting {{him on the}} head, then adding to his own two boys, 'Take <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> and play ball with them, or spin tops, or whatever may please them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] she admitted. [...] "Afterwards I {{spoke to}} <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> about you. He {{told me that}} you lived on your estates, that you played games well, that you shot birds and rabbits, and sent to prison drunken men and poachers. 'But about his life?' I asked. 'This is his life,' <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> answered. 'He has never gone in for a career!'" ...|$|E
60|$|Tim. I hope I {{shall have}} your good word, too, madam, to <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> for me. [To ISABELLA.|$|E
60|$|ERNEST. [Reluctantly {{realising}} {{the difference}} that this makes.] I suppose {{it does make}} a difference, her bein' <b>your</b> <b>cousin.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a dull {{house to}} come to, my dear," [...] said Lady Ball; [...] "but blood is thicker than water, they say, {{and we thought}} that perhaps {{you might like to}} be with <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> at Christmas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you please, my dear," [...] {{she said}} graciously; [...] "but {{do you not}} think it would amuse you to make your debut in society--unimpeachable society--and be {{properly}} introduced to the occupants of the 'pedestals,' as <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> will be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be so fast, young man," [...] {{returned}} his father. [...] "Your Uncle Dick {{may be too}} lenient. I am rather {{of the opinion that}} you and your brother, if not <b>your</b> <b>cousins,</b> have got to be taken in hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no; that's her residence--her {{principal}} one--since {{she became}} so united to <b>your</b> <b>cousin.</b> Isn't Miss Chancellor your cousin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is right, Monsieur de Laval,' {{said the}} Emperor. 'This {{interview}} {{can lead to}} nothing. Remove <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> from the room!' ...|$|E
60|$|Bib. They say, here's a great {{dinner to}} be made to-day here, at <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> Trice's, on purpose for the interview.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so do {{your sisters}} and <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> and <b>your</b> aunts," [...] hummed Ed, for Gus was often called Admiral {{because he really}} did possess three sisters, two cousins, and four aunts, besides mother and grandmother, all living in the big house together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah! you needn't talk to me, Rover! I {{know the}} kind you and <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> are. I'm going to fix you. How do you like that?" [...] and as he uttered the last word, Nappy Martell hauled back and slapped Fred on the cheek.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said I, [...] "I am {{well acquainted}} with your family. I know <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> in Concord very well." [...] But my overtures were vain, for he would {{withdraw}} by his aerial turnpikes into a more distant cedar-top, and spring his rattle again.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is <b>your</b> <b>Cousin</b> Abner's other name?" [...] asked Mary, with a vague {{recollection}} of hearing of Beatrice and Helen--somebody--in Trenton.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, I'll come--mayhap, mayhap--but I'll go now--glad to {{have seen}} you, citizeness. Where does <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> lodge?" [...] he asked abruptly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your arrows fall terribly astray there, Miss Dale, for I {{never touch}} a cue; {{you should talk}} to <b>your</b> <b>cousin</b> about billiards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I'll let you stay," [...] cried Old Mother Nature heartily. [...] "I am {{glad you}} have come, {{especially}} glad {{you have come}} today, because to-day's lesson is to be about you and <b>your</b> <b>cousins.</b> Now, Peter Rabbit, what are the differences between Striped Chipmunk and his cousins, the Tree Squirrels?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{so glad to}} see {{it clear}} off," [...] remarked Ruth Stevenson, as she quite {{naturally}} paired off with Jack, while May Powell turned to talk to Fred. And then she added, as she gazed admiringly at the young captain in his neat-fitting uniform: [...] "I understand you and <b>your</b> <b>cousins</b> have been doing the hero act again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will do my best, master, {{and will}} {{adventure}} my life {{all the more}} willingly, since {{it is in the}} service of Allan and Janet Armstrong. They were always pleasant and friendly with me, at Yardhope, and I like them for themselves, as well as because they are <b>your</b> <b>cousins.</b> Now, master, what is to be done?" ...|$|R
