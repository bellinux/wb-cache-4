500|$|According to Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine, {{the meaning}} to [...] "Talk" [...] {{is based on}} how Martin [...] "wants to teach us how to feel better about ourselves, and his lessons have the moral superiority {{disguised}} as sensitivity that marked Bono's mighty mullet period." [...] Tyrangiel interpreted the lyrics, [...] "Are you lost or incomplete/ Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece/ Tell me how you feel", with Martin begging in the song.|$|E

They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> you're in 1953 or something." ...|$|E

[...] In the fifth verse, Martin summarises about an individual who is lost and trying to discover the unknown: [...] "So you don't know where you're going/But you want to talk/And <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> you're going where you've been before/You'll tell anyone who will listen but you feel ignored." ...|$|E

[...] Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design. [...] "In the real world, the colors are bright and rich," [...] Willet said. [...] "In the skewed world, they're washed out and faded. [...] Nothing is obvious, and it's only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic".|$|E

500|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme in}} the album is that everything is broken, out of place or missing; This is apparent in nearly all songs in the album. Examples include [...] "Fix You" [...] ("When you lose something you can't replace") and also in [...] "X" [...] ("When something is broken, {{and you try to}} fix it, trying to repair it, any way you can") and [...] "Talk" [...] ("Are you lost or incomplete? Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?").

500|$|For {{the closing}} reveal {{involving}} Melisandre, {{the director of}} the episode stated that a similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in [...] "Mother's Mercy" [...] was used, with Carice van Houten wearing prosthetic makeup for the face that was then transposed onto the real body of an old woman. Podeswa stated, [...] "The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete [...] creation. Because what does a 400-year-old person look like? We don't know. So if you try to create that, then you're creating something that looks beyond our known reality. Here <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> she's very old without putting a number on it." ...|$|E
500|$|SFX {{magazine}} reviewer Richard Edwards {{gave the}} episode {{four out of}} five stars, saying it [...] "looks fantastic" [...] and praised choice of the abbey as the factory, which blew [...] "the clichÃ© of a futuristic industrial setting apart immediately, and [...] <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> youâ€™re watching something new." [...] Like Jeffery, he said the visual effects were [...] "generally pretty good" [...] but criticised the CGI used for Jennifer's special abilities. Keith Phipps on The A.V.

His complaint was that it [...] "truly [...] like half a story in the way the best Doctor Who two-parters don't", though he said it managed to plant intriguing strands for the conclusion.|$|E

500|$|Timothy Zachery Mosley {{was born}} on March 10, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a {{homeless}} shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time as a DJ, {{he was known as}} [...] "DJ Tim" [...] or [...] "DJ Timmy Tim". His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. I'm not a rapper," [...] he says dismissively. I'm not talking about my scars or my battles. Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. I'll tell you this, Tim says. If you get shot and you survive, <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> you're an Incredible Hulk. Them bullets don't hurt when they go in. But then they got that burnin', that acid burn. Goddamn! It feels like a stove burning your blood. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> any minute you gonna be dyin'.}} ...|$|E
500|$|One cut Goldenberg had to make, {{which he}} [...] "hated" [...] to do, was {{the absence of}} Quidditch, the Wizarding sport. [...] "The truth is that any movie made of this book, whoever made it, that had {{included}} the Quidditch subplot {{would have been a}} lesser film", he said. In the book, Ron grows as a character by trying out for the Quidditch team. [...] "Ron facing challenges and coming into his own {{in the same way that}} Harry is, we tried to get that into the film in other ways, as much as possible. So, <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like,</b> if not the details of that story, at least the spirit of it is present in the film".

Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that he [...] "preferred this episode of 30 Rock" [...] compared to the previous episode, [...] "SeinfeldVision".
