2500|$|Prince Oberyn Martell, nicknamed [...] "The Red Viper", {{is played}} by Chilean-American actor Pedro Pascal. [...] "This was a tough one", said showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss about the casting. [...] "The Red Viper is sexy and charming, yet believably dangerous; {{intensely}} likable, yet driven by hate. The boys love him, the girls love him, and he loves them all back. Unless <b>your</b> <b>last</b> <b>name</b> is Lannister. We found a fellow who can handle the job description and make it seem effortless. He wasn't easy to find and he won't be easy to stop". Martin commented on the casting by saying: [...] "I wasn't present for Pedro Pascal's audition, but I understand that he really killed it with his reading. And since his casting was announced, the producer of another TV show on which he appeared recently has written me to say how terrific Pascal is, and to congratulate us on the casting. So I suspect that he {{will turn out to}} be a wonderful Red Viper". Actress Indira Varma was cast as Ellaria Sand, Prince Oberyn's paramour.|$|E
