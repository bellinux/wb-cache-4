500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Paul van der Grijp believes Oviri {{was intended}} [...] as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin's persona as a [...] "civilised savage". [...] The artist {{wrote in his}} final letter to Morice that [...] "You were wrong that day when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was wrong to say I was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work {{there is nothing that}} can surprise or disconcert, except the fact that I am a savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable." ...|$|E
500|$|In Combs' first {{speech of}} the primary campaign, he {{admitted}} that the state needed to raise $25million ($ million in [...] dollars) in new revenue and that a sales tax should be considered. Chandler, the more experienced politician, attacked Combs for this suggestion, maintaining that an experienced governor like himself would not need to raise taxes to meet the state's obligations. Combs' speech was also attacked as dry and uninspiring, partly because he read it verbatim from prepared notes. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> couldn't give a speech," [...] Doc Beauchamp later complained to Clements. Hugh Morris, chief of the Louisville Courier-Journals Frankfort bureau, commented that [...] "Combs opened and closed his campaign on the same night".|$|E

60|$|MARGARET. And when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'snap' <b>I</b> {{caught the}} biscuit in my mouth.|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> must be {{very sure}} of my complexion. Of course I am. Here it is.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, I believe it; {{but tell}} me, Philip, {{did you not}} hint that you had been among former friends--at Lucon, <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> think?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something has happened, Dora! What {{have you}} done? What have <b>you</b> <b>said?</b> <b>I</b> insist upon knowing immediately," [...] she demanded, with {{somewhat}} startling brevity.|$|E
60|$|Bun. <b>I</b> thank <b>you,</b> Sir, <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> very well, blessed be the Lord.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> know, that <b>I</b> {{should make}} you an {{antidote}} to those black humours; and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> hoped <b>I</b> would consign them to the flames.’ ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{said you}} had never {{asked her to marry}} you," [...] pursued Ann relentlessly; [...] "you wouldn't tell me why. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What did {{you mean}} when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> could have given you no worse news than that of his coming alone?" [...] she {{questioned}} suddenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "'My accomplishments, sir, may be {{less than}} <b>you</b> imagine,' <b>said</b> <b>I.</b> 'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. I've--married <b>you.</b> She <b>said</b> <b>I</b> {{ought to}} marry you again, and I have straightway. It is true religion! Ha--ha--ha!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay,' {{says the}} other, 'I only knew <b>you</b> <b>said</b> so; <b>I</b> {{did not think}} you would have acted so from what <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> nor do <b>I</b> think I gave you any reason.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> {{was last}} night? You know," [...] he asked after some {{preliminary}} talk. [...] "Too--too--I don't know. A very funny word." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{that is what}} <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> but <b>I</b> don't believe it, Roger Morr. I {{think you}} put the {{magazine}} there yourself--you or Dave Porter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, now, I cannot look at <b>you</b> till <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> it. <b>I</b> {{have felt}} the truth of every word <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>I</b> beg your pardon for all that has passed.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Foster. [...] "Although I haven't {{known you}} long, I feel that I won't lose my partner when he marries you. I was {{grateful}} when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> hoped <b>I</b> {{would always be}} his friend." ...|$|R
