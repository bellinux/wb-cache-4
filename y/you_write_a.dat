500|$|Boston Globe {{sports editor}} Jason Nason campaigned for Joss' {{induction}} into the Hall of Fame {{starting in the}} 1950s. Sportswriter Red Smith wrote in 1970 in support of Joss. [...] "Could <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> history of baseball without mentioning Joss? Nobody ever has. That {{ought to be the}} measure of a man's fitness for the Hall of Fame, the only measure." [...] However, Warren Giles, then-chairman of the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee, pointed out to baseball historian Bob Broeg in 1972 that induction to the Hall required [...] "participation in ten championship seasons." [...] Joss had been on the Cleveland roster in 1911 and participated in spring training, falling ill just before regular season play commenced. Hence it was argued he had [...] "participated" [...] in the 1911 season, his tenth. The Hall's Board of Directors waived the eligibility requirements for Joss. Joe Reichler, a member of the Commissioner's office, worked to allow Joss to become eligible for the Hall and succeeded in 1977. Joss was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978. He is the only player in the Hall of Fame whose regular season playing career lasted fewer than ten years.|$|E
500|$|Playwright Horton Foote {{reportedly}} considered {{giving up}} on film writing, due to what he regarded as a poor adaption of his 1952 play The Chase into a 1966 film of the same name. Following what Foote saw as a far more successful adaption of his 1968 play Tomorrow in 1972, his interest in filmmaking was rekindled, {{under the condition that}} he maintain some degree of control over the final product. Foote said of this stage in his career, [...] "I learned that film really should be like theatre in the sense that in theatre, the writer is, of course, very dominant... If we don't like something, we can speak our minds.... It is always a collaborative effort.... But in Hollywood it wasn't so. A writer there has in his contract that you are a writer for hire, which means that <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> script, then it belongs to them." [...] This renewed interest in cinema prompted Foote to write Tender Mercies, his first work written specifically for the screen. In the view of biographer George Terry Barr, the script reflected [...] "Foote's determination to battle a Hollywood system that generally refuses to make such personal films." ...|$|E

Even after battling cancer for several years, he considered himself [...] "a very lucky man in every respect". [...] Sarah Lyall notes in her 2007 interview with Pinter in The New York Times that his [...] "latest work, a slim pamphlet called [...] "Six Poems for A.," [...] comprises poems written over 32 years, with [...] "A" [...] of course being Lady Antonia.

[...] LL Cool J later retaliated [...] dissing Ice-T in his song [...] "To da Break of Dawn" [...] from his album Mama Said Knock You Out (1990). Afrika Islam said their feud ended when a group meeting involving Flavor Flav, DJ Red Alert, Mike Tyson and Afrika Bambaataa persuaded them to stop fighting. Islam explained Tyson's role: [...] " [...] down with hip-hop and the Zulus and I've always considered rappers like boxers anyway". Ice-T commented on the feud in NME magazine in 2012, stating: [...] "You need a nemesis in hip hop. It's part of what fuels good rap. L was coming out of New York saying he was the best rapper in the world. I was trying to get my feet out of LA. You can't have someone saying they're the best if you're trying to.

Momsen commented about the recording: [...] "I'm like, okay, dude, you're singing an 8-year-old's words, but that's cool.

At first he was like 'How can you rap over a dance beat?' - and now he's DONE it!" [...] Instrumentation on the track includes drums, keys, synths, and bass; the former were provided by will.i.am while Caleb Speir provided the latter. will.i.am also co-recorded and co-engineered the song with Padriac Kerin at The Record Plant in Hollywood, Florida as well as Hit Factory Criteria and Circle House Studios in Miami.
