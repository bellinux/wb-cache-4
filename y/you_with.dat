5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to <b>you</b> <b>with</b> three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

That left <b>you</b> <b>with</b> a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
