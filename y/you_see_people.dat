500|$|After the {{election}} {{and the return of}} the National Government, little happened to support Baldwin's optimistic words. In the House of Commons on 2 March 1936, Wilkinson spoke of the [...] "atmosphere of mystery" [...] that surrounded the Jarrow scheme: [...] "Publicly one sees tremendous optimism... but when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>people</b> privately {{there is a great deal}} of humming and ha'ing, and they are not quite sure". Meanwhile, the BISF argued that increased steel production should be achieved by expanding capacity in existing facilities, rather than by building new plant. Duncan, in a reversal of his earlier attitude, now opposed the provision of finance for Jarrow which, he felt, might create a precedent that other distressed areas could exploit. The BISF finally succeeded in watering down the scheme to the extent that [...] it became unviable; Salt and his syndicate withdrew, and the scheme was dead, [...] "strangled at birth" [...] according to Wilkinson.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Mugabe, the {{president}} of Zimbabwe, has waged a violent campaign against LGBT people, arguing that before colonisation, Zimbabweans did not engage in homosexual acts. His first major public condemnation of homosexuality was in August 1995, during the Zimbabwe International Book Fair. He told an audience: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>people</b> parading themselves as lesbians and gays, arrest them and hand {{them over to the}} police!" [...] In September 1995, Zimbabwe's parliament introduced legislation banning homosexual acts. In 1997, a court found Canaan Banana, Mugabe's predecessor and the first President of Zimbabwe, guilty of 11 counts of sodomy and indecent assault.|$|E

But the looker-on {{will see the}} move, because his mind is calm, not disturbed {{by the desire to}} win. We become ambitious, and thus lose clearness of vision.

He {{said that he had}} made the remark while speaking off-the-cuff with members of an Indonesian youth group and trying to [...] "give them spirit". He said that he had told them: [...] "If you look at the map of South-east Asia, you [...] are so big, and Singapore is just a dot. But if you come to Singapore, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>people</b> with vision." [...] He also claimed that [...] "I have corrected [...] many times, but they have never put it [...] And I could not prove it in writing because I was talking freely." ...|$|E

Still, of course, at present they have no idea of that. They think they will be no longer obliged to work, and suppose that somehow they will be fed and clothed and have everything they want without any trouble to themselves. You see it is just the same thing that is going on in France." ...|$|E

Theres the people that dont intend to have children and that arnt fit to have them. Theres the people that marry because theyre so much run after by the other sex {{that they have to}} put a stop to it somehow. Theres the people that want to try a new experience, and the people that want to have done with experiences. How are you to please them all?

5000|$|Orwell {{describes}} the irritating behaviour of bookshop customers - first edition snobs, oriental students, vague minded women and [...] "the {{kind of people}} who would be a nuisance anywhere but have special opportunities in a bookshop". The shop had various sidelines including typewriters, stamps for collectors, horoscopes and Christmas novelties (Orwell was particularly amused by an invoice for these that included the phrase [...] "2 doz. Infant Jesus with rabbits"). However, the main sideline was the lending library, which to Orwell shed a new light on readers: [...] "In a lending library <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>people's</b> real tastes, not their pretended ones." ...|$|R

[...] How stale everything grows! If we were to live in a garden of Eden, now, and the gate were open, we should go out, and tramp forward, and push on, and get up early in the morning, and push on again--anything to keep moving, anything to get a change: anything but quiet for the restless children of Cain.|$|E
60|$|All public dinners in London, {{from the}} Lord Mayor’s annual banquet at Guildhall, to the Chimney-sweepers’ anniversary at White Conduit House; from the Goldsmiths’ to the Butchers’, from the Sheriffs’ to the Licensed Victuallers’; are amusing scenes. Of all {{entertainments}} of this description, however, {{we think the}} annual dinner of some public charity is the most amusing. At a Company’s dinner, the people are nearly all alike—regular old stagers, who make it a matter of business, and a thing not to be laughed at. At a political dinner, everybody is disagreeable, and inclined to speechify—much the same thing, by-the-bye; but at a charity dinner <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>people</b> of all sorts, kinds, and descriptions. The wine may not be remarkably special, to be sure, and we have heard some hardhearted monsters grumble at the collection; but we really think the amusement {{to be derived from}} the occasion, sufficient to counterbalance even these disadvantages.|$|E

Now that that important thing is settled, suppose you come and lunch with me in Covent Garden? I don't belong to a club yet, though I have got my name down {{at a couple of}} them, but as far as I can see they are slow sort of places unless you know a lot of people. The coffee houses are much more amusing; <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>people</b> of all sorts there--fellows like myself, who have no clubs to go to; country gentlemen up for a week; a few writers, who, by the way, are not the best customers of these places; men whom nobody knows, and men whom everybody knows.
