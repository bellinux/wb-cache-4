60|$|But may be <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> {{the wild}} extravagance of my panorama. You could {{if you were}} here. Here, you feel all the time just {{as if you were}} living about the year 1200 before Christ--or back to the patriarchs--or forward to the New Era. The scenery of the Bible is about you--the customs of the patriarchs are around you--the same people, in the same flowing robes, and in sandals, cross your path--the same long trains of stately camels go and come--the same {{impressive}} religious solemnity and silence rest upon the desert and the mountains that were upon them in the remote ages of antiquity, and behold, intruding upon a scene like this, comes this fantastic mob of green-spectacled Yanks, with their flapping elbows and bobbing umbrellas! It is Daniel in the lion's den with a green cotton umbrella under his arm, all over again.|$|E

Your mouth is flabby(?), but although your mouth {{goes all the}} way round, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> behind you.

6000|$|... "Ah;--that I do not know. But you are harsh to me, while I am {{longing to}} be kind to <b>you.</b> <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> {{that this has been}} all forced upon me,--partly by yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{piece of}} paper in the notebook. It will help us both. Oh, you fool! <b>You</b> fool! <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> what it will do for us? We shall escape!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With your leave, little master, {{you speak}} like a fool," [...] said the gruff seaman. [...] "You {{and all your}} kind are as {{children}} when once the blue water is beneath <b>you.</b> <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> {{that there is no}} wind, and that the Frenchman can warp her as swiftly as we? What then would you do?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The book {{begins with}} the main {{character}} describing the city he (or she; the character's gender is unclear) lives in, [...] "the city <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> out of". Many of the city's residents believe {{it is impossible to}} leave the city, but the main character suggests that he and the reader should leave, [...] "because there is something I {{want to talk to you}} about".|$|E
50|$|The {{woman is}} located offset {{to the left}} {{relative}} to the center line of the image, whereas the mirror is on the right. The oval mirror with the wooden frame mirrors so as to face viewed approximately {{in the middle of}} the mirror. The mirror has a size so that only the top portion of the woman's breasts seen. The woman raised his right arm covers parts of the mirror image so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the bottom part of the face. In the mirror image is also seen that women do not consider themselves in the mirror, but the gaze directed downward to the left. There is no eye contact with the viewer.|$|E
5000|$|In the [...] "Bat Masterson" [...] episode Brunette Bombshell, Welles was {{the first}} woman to receive an off screen over the knee spanking in a {{television}} show.The episode Brunette Bombshell shows her going face down across Gene Barry's knee and as he spanks her the camera moves up so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> his hand spanking her bottom.You can only see him smiling as he drops his hand down.This was because both Gene Barry and Rebecca Welles were married at the time and he did not think it was proper to spank another man's wife.However, he had no trouble taking her across his knees.Berry is quoted as saying of the episode; [...] "Rebecca Welles was a spoiled brat.She could have used an attitude adjustment badly but I did not believe it was my duty to administer a spanking to another man's wife.|$|E

5000|$|The aerial {{cableway}} from Flims onto Cassonsgrat {{takes you to}} the tear-off edge of the landslide. There is various hikes to this ridge as well. One route uses the ascent via Val Bargis, probably the nicest ascent although <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> actually <b>see</b> the rockslide area before reaching the top.|$|R
50|$|The road now skirts the {{boundary}} wall of Hillington Park on its left and passes the B1153 (southbound) to Grimston on the right. At {{the end of}} the wall on the left the road passes the junction with the northbound B1153 to Flitcham. The road now heads in an easterly direction over undulating West Norfolk countryside towards Harpley. At the 12.2 mi mark, the long distant footpath Peddars Way cross the road south to north at Harpley Dams just before the village. Peddars way is an old Roman road. From here the road inclines sharply. The road has an overtaking lane on the Eastbound carriage way which allows passing only on that carriage way and is marked with double white lines on the westbound carriageway. The village Harpley is bypassed on the right hand side. A brown tourist signpost on the left points out the road to nearby Houghton Hall just out of the village. The next section of the road towards the villages of East and West Rudham are characterised by long straight sections of road. Now having travelled 15.5 mi from the beginning the road reaches West Rudham. In the heart of the village on the left is a 17th-century Inn called the Duke’s Head. The pub is a free house and has log fires. At 16.2 mi the road passes through East Rudham passing {{on the left side of}} the village green and the Crown public house which is located on the eastern side of the green. On the way out of the village the road also passes a pub on the left called the Cat and Fiddle but was formally the Bakers Arms. Further on the road reaches the villages of Tattersett on the left and Coxford on the right and crosses the Culvert of the River Tat a tributary of the River Wensum although <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the river from the road. After passing the junction of the B1454 to Docking on the left (18 mi), the road now crosses an area of rolling hills and dips and passes the former airbase of RAF Sculthorpe on left. The road then drops down towards the village of Sculthorpe by-passing it on the left. At 21.6 mi the road passes the junction of the B1355 to South Creake and the Burnhams on the left. This stretch of road between this junction and before reaching a traffic island which marks the start of the Fakenham by-pass, is called Creake Road.|$|E
40|$|Sec. 95 of Civil Law {{says that}} if a person {{expressed}} his will under a false impression of {{an essential element of}} his legal act, the expression would be void. I insist in this paper that the misunderstanding which causes the invalidity of a legal act should rarely be admitted. If not, you can not enter into a contract feeling at ease. Because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> in appearance if the other party is mistaken or not...|$|E

6000|$|... "Think? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see?</b> If Pontiac {{will only}} turn the youth {{over to our}} tender mercies, we shall hold all of the Morrises in our power." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} girl slowly. [...] "But <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> that {{it is out of}} the {{question}} that I should entrust you with this commission?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you love}} me I beg, I implore, I beseech you {{in the name of}} that love--for your sake and my sake, to leave me. Oh, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> why you must go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To Santa Brigida; but, as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>not</b> direct. I {{expect her}} skipper {{wants to take}} a bearing from the Adexe lights. You are going there and her course {{is the same as}} ours." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{adventures of}} Tittletom (1949) - [...] "It's {{too bad that}} there are a number of things about this little story that are not good ... All in all, as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>not</b> as {{satisfactory}} as her previous books." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The horse {{are out of}} sight,' said Reuben, looking backwards, 'ours as well as theirs. Yet I see a {{clump of}} men over yonder {{at the other side}} of the Avon, and there on the {{hillside}} <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the gleam of steel?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No indeed, never {{since you}} and your mother {{were the first to}} treat me like a human being. You {{will be able to do}} {{anything}} with me, sweetest lady; the very sense that you are under the same roof makes another man of me. I loathe what I used to enjoy. Why, the very sight of you, sitting at supper like the lady in Comus, in your sweet grave dignity, made me feel what I am, and what those men are. I heard their jests with your innocent ears. With you by my side the Devil's power is quelled. You shall have a peaceful beneficent life among the poor folk, who will bless you; our good and gracious Queen will welcome you with joy and gratitude; and when the good time comes, as it must in a few years, you will have honours and dignities lavished on <b>you.</b> <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> what you will do for me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Rat me, if I {{ever say}} a word against the thieves again!' said Sir Gervas. 'I never saw a man wield sword more deftly in my life, and {{he must be a}} rare hand with a pistol to bring those two tall fellows down with two shots. But look over there, Clarke! <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> bodies of red-coats?' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Gordon {{examined}} {{the thing with}} the intimacy of hatred.... Corner Table grins at you, seemingly optimistic, with a flash of false teeth. But what is behind the grin? Desolation, emptiness, prophecies of doom. —For <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> — Behind that slick self-satisfaction, that tittering fat-bellied triviality, there's nothing but a frightful emptiness, a secret despair? And the reverberations of future wars." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} is eventually found {{many years later}} when Lt. Gruber, Helga and Von Strohm return to the town and accidentally knock the arm off the stone statue - inside which is hidden the painting. René (now an old man) takes the painting, then drives away with Yvette, telling Edith, [...] "You stupid woman! <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> - I am eloping!" ...|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 18th, {{signed as}} {{secretary}} of the Republican club, is received. In the matter of making speeches I am a good deal pressed by invitations from almost all quarters, and while I hope to be at Urbana some time during the canvass, I cannot yet say when. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> me at Monticello on the 6th of September? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You ask me why. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> {{answer the}} {{question}} for yourself? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> conceive the fear that was in me that you should shrink away from me in loathing? The fear that if you cared a little, I might for all time stifle such affection as you bore me? The fear that I must ruin your trust in me? Oh, mademoiselle, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> how my only hope lay in first owning defeat to Chatellerault, in first paying the wager?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Bessone was {{the first}} hairdresser to appear on television, and had his own show at Saturday teatime. Regarded as Britain's first celebrity hairdresser, he {{cultivated}} a faux French accent and a camp manner. Bessone liked to pace around his salon and, if a customer approached him, he would then exclaim with exasperation, [...] "Madam, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> that I am meditating!" [...] His Knightsbridge salon was replete with gilt mirrors, chandeliers, and champagne fountains.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} he would! In fact, when I asked him he {{explained}} with such readiness that I cannot help concluding you have both conspired to keep me in the dark. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> that, situated as I am in caring for an invalid who will not let his mind rest, uncertainty is almost worse than the knowledge of disaster to me. Will you not tell me frankly what you fear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Old Samuel hath {{them to a}} penstroke! There {{is another}} ahead of him there, {{with the head of}} a scythe inside his smock. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the outline? I warrant there {{is not one of the}} rascals but hath a pike-head or sickle-blade {{concealed}} somewhere about him. I begin to feel the breath of war once more, and to grow younger with it. Hark ye, lad! I am glad that I did not tarry at the inn.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> {{that she}} was unhappy! She endured many sorrows, and the {{crowning}} calamity of her life was the loss of seven loved sons. They were away in the mountains together, and did not return when expected: for many years she waited for tidings of them. It was conjectured that a great rock had fallen on and crushed them beneath it. Grief for her lost children made her hair white, and gave that expression to her face." ...|$|R
60|$|Hole essential. I {{am sorry}} about the maps; but I want 'em for next edition, so see and have proofs sent. You are quite right about the bottle and the great Huish, I must {{try to make it}} clear. No, I will not write a play for Irving nor for the devil. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> that the work of FALSIFICATION which a play demands is of all tasks the most ungrateful? And I have done it a long while - and nothing ever came of it.|$|R
50|$|Hill Hradištěk is a {{very visible}} local landmark. From the hill <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>not</b> only the town but also many other nearby towns and villages and very many vineyards. Under good weather {{conditions}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> also see monumental Pálava upland, wind farms in Austria and even distant White Carpathian mountains. On the hilltop there is a chapel which is consecrated to four saints: St. Urban (patron saint of winemakers), St. Wenceslas (patron saint of the Czech Lands) and St. Cyril and Methodius (patrons saint of Christianity in the Czech Lands).|$|R
6000|$|... "Fool!" [...] she blazed, {{rising and}} confronting {{him with an}} anger before which he recoiled, appalled. [...] "Do you dare to stand there and prate of honour--you? Do you forget why he stood his trial? Do you forget why he is dying, and <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the vile thing that you are doing in arguing flight, that you talk of honour thus, and deny his claim to it? Mon Dieu! Your effrontery stifles me! La Boulaye was right {{when he said that}} with us honour is but a word--just so much wind, and nothing more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hate you!" [...] cries I, {{and held}} her firm. [...] "You blind lass, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> a little in my wretched heart? Do you think when I set there, reading in that fool-book that I have just burned and be damned to it, I take ever the least thought of any {{stricken}} thing but just yourself? Night after night I could have grat to see you sitting there your lone. And what was I to do? You are here under my honour; would you punish me for that? Is it for that that you would spurn a loving servant?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your speech, Sir James, {{is neither}} courteous nor good," [...] said Knolles, [...] "and if I were {{a free man}} I would cram your words down your throat with the point of my dagger. But I am here to lead these men in profit and honor, not to quarrel with every fool who has not the wit to {{understand}} how soldiers should be led. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> that if I make attempts here and there, as you would have me do, I shall have weakened my strength before I come to that part where it can best be spent?" ...|$|R
