25|$|Grayson {{has been}} {{an outspoken critic of}} the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In May 2010, he {{introduced}} the War Is Making <b>You</b> <b>Poor</b> Act. The bill would require the president to fund the wars from the Department of Defense's base budget. The bill does not necessitate an end to the wars or mandate a cut-off date. In addition to the tax cuts, the bill would cut the federal deficit by $15.9 billion.|$|E

They were always led out crying, {{so one of}} their fellow slaves could mock the bruises and ask then: 'Oh <b>you</b> <b>poor</b> miserable fellow, what's happened to your skin? Surely a huge army of lashes from a whip has fallen down on you and laid waste your back?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The poem {{addresses}} and interrogates {{the concept of}} the noble savage, an idea which had gained popular currency in the Romantic Age which held that those people who live further from [...] "civilization" [...] live [...] "in harmony with nature and a more simple, childlike and blessed life" [...] than the alienated and unhappy people in European cities. Aleko's failure to integrate with the gypsies and his continued insistence on the moral standards of the city in the gypsy encampment challenge the notion that happiness can be found by reverting to nature. The poem closes with a clear attack on the idea of the noble savage: [...] "But even among <b>you,</b> <b>poor</b> sons of nature, there is no happiness! Tormenting dreams live below your bedraggled tents". [...] (ll.562–565) ...|$|E

2500|$|Walter Gratzer, {{professor}} emeritus of biochemistry at King's College London, writes that significant opposition to vivisection emerged in Victorian England, in part in revulsion at the research being conducted in France. Bernard and other well-known physiologists, such as Charles Richet in France and Michael Foster in England, were strongly criticized for their work. British anti-vivisectionists infiltrated the lectures in Paris of François Magendie, Bernard's teacher, who dissected dogs without anaesthesia, allegedly shouting at them — [...] "Tais-toi, pauvre bête!" [...] (Shut up, <b>you</b> <b>poor</b> beast!) — while he worked. Bernard's wife, Marie-Francoise Bernard, was violently opposed to his research, though she was financing it through her dowry. In the end, she divorced him and set up an anti-vivisection society. This was {{the atmosphere in the}} faculty of medicine and the teaching hospitals in Paris when Kingsford arrived, shouldering the additional burden of being a woman. Although women were allowed to study medicine in France, Rudacille writes that they were not welcomed. Kingsford wrote to her husband in 1874: ...|$|E
