6000|$|... 'Well, now, Clementine shall dress <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do with Milly,' {{continued}} Paula. 'Come along. Well, aunt--what's the matter?--and you, Charlotte? You look harassed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} very person!" [...] exclaimed Richard. [...] "He has had just the {{experience}} <b>you</b> desire, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get him at once, too." ...|$|R
30|$|It was {{possible}} yesterday {{for me to}} promise <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> still <b>can</b> consider it today, but it is impossible (for me to consider it) tomorrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "There--I wouldn't {{give myself}} any worry about that, if <b>I</b> was <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> besides, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> settle {{what you would}} do. Are you any {{different}} from me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Joe, I {{know you}} want to see me about something. While these two are having it out indoors, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> talk here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't regret that," [...] said Flora. [...] "I {{like nothing}} so well as waiting on <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> attend {{to my own}} affairs very well here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It's simple enough,' she answers. 'I {{was earning}} my living before I married <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> earn it again. You go your way, I go mine.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} don’t," [...] said Rosa. [...] "I shouldn’t enjoy being out without <b>you</b> neither. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{get all the}} fresh air I want in the garden." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{come from}} home because I'm unhappy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{mean to be}} a gipsy. I'll live with you, if <b>you</b> like, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> teach <b>you</b> a great many things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't understand, but I do. He {{deserves to}} be horsewhipped for daring to write to <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> come across him he shall have it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> work together, Prince Ludwig," [...] he said. [...] "I have sent for the Serbian and Austrian ministers. The former {{should be here}} immediately." ...|$|E

6000|$|LADY W. Well, thank heaven there's no [...] "front" [...] to a revolution. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go {{to glory}} {{together}} this time. Compact! Anything that's on, I'm to abate in.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} of a plan. I'm stronger than <b>you</b> <b>and</b> perhaps <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get her along alone, after she recovers. Can you find the house from here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Dixon {{began to}} {{overwhelm}} him with thanks, but he cut them short. 'I promise nothing. Let me hear what <b>you</b> want, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> judge whether <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will admit}} that my {{experience}} gives me some power of judging for <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> probably guide you in practical matters better than you can guide yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Mr. Bince, [...] "I {{suppose we}} shall see you Thursday, but just bear in mind, please, that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> work better {{together}} than at cross-purposes." ...|$|E

60|$|Isn't it lucky? It's a {{difficult}} position. That irresistible charm of hers will make everything possible. After all, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> agree {{in that we}} both want Arthur to be happy.|$|E
6000|$|... 96. [...] "Don't talk to me! I've known more rich merchants than <b>you</b> have: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell <b>you</b> not ONE of {{them was}} ever an old miser since the world began!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am--one of them. There {{are two of}} us, <b>you</b> know; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{guess who}} <b>you</b> are--you are Captain Niel, whom uncle is expecting {{to help him with}} the farm and the ostriches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do me justice, James," [...] said Lord Avon, {{clasping}} the broad, brown hand {{which the}} country squire had held out to him. [...] "I am as innocent as <b>you</b> are; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> prove it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No {{doubt that}} will make her quite {{independent}} of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> understand that her presence here in such circumstances must be very uncomfortable to you all. No doubt she feels her power." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all," [...] she retorted, [...] "there is {{no great}} {{difference}} between a storekeeper and a farmer. All my city friends know what <b>you</b> are, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find no fault with the way they treat me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What do you demand, Ghost-people?" [...] asked Dingaan. [...] "Cattle are {{somewhat}} scarce here just now, <b>and</b> wives, <b>I</b> think, {{would be of}} little use to you. What is there, then, that <b>you</b> desire, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> give?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{vote the}} girls all {{go into the}} cabin," [...] said Dick. [...] "Sam can go with them if he wants to. Tom, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> stay on deck {{to look after the}} sails." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lynde and I can go {{and bring}} the Captain's {{mattress}} down," [...] said Emily. Now that Alan was safe she was eager to do all she could. [...] "Then <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> carry {{him up to the}} house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've been {{neglecting}} things here, Mangan," [...] he complained. [...] "You {{ought to}} have come down and exorcised that ghost.

6000|$|... "S'pose {{we put it}} {{away for}} a while? It hasn't {{been so long since}} I ate that lot o' quails, <b>you</b> know; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hold on a spell, an' we'll be hungry before we're ready to go to sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No,--not purposely. <b>And</b> if <b>you</b> did, it 's over now. You have {{rejected}} me. I understand that. There's {{no reason why}} <b>you</b> shouldn't. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hold my tongue." [...] He did not turn, but looked steadily past her at the boat's head.|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> do? I ask myself, as a {{woman of}} business, what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> do to help you? I can't give you advice, for I am not on the spot, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't know how {{circumstances}} may alter {{from one day to}} another.
