500|$|... "Adore You" [...] is a pop and R ballad, which {{lasts for}} four minutes and 38 seconds. The song {{performs}} in common time, at a tempo of 60 beats per minute. Played {{in the key}} of C major, the chord structure of C—Fmaj7—Am is followed throughout, and Cyrus's vocal range spans from G3 to A4. Its lyrics discuss [...] "power imbalance in love"; in the chorus, she states her affection towards her boyfriend through the lines [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> need me / Know I need you more / Boy, I adore you", although Kyle Fowle of Slant Magazine felt that Cyrus' reliance in her partner is admittedly detrimental to her personal well-being as the song continues.|$|E
500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; if <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing {{down a couple of}} hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise. McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the radio that people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they {{could find a way to}} implicate him.|$|E

500|$|The song {{has gained}} {{attention}} {{due to its}} explicit lyrics. The song begins with the lyrics [...] "I got a body full of liquor and a cocaine kicker", during the song [...] "a slew of f-bombs" [...] can be heard, and varied graphic descriptions such as: [...] "You got your legs {{up in the sky}} with the devil in your eyes / Let me hear <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> want it all" [...] and the chorus [...] "You and me, baby, making love like gorillas!". Overall, the lyrics portray the subject of having a [...] "romantic evening" [...] of making love like wild animals (gorillas), despite being high from cocaine and drunk from liquor. On September 11, 2013, The Daily Telegraph reported that Dannielle Miller, co-founder of Enlighten Education, decided to appeal to mainstream radio in order to ban [...] "Gorilla", due to its sexual and violent lyrics towards women.|$|E
500|$|... "Electioneering", {{featuring}} a cowbell and a distorted guitar solo, is the album's most rock-oriented track {{and one of}} the heaviest songs Radiohead has recorded. It has been compared to Radiohead's earlier style on Pablo Honey. The cynical [...] "Electioneering" [...] is the album's most directly political song, with lyrics inspired by the Poll Tax Riots. The song was also inspired by Chomsky's , a book analysing contemporary mass media under the propaganda model. Yorke likened its lyrics, which focus on political and artistic compromise, to [...] "a preacher ranting in front of a bank of microphones." [...] Regarding its oblique political references, Yorke said, [...] "What can you say about the IMF, or politicians? Or people selling arms to African countries, employing slave labour or whatever. What can <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> <b>You</b> just write down 'Cattle prods and the IMF' and people who know, know." [...] O'Brien said the song was about the promotional cycle of touring: [...] "After a while you feel like a politician who has to kiss babies and shake hands all day long." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lerner {{points out}} that grey and black {{operations}} ultimately have a heavy cost, in that the target population sooner or later recognizes them as propaganda and discredits the source.

2500|$|Human Nature is an Australian harmony pop group, which {{formed in}} 1989, with Toby Allen, Phil Burton and brothers, Andrew and Mike Tierney. Originally {{they were a}} doo-wop group, the 4 Trax, while the members were schoolmates.

Three of their albums have reached numberone on the ARIA Albums Charts, Counting Down (May 1999), [...] (November 2005) and [...] (October 2006).

2500|$|Backmasking {{has also}} been used to record {{statements}} perhaps too critical or explicit to be used forwards. Frank Zappa used backmasking to avoid censorship of the track [...] "Hot Poop", from We're Only in It for the Money (1968). The released version contains {{at the end of}} its side [...] "A" [...] the backmasked message [...] "Better look around before <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> don't care. / Shut your fucking mouth 'bout the length of my hair. / How would you survive / If you were alive / shitty little person?" [...] This profanity-laced verse, originally from the song [...] "Mother People", was censored by Verve Records, so Zappa edited the verse out, reversed it, and inserted it elsewhere in the album as [...] "Hot Poop" [...] (though even in the backward message the word [...] "fucking" [...] is censored). On the same album, a modified backmasking can be heard in [...] "Harry, You're a Beast" [...] with Madge saying, [...] "Don't come in me, in me" [...] repeatedly before she starts crying. In at least one bootleg version of the album, these words are very clear.|$|E
2500|$|No direct {{orders to}} commit atrocities by Milošević {{have ever been}} discovered, though little or no effort was made by Milošević to punish people deemed {{responsible}} for such atrocities, including Ratko Mladić who, after being accused of allowing atrocities to occur against Croats in Vukovar, was sent to lead the Army of the Republika Srpska, in which capacity Mladić was accused of ordering atrocities, including the murder of thousands of Bosniak men and boys in Srebrenica. Even after the reports of Srebrenica were released, Milošević refused to accept that Mladić {{was responsible for the}} crimes he was accused of. Wesley Clark, {{who was a member of}} the US team that helped negotiate the 1995 peace agreement ending the Bosnian War, claimed in his testimony during the trial of Milošević that Milošević had prior knowledge of the Srebrenica massacre and knew of Mladić's plans. During the negotiations, Clark had asked Milošević: 'Mr. President, <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> have so much influence over the Bosnian Serbs, but how is it then, if you have such influence, that you allowed General Mladić to kill all those people in Srebrenica?' with Milošević answering: 'Well, General Clark... I warned Mladić not to do this, but he didn't listen to me.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example of}} a great {{humanitarian}} action was performed by squad chief Lieutenant Colonel Ushakov, which received from you praiseworthy and commendable words: not entering you in battle because of my injured soldiers, I left for Arkevan and Lankaran through a woody road, wanting to save them from captivity and followed the convoy which was accompanied by unarmed injured soldiers and Russian refugees, totalling 350 people, of whom 260 were injured soldiers, 40 caretakers of the horses, and 50 Russian fugitive soldiers. Having reached all {{of them on the}} road, the battalion led by Ushakov captured only the Russian fugitives, while the other 300 peoples were brutally executed, leaving no single one of them alive, as they were Muslims, despite the fact that all of them were basically walking dead, being injured and unarmed. Is this meant to the people <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> love? Where is your God [...] — Jesus, saying [...] "Love your neighbor as you love yourself, and the raised sword will perish by the sword." [...] Where does it say that we should kill prisoners, and even the sick and injured? Of this atrocity, ferocity, and brutality, are only our soldiers capable of. Based on your Gospel's saying [...] "the raised sword will perish by the sword". — I confidently predict, and foretell that is there is something good for Persia, when your soldiers, will rebel against their rulers themselves and will kill all the generals together with their evil kill for all that they have done to their neighbouring countries, and that there will remain no trace of them.|$|E
