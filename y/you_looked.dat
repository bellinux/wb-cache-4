She later noted, [...] "I remember Billy Drago was awesome–he looked so creepy after makeup.

500|$|Completing {{the ground}} floor was a smaller lounge, and a large garage. The main {{staircase}} to the upper floors was situated in the entrance hall. The house had six bedrooms, with five on the first floor. The giant master bedroom featured a huge double bed, white carpets and an en-suite bathroom complete with sunken bathtub, shower, Jacuzzi and 'his and hers' wash basins. Lennon wanted the guest bedrooms to contain works of art by students of the Liverpool Art College. In particular, two drawings by former Beatles' bassist Stuart Sutcliffe were hung, for what Lennon described as [...] "sentimental reasons". The first floor also had a study. On the top floor was the attic, which Lennon claimed as his own, painting the ceiling one bright colour, then changing to another when the paint ran out, and installing most of his musical equipment there. Outside the house, to the right as <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> down from the sunroom, lay the swimming pool. In 1967, Lennon suggested a mirrored bottom for the pool; being advised {{that this would be}} not only impractical and expensive, but potentially dangerous to swimmers, he settled for a large eye mosaic set in the side. The mosaic was based on the Eye of Knowledge, which was part of the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at this guy you would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You would say {{he was the guy}} who did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of all}} this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E

500|$|According to John Brousseau, the bad {{publicity}} led to {{reforms of the}} Hole. Its inmates were allowed to sleep in proper beds in the [...] "Berthing" [...] quarters elsewhere in the compound. Brousseau describes their new seven-days-a-week routine starting when [...] "they got up, showered, {{then went to the}} dining hall at 9:30. They had 30 minutes for breakfast. Then they walked up to the Hole. They sat down at desks. I have no clue what work they did. They worked until 12:30 or 1 pm. Then they were marched back to the dining hall and had 30 minutes for lunch. Then they were marched back to the Hole and were there until 6 pm." [...] After a 30-minute dinner, they were taken to the study hall and stayed there [...] "for two and a half hours, until about 9:30. Then they went to the Hole again to wrap up their day. At 11 or midnight, they'd get marched back to Berthing." [...] Some of the restrictions on contacting people outside the Hole were also said to have been eased. However, other Church staff were still encouraged to avoid contact with the inmates: [...] "You didn't talk to them, <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> the other way, you'd leave the area if you saw them, it's like the black plague." [...] Brousseau commented: [...] "You stayed away from these people. They're considered the worst of the worst." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{regards to}} casting, Watanabe {{considered}} Kōichi Yamadera to be [...] "really perfect" [...] for Spike. The staff had him audition as a formality, but Watanabe felt that [...] "no matter how <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at it, {{there was only}} Yamadera". After a decade of work in anime series, Yamadera was pleased to secure his first leading role, but Unshō Ishizuka, Jet's voice actor, was surprised that Yamadera was not cast as Jet. The two characters were designed to be opposites, with Spike being thin and wearing smart attire, while Jet was bulky and wore more casual clothing. Spike's English voice actor, Steven Blum, used film noir imagery to get himself in the right frame of mind to voice the character, but experienced some difficulty portraying in scenes where he was showing vulnerability. Reflecting on his performance, Blum said [...] "there were a few lines here and there that I felt were awkward, and could have been smoothed out better." [...] He called Spike an [...] "example of a character [...] didn't fully appreciate until the series was over", adding {{that he would like}} to reprise his role as the character if given the chance. Spike's portrayal was expanded in [...] Specifically, according to Yamadera, the character displayed more of his inner thoughts and showed a gentler side than he did in the series. This was because the team had more time available to express such details. Blum found his performance in the movie one of his most difficult from an emotional standpoint, as there were scenes where Spike was portrayed quite differently from the version he had been playing in the series.|$|E

2500|$|The Vampire Lovers {{were formed}} in 1981, after {{the demise of}} Brisbane punk rock group, The Flying Squad, (who {{featured}} Brendan Kibble and Shane Cooke) Initially with Axle [...] "Axe Babe" [...] Conrad on vocals, Brendan Kibble on vocals and guitar, and Shane Cooke on bass guitar. By 1982 they had enlisted other local musicians, Matt [...] "Nasty" [...] Le Noury on guitar and Dave Chamberlain on drums, to complete the original line up, but Kibble quit shortly after {{and went on to}} form The Bam Balams. The Vampire Lovers named themselves after the 1970 lesbian Hammer Horror movie, of the same name. According to music historian, Ian McFarlane, Brisbane produced [...] "some of the most anarchistic bands of the Australian punk rock era" [...] and that it was a city nationally renowned for its ultra conservatism. Vocalist Axle Conrad suggested to Steve Bell from Time Off magazine that [...] "You were certainly targeted if <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> different in any way. Wearing those clothes was like a badge of honour - the more <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> out there, the more gang you were, the more you perpetuated the 'us versus them' vibe." ...|$|E

[...] Black told him, [...] "Hey man, Elvis sends his love", and lit a cigarette for him, even though the patient in the next bed was in an oxygen tent. A week later, Perkins was given a telegram from Presley (which had arrived on March 23), wishing him a speedy recovery.|$|E
2500|$|Empire {{magazine}} described Ward's 'Wooden Planet' {{concept as}} 'undeniably attractive – {{it would have}} been visually arresting and at the very least, could have made for some astonishing action sequences.'

'Imagine the kind of vertical jeopardy sequence that could have been staged here – the Alien clambering up these impossibly high bookshelves as desperate monks work the platform'.

2500|$|By 1895 Cotton {{had become}} known for portraits {{she had made}} of {{prominent}} European men including the Duke of Cambridge and Otto von Bismarck. Early that year paintings of two men to whom she had social and family connections appeared at Knoedler's Galleries in New York. One showed her husband's friend, Samuel M. Roosevelt and the other showed Howard Potter to whom Cotton was related via her husband's first marriage. Later in the year five portraits by Cotton appeared in a loan exhibition to aid two local charities. A critic for The Sun singled out [...] "Miss E. Winslow" [...] as {{the best of the}} group, saying the portrait contained a [...] "dignity and distinction quite apart from any charm of feature or expression." [...] The critic also defended the dignity conveyed in two other portraits which the critic said had been unfairly criticized as [...] "unnecessarily realistic in regard to the ravages of time." [...] Of the self-portrait a society writer said a viewer at the exhibition would be astonished because the [...] "smiling, young, modish society woman, seemingly coming out of the frame with outstretched hand to greet <b>you,</b> <b>looked</b> too much the woman of fashion to be the hard working artist." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} titled War for several reasons; in 1982, Bono said, [...] "War {{seemed to be}} the motif for 1982," [...] adding that [...] "Everywhere <b>you</b> <b>looked,</b> from the Falklands to the Middle East and South Africa, there was war. By calling the album War we're giving people {{a slap in the face}} and at the same time getting away from the cosy image a lot of people have of U2." [...] The Edge said that [...] "It's a heavy title. It's blunt. It's not {{something}} that's safe, so it could backfire. It's the sort of subject matter that people can really take a dislike to. But we wanted to take a more dangerous course, fly a bit closer to the wind, so I think the title is appropriate." [...] The boy on the cover is Peter Rowen (brother of Bono's friend, Guggi). He also appears on the covers of Boy, Three, The Best of 1980–1990, Early Demos and many singles. Bono described the reasoning behind the cover: [...] "Instead of putting tanks and guns on the cover, we've put a child's face. War can also be a mental thing, an emotional thing between loves. It doesn't have to be a physical thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Beatles' press officer, Tony Barrow, wrote a {{book called}} On the Scene at the Cavern, using the {{pseudonym}} Alistair Griffin. [...] "On the Scene at the Cavern," [...] a book including text as well as photographs from the crowds and performances at the club, was celebrated at a launch party at The Cavern Club in August 1964. [...] In the book, Barrow described in vivid detail the scene at the Cavern Club in its heyday. [...] "Even on a night when the Beatles weren’t billed to appear there were odds-on chances you’d find Paul or George or one of the other boys propping up the counter of The Cavern’s coke bar and chatting to groups of fans," [...] Barrow tells readers of [...] "On the Scene at the Cavern". [...] "And if <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> in at a lunchtime session Cillia Black would have checked your coat into the cloakroom or spooned out a plate of tomato soup for you."
