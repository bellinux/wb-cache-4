5000|$|In 1989, {{she opened}} her own studio, Louise Fili Ltd, specializing {{in the design of}} {{restaurant}} identities and food packaging. “There were a few things I did know when I started my business. I knew I wanted to stay small and I always have. I also wanted to focus on the only three things that interest me: food, type, and all things Italian.” says Louise. During that time, there were few female-run companies, so she knew naming the company after herself could be a liability. But she decided to send a clear message: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> my being female, then I don’t want you as a client.” She has designed identities for many New York City eateries such as Picholine, Artisanal, The Mermaid Inn, and Via Carota, and has created packaging for Sarabeth's, Tate's, and Bella Cucina. Her geometric, often Cubist-looking designs show an affinity to European modernism, in particular, the work of Lucian Bernhard, A.M. Cassandre, Jean Carlu and Italian posters of the 1930s.|$|E

John Luoni [...] The ACLU filed a suit on Sierra's behalf on December 9, 2001 against the school district and Mann, but the suspension was immediately upheld in the Kanawha County circuit court. Sierra's pro bono lawyers claimed that Mann was responsible for disruption, and that he could have taken the opportunity to teach his students about tolerance and constitutional rights instead of making misleading and incendiary comments in the media. The defense countered by saying constitutional rights did not apply equally to adults and students, with the latter not having the same latitude with regards to freedom of speech. Judge James Stucky rejected Sierra's request for a preliminary injunction on November 2, citing her voluntary withdrawal from the county school system, but scheduled a jury trial for her lawsuit for June 24. Stucky ruled that while Sierra was free to believe what she wanted and to express those beliefs, those rights were [...] "not absolute" [...] in a school setting and that the disruption she had caused there overrode her right to free speech. Stucky further declared that he could not guarantee her safety at Sissonville High School.

But, really, it could be a much bigger idea: someone's selling you guns and making money. Selling weapons and the companies that manufacture guns - that's probably the biggest moneymaker in the world." [...] Acknowledging that her heavily politicized lyrics in all of her compositions were [...] "a bit of a jump for people", she told Carolyn E. Davis of MTV in April 2005 that not talking about her experiences in her songs would disqualify her as an artist, noting that [...] "the other point I was making referencing the violence I had seen in Sri Lanka is, if we're going to invest so much money in creating wars around the world, that's quite a given thing. If you've seen somebody get shot and if you've seen a bomb go off, then you've given me total access to talk about it - because you've made that a part of my life. I didn't ask for nobody to bomb my school, but if they did, I would have the right to talk about it. And if people are uncomfortable, then they should think twice before they go off and hit random buildings."
