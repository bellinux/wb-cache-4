50|$|The gearbox of the <b>yaw</b> <b>drive</b> {{is a very}} crucial {{component}} {{since it}} is required to handle very large moments while requiring the minimal amount of maintenance and perform reliably for the whole life-span of the wind turbine (approx. 20 years). Most of the <b>yaw</b> <b>drive</b> gearboxes have input to output ratios {{in the range of}} 2000:1 in order to produce the enormous turning moments required for the rotation of the wind turbine nacelle.|$|E

50|$|The <b>yaw</b> <b>drive</b> is an {{important}} component of the horizontal axis wind turbines' yaw system. To ensure the wind turbine is producing the maximal amount of electric energy at all times, the <b>yaw</b> <b>drive</b> is used to keep the rotor facing into the wind as the wind direction changes. This only applies for wind turbines with a horizontal axis rotor. The wind turbine is said to have a yaw error if the rotor is not aligned to the wind. A yaw error implies that a lower share of the energy in the wind will be running through the rotor area. (The generated energy will be proportional the cosine of the yaw error).|$|E
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} use {{a plurality}} of smaller <b>yaw</b> <b>drives</b> (usually six) to facilitate easy replacement. Such a configuration with plurality of <b>yaw</b> <b>drives</b> often offers the possibility of active yaw braking using differential torque from the <b>yaw</b> <b>drives.</b> In this case half of the <b>yaw</b> <b>drives</b> apply a small mount of torque for clockwise rotation {{and the other half}} apply torque in the opposite direction and then activate the internal magnetic brakes of the electric motor. In this way the pinion-gear rim backlash is eliminated and the nacelle is fixed in place.|$|R
50|$|The gear-rim and the pinions of the <b>yaw</b> <b>drives</b> are the {{components}} that finally transmit the turning moment from the <b>yaw</b> <b>drives</b> {{to the tower}} in order to turn the nacelle of the wind turbine around the tower axis (z axis). The main characteristics of the gear-rim are its big diameter (often larger than 2 m) and the orientation of its teeth.|$|R
5000|$|The roller yaw bearing is {{a common}} {{technical}} yaw bearing solution followed by many wind turbine manufacturers as it offers low turning friction and smooth rotation of the nacelle. The low turning friction permits the implementation of slightly smaller <b>yaw</b> <b>drives</b> (compared to the gliding bearing solution), {{but on the other}} hand requires a yaw braking system.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilize}} the yaw bearing against rotation a means of braking is necessary. One of the simplest ways to realize that task is to apply a constant small counter-torque at the yaw drives in order to eliminate the backlash between gear-rim and <b>yaw</b> <b>drive</b> pinions and to prevent the nacelle from oscillating due to the rotor rotation. This operation however greatly reduces {{the reliability of the}} electric yaw drives, therefore the most common solution is the implementation of a hydraulically actuated disk brake.|$|E
50|$|The yaw drives {{exist only}} on the active yaw systems and are the means of active {{rotation}} of the wind turbine nacelle. Each <b>yaw</b> <b>drive</b> consists of powerful electric motor (usually AC) with its electric drive and a large gearbox, which increases the torque. The maximum static torque of the biggest yaw drives is {{in the range of}} 200.000Nm with gearbox reduction ratios in the range of 2000:1. Consequently, the yawing of the large modern turbines is relatively slow with a 360° turn lasting several minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Roller yaw bearing - Electric <b>yaw</b> <b>drive</b> - Brake: The nacelle {{is mounted}} on a roller bearing and the azimuth {{rotation}} is achieved via a plurality of powerful electric drives. A hydraulic or electric brake fixes {{the position of the}} nacelle when the re-orientation is completed in order to avoid wear and high fatigue loads on wind turbine components due to backlash. Systems of this kind are used by most of the wind turbine manufacturers and are considered to be reliable and effective but also quite bulky and expensive.|$|E
50|$|The gear-rims {{with teeth}} {{on the outer}} surface have the {{advantage}} of higher reduction ratios in combination with the pinions as well as reduced machining costs over the gear-rims with inner teeth. On the other hand, the former configuration requires the <b>yaw</b> <b>drives</b> to be mounted far apart from each other thus increasing the wind turbine main frame dimensions and costs.|$|R
5000|$|Windmills of the 18th century began {{implementing}} rotatable nacelles {{to capture}} wind coming from different directions. The yaw systems of these [...] "primitive" [...] windmills were surprisingly {{similar to the}} ones on modern wind turbines. The nacelles rotated by means of wind <b>driven</b> <b>yaw</b> <b>drives</b> known as fantails, or by animal power, and were mounted on the windmill towers by means of an axial gliding bearing.|$|R
40|$|The present U. S. {{development}} effort toward large horizontal axis WECS {{concentrates on the}} configuration with two rigid blades with collective pitch variation and a <b>yaw</b> gear <b>drive.</b> Alternative configurations without <b>yaw</b> gear <b>drive</b> were considered where the rotor is either selfcentering or where the yaw angle is controlled by blade cyclic pitch inputs. A preliminary evaluation of the dynamic characteristics for these alternative design configurations is presented...|$|R
50|$|After {{generators}} and cable, minor amounts of copper {{are used in}} the remaining equipment. In yaw and pitch auxiliary motors, the <b>yaw</b> <b>drive</b> uses a combination of induction motors and multi-stage planetary gearboxes with minor amounts of copper. Power electronics have minimal amounts of copper compared to other equipment. As turbine capacities increase, converter ratings also increase from low voltage (<1kV) to medium voltage (1kV-5kV). Most wind turbines have full power converters, which have the same power rating as the generator, except the DFAG that has a power converter that is 30% of the rating of the generator. Finally, minor amounts of copper are used in air/oil and water cooled circuits on gearboxes or generators.|$|E
50|$|The active yaw {{systems are}} {{equipped}} {{with some sort of}} torque producing device able to rotate the nacelle of the wind turbine against the stationary tower based on automatic signals from wind direction sensors or manual actuation (control system override). The active yaw systems are considered to be {{the state of the art}} for all the modern medium and large sized wind turbines, with a few exceptions proving the rule (e.g. Vergnet). The various components of the modern active yaw systems vary depending on the design characteristics but all the active yaw systems include a means of rotatable connection between nacelle and tower (yaw bearing), a means of active variation of the rotor orientation (i.e. <b>yaw</b> <b>drive),</b> a means of restricting the rotation of the nacelle (yaw brake) and a control system which processes the signals from wind direction sensors (e.g. wind vanes) and gives the proper commands to the actuating mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Unlike CMU Ballbot, BallIP and Rezero use omni-wheels {{to drive}} the ball. This drive {{mechanism}} {{does not require a}} separate <b>yaw</b> <b>drive</b> mechanism and allows direct control of the yaw rotation of the ball. Unlike CMU Ballbot that uses four motors for driving the ball and one motor for yaw rotation, BallIP and Rezero use only three motors for both the operations. Moreover, they only have three force transmission points compared to four points on CMU Ballbot. Since the contact between an omni-wheel and the ball should be reduced to a single point, most available omni-wheels are not properly suitable for this task because of the gaps between the individual smaller wheels that result in unsteady rolling motion. Therefore, the BallIP project introduced a more complex omni-wheel with a continuous circumferential contact line. The Rezero team equipped this omni-wheel design with roller bearings and a high-friction coating. They also additionally fitted a mechanical ball arrester that presses the ball against the actuators in order to further increase friction forces and a suspension to dampen vibrations. The Adelaide Ballbot uses wheels for its LEGO version and traditional omni-wheels for its full-scale version.|$|E
50|$|The modern <b>yaw</b> <b>drives,</b> {{even though}} {{electronically}} controlled and equipped with large electric motors and planetary gearboxes have great similarities {{to the old}} windmill concept. They still use a means of mechanical energy “production” (i.e. electric motor), a method to increase the torque (i.e. gearbox) and a gear-rim mounted on the fixed portion of the wind turbine and in constant mesh with the output gear of the said gearbox.|$|R
50|$|The {{disk brake}} {{requires}} a flat circular brake disk and plurality of brake calipers with hydraulic pistons and brake pads http://svendborg-brakes.dk/uk/products/brakes/active_brakes.html. The hydraulic yaw brakes {{are able to}} fix the nacelle in position thus relieving the <b>yaw</b> <b>drives</b> from that task. The cost however of the yaw brake {{in combination with the}} requirement of a hydraulic installation (pump, valves, pistons) and its installation in the vicinity of brake pads sensitive to lubricant contamination is often an issue.|$|R

40|$|An {{electronic}} differential for high-performance {{electric vehicles}} with independent driving motors is proposed in this paper. This electronic differential endows the electric vehicle with a close-to-zero vehicle side-slip angle. When vehicle side-slip vanishes, the heading {{direction of the}} vehicle coincides with the velocity direction of the mass centre. In addition to the side-slip angle, the <b>yaw</b> rate is <b>driven</b> towards an optimal value with the proposed electronic differential on-board. The improvements in vehicle side-slip and yaw rate responses are of great significance to the handling performance of high-performance vehicles. In this paper, the mathematical relationships between the vehicle dynamic states and the independent motor torques are revealed, based on which the proposed electronic differential controller is designed. Simulation results manifest that in various challenging steering scenarios, the proposed control method outperforms two common electronic differential control schemes in terms of vehicle side-slip and yaw rate responses...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the implementation of}} a versatile large-eddy simulation (LES) model into an immersed boundary solver and its application to study of swimming and flying in nature. Specifically, we employ the dynamic global coefficient 1 form of the algebraic eddy viscosity model introduced by Vreman. 2 This model is implemented within a Cartesian grid based IBM amenable to flows with moving boundaries. The implementation is then validated against canonical flows including turbulent channel flow and flow past a circular cylinder.

40|$|A {{semi-autonomous}} unmanned {{underwater vehicle}} (UUV), named LAURS, {{is being developed}} at the Laboratory of Sensors and Actuators at the University of Sao Paulo. The vehicle {{has been designed to}} provide inspection and intervention capabilities in specific missions of deep water oil fields. In this work, a method of modeling and identification of yaw motion dynamic system model of an open-frame underwater vehicle is presented. Using an on-board low cost magnetic compass sensor the method is based on the utilization of an uncoupled 1 -DOF (degree of freedom) dynamic system equation and the application of the integral method which is the classical least squares algorithm applied to the integral form of the dynamic system equations. Experimental trials with the actual vehicle have been performed in a test tank and diving pool. During these experiments, thrusters responsible for <b>yaw</b> motion are <b>driven</b> by sinusoidal voltage signal profiles.

40|$|A novel fully {{decoupled}} micro inertial {{measurement unit}} (MIMU) is presented in this paper. The proposed MIMU structure, mostly focusing on the gyroscope unit, is highly symmetrical and can be limited to an area of 10, 000 μm × 10, 000 μm. Both the tri-axis gyroscope and tri-axis accelerometer structures are fabricated on the same single silicon chip, which can differentially detect three axes’ angular velocities and linear accelerated velocities at the same time. By elaborately arranging different decoupling beams, anchors and sensing frames, the drive and sense modes of the tri-axis gyroscope are fully decoupled from each other. Several dynamic models, including decoupling beams with fabrication imperfections, are established for theoretical analysis. The numerical simulation made by MATLAB shows the structural decoupling of three sense modes, and indicates that the key decoupling beams, which affect the quadrature error, can be improved in design. The whole fabrication process, including silicon on glass (SOG) process, dry/wet etching {{as well as the}} methods for improving the fabrication quality, is then shown. Experiments for mode frequency and quality factors of four modes (<b>drive,</b> <b>yaw,</b> pitch and roll) have been performed, and are found to be 455 (6950. 2 Hz), 66 (7054. 4 Hz), 109 (7034. 2 Hz) and 107 (7040. 5 Hz) respectively.

40|$|Manufacturers of wind {{turbines}} have observed {{a new phenomenon}} that appears in high power {{wind turbines}}: excessive wear in the teeth located at 0 º in the pitch bearing. In order to design more efficient wind turbines, manufacturers are increasing the rotor diameter to capture more kinetic energy from the wind to generate more energy, therefore the stress in the joints/unions is increased, {{which leads to the}} elastic deformation of the system. These stresses and deformations increase {{in all parts of the}} wind turbine, the foundations and the tower, <b>yaw,</b> nacelle, <b>drive</b> train and blade unions. All these cases are mainly static unions, except the drive train that transmits torque, the yaw system that turns the nacelle and the pitch system that turns each blade around its axis. The weight of the blades under movement, always working in the most efficient position, causes micro-movements allowed by the elastic deformations and the backlash of the gear transmission that induce an excessive wear at the zero degree position. The same phenomenon is observed in the yaw system, though to a lesser extent. Despite the manufacturer's efforts, a solution that could be implemented in the near future or easily retrofitted in the wind turbines does not yet exist. The aim of this PhD project is to improve the lubrication of the pitch and yaw gear systems of wind turbines through the use of a novel lubrication system based on an array of micro-fabricated channels fitted at the gears' root (dedendum). A micro-nozzle to continuously inject fresh grease in between the teeth in contact has been designed, manufactured and installed in a test bench of a 2 MW wind turbine pitch system. The test bench has been used to characterize the fatigue behavior of the gear surface using conventional wind turbine greases under real cyclic loads, showing a delay of 2 x 10 ^ 4 cycles in the appearance of wear. The proposed micro-nozzle is expected to be compatible with and easily implemented into both newly designed and in-market models. This novel lubrication system will inject fresh lubricant to the gear contact area even when the wind turbine is generating electricity. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a novel fully {{decoupled}} silicon micromachined tri-axis linear vibratory gyroscope. The proposed gyroscope structure is highly symmetrical and can be limited to an area of about 8. 5 mm × 8. 5 mm. It can differentially detect three axes’ angular velocities at the same time. By elaborately arranging different beams, anchors and sensing frames, the drive and sense modes are fully decoupled from each other. Moreover, the quadrature error correction and frequency tuning functions are taken into consideration in the structure design for all the sense modes. Since there exists an unwanted in-plane rotational mode, theoretical analysis is implemented to eliminate it. To accelerate the mode matching process, the particle swam optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted and a frequency split of 149 Hz is first achieved by this method. Then, after two steps of manual adjustment of the springs’ dimensions, the frequency gap is further decreased to 3 Hz. With {{the help of the}} finite element method (FEM) software ANSYS, the natural frequencies of <b>drive,</b> <b>yaw,</b> and pitch/roll modes are found to be 14, 017 Hz, 14, 018 Hz and 14, 020 Hz, respectively.
