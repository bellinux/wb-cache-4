60|$|Penmaenmawr, Aug. 29, 1861.—-Thanks for {{the brief}} notice which <b>you</b> <b>recently</b> took of the Public Schools Commission. I was heartily {{glad to hear}} that you had formed a drastic set of questions. I take the deepest {{interest}} in the object of the commission, and I have full confidence in its members and organs; and at all times I shall be very glad to hear what you are doing. Meantime I cannot help giving you, to be taken for what it is worth, the sum of my own thoughts upon the subject.... The low utilitarian argument in matter of education, for giving it what is termed a practical direction, is so plausible that I think we may on the whole be thankful that the instincts of the country have resisted what in argument it has been ill able to confute. We still hold by the classical training as the basis of a liberal education; parents dispose of their children in early youth accordingly; but if they were asked why they did so, it is probable they would give lamentably weak or unworthy reasons for it, such for example as that the public schools and universities open the way to desirable acquaintance and what is termed “good society.” Your commission will not I presume be able to pass by this question, but will have to look it in the face; and to proceed either upon a distinct affirmative, or a substantial negative, of the proposition that the classical training is the proper basis of a liberal education. I hope you will hold by affirmation and reject negation.|$|E

50|$|A current {{definition}} of the going concern assumption {{can be found in}} the AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No.1 Codification of Auditing Standards and Procedures, Section 341, “ The Auditor’s Consideration of an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern”(AU Section 341). The 'going concern' concept assumes that the business will remain in existence long enough for all the assets of the business to be fully utilized. Utilized assets means obtaining the complete benefit from their earning potential. (i.e. if <b>you</b> <b>recently</b> purchased equipment costing $5,000 that had 5 years of productive/useful life, then under the going concern assumption, the accountant would only write off one year's value $1,000 (1/5th) this year, leaving $4,000 to be treated as a fixed asset with future economic value for the business).|$|E
5000|$|Alissa Wilkinson of Vox wrote, [...] "It's a {{competent}} documentary, though calling it entertaining is a stretch — that {{will depend on}} who's watching. But its very existence brings to life {{some of the problems}} that most plague American political culture — without, unfortunately, really reflecting on what it's doing. Trumped is a missed opportunity. ... The 'inside look' that Trumped promises is not much of an inside look at the title candidate at all. In fairness, that's not really the filmmakers' fault; Trump's brand is built on letting it all hang out, tax returns and physician's reports notwithstanding. Thus, finding something to say that hasn't already been tweeted or stated on camera is almost impossible." [...] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called it a [...] "hastily assembled" [...] film and wrote, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>recently</b> returned to the U.S. after a year-long Peace Corps stint in a remote village with no electricity or mail service, then Trumped: Inside the Greatest Political Upset of All Time will serve as a reasonable primer on the nightmare you missed." ...|$|E

[...] When his book, The Meaning of a Liberal Education was released in 1926, Frederick Paul Keppel, {{the president of the}} Carnegie Corporation proclaimed it as “the most important contribution to the understanding of adult education… this far in the United States.” [...] In March 1928, John Dewey responded to a request from Marie Mattingly Meloney, editor of the New York Herald-Tribune Sunday Magazine, and offered his recommendations on recently published texts on education. Dewey wrote, “I think the best educational books of recent publication are…Martin, The Meaning of a Liberal Education. This {{was not the first time}} Dewey recommended Everett Dean Martin’s book. In 1927, the editors of the Journal of the National Education Association approached Dewey and asked, “What book have <b>you</b> <b>recently</b> found especially worthwhile? Something that you have read easily, eagerly, and with profit, either in the field of education or out of it.” Dewey identified two books; one of them was Martin’s The Meaning of a Liberal Education.|$|E
