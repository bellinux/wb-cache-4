[...] Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, the stars and creators of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, guest starred in the episode as two foodies and performed a hip hop song that makes fun of foodies. Chefs and media personalities [...] Anthony Bourdain, Gordon Ramsay, and Mario Batali also guest starred in the episode, but as themselves in a dream sequence. Although [...] "The Food Wife" [...] has received generally positive reviews from television critics, particularly for the hip hop song, it has also attracted criticism from certain food critics.|$|E

500|$|Actor Diedrich Bader guest {{starred in}} the episode as the sheriff. The Simpsons {{producer}} Ian Maxtone-Graham directed Bader during his recording session, telling the guest star to do a Southern accent. The episode also features guest appearances from talk show host Charlie Rose and film producer Robert Evans as themselves. Evans and Rose appear in a scene {{at the beginning of}} the episode, when Homer stays up late and watches television because of his fear that he might die in his sleep. Rose is seen interviewing Evans on the television, and as they are talking about Evan's film Love Story, Rose says: [...] "And the critics loved it, too. I remember Vincent Canby said, [...] 'I'm going to kill you, Homer. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> dead.'" [...] The last part is imagined by Homer, who has become incredibly sleepy. Later in the interview, when talking about his unsuccessful film The Two Jakes, Evans says: [...] "I said to myself, 'Evans, you forgot Hollywood Rule No. 1: [...] Kill Homer Simpson.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In early July 1778, the Prussian General Johann Jakob von Wunsch (1717–1788) {{crossed into}} Bohemia near the {{fortified}} town of Náchod, {{in the opening}} action of the War of the Bavarian Succession. Nauendorf had only 50 Hussars, but they sallied from their garrison to engage the larger Prussian force. Encountering Wunsch, Nauendorf greeted the old Prussian general and his men as friends; {{by the time the}} Prussians realized the allegiance of the Hussars, Nauendorf and his small force had acquired the strategic advantage. Following a brief skirmish, Wunsch withdrew. The next day Nauendorf was promoted to major. In a letter to her son, Joseph, the Empress Maria Theresa wrote: [...] "They say <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> pleased with the rookie Nauendorf, the Carlstätter or Hungarian who killed seven men, that you gave him 12ducats." [...] Enamored with the possibility of acquiring Bavaria, Joseph encouraged successful raids against the Prussian troops. On 7August 1778, with two squadrons of his regiment, Nauendorf led a raid against a Prussian convoy at Biebersdorf in the County of Kladsko. The surprised convoy surrendered, and Nauendorf captured its officers, 110men, 476horses, 240wagons of flour, and 13transport wagons.|$|E
500|$|When Stewie is {{fantasizing about}} murdering and harming Lois, he {{performs}} several karate and kung-fu moves. This is {{a reference to}} an individual whom Mark Hentemann, a writer for Family Guy, used to know. He was the boy who would come to school, car washes or other events and tell stories {{about the people who}} he had been in physical fights with. During the scene when Stewie describes Lois as being the female version of Bonnie Hunt, MacFarlane comments that he feels bad about that joke, as just before it was broadcast— Hunt telephoned him on his mobile phone and told him about how much she enjoyed the show, however the gag was not removed due to its expected airing date being so close to when the telephone call was made. On the uncut version of this episode, there is a scene where Peter sleepily mistakes Stewie's mouth for Lois's genitals, muttering, [...] "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> ready!" [...] The edited TV version does not have this part, but leaves in the first half, in which Peter sleepily mistakes Stewie's nose for Lois's nipple.|$|E

500|$|... "The Food Wife" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman. The writing process began around September 2010. According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world that I always thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating, but as something that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it. 'I'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork-neck soup restaurant,' and you can kind of claim that as yours. The blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element that I always thought was inherently funny. And when I write Simpsons episodes, I try to start with a world I think is funny, and think, 'What's a good story we can tell in that world, using the characters that we have?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Rosie O'Donnell reacted {{negatively}} to Fink's casting and first solo musical performance. In {{an interview with}} Access Hollywood, she deemed her rendition of [...] "I Know What Boys Like" [...] underwhelming, and stated that it failed to meet her expectations. She called Lauren [...] "so unlikable," [...] and questioned why the producers had not cast a [...] "pretty heavy girl". Fink brushed off O'Donnell's comments. O'Donnell later apologized, and said, [...] "Oh, Ashley – I love your swagger – your acting – your face – your heart – as a famous fat person – I am often asked about the issue… I love the story line – I love the show – and if in any way something I said hurt you – I apologize MORE. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> talented, and I can't wait to hear you belt it…as I know you can—the often misquoted Rosie." [...] Fink was defended by Justin Thompson of Socialite Life, who commented: [...] "I've loved her character and how they've developed her and she's just {{become a source of}} great comedy – is that because she's full-figured? No. Is it because her character is well-written? Yes. It’s kind of sad to see Rosie lambaste what the show is trying to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Patton {{views on}} race were {{complicated}} and often negative. This {{may have been}} cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States. Privately he wrote of black soldiers: [...] "Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor." [...] He also stated that performance {{was more important than}} race or religious affiliation: [...] "I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be a nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>so</b> long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!" [...] Likewise, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies.|$|E

500|$|Dykins later managed several bars in Liverpool, {{which allowed}} Julia {{to stay at}} home at Blomfield Road, to look after Baird, Jackie, a cat named [...] "Elvis", and the 11-year-old Lennon, who had started to visit and {{occasionally}} stayed overnight. Baird would give up her bed to Lennon, and share Jackie's double bed. Dykins used to give Lennon weekly pocket money (one shilling) for doing odd jobs, such as collecting golf balls on the local course, on top of the five shillings that Lennon's Aunt Mimi gave him. During Lennon's visits, he would climb trees with Baird and Jackie, test Baird's spelling, and once gave Baird half-a-crown to leave him alone when he wanted to kiss his first girlfriend. Baird remembered that after Lennon had visited them, her mother would often play a record called, My Son John, To Me <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>So</b> Wonderful, [...] "by some old crooner, and sit and listen to it". [...] "My Son John"—sung by David Whitfield—was released in 1956. Although Mimi sent Lennon to his Aunt's croft in Sango Bay, Durness, Scotland, for his holidays, he later persuaded Mimi to let him take short holidays in North Wales with the Dykins family. Julia took Baird and Jackie to Rosebury Street, Liverpool, to watch Lennon play with The Quarrymen {{on the back of a}} flatbed coal truck on 22 June 1957. Baird was allowed to sit on the back, but as the music was too loud she asked to be taken off. The Quarrymen played twice that day as part of a celebration to mark the 750th anniversary of the granting of Liverpool's charter by King John. Lennon and McCartney would later rehearse in the bathroom of Blomfield Road because they said the acoustics [...] "sounded like a recording studio".|$|E
