Arlin announced the play-by-play action between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia Phillies over KDKA from a box seat next to the first-base dugout. [...] Regular broadcasts began in 1936 by A. K. ′′Rosey′′ Rowswell, a local humorist and friend of owner Bill Benswanger. [...] Rowswell is quoted as describing his broadcasting with, [...] "It's not just play-by-play that matters. [...] It's what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> between the pitches that counts." [...] His style influenced junior partner Bob Prince, who began broadcasting in 1948. Rowswell broadcast games at Forbes Field until his death in 1955.|$|E

I think that the saving of 530 children is, I imagine, the most moving experience a man can have. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> Hebrew: 'The one who saves one life, is {{like the one that}} saved the life of the whole world.' [...] But when you save 530 children, it’s really unforgettable. I want to express, on behalf of our people, our nation, our recognition of your courage, your wisdom, of your determination under extremely difficult conditions".|$|E
2500|$|Theo {{referred}} to these pictorial {{elements in a}} letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: [...] "I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [...] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things." [...] Vincent responded in early November, [...] "Despite what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe {{that in the long run}} you'd get used to it." [...] And later in the same letter, he wrote, [...] "I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Saadia Gaon {{read the}} words of [...] "And your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the Lord your God," [...] to teach that {{if all goes well}} and runs {{smoothly}} for those engaged in the accumulation of money, then they are apt to put their entire trust in money and forget to make mention of their Master and deny their Provider. Reading [...] Hezekiah ben Manoah (the Hizkuni) lamented that the phenomenon of becoming haughty is tragically all too common. Reading [...] Bahya ben Asher taught that pride is the principal cause of forgetting essentials. Due to the abundance of affluence, peace, and tranquility, a person's heart can become haughty and smug, and the evil urge ( [...] , yetzer hara) can find it easy to provoke a person to follow the heart without restraint. When that happens, Heaven's concerns become marginal. In [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> your heart: ‘My strength and the power of my hand has gotten me this wealth,'" [...] Bahya ben Asher read Moses to warn of the possibility that arrogance can lead one to ascribe affluence to one's own lucky stars. And reading [...] "you shall remember the Lord your God," [...] Bahya ben Asher taught that God alone is the Source of good fortune, because God has given people the strength to perform deeds of valor, and has handed people the power to overcome bad fortune in their stars. Abraham ibn Ezra read Moses to warn the Israelites in [...] that they might forget that they were slaves with downcast hearts, forget the affliction and the hunger that they experienced in the wilderness, and forget that God sustained them nonetheless. But Ibn Ezra {{read the words}} [...] "But you shall remember" [...] in [...] to teach that if the thought [...] "My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth" [...] should enter one's mind, then one should remember the One Who gives one power.|$|E
