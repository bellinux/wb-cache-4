500|$|Real estate magnate Donald Trump, head of The Trump Organization since 1971, first {{dabbled in}} presidential {{politics}} in the early summer of 1987. [...] Republican political organizer Mike Dunbar, unimpressed with the candidates for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, founded the [...] "Draft Trump for President" [...] organization. [...] Believing Trump had {{the makings of a}} president, Dunbar pitched Trump the idea of speaking at an event for Republican candidates in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire. [...] According to Dunbar in a later interview, Trump was receptive to this idea. [...] Then a registered Democrat, Trump officially changed his registration to Republican in July 1987. [...] Speculation that he would actually run for president intensified two months later, when he purchased $94,801 worth of full-page advertisements in The New York Times, Boston Globe, and The Washington Post with the heading [...] "There’s nothing wrong with America’s Foreign Defense Policy that a little backbone can’t cure." [...] The advertisements reflected Trump's concerns that Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait were taking advantage of American money and protection without providing any benefit to the United States. [...] The next month, as Dunbar had proposed, Trump appeared at a Rotary Club luncheon in New Hampshire. [...] There, he delivered what The New York Times described as an [...] "impassioned speech," [...] in which he expressed concern about the United States being [...] "pushed around" [...] by its allies and proposed that [...] "these countries that are ripping us off pay off the $200 billion deficit." [...] In the audience, college students held placards reading [...] "Trump for President." [...] Nevertheless, Trump proclaimed, [...] "I'm not here because I'm running for President. I'm here because I'm tired of our country being kicked around and I want to get my ideas across." [...] Later, Trump appeared on the Phil Donahue Show. [...] After the appearance, he received a letter from former President Richard Nixon in which Nixon explained that his wife Pat, [...] "an expert on politics," [...] had seen Trump on the show and [...] "predicts that whenever you decide to run for office <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> winner!"

2500|$|During 1936, von Braun's {{rocketry}} {{team working}} at Kummersdorf investigated installing liquid-fuelled rockets in aircraft. Ernst Heinkel enthusiastically supported their efforts, supplying a He-72 and later two He-112s for the experiments. Later in 1936, Erich Warsitz was seconded by the RLM to Wernher von Braun and Ernst Heinkel, {{because he had}} been {{recognized as one of the}} most experienced test-pilots of the time, and because he also had an extraordinary fund of technical knowledge.

So {{between the ages of}} 12 and 17, I got rebellious and decided this was not for me. I {{was going to be a}} housewife and mother." [...] Reddy's teenage rebellion in favour of domesticity manifested as marriage to Kenneth Claude Weate, a considerably older musician and family friend; divorce ensued and, to support herself as a single mother to daughter Traci, she resumed her performing career, concentrating on singing, since health problems precluded dancing (she had a kidney removed at 17). She sang on radio and television, eventually winning a talent contest on the Australian pop music TV show Bandstand, the prize ostensibly being a trip to New York City to cut a single for Mercury Records. After arriving in New York in 1966, she was informed by Mercury that her prize was only the chance to audition for the label and that Mercury considered the Bandstand footage to constitute her audition, which was deemed unsuccessful. Despite possessing only $200 and a return ticket to Australia, she elected to remain in the United States with 3-year-old Traci and pursue a singing career.|$|E
2500|$|As {{had been}} planned previously, in September 1818 Charles joined his older brother Erasmus Alvey Darwin (nicknamed [...] "Eras") in staying as a boarder at the Shrewsbury School, where he loathed the {{required}} rote learning, and would try to visit home when he could. He continued collecting minerals and insects, and family holidays in Wales brought Charles new opportunities, but an older sister ruled that [...] "it was not right to kill insects" [...] for his collections, {{and he had to}} find dead ones. He read Gilbert White's The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne and took up birdwatching. Eras took an interest in chemistry and Charles became his assistant, with the two using a garden shed at their home fitted out as a laboratory and extending their interests to crystallography. When Eras went on to a medical course at the University of Cambridge, Charles continued to rush home to the shed on weekends, and for this received the nickname [...] "Gas". The headmaster was not amused at this diversion from studying the classics, calling him a poco curante (trifler) in front of the boys. At fifteen, his interest shifted to hunting and bird-shooting at local estates, particularly at Maer in Staffordshire, the home of his relatives, the Wedgwoods.
