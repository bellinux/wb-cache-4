The six-act work was written in vernacular Malay, the lingua franca of the Indies, and was based on E. Phillips Oppenheim's short story [...] "The False Gods". Though in his foreword Kwee Tek Hoay apologised {{for the quality of}} the stage play, writing that [...] "the content and arrangement of this book are far from what <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> neat", Sumardjo praises his language, feeling that the story flowed well.|$|E

She described it as a [...] "very difficult instrument" [...] and stated, [...] "There was so much noise in [...] It was like rrrrrrnnnnngh , I was faking the melody and it was ugly, very weird stuff. I had to really switch this button [...] like don't listen to it and feel what you’'re feeling. It took a while because at the beginning, I was very aware of playing this horrible melody, if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> it a melody, and I knew I had to feel something. It took a few takes because I thought, 'oh, how could [...] listen to that? The cinematographer!' It took a while to ignore that and just be in the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E

500|$|An {{aggressive}} right-handed all-rounder, Loxton {{tended to}} bat in the middle-order, and bowled {{after the new}} ball pacemen. As well as being a belligerent batsman, he was a right-arm fast-medium swing bowler known {{for his ability to}} move the ball, and a powerful outfielder. He had a strong arm and exploited his power frequently, {{to the extent that the}} Australian wicket-keeper Don Tallon complained about the jarring impact of his unnecessarily strong throws when the batsmen were already home and no run out was possible. Loxton was known for his energetic and aggressive approach to cricket, and liked to attack and intimidate opposition batsmen. In one match in the late-1950s, he bowled an eight-ball over at New South Welshman Norm O'Neill consisting entirely of bouncers aimed at the upper body. Loxton was not afraid of opposition bowlers doing the same to him; he had a penchant for trying to hook bouncers out of the ground. He was a predominantly back-foot player whose initial foot-movement tended to be back and towards and then across the stumps. When he committed to a back foot shot, Loxton often made such a decisive retreat that he almost stepped onto his stumps. One painter once captured the Victorian almost disturbing the woodwork with his right leg, leading Loxton to quip [...] "That's what I call using the crease". Hassett said that his fellow Victorian [...] "really used to give everything he had all the time... Put him on to bowl and he'd bowl his hardest, no matter how he felt." [...] Bradman said that Loxton [...] "never shirked the issue" [...] and that [...] "he’d throw himself into it with everything he had. This is one of the reasons he was a great team man. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> on him at any stage and he’d give you his very best." [...] Bradman said that the Victorian all-rounder [...] "was never a great cricketer in the sense that some others were great, but he was a very good player and what he lacked in ability he made up for in effort". He further added that the Victorian was [...] "the very essence of belligerence...His whole attitude suggests defiance and when he hits the ball it is the music of a sledgehammer." [...] Former Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, while agreeing that Loxton was always energetic, regarded his bowling as being too dull and predictable to have any major impact at the highest level, and thought that the Victorian all-rounder’s career would have been best served by saving his energy purely for batting.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for Time, critic Lev Grossman {{said that}} Díaz's novel was [...] "so astoundingly great {{that in a}} fall crowded with heavyweights—Richard Russo, Philip Roth—Díaz is a good bet to run away with the field. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao... the saga of an {{immigrant}} family, but that wouldn't really be fair. It's an immigrant-family saga for people who don't read immigrant-family sagas."

2500|$|In 2008, {{speaking}} to Kerrang!, Max Cavalera remembered: [...] "This certainly {{got in touch}} with the dark side of Sepultura. [...] "Refuse/Resist" [...] is an anti-police song – a real piece of anarchy. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> the album riot music. It was full of heavy shit and some of it was risky, but it was just where we were coming from at the time. [...] "Manifest" [...] is also very close to me. That's about a massacre of prisoners by police at a jail in São Paulo. One hundred and eleven prisoners were killed, and one of my friends was there and took pictures of it all, one of which we used in the artwork." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gaahl is {{strongly}} opposed to Christianity. He {{has often been}} mistaken as a Satanist, but objects to being labeled as such. In a 1995 interview, he stated: [...] "I am my own God as I am my own Satan. So I'm not a Satanist judging by those terms". He jokingly added: [...] "Maybe <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> it Gaahlism". He reiterated this belief in the documentary True Norwegian Black Metal when he said: [...] "The god within yourself is the only true god". In an interview for the documentary —at which time he was Gorgoroth's vocalist—Gaahl was asked what inspired the band's music, to which his sole reply was [...] "Satan". When asked what Satan represented, he again answered with a single word: [...] "Freedom".|$|E
2500|$|Commenting {{on later}} novels in the series, Lester del Rey in Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact wrote of The Hostage of Zir that [...] "here's {{only one way}} to {{describe}} it's a new Krishna novel. And like de Camp's other popular Krishna novels, it's a wry and wacky story of a human forced to contend with the semicivilized and semihuman cultures of an alien world where Murphy's law always holds good, and nothing ever goes according to plan. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> it sword-and-sorcery, since swords are buckled with a touch of swash, and human science is a sort of magic to the too-human but egg-laying Krishnans. But the adventure is always cock-eyed." [...] He concludes that [...] "f you've read and enjoyed the other stories of Krishna, you'll want this one. If you haven't read any, this is a good one to start with." ...|$|E

Paul Meany stated {{in an interview in}} 2006 that if his previous band Earthsuit (a Christian act) [...] "inspired anything, it was what not to do." [...] Drummer Darren King has also stated that he does not consider the band to be Christian.

He believed that this [...] "broken" [...] Sheena had not been seen in her previous works before. CDJournal reviewers noted the song's structure, describing it as [...] "developing into a constantly changing song, as if many songs were in a single song." [...] Reviewer Naoko Saito was very positive on the song, praising the [...] "exploding tricky band sound", calling the song [...] "full of thrills and excitement, like looking at something you shouldn't be". What's In? reviewers called the song a [...] "wild rock tune", noting its [...] "bewildering structure".|$|E
2500|$|In {{summarizing}} the biographical works on Gandhi, Blema S. Steinberg concluded she was decidedly non-ideological. Only 7.4% (24) {{of the total}} 330 biographical extractions posit ideology {{as a reason for}} her policy choices. Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties. Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> me a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term...we used the word [...] because it came closest to {{what we wanted to do}} here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all." [...] Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by Hindustan Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra as [...] "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century." [...] Her campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao (Eng: Remove Poverty), has become the iconic motto of the Indian National Congress. To the rural and urban poor, untouchables, minorities and women in India, Gandhi was [...] "Indira Amma or Mother Indira." ...|$|E
