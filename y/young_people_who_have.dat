40|$|There {{have been}} serious {{concerns}} in the UK {{about the number of}} <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are looked after in state care but are also young offenders. The relationship between the care system and offending is complex, since there are shared risk factors, in particular histories of poor parenting, abuse and neglect. This article reports on a mixed methods study. It focuses on findings regarding a sample of 100 <b>young</b> <b>people</b> (age 14 - 19), using data from file searches, psychological measures and narrative interviews. The sample was made up of three sub-samples - looked after <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> offended, looked after <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not offended and <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> offended but were not looked after. This paper presents the study’s findings in relation to the characteristics and pathways of these groups. It emphasises the range and interaction of individual, family and education and activity risk and resilience factors. In particular, it highlights the role of social cognition deficits in increasing the risk of offending for <b>young</b> <b>people</b> in state care...|$|R
25|$|In England and Wales, a Youth Offending Team (YOT) is a multi-agency {{team that}} is coordinated by a local authority, which is overseen by the Youth Justice Board. It deals with young offenders, sets up {{community}} services and reparation plans, and attempts to prevent youth recidivism and incarceration. YOTs were set up following the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act {{with the intention of}} reducing the risk of young people offending and re-offending, and to provide counsel and rehabilitation to those who do offend. Youth Offending Teams engage {{in a wide variety of}} work with young offenders (those under 18) in order to achieve their aims. YOTs supervise <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been ordered by the court to serve sentences in the community or in the secure estate.

2500|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{societal}} and scientific arguments about whether the content of video games [...] change the behavior and attitudes of a player, and whether this is reflected in video game culture overall. Since the early 1980s, advocates of video games have emphasized their use as an expressive medium, arguing for their protection under the laws governing freedom of speech and also as an educational tool. Detractors argue that video games are harmful and therefore should be subject to legislative oversight and restrictions. The positive and negative characteristics and effects of video games are the subject of scientific study. Results of investigations into links between video games and addiction, aggression, violence, social development, and a variety of stereotyping and sexual morality issues are debated. A study was done that showed that <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had a greater exposure to violence in video games ended up behaving more aggressively towards people in a social environment.|$|E

Boyle, a {{pharmacist}} of Irish-Catholic background, and Karen Cornell, an accountant and psychic of Jewish background. Cornell described both of his parents as alcoholics. Cornell was the middle child of six children; he had two older brothers and three younger sisters. He attended Christ the King Catholic elementary school, where he performed {{for the first time}} in front of a crowd, singing the 1960s anti-war song [...] "One Tin Soldier". He later attended Shorewood High School. When he was in seventh grade, his mother pulled him and his sister out of Catholic school; Cornell claimed because they were about to be expelled for being too inquisitive. Cornell recalled the episode in a 1994 interview: [...] "With a religion like that, it's not designed for anyone to question. Being <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a natural curiosity and half a brain, you're going to start finding inconsistencies, which there are tons of in organized religion.

Formerly, before {{his interest in the}} newspaper had lapsed at all, he used to give his Sunday leisure to making selections and writing paragraphs for it; but he now let the pile of exchanges lie unopened on his desk, and began to rummage through the letters scattered about in it. They were mostly from young ladies with whom he had corresponded, and some of them enclosed the photographs of the writers, doing their best to look as they hoped he might think they looked. They were not love-letters, but were of that sort which the laxness of our social life invites <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> met pleasantly, to exchange as long as they like, without explicit intentions on either side; they commit the writers to nothing; they are commonly without result, except in wasting time which is hardly worth saving.

They turn towards the fields. The girl's countenance brightens, and an unwonted glow rises in her face. They are going to Hampstead or Highgate, to spend their holiday afternoon in some place where they can see the sky, the fields, and trees, and breathe {{for an hour or two}} the pure air, which so seldom plays upon that poor girl's form, or exhilarates her spirits.|$|E
