5|$|BioWare's Baldur's Gate {{series was}} no less important, the most {{significant}} D series to be released since the Gold Box era. The games created the most accurate and in-depth D simulation <b>yet,</b> <b>and</b> featured support for up to six-players in cooperative mode. Baldur's Gate (1998) provided an epic story with NPC followers and written dialogue that continued through both titles and two expansion packs. Black Isle produced a more combat-oriented series, Icewind Dale, soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|During {{these early}} years, student life was molded by the Corps of Cadets. The Corps {{was divided into}} a {{battalion}} of three companies, and rivalry among the companies was strong, giving birth to the Aggie spirit and future traditions. No bonfires, yell practices, or athletics teams existed as <b>yet,</b> <b>and</b> social clubs and fraternities were discouraged.|$|E
5|$|Fish thrived for {{a limited}} time in Sulphur Creek between the {{introduction}} of perennial flows and the devastating floods {{at the end of}} the 20th century. These floods wiped out many of the remaining riparian areas lining waterways in the watershed. Despite the massive environmental degradation in the Sulphur Creek watershed, it is not biologically dead, <b>yet</b> <b>and</b> still supports some native species. Work is under way in the watershed to remove non-native species and restore native riparian vegetation.|$|E

5|$|US-62 was realigned for a {{third time}} on September 4, 1961. This routing was only meant to be temporary, {{following}} Agnew, Exchange, and Reno Avenues to downtown. This change was followed up by the September 4, 1963 rerouting, which put US-62 onto its present-day routing (though I-240 did not exist <b>yet,</b> <b>and</b> I-44 still ended at I-35).|$|E
5|$|A {{planning}} {{office was}} established in 1962, initially led by Erik Himle. The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968, and construction started in 1971. The rationale for {{the building of the}} station was that Frogner was to be developed as a dense, commercial district. However, to cut costs with the Oslo Tunnel, it was decided that parts of Nationaltheatret would not be built <b>yet,</b> <b>and</b> that Elisenberg Station would not open until after the tunnel was completed. By 1978, the platform area had been built, but the access way had not. The investments cost 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK), 75 mill. of 1998 standard. The Oslo Tunnel opened, without Elisenberg Station, on 1 June 1980.|$|E
5|$|Dark Gaia then attacks Sonic and Chip, but Chip protects Sonic {{and calls}} {{all of the}} Gaia temples {{together}} to form the Gaia Colossus and fight Dark Gaia. The Gaia Colussus seemingly destroys Dark Gaia, but Dark Gaia is not finished with them or the Earth <b>yet,</b> <b>and</b> consumes the entire world in darkness, becoming Perfect Dark Gaia in the process. Chip then gives the restored Chaos Emeralds to Sonic, allowing him to turn into Super Sonic and destroy it; Dark Gaia then sinks back into the planet, but the battle takes its toll on Super Sonic. Chip saves Sonic by throwing him to the surface, before returning himself {{to the inside of}} the planet; he leaves behind his necklace and some parting words. Sonic places the necklace on his hand as a bracelet to remind him of their adventure together before speeding off with Tails, flying alongside him on the coastline in the Tornado plane.|$|E

5|$|Larry Wilmore, {{who plays}} the {{sensitivity}} trainer Mr. Brown, is {{a writer for the}} show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part <b>yet</b> <b>and</b> Daniels had Wilmore read for the role to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels thought he was perfect for the role. However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors for the role. Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, is far from the bubbly, chatty character that Kelly later becomes.|$|E

5|$|The {{attendant}} tells Scully that Mr. Milsap is {{the only}} person with a working phone, but she discovers that the line is dead. Mr. Milsap offers Scully a room at the local boarding house, but Scully tries the rest of the town only to be ignored by everyone; they are all too engrossed in Bible study groups. Disturbed by the turn of events, she keeps her gun close at hand. The next morning, Mr. Milsap tells Scully that there is a man who needs help downstairs. She goes with him and finds the hitchhiker from the teaser having a seizure. She advises them {{to take him to the}} hospital, but they pretend that they do not have any cars. While examining the man, Scully discovers a strange circular wound on his back. Meanwhile, Doggett calls the local sheriff and learns that Scully has not arrived <b>yet,</b> <b>and</b> so he sets out to find her.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} {{elements of the}} cathedral are so specifically detailed and the elements of Gothic and contemporary architecture so well delineated, that art and architecture historians have concluded that van Eyck must have had enough architectural knowledge to make nuanced distinctions. More so, given the finesse of the descriptions, many scholars have tried to link the painting with a particular building. <b>Yet,</b> <b>and</b> as with all buildings in van Eyck's work, the structure is imagined and probably an idealised formation of what he viewed as a perfect architectural space. This is evident {{from a number of}} features that would be unlikely in a contemporary church, such as the placing of a round arched triforium above a pointed colonnade.|$|E

The records {{for the first three}} films have since been surpassed. The next three X-Men films after X-Men: The Last Stand opened lower than their predecessor and didn't set opening records. In North America, Deadpool is the highest-grossing film in the series, and it also has the highest opening weekend. Outside North America, X-Men: Days of Future Past has the highest opening weekend and is the highest-grossing film in the series. Worldwide, Deadpool is the highest-grossing film in the series and the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.|$|E

It is the first planet discovered to have a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits in a direction counter to the rotation of its host star. This discovery challenged traditional planetary formation theory. In terms of diameter, WASP-17b is the second-largest exoplanet discovered <b>yet,</b> <b>and</b> at half Jupiter's mass, this makes it the most puffy planet known.

5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her <b>yet,</b> <b>and</b> they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E
5|$|It {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium-254, which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms,Es|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=122|pages=411–417|year=1986|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(86)90435-2|first10=R.

L.|displayauthors=9}} to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories, and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of ultraheavy elements. However, given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table, it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions, and indeed attempts to synthesise it in 2019 and 2020 are currently planned at laboratories at Japan and Russia. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered <b>yet,</b> <b>and</b> it is also possible, due to drip instabilities, that only the lower period 8 elements, up to around element 128, are physically possible. No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals, such as unhexpentium, due to their extremely high atomic number: they would require new, more powerful technology to make.|$|E
