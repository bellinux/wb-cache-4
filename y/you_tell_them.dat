And then I went and I played it for [...] and I just {{basically}} told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing. And so that song specifically, you know, I did everything." ...|$|E

500|$|For In the Zone, Spears {{worked with}} hit {{producers}} such as Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Diddy, Christopher Stewart, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix. She first started writing songs for In the Zone during the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring, [...] "The {{only thing that}} was scary {{to me is that}} I didn't know if they were good. [...] You can’t trust anybody. You have to go with your feelings." [...] Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was [...] "Everytime", which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", as well as [...] "Shine", written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in May 2003. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took time to work with different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for In the Zone was [...] "Touch of My Hand", and Spears said it [...] "really did provide a balance {{for the rest of the}} record. We just went from there." [...] Following the recording sessions for [...] "Everytime", Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying, [...] "I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing." ...|$|E

2500|$|While camped {{beside the}} Australian Light Horse outside Bloemfontein with Lord Roberts' army, the New South Wales Lancers {{with the rest}} of French's cavalry, waited to move. At this time both men and horses {{suffered}} continuously rainy weather and cases of enteric were taken away every day. Major Allenby, appointed to command the squadron of New South Wales Lancers, arrived one evening towards midnight. He was about to walk in on a rum soaked officers' mess, when he was intercepted by an acquaintance, (A. B. Paterson who later commanded Remounts during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War) who informed Allenby the mess were just drinking his health. He replied, [...] "I heard you. But that's no excuse for keeping the whole camp awake. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> to be in bed with all lights out, in five minutes, or I'll {{have to do something about}} it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The witness {{tampering}} {{charges were}} based on text messages Ravi sent to Wei, in which he tried to persuade her not to contradict what he had told police. In these messages, Ravi said [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> we did it on purpose?", and [...] "Because I said we were just messing around with the camera." [...] Wei responded [...] "Omg dharun why didnt u talk to me first i told them everything". According to a prosecution expert witness, Ravi deleted almost 100 text messages between him and Wei and another high school friend, whom he had invited to view Clementi's second encounter with his guest. A key aspect of the prosecution's evidence tampering charge was Ravi's deletion of two potentially incriminating postings: one on Twitter on September 19 in which he wrote that his roommate was [...] "making out with a dude. Yay", and one on September 21 in which he told his iChat followers [...] "dare you to video chat me" [...] {{during the time of}} Clementi's tryst. He replaced the latter post with one that said [...] "don't you dare video chat me" [...] {{at the time of the}} tryst, stating that the first message was a draft. Ravi was charged with third and fourth degree invasion of privacy.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{findings}} of the inquiry into Wright's death were released in September 2010, Ulster Television News broadcast a report regarding the question of collusion. South Belfast UDA brigadier Jackie McDonald explained to Ulster Television's Live Tonight the UVF's mindset at the time Wright was threatened with execution by the CLMC in 1996, [...] "It was obvious he [...] was doing his own thing and going his own way. I think he had become such an embarrassment to the UVF that they had to send word to him {{to get out of the}} country – that's when the LVF was formed, that's when the breakaway group appeared." [...] When asked by the interviewer whether or not the CLMC had actually been prepared to carry out the death threat against Wright McDonald replied, [...] "You have to be prepared to kill people if <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> to do something and they don't do it – something of that magnitude. If you say they had to go and they don't go – the defiance alone, it doesn't leave many alternatives". McDonald expressed his personal belief that there had probably been no state collusion in Wright's death. Equally dismissive of the allegations of collusion, Willie Gallagher of the Republican Socialist Movement offered the suggestion that had the INLA not killed Wright, he would have been released from prison shortly afterwards. Once free, Wright would have continued to conduct and orchestrate his murder campaign against nationalists.|$|E
