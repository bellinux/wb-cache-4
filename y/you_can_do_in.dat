The strings in the song were arranged by Carl Bagge, and played by various cello and violin players. The song alongside [...] "Hang with Me" [...] {{were among the first}} songs to be recorded for the Body Talk series, and Robyn said that she saved them for a later release because [...] " [...] knew they would be singles, or could be singles, and [...] wanted them to get that chance." [...] Robyn described the song to The Macomb Daily as [...] "a love song ... about what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> a club". In an interview with MTV News, she elaborated on the song's theme and message, saying, [...] "I think 'Indestructible' is a song that talks about what happens when you meet new people and fall in love, and how that can be scary and fun at the same time." ...|$|E

Gardiner turned down several chances to run provincially and federally. Gardiner chose instead to concentrate on his own career in business. [...] "There is nothing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> politics that makes the cash register ring." [...] Gardiner was even considered to run for the leadership of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party (and therefore provincial premier) in 1948, but chose to support Leslie Frost instead.

[...] He has premiered 13 full-length plays at Georgia theaters since 2009. He lists among his influences fellow Mississippi-native writers Ida Bell Wells, Eudora Welty, Beth Henley, and Richard Wright. His emphasis as a playwright is on comedy, believing that laughter is crucial for audience engagement. As he explained to Backstage Magazine in 2015, “If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make someone laugh, they listen. And they lean in {{and they want to}} hear more. And once you have that level of engagement, then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> start layering in a message that you want them to take away. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that <b>in</b> film. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that <b>in</b> a book.
