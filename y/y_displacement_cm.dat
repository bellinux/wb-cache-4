40|$|A noncontact {{position}} sensor {{has been designed}} for use with a specific two-dimensional linear electromagnetic actuator. To minimize the bulk and weight added by the sensor, the sensor has been made {{an integral part of}} the actuator: that is to say, parts of the actuator structure and circuitry are used for sensing as well as for varying position. The actuator (see Figure 1) includes a C-shaped permanent magnet and an armature that is approximately centered in the magnet gap. The intended function of the actuator is to cause the permanent magnet to translate to, and/or remain at, commanded x and y coordinates, relative to the armature. In addition, some incidental relative motion along the z axis is tolerated but not controlled. The sensor is required to measure the x and <b>y</b> <b>displacements</b> from a nominal central position and to be relatively insensitive to z displacement. The armature contains two sets of electromagnet windings oriented perpendicularly to each other and electrically excited in such a manner as to generate forces in the x,y plane to produce the required motion. Small sensor excitation coils are mounted on the pole tips of the permanent magnet. These coils are excited with a sine wave at a frequency of 20 kHz. This excitation is transformer-coupled to the armature windings. The geometric arrangement of the excitation coils and armature windings is such that the amplitudes of the 20 -kHz voltages induced in the armature windings vary nearly linearly with x and <b>y</b> <b>displacements</b> and do not vary significantly with small z displacements. Because the frequency of 20 kHz is much greater than the maximum frequency characteristic of the actuation signals applied to the armature windings, there is no appreciable interference between actuator and sensor functions of the armature windings...|$|R

Moreover, the projection error increases by increasing the diverge angle, and drops when the platform starts to verge, the error is not constant; {{this is due to the}} position of the target: the images started to overlap, which led to a drop in the error. Figure  11 shows that, when the verge angle starts to increase, the projection error starts to decrease, where the target gets close to the horopter.

However, the optimal placement of the stiffener curves has remained a challenge, both due {{to the presence of}} multiple local minima in the design space, as well as the associated CPU cost to solve the problem. This paper presents a new approach to designing the stiffener curves based purely upon the first buckling mode of the unstiffened panel. The approach defines a heuristic metric for the effectiveness of a stiffener in increas-ing the buckling load capacity of a panel. The stiffener curve with the highest metric should then provide the lowest optimum mass for the stiffened panel. Optimization results with parametric studies show that the approach provides an extremely cost effective method to obtain stiffener curves giving near-optimal panel weight.

Two questions were addressed with this study concerning the new SRSD: 1) whether spine movement was occurring with the methodology, and 2) where movement was taking place. Methods Sixty-five subjects performed seven trials of repositioning to a two-thirds full flexion position in sitting with X and <b>Y</b> <b>displacement</b> measurements {{taken at the}} T 4 and L 3 levels. The thoracolumbar angle between the T 4 and the L 3 level was computed and compared between the positions tested. A two (vertebral level of thoracic and lumbar) by seven (trials) mixed model repeated measures ANOVA indicated whether significant differences were present between the thoracic (T 4) and lumbar (L 3) angular measurements. Results Calculated thoracolumbar angles between T 4 and L 3 were significantly different for all positions tested indicating spinal movement was occurring with testing.

40|$|BACKGROUND:. Hemiparetic gait {{following}} stroke requires substantial energy consumption, which would promote deconditioning and disability. Optimal modalities for decreasing this energy cost remain challenging. Excessive energy consumption, however, {{seems to be}} mainly due to extra positive muscle work to substantially lift the body's center of mass (CM) against gravity during the paretic limb swing. OBJECTIVE:. The authors tested a new rehabilitation strategy in a pilot study to specifically reduce the energy cost in hemiparetic gait. METHODS:. Six chronic hemiparetic patients underwent a 6 -week gait training program on a treadmill with real-time feedback of their CM {{and were asked to}} reduce its increased vertical displacement. The authors assessed the walking energy cost, vertical <b>CM</b> <b>displacement,</b> kinematics, and electromyogram activity without feedback before and after treatment. RESULTS:. After treatment, the vertical <b>CM</b> <b>displacement</b> decreased by 10 % (P =. 005), particularly when the CM vaulted over the nonparetic limb in stance, and the energy cost decreased markedly by 30 % (P =. 009). The paretic knee flexion in swing increased concomitantly by 45 % and muscle co-contraction decreased significantly in both thigh muscles by 15 %. CONCLUSIONS:. The rehabilitation approach followed in this study seems remarkably effective in decreasing the walking energy cost. By treating the compensatory strategy (ie, the increased <b>CM</b> <b>displacement),</b> we also appear to treat primary deviations such as poststroke knee impairments, which is novel and complementary to current concepts in rehabilitation.

40|$|Nanomanipulation and nanoimaging with Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM) is {{a popular}} {{technique}} for nano-manufacturing. However, under ambient conditions without stringent environment control, nanomanipulation tasks are difficult to complete because various system drift can cause uncertainties of the spatial relationship between the AFM probe tip and the nano-entities to be manipulated. Researchers have speculated that thermal drift {{is one of the}} major causes of errors for nanomanipulation using AFM systems, but to this date, quantitative analyses of AFM drift phenomenon are almost non-existent. This paper gives a detection and analyses method for AFM operating-drift based on automated sequential image processing, which provides a quantitative understanding of the AFM drift phenomenon. Essentially, the drift of an AFM system can be measured by a Phase-Correlation Method among consecutively scanned images. In order to eliminate the effects of z-direction drifts in x, <b>y</b> <b>displacements,</b> a gradient calculation method is introduced. The influence of a PZT actuator&# 39;s thermal expansion on overall system drift is also analyzed.

40|$|Human walking has a {{peculiar}} straight-legged style. Consequently, the body's {{centre of mass}} (CM) moves {{up and down with}} each step, which is noticeable in their up and down head bobbing while walking. This vertical CM movement enables humans to save energy via a pendulum-like mechanism but is probably a relatively recent locomotor innovation insofar as earliest bipeds may have walked flexed and flat. We investigated the mechanics, energetics, muscle efficiency and optimization of human walking by decreasing and increasing the vertical <b>CM</b> <b>displacement</b> (flat and bouncy walking) in comparison to normal walking at six speeds (1 – 6 km h− 1). In both flat and bouncy walking, the pendular mechanism was reduced and the energy cost was increased. However, this increase was unexpectedly much sharper in flat walking where muscles provided normal mechanical work but with a decrease in muscle efficiency. In bouncy walking, muscles provided extra mechanical work in an efficient way. Our results showed that not only do humans bob up and down in normal walking to save energy via a pendulum-like mechanism but also to make their muscles work efficiently. Actually, walking flat makes the muscles work in unfavourable conditions that waste energy. Furthermore, we are still close to a flat <b>CM</b> <b>displacement</b> relative to our current ability to change this displacement, which suggests that reducing vertical <b>CM</b> <b>displacement</b> is indeed important but only to certain limits.

We performed the first blinded comparison of Fahn–Tolosa–Marín (FTM) ratings and tablet measures of essential tremor {{to determine if a}} digitizing tablet is better than 0 – 4 ratings in detecting changes in essential tremor that exceed random variability in tremor amplitude. Methods:  The large and small spirals of FTM were drawn with each hand on two consecutive days by 14 men and four women (age 60 ± 8. 7 years [mean±SD]) with mild to severe essential tremor. The drawings were simultaneously digitized with a digitizing tablet. Tremor in each digitized drawing was computed with spectral analysis in an independent laboratory, blinded to the clinical ratings. The mean peak-to-peak tremor <b>displacement</b> (<b>cm)</b> in the four spirals and mean FTM ratings were compared statistically. Results:  Test–retest intraclass correlations (ICCs) (two-way random single measures, absolute agreement) were excellent for the FTM ratings (ICC 0. 90, 95 % CI 0. 76 – 0. 96) and tablet (ICC 0. 97, 95 % CI 0. 91 – 0. 99). Log 10  tremor amplitude (T) and FTM were strongly correlated (log T  =  α FTM +  β,  α ≈ 0. 6,  β ≈– 1. 27, r = 0. 94).

When operators are no longer exposed to whole-body vibration (WBV) generated by their vehicle, their sensorimotor coordination and body representation remain altered. A sensorimotor treatment based on a set of customized voluntary movements is tested to counter and prevent potential post-work accidents due to prolonged exposure to WBV. This treatment includes muscle stretching, joint rotations, and plantar pressures, all known to minimize the deleterious effects of prolonged exposure to mechanical vibrations. The postural {{stability of}} participants (drivers; N = 12) was assessed via the area of an ellipse computed from the X and <b>Y</b> <b>displacements</b> of the center-of-pressure (CoP) in the horizontal plane when they executed a simple balance task before driving, after driving, and after driving and having performed the sensorimotor treatment. An ancillary experiment is also reported in which a group of non-driver participants (N = 12) performed the same postural task three times during the same day but without exposure to WBV or the sensorimotor treatment. Prolonged exposure to WBV significantly increased postural instability in bulldozer drivers after they operated their vehicle compared to prior to their day of work. The sensorimotor treatment allowed postural stability to return to a level that was not significantly different from that before driving. The results reveal that (1) the postural system remains perturbed after prolonged exposure to WBV due to operating a bulldozer and (2) treatment immediately after driving provides a ``sensorimotor recalibration'' and a significant decrease in WBV-induced postural instability. If confirmed in different contexts, the postural re-stabilizing effect of the sensorimotor treatment would constitute a simple, rapid, inexpensive, and efficient means to prevent post-work accidents due to balance-related issues...|$|R
