500|$|As {{leader of}} the Whigs and a {{powerful}} legislator (as well as a frustrated presidential candidate in his own right), Henry Clay expected to have substantial influence in the Harrison administration. He ignored his own platform plank of overturning the [...] "spoils" [...] system. Clay attempted to influence Harrison's actions before and during his brief presidency, especially in putting forth his own preferences for Cabinet offices and other presidential appointments. Harrison rebuffed his aggression, saying [...] "Mr. Clay, <b>you</b> <b>forget</b> that I am the President." [...] The dispute intensified when Harrison named Daniel Webster, Clay's arch-rival {{for control of the}} Whig Party, as his Secretary of State, and appeared to give Webster's supporters some highly coveted patronage positions. Harrison's sole concession to Clay was to name his protégé John J. Crittenden to the post of Attorney General. Despite this, the dispute continued until the President's death.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} was not close, it was 7–2 on the principal {{issue of whether}} {{there had been a}} constitutional violation... But what if it was unconstitutional to have that recount?

Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated that during the interpretation of the lyrics, Rihanna is proud and sexual and her confidence comes from elsewhere. Rihanna reveals her sex fantasies through singing the lyrics: [...] "I'mma do it do it do it/On the bed on the floor on the couch/Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth/Just because I can't kiss back/Doesn't mean you can't kiss that", which were described as the [...] "nastiest" [...] on the song by Brad Wete of Complex.
