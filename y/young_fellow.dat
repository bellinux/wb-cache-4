[...] Chandler proposed that he be the presidential nominee with Kennedy as the nominee for vice-president, but the convention chose Kennedy for president instead.|$|E
500|$|Hay and Nicolay divided their responsibilities: Nicolay {{tending to}} assist Lincoln {{in his office}} and in meetings, while Hay dealt with the correspondence, which was very large. Both men tried to shield Lincoln from office-seekers and others who wanted to meet with the President. Unlike the dour Nicolay, Hay, with his charm, escaped much of the hard {{feelings}} from those denied Lincoln's presence. Abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson described Hay as [...] "a nice <b>young</b> <b>fellow,</b> who unfortunately looks about seventeen and is oppressed with the necessity of behaving like seventy". Hay continued to write, anonymously, for newspapers, sending in columns calculated to make Lincoln appear a sorrowful man, religious and competent, giving of his life and health to preserve the Union. Similarly, Hay served as what Taliaferro deemed a [...] "White House propagandist", in his columns explaining away losses such as that at First Manassas in July 1861.|$|E

Len Hutton, another who was coached by Hirst, wrote [...] "I shall always think of George Hirst as the ideal coach. He was a 'natural' one, the guide, the philosopher, and friend of every <b>young</b> <b>fellow</b> who has had a trial under him". Part of Hirst's success at Eton came from his personality and ability to extract the best from people. Bowes noted how his enthusiasm inspired young players, and his humour and kindness led boys to worship him. He could pass on technical knowledge {{in a way that was}} easy to comprehend, backed up with anecdotes to illustrate his point. Bowes described how [...] "he had a rare skill in noting and demonstrating your faults and no less skill in illustrating the remedies".|$|E
500|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, Ramsey was conscripted into the British Army on 24 June 1940. He was assigned to the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and underwent his initial training in Truro, where he and other recruits were housed in a hotel commandeered by the army. Ramsey found the experience a thrilling adventure. [...] "Until I travelled to Cornwall, the longest journey I had undertaken was a trip to Brighton by train," [...] he recalled. [...] "It was the first time I had ever been into a hotel! Even with us sleeping twelve to a room, on straw mattresses, could not end for me the awe of living in a swagger hotel." [...] "That set the tone for Alf's war," [...] Leo McKinstry suggests in his 2010 biography; attached to his regiment's 6th Battalion, Ramsey spent the entire war in Britain on home defence duties. The training was still physically demanding though, and, in Ramsey's words, made him [...] "a fitter <b>young</b> <b>fellow</b> than when I reported for duty as a grocery apprentice from Dagenham".|$|E
500|$|The cricket press {{noticed the}} absence of Crawford and the {{professionals}} from Surrey's team over the following games, and noted that Crawford was now playing club cricket. Meanwhile, Alverstone wrote to Crawford that the Surrey committee fully supported Leveson Gower's decision to omit Rushby and Lees, {{and told him that}} Surrey would not select him again unless he apologised to Leveson Gower. Crawford refused, writing to Alverstone: [...] "I do not know who was responsible for the selection of the second eleven sort of team furnished up for such an important match... There seems to be some impression amongst a few of the Surrey committee that I am some young professional instead of being a <b>young</b> <b>fellow</b> who has had an experience of cricket that has seldom fallen to the lot of anyone, and my request for an alteration of the team should have had some weight". In his History of Cricket, Benny Green describes the letter as evidence of a [...] "literate and quietly self-confident young man who will not easily be manipulated." ...|$|E

500|$|Barrymore decided next {{to star in}} Hamlet on stage, with Arthur Hopkins directing. They {{spent six}} months preparing, cutting over 1,250 lines from the text as they did so, and Barrymore opted to play Hamlet as [...] "a man's man", {{according}} to Norden. Barrymore later described his Hamlet as a [...] "normal, healthy, lusty <b>young</b> <b>fellow</b> who simply got into a mess that was too thick for him... {{he was a great}} fencer, an athlete, a man who led an active, healthy life. How can you make a sickly half-wit out of a man like that?" [...] Barrymore again used Carrington as a vocal coach; rehearsals started in October, and the play opened on November 16. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. Woollcott, writing for the New York Herald, opined that it was [...] "an evening that will be memorable {{in the history of the}} American theater". while John Corbin, the drama critic for The New York Times, agreed, writing that [...] "in all likelihood we have a new and a lasting Hamlet". The reviewer for Brooklyn Life stated that Barrymore had [...] "doubtless won the right to be called the greatest living American tragedian". In 1963, Orson Welles said that Barrymore was the best Hamlet he had seen, describing the character as [...] "not so much princely– he was a man of genius who happened to be a prince, and he was tender, and virile, and witty, and dangerous".|$|E
500|$|Howe {{was opposed}} in his riding by CCF {{candidate}} Doug Fisher, a {{local high school}} teacher. Fisher's campaign was well financed, with support from his party, the unions, {{and a number of}} corporate enemies Howe had made over the years. Fisher was able to buy up the key time on the local television station—Howe initially scheduled no television appearances. The voters of Port Arthur saw Fisher on television every night, explaining why the Liberals had gone wrong in his view, and what his party proposed to do to correct matters. Called back to his riding after the remainder of his disastrous Prairie tour was canceled, Howe found that Fisher's appeals had caused defections among Liberals. Howe managed to get TV time just before the election and according to Bothwell and Kilbourn [...] "treated his viewers to the sight of a tired, harsh old man, telling them that the nice <b>young</b> <b>fellow</b> that they had been seeing on television {{for the last couple of}} months was, if not a communist himself, then associated with the communists. No one believed him." [...] Fisher defeated Howe by over a thousand votes. Howe was gracious in defeat, shaking Fisher's hand at the television station, and assuring the member-elect's mother, long a Howe admirer, that there were many things for him to do. [...] Howe's defeat came as the Liberals still led narrowly in the reported returns. The Tories forged ahead, and took the greater number of seats, 112 to 105. [...] St. Laurent could have remained in office until Diefenbaker and the Tories defeated him in the House, but chose not to—a course with which Howe agreed. The Liberals left office on 21 June 1957, with Howe the only remaining minister of those sworn in with Mackenzie King in 1935.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from November 26, 1910. It states: [...] "Jack Clyde is a rich <b>young</b> <b>fellow</b> who has been brought up by his wealthy uncle in a small Western town. Jack decides {{that he wants to}} move to New York and is indulged in this whim by his uncle, who sends with the lad as valet a faithful old servant, who has his welfare at heart. In the city Jack rents expensive apartments, and leads a vain, idle life. Jack's uncle hears of his conduct and devises a scheme whereby he can make a thorough test of the boy. He instructs his lawyers to announce his death, that the entire fortune has gone to charity, and Jack has been left penniless. Jack is turned out of his rooms and shunned by his rich friends. Among the very poor, whom he formerly despised, he is treated as a comrade. They share with him their last crust, and he ends by marrying them, and falling in love with a humble little flower girl. Jack finally secures a situation as a porter in a hotel. His uncle discovers that he is planning to give a Thanksgiving dinner to all those poorer than himself and decides that Jack has learned his lesson. Jack brings to his poor room a few meager provisions that his week's salary has permitted him to buy. While waiting for his guests to arrive Jack goes to sleep. His uncle and the old servant who have been watching him closely, seize upon this opportunity to enter Jack's room and substitute for his poor meal a real Thanksgiving feast. The guests arrive, their host awakes, uncle returns, and Jack is assured that his prosperity is real and not a dream." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps it was Garrick's acting, {{the most}} showy of his careers, {{that brought him}} the most adulation. Garrick was not a large man, only {{standing}} 5'4", and his voice is not described as particularly loud. From his first performance, Garrick departed from the bombastic style that had been popular, choosing instead a more relaxed, naturalistic style that his biographer Alan Kendall states [...] "would probably seem quite normal to us today, but it was new and strange for his day." [...] Certainly this new style brought acclaim: Alexander Pope stated, [...] "he was afraid the young man would be spoiled, for he would have no competitor." [...] Garrick quotes George Lyttelton as complimenting him by saying, [...] "He told me he never knew what acting was till I appeared."

2500|$|William Diaper (1685–1717) was an English poet of the Augustan era. Little {{is known}} about his life. He was born in Bridgwater, Somerset and {{attended}} Balliol College, Oxford as a pauper, where he took his BA in 1702. In 1709 he was ordained a deacon at Wells and became a curate in the parish of Brent, which he describes in disparaging terms in a poem of the same name, calling it [...] "nature's gaol". By 1712, he had made contacts in the London literary world and become a protégé of Jonathan Swift, who refers to the poet several times in his Journal to Stella. In March 1712, Swift writes:Here is a <b>young</b> <b>fellow</b> has writ some Sea Eclogues, poems of Mermen, resembling pastorals of shepherds, {{and they are very}} pretty, and the thought is new. Mermen are he-mermaids; Tritons, natives of the sea. Do you understand me? I think to recommend him to our Society to-morrow. His name is Diaper. P— on him, I must do something for him, and {{get him out of the}} way. I hate to have any new wits rise, but when they do rise I would encourage them; but they tread on our heels and thrust us off the stage.In December 1712, he continued his account of Diaper's progress:This morning I presented one Diaper, a poet, to Lord Bolingbroke, with a new poem, which is a very good one; and I am to give him a sum of money from my lord; and I have contrived to make a parson of him, for he is half one already, being in deacon’s orders, and serves a small cure in the country; but has a sword at his a—— here in town. ’Tis a poor little short wretch, but will do best in a gown, and we will make Lord Keeper give him a living.In another letter, Swift refers to Diaper's being ill:I was to see a poor poet, one Mr. Diaper, in a nasty garret, very sick. I gave him twenty guineas from Lord Bolingbroke, and disposed the other sixty to two other authors, and desired a friend to receive the hundred pounds for poor Harrison, and will carry it to him to-morrow morning. I sent to see how he did, and he is extremely ill; and I very much afflicted for him, for he is my own creature, and in a very honourable post, and very worthy of it. I dined in the City. I am in much concern for this poor lad. His mother and sister attend him, and he wants nothing.|$|E
