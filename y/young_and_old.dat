5|$|Historian Sandra Mass {{considers}} the Rommel myth a hero cult, {{a synthesis of}} old and new hero cults and traditions culled primarily from Germany's largely imaginary colonial past, in particular the proletarian hero cult originally represented by Carl Peters and the bourgeois one represented by Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Rommel, as portrayed by this hero cult, was both chivalrous and ruthless, <b>young</b> <b>and</b> <b>old,</b> harsh and gentle, strong and righteous. Calder, Duffy and Ricci opine that Rommel's military brilliance provoked a masochistic tendency to romanticise a worthy opponent, that because he was skilled at his profession, he must have been an anti-Nazi hero.|$|E

Thus, the prevention of backward falls by older adults is a critical subject to be studied.

There were two specific aims in this study. The first aim was to develop two-dimensional musculoskeletal models of <b>young</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> adults.

40|$|The {{ability to}} read and {{appropriately}} respond to emotions in others is central for successful social interaction. <b>Young</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> adults are better at identifying positive than negative facial expressions <b>and</b> expressions of <b>young</b> than older faces. Little, however, {{is known about the}} neural processes associated with reading different emotions, particularly in faces of different ages, in samples of <b>young</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> adults. During fMRI, <b>young</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> participants identified expressions in happy, neutral, <b>and</b> angry <b>young</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> faces. The results suggest a functional dissociation of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) in reading facial emotions that is largely comparable in <b>young</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> adults: Both age groups showed greater vmPFC activity to happy compared to angry or neutral faces, which was positively correlated with expression identification for happy compared to angry faces. In contrast, both age groups showed greater activity in dmPFC to neutral or angry than happy faces which was negatively correlated with expression identification for neutral compared to happy faces. A similar region of dmPFC showed greater activity for older than young faces, but no brain-behavior correlations. Greater vmPFC activity in the present study may reflect greater affective processing, involved in reading happy compared to neutral or angry faces. Greater dmPFC activity may reflect more cognitive control involved in decoding and/or regulating negative emotions associated with neutral or angry than happy, <b>and</b> <b>older</b> than <b>young,</b> faces...|$|R
