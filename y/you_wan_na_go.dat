Acknowledgements Someone once said that in order to discover your future, you must look to your roots. Although my mother is quick to remind me that I am a mix of many cultures, nothing has defined and shaped me more than my Italian last name (which sounds extra fabulous with the title “Dr. ” in front of it). I would therefore like to thank the many people who have supported me during the years I have been in school studying topics related to my Italian heritage. Starting with my family, I want to thank my Dad, Norman Andrighetti, for spoiling me and for showing me in the process that money is not as important as my happiness. Instead of forcing me to get a job after I graduated with my B. A., he paid for me to return to college to study Italian and to travel to Italy. Dad, that was the start of an amazing journey that has given me a stronger sense of self, countless adventures, and now this Ph. D. ! I also want to thank my Mom, Carolyn Andrighetti, for teaching me two invaluable life lessons: being really good at something means doing it every day whether <b>you</b> <b>wan...</b>|$|R
40|$|E. V. Pitjeva, by {{processing}} {{more than}} 400, 000 planetary observations {{of various types}} with the dynamical models of the EPM 2006 ephemerides, recently estimated a correction to the canonical Newtonian-Einsteinian Venus' perihelion precession of - 0. 0004 +/- 0. 0001 arcseconds per century. The prediction of general relativity for the Lense-Thirring precession of the perihelion of Venus is - 0. 0003 arcseconds per century. It turns out that neither other mismodelld/unmodelled standard Newtonian/Einsteinian effects nor exotic ones, postulated to, e. g., explain the Pioneer anomaly, may have caused the determined extra-precession of the Venus orbit which, thus, can be reasonably attributed to the gravitomagnetic field of the Sun, not modelled in the routines of the EPM 2006 ephemerides. However, {{it must be noted}} that the quoted error is the formal, statistical one; the realistic uncertainty might be larger. Future improvements of the inner planets' ephemerides, with the inclusion of the Messenger and Venus-Express tracking data, should further improve the accuracy and the consistency of such a test of general relativity which would also benefit of the independent estimation of the extra-precessions of the perihelia (and the nodes) by other teams of astronomers.
