Ketubot 103a) {{that the}} spirit of Rebbi Judah used to visit his home, wearing Shabbat clothes, every Friday evening at dusk. He would recite Kiddush, and others would thereby {{discharge}} their obligation to hear Kiddush. [...] One Friday night {{there was a knock at}} the door. [...] "Sorry," [...] said the maid, [...] "I can't let <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> now because Rabbeinu HaKadosh is in the middle of Kiddush." [...] From then on Judah stopped coming, since he did not want his coming to become public knowledge.|$|E

Come again by-and-by. I--I--I'm so awfully tired and queer this morning somehow." ...|$|E

"Dear Stephen," [...] she explained, [...] "if I were to {{come away}} with you and marry <b>you,</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> a little time I should cease to be your lover, I should be your squaw. I should have to share your worries and make your coffee--and {{disappoint}} you, disappoint you and fail you in a hundred ways. Think! Should I be any good as a squaw? How can one love when one knows the coffee isn't what it should be, and one is giving one's lover indigestion? And I don't want to be your squaw. I don't want that at all. It isn't how I feel for you. I don't want to be your servant and your possession." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could tell}} you of one, Harry, who thinks very ill of me--nay, of two; and they are both in this room. Do you {{remember}} how you used to teach me that terribly conceited bit of Latin--Nil conscire sibi? Do you suppose that I can boast that I never grow pale as I think of my own fault? I am thinking of it always, and my heart is ever becoming paler and paler. And as {{to the treatment of}} others--I wish I could make you know what I suffered when I was fool enough to go to that place in Surrey. The coachman who drives me no doubt thinks that I poisoned my husband, and the servant who let <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> now supposes me to be an abandoned woman because you are here." ...|$|E
