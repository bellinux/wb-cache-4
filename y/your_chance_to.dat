500|$|Prior to the 1965–66 NBA season, Auerbach {{announced}} {{the coming year}} {{would be his last}} as coach, stating {{to the rest of the}} league, [...] "This is <b>your</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> take your last shot at me." [...] After losing game 1 of the 1966 finals to the Lakers, he publicly named his successor, center Bill Russell. The Celtics won the series in seven games, sending Auerbach out on top. Russell then took over as a player-coach, and so became the first African-American head coach ever in the four major North American professional team sports. While his pupil led the Celtics to two further titles in 1968 and 1969, Auerbach rebuilt the aging Celtics with shrewd draft picks, among them future Hall-of-Famers Dave Cowens and Jo Jo White, as well as Paul Westphal and Don Chaney. With his ex-player Tom Heinsohn coaching the Celtics and led by former sixth man John Havlicek, Auerbach's new recruits won the Atlantic Division every year from 1972 to 1976, winning the NBA title in 1974 and 1976. Auerbach also signed veteran forward/center Paul Silas and ex-ABA star Charlie Scott.|$|E

It never crossed my mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so when I got the phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an odd thing to do to have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again. There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here waiting for us just like it was."

Old King Friedrich thereupon said, [...] "You have chances of succession; true enough,--but nobody knows what will become of that.
