5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are seen}} on Earth {{because of a}} fortuitous {{combination}} of circumstances. Even on Earth, the diversity of eclipses familiar to people today is a temporary (on a geological time scale) phenomenon. Hundreds {{of millions of years}} in the past, the Moon was closer to the Earth and therefore apparently larger, so every solar eclipse was total and there were no annular eclipses. Due to tidal acceleration, the orbit of the Moon around the Earth becomes approximately 3.8cm more distant each year. Millions of <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> the Moon will be too far away to fully occlude the Sun, and no total eclipses will occur. In the same timeframe, the Sun may become brighter, making it appear larger in size. Estimates of the when the moon will be unable to occlude the entire sun when viewed from the Earth range between 1.4 billion and 650 million <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E

A deleted scene, parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind-the-scenes show Doctor Who Confidential, was filmed, depicting Amy discussing with the Doctor how she had seen herself with Rory ten <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> and if that would really happen.|$|E

A citizen named Kelly Larson (Will Forte) comes to Leslie's office and makes a passionate plea for the Twilight books to be included. When Leslie refuses because the books have no connection to Pawnee, Kelly handcuffs himself to a pipe in her office until she reconsiders. He is able to stay several days because he brought food, water and a pillow. During his stay, Kelly notices Tom (Aziz Ansari) appears sad, and correctly deduces Tom is having romantic issues; Tom's girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) has dumped him because Tom cannot get over the fact that his ex-wife, Wendy (Jama Williamson), is dating Ron (Nick Offerman). Kelly encourages Tom to read Twilight, to which he initially scoffs, but after reading them finds he loves the books.

That's why I'll have to do it... YESTERDAY!

To salvage Dr. Fred's plan, Bernard must acquire a replacement diamond for the time machine, while Hoagie and Laverne must restore power to their respective Chron-o-John pods by plugging them in.Bernard: Well, hurry up and bring them back!

50|$|Alternatively, {{the player}} may join Vauclair in {{his plans to}} release the virus.
