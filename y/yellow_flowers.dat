5|$|A {{variety of}} Fritillaria species {{are used as}} early spring {{ornamental}} flowers. These vary from the large Fritillaria imperialis (crown imperial) available {{in a number of}} colours such as yellow or orange, to the relatively tiny species such as Fritillaria meleagris or Fritillaria uva-vulpis with their chequered patterns. Erythronium is less common but a popular cultivar is 'Pagoda' with its sulphur <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers.</b> Calochortus (mariposa lily) may be sold as a mixture or as cultivars.|$|E
5|$|B.menziesiis inflorescences {{resemble}} those of no other banksia; its closest relatives were felt by George to be B.speciosa (showy banksia) and B.baxteri (bird's nest banksia), which differs from B.menziesii in having <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers</b> and leaves with deep triangular lobes. In 2002, a molecular study by Austin Mast showed its closest relatives to be {{the members of the}} series Crocinae.|$|E
5|$|Isopogon anethifolius, {{commonly}} known as narrowleaf- or narrow-leafed drumsticks, is a shrub in the family Proteaceae. The species is found only in coastal areas near Sydney, Australia, and to the immediate west. It occurs naturally in woodland, open forest and heathland on sandstone soils. An upright shrub, it can reach to 3m (10ft) in height, with terete leaves that are divided and narrow. The <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers</b> appear from September to December and are prominently displayed. They are followed by round grey cones, which give the plant its common name of drumsticks. The small hairy seeds {{are found in the}} old flower parts.|$|E
50|$|Helianthella parryi is a {{herbaceous}} plant up to 50 cm tall. The plant usually produces only one <b>yellow</b> <b>flower</b> heads per stem, though sometimes 2 or 3. Heads are nodding (hanging). Each head contains 8-14 <b>yellow</b> ray <b>flowers</b> surrounding numerous <b>yellow</b> disc <b>flowers.</b>|$|R

5|$|The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root {{vegetable}} {{closely related to}} the carrot and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers,</b> in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers bloom {{from early}} May to late September {{but most are}} gone by late August. Moisture from snow-melt along with some {{rainfall}} in late spring kick-starts the germination of annual plants, including wildflowers. Most of these plants complete their entire life cycle in the few months each year that moisture levels are good. The onset of summer decreases the number of wildflowers and by autumn only the tiny <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers</b> of sagebrush and rabbitbrush remain. Some wildflowers that grow {{in the area are}} the arrow-leaved balsamroot, bitterroot, blazingstar, desert parsley, dwarf monkeyflower, paintbrush, scorpionweed, scabland penstemon and the wild onion.|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with two male flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two male and two female) have been reported. At {{the far end of}} the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the triads of male and female flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers</b> and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers.|$|E
50|$|The Second Guangzhou Uprising, {{known in}} Chinese as the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Flower</b> Mound Uprising or the Guangzhou Xinhai Uprising, was a failed {{uprising}} led by Huang Xing {{and his fellow}} revolutionaries against the Qing Dynasty in Guangzhou.

5|$|Although to many she is {{best known}} for Demi's Birthday Suit, art aficionados {{consider}} her most famous work Disappearing Model. The work appeared on Ripley's Believe it or Not!. In the trompe l'oeil body painting, the face and body of the model are almost indistinguishable from the red and blue and <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers</b> of the wallpaper in the background. Her first body paintings was also memorable as she painted a moko on a female Ford Modeling Agency fashion model named Jana, which is a tabooed employment of a traditionally male ritual face mask. An example from Gair's website of her ability to trick the eye into seeing a three-dimensional subject blend with a two-dimensional background is seen in a photograph of a pregnant Elle Macpherson. Other examples of this technique include the cover of her first book (pictured below) and images from within this book.|$|E
5|$|It is a hairy {{biennial}} {{plant that}} can grow to 2 m tall or more. Its small, <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers</b> are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows {{from a large}} rosette of leaves. It grows {{in a wide variety}} of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively invasive, since its seeds require open ground to germinate. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a very competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.|$|E
5|$|Several {{plants are}} {{immediately}} evident to the visitor. Banyan (Ficus macrophylla subsp. columnaris) {{is a remarkable}} tree with a buttressed trunk and pendulous aerial roots: {{it can be seen}} on the track to Clear Place and near Ned's Beach. Pandanus tree (Pandanus forsteri) has spectacular teepee-like prop roots and pineapple-like fruits that are orange-red when mature, the tough leaves being used for basketry. It occurs in damp areas like creek beds and fine specimens can be seen along the Boat Harbour track. There are ten species of orchid on the island, the most noticeable being the bush orchid (Dendrobium macropus subsp. howeanum) on lowland trees and rocks, bearing cream flowers from August to September. Other prominent flowering plants in the summer include, on the mountain slopes, the whiskery red flowers of mountain rose (Metrosideros nervulosa and Metrosideros sclerocarpa), the massed small <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers</b> of corokia (Corokia carpodetoides), orange plump flowers of pumpkin tree (Negria rhabdothamnoides), and white spikes of Fitzgerald tree (Dracophyllum fitzgeraldii). The kava bush has large, aromatic, heart-shaped leaves. After heavy rain the endemic glowing mushrooms Mycena chlorophanos and Omphalotus nidiformis {{can be found in the}} palm forests.|$|E

5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers</b> appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E

25|$|Scuticaria itirapinensis, {{the last}} species of Brazilian southeast, {{is the one}} that closely resembles Amazonian Scuticaria steelei, {{although}} it can be easily separated because of its strong <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers</b> and much shorter leaves, besides slight differences on the proportions of floral structures. A Scuticaria steelei presents entirely pale <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers,</b> completely covered by spaced small darker stains, However it is not even necessary to observe the flowers to identify it as their leaves are about one meter long, and there are references of plants measuring almost one and a half meter.|$|E
25|$|Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is a {{flowering}} plant {{species in the}} carrot family. It is a hardy, perennial herb with <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers</b> and feathery leaves.

25|$|Pollination is by a {{wide range}} of bees, flies and moths and butterflies. Over a season, one plant may produce 2,000 to 2,500 <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers</b> in 20- to 60-headed, flat-topped corymbs. The number of seeds {{produced}} may be as large as 75,000 to 120,000, although in its native range in Eurasia very few of these would grow into new plants and research has shown that most seeds do not travel a great distance from the parent plant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>flowers</b> such as primrose, rowan, hawthorn, gorse, hazel, and marsh {{marigold}} were placed at doorways and windows in 19th century Ireland, Scotland and Mann. Sometimes loose flowers were strewn {{at the doors}} and windows and sometimes they were made into bouquets, garlands or crosses and fastened to them. They would also be fastened to cows and equipment for milking and butter making. It is likely that such flowers were used because they evoked fire. Similar May Day customs are found across Europe.|$|E
25|$|The last {{subgroup}} {{is formed}} by species that present petals oblique to the column. Two have petals and sepals marked with other colors: Bifrenaria clavigera, {{that has a}} calcar formed by the fusion of the lateral sepals bases, and Bifrenaria silvana where the calcar {{is a result of}} their superposition; Bifrenaria leucorhoda has white flowers with labellum veined of pink color. The two remaining species have highly similar <b>yellow</b> <b>flowers,</b> although of diverse sizes, the smaller and often paler is Bifrenaria stefanae, the larger and of brighter color is Bifrenaria vitellina.|$|E
