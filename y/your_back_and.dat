500|$|Finally, a Bedouin story {{states that}} Allah created the Arabian horse {{from the south}} wind and exclaimed, [...] "I create thee, Oh Arabian. To thy forelock, I bind Victory in battle. On thy back, I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins. I {{establish}} thee {{as one of the}} Glories of the Earth... I give thee flight without wings." [...] Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind: [...] "I want to make a creature out of you. Condense." [...] Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a kamayt-colored animal (a bay or burnt chestnut) and said: [...] "I call you Horse; I make you Arabian and I give you the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals. Men shall follow you wherever you go; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit; you shall fly without wings; riches shall be on <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> fortune shall come through your meditation." ...|$|E

Literary journalist Alec Wilkinson {{writes that the}} song's narrator is [...] "looking for refuge {{in the part of}} town where the wind always blows at <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> the ground tilts in your favor." [...] "Guantanamo" [...] features cascading guitar by Cooder and handclaps. The song is about the nadir of human depravity. A slow, 12-bar blues lament, [...] "Cold Cold Feeling" [...] features juke joint, bottleneck guitar, and lyrics placing Barack Obama as the narrator singing his blues in the White House. Cooder meant to draw sympathy from listeners for Barack Obama. Geoff Cowart of musicOMH draws similarities of the song to [...] "the voodoo blues of Screaming Jay Hawkins". [...] "Going to Tampa" [...] is a string band country song in Alla breve meter. Using scathing humor and burlesque lyrical elements, the song's farcical lyrics depict a fictional hijacking of the 2012 Republican National Convention by the Tea Party, as Cooder accuses both parties of racism and social engineering.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{found in}} [...] {{support for the}} proverb that if a person tells {{you that you have}} a donkey's ears, do not believe it, but if two tell it to you, order a halter. For Abraham called Hagar Sarai's servant the first time in [...] saying, [...] "Behold, your maid is in your hand." [...] And then the angel called Hagar Sarai's servant the second time in [...] saying, [...] "Hagar, Sarai's handmaid." [...] Thus, {{thereafter}} in [...] Hagar acknowledged that she was Sarai's servant, saying, [...] "I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai." [...] Similarly, Rava asked Rabbah bar Mari where Scripture supports the saying of the Rabbis that if your neighbor (justifiably) calls you a donkey, you should put a saddle on <b>your</b> <b>back</b> (<b>and</b> not quarrel to convince the neighbor otherwise). Rabbah bar Mari replied that the saying found support in [...] where first the angel calls Hagar [...] "Sarai's handmaid," [...] and then Hagar acknowledged that she was Sarai's servant, saying, [...] "I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.".

Nogueira said,"They have a clinic in Kansas where they work with stem cells. What they do is they remove some cells from fat out of <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> then inject them in your joints. I did it on my elbows, my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It's pretty cutting edge technique. I'm responding really well so far. It's been helping a lot with my pain. I'm still doing physiotherapy, which is responsible for curing my hips, but I'm now doing this to make it even stronger. I had a break between my last fight and The Ultimate Fighter shootings, so I decided to go for it."Nogueira also confessed a desire to fight Frank Mir for a third time saying,"In two weeks I'll be cleared to train freely again. First, I will get my body strong enough so I can train and be 100% ready to fight. I intend to fight at UFC 190 in August. I wanted to come back at the TUF finale card, but I'm afraid there won't be enough time. I'll definitely be ready in August. The UFC told me they would put me in a card in August. They didn't say which one, but I'm sure it'll be the one in Rio. I still don't have an opponent. They said there were three different guys I could be fighting, but I can't comment on that. I don't have any preferences really. I just want to come back and fight, but I would like to face Frank Mir again {{before the end of the}} year." ...|$|E
