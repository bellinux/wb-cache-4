500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the spring}} {{training}} in 2006, Feldman was feeling confident {{that he was going to}} make the parent club's 25-man roster. A week before Opening Day he was called into Manager Buck Showalter's office. But instead of telling Feldman he had made the team, for the first 10 minutes Showalter and the team's pitching coach Mark Connor spoke on and on about how Feldman had had a solid spring training — but needed to work on some things. Feldman couldn't believe it but eventually thought, [...] "Holy smoke, I’m going down [...]" [...] Suddenly, unable to continue the prank any longer, Showalter burst out laughing: [...] "Pack <b>your</b> <b>bags,</b> rookie, you’re coming with us!" ...|$|E
500|$|In Japan, {{the song}} {{has met with}} {{considerable}} criticism. When [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] first appeared in Japanese TV shows in July, the reaction from viewers was negative. As a result, Psy's Japanese record label YGEX cancelled a previously planned Japanese language re-release of [...] "Gangnam Style". According to The Dong-a Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper, the song's lukewarm reception in Japan could {{have been caused by}} a diplomatic conflict between the two countries and the newspaper accused the Japanese media of keeping its people [...] "in the dark". However, Jun Takaku of the Japanese daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun explained that [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] had caused [...] "barely a ripple in Japan" [...] because Psy does not conform to the image of other [...] "traditionally polished" [...] K-pop acts popular in Japan such as Girls' Generation and TVXQ. Erica Ho from Time magazine similarly noted that despite the K-pop musical genre being very popular in Japan, the country seemed to be [...] "immune to PSY Mania" [...] and she advised her readers who dislike the song to [...] "pack <b>your</b> <b>bags</b> for Japan".|$|E

Or prosecute a Sunday-Society Cockney for picking my primroses. Custom-houses indeed! It's Chinese. There are things a Great Country mustn't do, Stephen. A country like ours ought to get along without the manners of a hard-breathing competitive cad.... If it can't I'd rather it didn't get along.... What's the good of a huckster country?--it's like having a wife on the streets. It's no excuse that she brings you money. But since the peace, and that man Chamberlain's visit to Africa, you Imperialists seem to have got this nasty spirit all over you.... The Germans do it, you say!" ...|$|E
