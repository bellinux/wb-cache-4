500|$|Rasputin's {{friendship}} with the imperial children {{was evident in the}} messages he sent to them. [...] "My Dear Pearl M!" [...] Rasputin wrote the nine-year-old Maria in one telegram in 1908. [...] "Tell me how <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> with the sea, with nature! I miss your simple soul. We will see each other soon! A big kiss." [...] In a second telegram, Rasputin told the child, [...] "My Dear M! My Little Friend! May the Lord help you to carry your cross with wisdom and joy in Christ. This world is like the day, look it's already evening. So it is with the cares of the world." [...] In February 1909, Rasputin sent all of the imperial children a telegram, advising them to [...] "Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{conflicts}} and political dimensions of Star Trek represent allegories of contemporary cultural realities. Star Trek: The Original Series addressed {{issues of the}} 1960s, just as later spin-offs have reflected issues of their respective decades. Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace, the value of personal loyalty, authoritarianism, imperialism, class warfare, economics, racism, religion, human rights, sexism, feminism, {{and the role of}} technology. Roddenberry stated: [...] " [...] a new world with new rules, I could make statements about sex, religion, Vietnam, politics, and intercontinental missiles. Indeed, we did make them on Star Trek: we were sending messages and fortunately they all got by the network." [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> about purple people on a far off planet, they (the TV network) never really caught on. They were more concerned about cleavage. They actually would send a censor down to the set to measure a woman's cleavage to make sure too much of her breast wasn't showing" ...|$|E

In terms of the stimulus <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> about, it was failed. [...] And {{let me tell you what}} I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E

2500|$|From 1989 to 1990, the Najibullah {{government}} was partially successful in {{building up the}} Afghan defence forces. The Ministry of State Security had established a local milita force which stood at an estimated 100,000 men. The 17th Division in Herat, which had begun the 1979 Herat uprising against PDPA-rule, stood at 3,400 regular troops and 14,000 tribal men. In 1988, {{the total number of}} security forces available to the government stood at 300,000. This trend did not continue, and by the summer of 1990, the Afghan government forces were on the defensive again. By the beginning of 1991, the government controlled only 10 percent of Afghanistan, the eleven-year Siege of Khost had ended in a mujahideen victory and the morale of the Afghan military finally collapsed. In the Soviet Union, Kryuchkov and Shevardnadze had both supported continuing aid to the Najibullah government, but Kryuchkov had been arrested following the failed 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt and Shevardnadze had resigned from his posts in the Soviet government in December 1990 – there were no longer any pro-Najibullah people in the Soviet leadership and the Soviet Union {{was in the middle of}} an economic and political crisis, which would lead directly to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991. At the same time Boris Yeltsin became Russia's new hope, and he had no wish to continue to aid Najibullah's government, which he considered a relic of the past. In the autumn of 1991, Najibullah wrote to Shevardnadze [...] "I didn't want to be president, <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> me into it, insisted on it, and promised support. Now you are throwing me and the Republic of Afghanistan to its fate." ...|$|E
