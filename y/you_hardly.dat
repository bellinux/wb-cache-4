500|$|According to the TES (formerly the Times Educational Supplement), [...] "From April, holly blue, peacock and {{brimstone}} butterflies abound.

2500|$|Some of Morath's signal {{achievements}} are in portraiture, including posed {{images of}} celebrities {{as well as}} fleeting images of anonymous passersby. Her pictures of Boris Pasternak's home, Pushkin's library, Chekhov's house, Mao Zedong's bedroom, as well as artists' studios and cemetery memorials, are permeated {{with the spirit of}} invisible people still present.

If you're one of her subjects, <b>you</b> <b>hardly</b> know your guard is down and your secret recorded until it's too late. She is a tender intruder with an invisible camera." ...|$|E
