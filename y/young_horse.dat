5|$|Beholder (foaled May 9, 2010) is an American Thoroughbred race {{horse and}} {{multiple}} Eclipse Award winner. She was purchased as a yearling by B. Wayne Hughes of Spendthrift Farm. She had an early {{reputation for being}} difficult to handle, but trainer Richard Mandella worked extensively with the fractious <b>young</b> <b>horse,</b> gradually developing her from a temperamental front-runner into a seasoned veteran who could be placed in strategic positions.|$|E
5|$|Forward riding, {{also called}} Straight riding or the Remontenschule - This {{is the name}} given to the skills taught {{in the first year}} of training, where a <b>young</b> <b>horse</b> learns to be saddled and bridled, learns basic {{commands}} on a longe line, and then is taught to be ridden, mostly in an arena in simple straight lines and turns, to teach correct responses to the rider's legs and hands while mounted. The main goal during this time is to develop free forward movement in as natural a position as possible.|$|E
5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a <b>young</b> <b>horse</b> (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyse the dynamics of growth of the Czech warm-blood <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> and to evaluate the effect of rearing facilities for testing <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> (RFT) on the increase in body measurements of the <b>young</b> <b>horses.</b> Groundwork data were obtained from the database of the Czech Warm-Blood Horse Breeders Association which contains data on the regular grading of the <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> in the RFT facilities. Data from the year 2001 to 2011 from 7 RFT facilities for <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> of the Czech warm-blood were entered in the basic database. Statistical processing of the database using the GLM method revealed that the RFT had a statistically significant effect on the tape-measure, heart-girth and bone. By multiple comparisons of the individual effects using the Tukey-B method we discovered statistically significant differences in body measurements of the <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> among the respective rearing facilities for testing <b>young</b> <b>horses.</b> The growth dynamics of <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> in the individual RFT considerably differed. The growth of <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> from the RFT Železnice was the most balanced showing no marked fluctuations. In the other rearing facilities the growth of the <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> fluctuated considerably in the course of the testing period; particularly in the Albertovec, Tlumačov and Luka-Týn rearing facilities for testing <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> the growth of the <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> was retarded in the second half of the testing period...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the introduction of foreign adults on the behavior of <b>young</b> <b>horses.</b> First, we observed the behavior of 1 - and 2 -year-old domestic horses housed in same-age and same-sex groups (a standard housing system, but different from a natural situation). Then, two same-sex adults were introduced into each experimental group. Observations made before, during and after an introduction indicated that <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> reared in homogeneous groups of young had different behaviors compared to other domestic horses reared under more socially natural conditions. After the introduction of adults, <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> expressed new behaviors, preferential social associations emerged, positive social behavior increased and agonistic interactions decreased. These results have important implications both for understanding the influence that adults may have on the behavior of <b>young</b> <b>horses,</b> and in terms of husbandry, indicating the importance of keeping <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> with adults, although further studies are still necessary...|$|R
5|$|Van Grunsven {{first met}} Bonfire {{when he was}} {{two and a half}} years old, having been under saddle for only a week. He was later {{purchased}} by Van Grunsven's father. At first it appeared that the <b>young</b> <b>horse</b> would be a poor prospect, as his hot temperament led to poor gaits. However, he did well at learning advanced dressage moves such as the piaffe and passage, and so Van Grunsven continued to work with him. He improved, and by the time he was seven years old, he was competing at the Grand Prix level. His temperament continued to lead to difficult rides, and he had a tendency to spook at small items near the ring; these tendencies decreased as he grew older.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>young</b> <b>horse</b> he {{was bought}} for £10 by Bill Scott. Scott had {{recently}} quarreled {{with his brother}} John Scott, the leading racehorse trainer of the time, and had set up his own stable near Malton, North Yorkshire, with the day-to-day conditioning of the horses being handled by William Oates. Bill Scott, who rode many of his own horses, {{was one of the}} most successful jockeys of his era, although he was also noted for his heavy drinking and rough riding tactics. Scott named his bay colt Tibthorpe, after a village near Driffield.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, {{a teenage}} boy named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) from Devon, England, {{witnesses}} {{the birth of a}} bay Thoroughbred foal and subsequently watches with admiration the growth of the <b>young</b> <b>horse.</b> Much to the dismay of his mother Rose (Emily Watson), his father Ted buys the colt at auction, outbidding their landlord Lyons, despite their needing a more suitable plough horse for the farm work. Albert's best friend, Andrew Easton, watches as Albert teaches his colt many things, such as to come when he imitates the call of an owl by blowing through his cupped hands. He names the horse Joey.|$|E

25|$|Witez II {{was only}} a {{yearling}} when Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939. With both the Soviet Union and Germany occupying the country, the Janów stud was temporarily evacuated. However, though Janów was on the German side of the Curzon line, the Russian military nonetheless confiscated most of the mature breeding stock as spoils of war. Witez II, along with {{the bulk of the}} young horses, avoided this fate and ultimately was returned to Janów, which was soon under the management of the German military. As <b>young</b> <b>horse,</b> he was put into race training, but because of wartime cancellation of horse racing during the occupation of Poland, he was not taken to the track. Instead, he was put to stud, first at Janów, and then was taken to Hostau in what today is the Czech Republic, where the Nazis had gathered significant bloodstock of all different breeds from across the Third Reich.|$|E

500|$|Varian {{departed}} {{slightly from}} tradition. She started young horses under saddle {{at the age}} of three, beginning with a bridle and a snaffle bit because it sends clearer signals to a <b>young</b> <b>horse,</b> particularly one of sensitive disposition. [...] She then introduced the traditional hackamore, and, after a couple of months to transition between the hackamore and the snaffle, began teaching neck reining, which allows a horse to be ridden one-handed. After a year or two, when the horse became light in the hackamore, she introduced the <b>young</b> <b>horse</b> to the two-rein, using a light bosal with either a [...] "half-breed" [...] or a low-port curb bit. Once the horse understood the bit, the bosal was removed and the horse was ridden in just the curb bit for a while until ready to go into the full spade bit, at which point the horse went back into the two-rein when the spade is first introduced. She introduced horses to the spade bit {{at the age of}} seven or eight, if they had suitable conformation and temperament to carry it. When she selected and fully trained a spade bit horse for her own personal use, that particular horse stayed with her for life and was never sold.|$|E

50|$|Weanlings are {{not capable}} of reproduction. Puberty occurs in most horses during their {{yearling}} year. Therefore, some <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> are capable of reproduction prior to full physical maturity, {{though it is not}} common. Two-year-olds sometimes are deliberately bred, though doing so, particularly with fillies, may put undesirable stress on their still-growing bodies. As a general rule, breeding <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> prior to the age of three is considered undesirable.|$|R
500|$|Concern {{exists that}} the closed stud book and tightly {{regulated}} {{population of the}} Thoroughbred is at risk of loss of genetic diversity because {{of the level of}} inadvertent inbreeding inevitable in such a small population. According to one study, 78% of alleles in the current population can be traced to 30foundation animals, 27 of which are male. Ten foundation mares account for 72% of maternal (tail-female) lineages, and, as noted above, one stallion appears in 95% of tail male lineages. [...] Thoroughbred pedigrees are generally traced through the maternal line, called the distaff line. The line that a horse comes from is a critical factor in determining the price for a <b>young</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, the vaquero method [...] {{starts a}} <b>young</b> <b>horse</b> using a hackamore, which is {{headgear}} {{that uses a}} heavy rawhide noseband, called a bosal instead of a bit to control the horse. As the horse gains skill with a rider, it moves to lighter bosals, and next into a transitional period in its training; carrying a bridle with a type of curb bit called a [...] "half breed" [...] which is a modified spade bit worn {{in conjunction with a}} light bosal. The rider carries two sets of reins, one set on the bosal and one on the curb, giving this gear its name, the [...] "two-rein." [...] After several years in a two-rein, the horse graduates into the spade bit.|$|E
500|$|Ponche de Leona {{delivered}} Mucho Macho Man {{three weeks}} after her due date. [...] At birth, the foal was lifeless with no heartbeat. Farm staff tried to revive him by massaging and shaking him. [...] He was unresponsive for several minutes, then his eyes opened and he [...] "just got up and galloped away". As a result, his foalhood nickname was [...] "Lazarus". [...] In {{addition to being a}} late foal, he was very big and hence slow to reach full development. Because the <b>young</b> <b>horse</b> was so tall and skinny, John Rio called him [...] "Mr. Green Jeans", though no one else did. [...] His official name is derived from the Village People song [...] "Macho Man", and owner Dean Reeves' nickname for him is [...] "Macho".|$|E
5000|$|Horses are {{not fully}} mature {{until the age of}} four or five, but most are started as working animals much younger, though care must be taken not to over-stress the [...] "soft" [...] bones of younger animals.

Physiologically <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> are still not truly mature as two-year olds, though some breeders and most race horse trainers do start <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> in a cart or under saddle at that age. The most common age for <b>young</b> <b>horses</b> to begin training under saddle is the age of three. A few breeds and disciplines wait until the animal is four.|$|R

500|$|Mucho Macho Man first raced at Calder Race Course. [...] He was {{scratched}} by {{the track}} veterinarian {{from the first}} race into which he was entered; he had been slightly injured when the horse next to him reared and flipped over in the starting gate. He was entered in another race a week later, a maiden race in which he finished second, losing to a colt named Gourmet Dinner. After that race, Mucho Macho Man was purchased by Reeves Thoroughbred Racing. [...] Dean and Patti Reeves had considered purchasing Gourmet Dinner, but Dean Reeves recalled saying at the time, [...] "Call me crazy, but I like the second horse." [...] After the sale, Tim Ritvo took over the training of Mucho Macho Man from his original trainer, Bill White. The colt came in third at his next race, at Saratoga in New York state; {{he won his first}} race on September19, 2010, at Monmouth Park in New Jersey. After that race, the colt's training was turned over to Kathy Ritvo when Tim began working for Gulfstream Park. In November 2010, Mucho Macho Man moved up to graded class and finished second behind To Honor and Serve twice in a row at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York City, first in the Nashua Stakes and then in the Remsen Stakes. Throughout his two-year-old year the <b>young</b> <b>horse</b> was easily distracted, so he raced with blinkers for both White and Ritvo.|$|E

2500|$|A horse may be gelded at any age; however, if {{an owner}} intends to geld a {{particular}} foal, {{it is now}} considered best to geld the horse prior to becoming a yearling, [...] and definitely before he reaches sexual maturity. [...] While it was once recommended to wait until a <b>young</b> <b>horse</b> was well over a year old, even two, this was a holdover {{from the days when}} castration was performed without anesthesia and was thus far more stressful on the animal. [...] Modern veterinary techniques can now accomplish castration with relatively little stress and minimal discomfort, so long as appropriate analgesics are employed. [...] A few horse owners delay gelding a horse {{on the grounds that the}} testosterone gained from being allowed to reach sexual maturity will make him larger. [...] However, recent studies have shown that this is not so: [...] any apparent muscle mass gained solely from the presence of hormones will be lost over time after the horse is gelded, and in the meantime, the energy spent developing muscle mass may actually take away from the energy a <b>young</b> <b>horse</b> might otherwise put into skeletal growth; the net effect is that castration has no effect on rate of growth (although it may increase the amount of fat the horse carries).|$|E
