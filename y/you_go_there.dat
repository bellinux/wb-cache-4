500|$|The {{shipyard}} generated high {{employment to}} Jarrow, but the industrial works created a harsh environment. Ellen Wilkinson, the town's historian {{and member of}} parliament from 1935 to 1947, quotes a newspaper source from 1858: [...] "There is a prevailing blackness about the neighbourhood. The houses are black, the ships are black, the sky is black, and if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> {{for an hour or}} two, reader, you will be black". According to Wilkinson, the yard's founder, Sir Charles Palmer, [...] "regarded it as no part of his duty to see that the conditions under which his workers had to live were either sanitary or tolerable".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Wallabies coach Robbie Deans and {{selectors}} wagered {{the potential}} returns in finishing games with two openside flankers {{on the field}} {{as a way to}} counter McCaw. In September 2012 after the All Blacks v South African Test in Dunedin, then South African coach Heyneke Meyer said that McCaw was the greatest rugby player the world has ever seen. Following the All Blacks win over Wallabies to claim their 3rd World Cup, All Blacks Coach Steve Hansen praised McCaw's and Dan Carter's career efforts, distinguishing McCaw from Carter:“Richie is the best All Black we have ever had and Dan is a close second,” said Hansen. “The only thing that separates them is Richie has played 148 matches at flanker, which is unheard of - you put your body on the line every time <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>there.</b> The challenge for the other guys now is to try and become as great as him and Dan.” ...|$|E

500|$|Hoffman's {{entrance}} into games, {{accompanied by the}} playing of [...] "Hells Bells", became popular among fans after it was introduced in 1998. Tom Verducci of Sports Illustrated wrote that Hoffman's [...] "signature moment {{is one of the}} most electrically charged in sports: Padres fans rising and roaring, in Pavlovian fashion, upon hearing the first bell toll, the foreboding bonging like something out of Hitchcock as Hoffman enters slowly, stage right." [...] Opposing closer Jason Isringhausen said, [...] "'Hells Bells' in San Diego is Trevor. It's like when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>there,</b> you want to [...] two out of three so you can hear it once." [...] The initial introduction of Hoffman's entrance music was a forerunner in the heavy metal closer theme songs used throughout home stadiums. The San Diego Union-Tribune initially noted, [...] " [...] entrance was more suited to the World Wrestling Federation than the national pastime." [...] By the end of Hoffman's career, San Jose Mercury News and ESPN.com wrote that the song should be honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame. Other teams contacted the Padres for videos of the [...] "Trevor Time" [...] production. Yankees executives witnessing Hoffman's entrance in 1998 were inspired to use the song [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] for Rivera's entrance starting the following season.|$|E
2500|$|Before Perverted-Justice {{began working}} {{primarily}} with law enforcement, child safety advocate Julie Posey described Perverted-Justice's tactics as [...] "a gross invasion of privacy." [...] Posey indicated {{that she did}} not feel the methods employed by Perverted-Justice were completely effective. [...] "What it does is embarrass them for the moment... but then they'll go and get a different screen name and know to check things out a little more thoroughly next time." [...] Posey and Perverted-Justice founder Xavier Von Erck appeared on Fox News Channel shortly thereafter, where Posey remarked, [...] "It’s more of an entertainment site, actually. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>there,</b> you click on a link of a picture that takes you to that person’s chat-log and that person has a scale—a sliminess scale as he calls it—and you can rate the pervert from, I think it’s, one to five. To me, that kind of gives a sense of entertainment. Anybody that finds entertainment value in exploiting children, I have a problem with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crowe {{returned}} to Australia at age 21, intending {{to apply to}} the National Institute of Dramatic Art. [...] "I was working in a theatre show, and talked to a guy who was then the head of technical support at NIDA", Crowe has recalled. [...] "I asked him what he thought about me spending three years at NIDA. He told me it'd be a waste of time. He said, 'You already do the things <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> to learn, and you've been doing it for most of your life, so there's nothing to teach you but bad habits.'" [...] From 1986 to 1988, he was given his first professional role by director Daniel Abineri, in a New Zealand production of The Rocky Horror Show. He played the role of Eddie/Dr Scott. He repeated this performance in a further Australian production of the show, which also toured New Zealand. In 1987, Crowe spent six months busking when he could not find other work. In the 1988 Australian production of Blood Brothers, Crowe played the role of Mickey. He was also cast again by Daniel Abineri in the role of Johnny, in the stage musical Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom in 1989.|$|E

2500|$|When Chauvel {{arrived in}} Damascus, {{he told his}} staff [...] "to pitch my camp in a clean orchard {{just out of the}} city, which I thought would suit me better after what I had seen of the place. I then went back to my camp, had lunch, and became {{immersed}} in problems of supply, collection of prisoners, orders for the morrow, etc., sending off first of all an aeroplane message to Lord Allenby, telling him what I had done." [...] He also sent for the British Supply Officer of the Hejaz Forces. [...] "Before discussing supply matters, however, he ... said 'they are out to make as little as possible of the British and make the populace think that it is the Arabs who have driven out the Turk. This is why Lawrence asked you to keep your men out of the city and they have no intention of asking you for any police.' He also said 'They are getting the British Consulate ready for you. If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> you are not defining yourself as the Conqueror of this country, but rather as a contributory ally. You should take possession of Djemal Pasha's house, which is the best one in the place, and which they are reserving for Feisal.' He said there was absolute chaos in the city, the Bazaars were closed and all the better class of people were terrified at the idea of the Hejaz crowd being in charge." [...] As a result, Chauvel decided to march through the city the following day, with [...] "practically every unit being represented; guns, armoured cars, everything, and I also took possession of Djemal's house." ...|$|E
