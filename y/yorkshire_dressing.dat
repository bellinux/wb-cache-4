25|$|Trueman {{played in}} 32 {{first-class}} matches in 1957, taking 135 wickets at 17.05 with a best return of 7–37. He had 10 wickets in a match twice and 5 in an innings nine times. He had an outstanding {{time in his}} favoured leg slip position too, holding 36 catches. There were more problems in the <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>dressing</b> room, principally a petition started by certain players for the club committee to sack Billy Sutcliffe from the captaincy. Trueman refused to sign it but, in August, Sutcliffe decided to resign. Despite this, Yorkshire still managed to finish third, though a long way behind champions Surrey.|$|E
500|$|Hutton rarely captained Yorkshire, {{except in}} the absence of the {{official}} captain, through a combination of poor health, frequent absences with England and the presence of the amateur Norman Yardley in the side. Yardley claimed several times that he would have stood down in Hutton's favour, but the committee remained distrustful of professional captaincy and thought Hutton a hypochondriac who used his health as an excuse not to play. Hutton was a reserved man for whom the <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>dressing</b> room clashes of the 1950s held little appeal. As the side's senior professional, he did not always provide the guidance which younger players in the side were seeking. The team was divided and the players frequently clashed with each other; some critics believe this was a factor in the county's failure to win the County Championship in the 1950s. Ray Illingworth, a player at the time, believes that Hutton was the only man who could have changed the negative attitude around the team, but [...] "he didn't do anything about it". Illingworth recalled that he was a [...] "distant hero", saying: [...] "He was a funny man was Len—slightly sarcastic all the time. He'd hear an argument in the dressing room and he'd throw a bit of wood on the fire to keep it going. He looked after himself, he was very much of a loner." ...|$|E

5000|$|The 1999 Seattle demonstrations saw {{extensive}} violent {{clashes with}} the police. For the 2000 protest in Prague, demonstrators divided themselves into three broad groupings {{based in part}} on the way they wished to engage with the authorities. There was a [...] "Yellow march" [...] for traditional non violent protest, a [...] "Blue march" [...] for those who were up for physically taking on the police, and a [...] "Silver and Pink" [...] group which is described as employing [...] "tactical frivolity" [...] and also in being the most successful in terms of penetrating the security cordon around the IMF meeting. Attending Prague was also a small group specifically calling itself [...] "Tactical Frivolity", which consisted of a Samba band plus thirteen women from <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>dressed</b> as pink fairies.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005 Sykes married British {{entrepreneur}} Toby Rowland, son of businessman [...] "Tiny" [...] Rowland, at Sledmere House, her family's {{ancestral home}} (1751) in the East Riding of <b>Yorkshire.</b> Her <b>dress,</b> with an eight-foot train and hand-sewn roses, {{was designed by}} Sykes' friend and protégé of Isabella Blow, Alexander McQueen. Sykes was sometimes described as a muse of McQueen; she modelled for some of his earliest catwalk shows, {{as well as for}} photoshoots of his designs. Before her wedding, she wrote an article for Vogue about shopping for suitable lingerie for her wedding night, an article that included reference to a [...] "$900 bra" [...] Six years later some fashion journalists (anticipating correctly the chosen designer) claimed that Catherine Middleton had been inspired by Sykes' wedding dress to choose Burton to design hers for her marriage to Prince William, Duke of Cambridge., although others suggested that the inspiration was that (also in 2005) of Sara Buys to William's stepbrother, Tom Parker Bowles.|$|R

25|$|Dog Clothing is {{a garment}} made by humans for their canine companions. Dog clothes are {{available}} in various price ranges from inexpensive to high-end designer styles. Typically toy and small breed dogs, such as Chihuahuas and <b>Yorkshire</b> Terriers are <b>dressed</b> in dog clothes, although even large breeds like Golden Retrievers can wear clothes, too. It is more common to dress small dogs because they are easier to dress and they often suffer from the cold more due to their coats being less thick. Dog clothes are made to be either functional or for show. Functional dog clothes are for protection from the elements and allergens. Dog clothes that are purely for show would be used as costumes for holidays and special occasions such as Halloween or weddings.|$|R
