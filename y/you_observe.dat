Miller, {{author of}} Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Havoc (2002), writes: [...] "Cubism {{directly}} helped Niels Bohr discover {{the principle of}} complementarity in quantum theory, which says that something can be a particle and a wave at the same time, but {{it will always be}} measured to be either one or the other. In analytic cubism, artists tried to represent a scene from all possible viewpoints on one canvas." [...] Miller continues: [...] "An observer picks out one particular viewpoint. How you view the painting, that’s the way it is. Bohr read the book by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes on cubist theory, Du [...] "Cubisme". It inspired him to postulate that the totality of an electron is both a particle and a wave, but when <b>you</b> <b>observe</b> it you pick out one particular viewpoint." ...|$|E

2500|$|It can {{be easier}} to {{understand}} the correct answer if you consider the paradox as Bertrand originally described it. After a box has been chosen, but before a box is opened to let <b>you</b> <b>observe</b> a coin, the probability is [...] that the box has two {{of the same kind}} of coin. If the probability of [...] "observing a gold coin" [...] in combination with [...] "the box has two of the same kind of coin" [...] is , then the probability of [...] "observing a silver coin" [...] in combination with [...] "the box has two of the same kind of coin" [...] must also be [...] And if the probability that the box has two like coins changes to [...] {{no matter what kind of}} coin is shown, the probability would have to be [...] even if you hadn't observed a coin this way. Since we know his probability is , not , we have an apparent paradox. It can be resolved only by recognizing how the combination of [...] "observing a gold coin" [...] with each possible box can only affect the probability that the box was GS or SS, but not GG.|$|E
