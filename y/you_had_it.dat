2500|$|In the {{gap between}} the end of {{promotion}} for iMegaphone internationally and the re-promotion, Heap had also begun to think about her second solo album, and had started writing songs, both solo, as well as working with Guy Sigsworth; however, as she was without a record deal, the songs were shelved. During the time when she was unsigned, Heap appeared on two UK singles, [...] "Meantime" [...] (a track written by her former Acacia colleagues Guy Sigsworth and Alexander Nilere for the soundtrack to the independent British film, [...] ) and [...] "Blanket" [...] (a 1998 collaboration with Urban Species). In 2000, Heap sang on two tracks of the album <b>You</b> <b>Had</b> <b>It</b> Coming by Jeff Beck.|$|E
2500|$|She {{subsequently}} {{released her}} debut album, an alternative rock record, iMegaphone (1998), again with assistance from Sigsworth {{working as a}} producer on the album. However, as funding for Almo Sounds began to decline, Heap was dropped from the label. In the following period while without a label she performed multiple songs for the film , released two singles, and was featured on guitarist Jeff Beck's 2001 album <b>You</b> <b>Had</b> <b>It</b> Coming. In early 2002, Heap and Sigsworth formed the electronic duo Frou Frou, and released their only album to date, Details (2002), to critical acclaim. The duo broke up in late 2003, though they did reform temporarily to record a cover of the Bonnie Tyler song [...] "Holding Out for a Hero" [...] {{as part of the}} Shrek 2 soundtrack.|$|E
