The requirements for a person to be considered for participation in a playtest vary. Some playtests are open to anyone who cares to volunteer, while others specifically target professional gamers and journalists. Some playtests also try to evaluate the game's appeal to players with different levels of experience by selecting players with varying exposure to the game's genre.|$|E

50|$|Foix: Are you {{interested}} in the new paths or trends within current Hollywood production being tried by people like Coppola, Schrader, Spielberg, Scorsese or DePalma?Kubrick: I {{think one of the}} most interesting Hollywood films, well not Hollywood -- American films -- that I've seen in a long time is Claudia Weill's Girlfriends. That film, I thought, was one of the very rare American films that I would compare with the serious, intelligent, sensitive writing and filmmaking that you find in the best directors in Europe. It wasn't a success, I don't know why; it should have been. Certainly I thought it was a wonderful film. It seemed to make no compromise to the inner truth of the story, you know, the theme and everything else....The great problem is that the films cost so much now; in America it's almost impossible to make a good film -- which means <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> a certain amount of time on it, and have good technicians and good actors -- that aren't very, very expensive. This film that Claudia Weill did, I think she did on an amateur basis; she shot it for about a year, two or three days a week. Of course she had a great advantage, because she had all the time she needed to think about it, to see what she had done. I thought she made the film extremely well.|$|E

Why then aren't building owners rushing to retrofit their structures if it means saving money, improving employee comfort and property values, not to mention saving the planet? The reason lies in the inconvenient truth that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> money to save money.
