5|$|The {{area around}} Bow Street was first {{developed}} by Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford in 1633. Buildings were first erected {{on the west}} side of the street that <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was fully built by around 1635-6. Development to the northeast was restricted by a brick wall that had been built by the Earl's cousin, Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford, in 1610 as a land boundary and remained undeveloped for some time. It was eventually built on around 1673-7, with eleven properties constructed.|$|E

5|$|Zeta {{is one of}} the latest-forming {{tropical}} cyclones ever {{to develop}} in the recorded history of Atlantic hurricane seasons; the only later storm was Hurricane Alice of 1954–55, which is estimated to have become tropical on December 30, 1954 at 1:00a.m. EST (0600 UTC). It is also the second recorded North Atlantic tropical cyclone (after Alice) to exist in two calendar years. In addition, Zeta surpassed Alice as the longest-lived tropical cyclone to form in December and cross over into the next <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was also the longest-lived January tropical cyclone.

5|$|Altrincham has two theatres, the Altrincham Garrick Playhouse and the Club Theatre (latterly {{known as}} the Altrincham Little Theatre). The Altrincham Garrick group was formed in 1913. The Garrick held the world stage premier of Psycho in 1982. In 1998, it {{received}} a grant of £675,000 from the National Lottery {{as part of a}} £900,000 redevelopment of the theatre, which was completed in 1999. The Club Theatre group began in 1896, as the St Margaret's Church Institute Amateur Dramatics Society. It provides a venue for the Trafford Youth Theatre production each <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> runs the Hale One Act Festival, an annual week-long event started in 1972. The club has received awards from both the Greater Manchester Drama Federation and the Cheshire Theatre Guild. Altrincham also had Greater Manchester's only Michelin starred restaurant, the Juniper.|$|E
5|$|Curing {{the leaks}} and {{cleaning}} up the contamination delayed the tunnel's completion by a <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was finally opened on 22 August 1999. The entire process was further complicated by conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the Scandinavian Rock Group. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during the incidents, which should have been addressed in 1995, but were never taken seriously. Compensation was paid for approximately 60 houses which were damaged {{as a result of}} tunnel construction. An evaluation by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was spent fixing the leaks, but the report claimed that this was to a large extent a waste of money, resulting from inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the construction of the entire railway. In total the extraordinary additional costs for the tunnel totaled NOK1.3 billion.|$|E

5|$|For {{its first}} three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which {{it begins to}} forage for {{vegetation}} and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle {{at the same rate}} as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.|$|E
5|$|Hybrid Theory debuted {{at number}} 16 on the US Billboard 200, selling 50,000 copies {{in its first}} week. It was {{certified}} gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) five weeks after its release. In 2001, the album had sold 4.8 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was estimated that the album continued selling 100,000 copies per week in early 2002. Throughout the following years, the album continued to sell at a fast pace and was eventually certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005 for shipment of ten million copies in the United States. To date, the album has sold 30 million copies worldwide, which makes it the best selling debut album of the 21st century. As of July 2017, the album has sold 10,500,000 copies in the US. After the death of Chester Bennington on July 20, 2017, the album reached number 1 on the iTunes and Amazon music charts.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 John Fluor {{moved to}} Santa Ana, California {{for health reasons}} without his {{brothers}} and founded Fluor Corporation out of his garage under the name Fluor Construction Company. By 1924 the business had annual revenues of $100,000 ($1.36 million in 2013 dollars) and a staff of 100 employees. John Fluor delegated most of the company's operations to his sons, Peter and Simon Fluor. A $100,000 capital investment was made that <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was incorporated. John's eldest son Peter served as head of sales and grew the company to $1.5 million ($20.4 million in 2013 dollars) in revenues by 1929. In 1929 the company re-incorporated as Fluor Corporation. By the 1930s, Fluor had operations in Europe, the Middle East and Australia. Business declined rapidly during the Great Depression, but picked up again during World War II. During the war Fluor manufactured synthetic rubber and was responsible for {{a substantial portion of}} high-octane gasoline production in the United States. A Gas-Gasoline division of Fluor was created in Houston in 1948.|$|E

5|$|Initial rescue {{operations}} were hampered by inclement weather. Attempts to move New Carissa under her own power failed, and tugboat assistance {{was not available}} immediately after the grounding. Only one tugboat was available locally, but {{she was unable to}} cross the Coos Bay bar because of safety concerns. It was also uncertain whether or not the locally available tugboat could have successfully rescued New Carissa. The nearest salvage tugboat capable of towing a large ship off a beach, Salvage Chief, was moored at her home port of Astoria, Oregon, 200statutemiles(320km) to the north, a 24-hour journey away. Salvage Chief had not sailed in over a <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> took 18hours to fuel, provision, and find a crew for the ship. Once mobilized, poor weather in the Astoria area prevented the tugboat from crossing the treacherous Columbia River bar for an additional two days. Salvage Chief did not arrive in the area until 8 February four days after the grounding occurred.|$|E
5|$|M.I.A.'s debut studio album, Arular, was {{initially}} {{scheduled to be}} released in September 2004, but the release was delayed by six months due to problems with the clearance of samples used in the songs. She released two singles and a mixtape in the interim. Although the album had limited commercial success, it was highly regarded by music critics for its blending of genres such as grime, hip hop, ragga and Brazilian baile funk, and for its politicised lyrics. Music magazines in the United States and Europe included it in lists of the best albums of the <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was nominated for the Mercury Prize in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The 9th Spanish Legion {{participated in}} the Roman {{invasion}} of Britain, suffering losses under Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the rebellion of Boudica of 61, and setting up a fortress in 71 that later became part of Eburacum. Although some authors have claimed that the 9th Legion disappeared in 117, there are extant records for it later than that <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was probably annihilated in {{the east of the}} Roman Empire. For a time it was believed, at least by some British historians, that the legion vanished during its conflicts in present-day Scotland. This idea was used in the novels The Eagle of the Ninth by Rosemary Sutcliff, Legion From the Shadows by Karl Edward Wagner, Red Shift by Alan Garner, Engine City by Ken MacLeod, Warriors of Alavna by N. M. Browne, and in the feature films The Last Legion, Centurion and The Eagle.|$|E

5|$|The Hugo Award for Best Fancast {{is awarded}} to the best non-professional audio or video {{periodical}} devoted to science fiction, fantasy, or related subjects. The fancast must have released four or more episodes {{by the end of}} the previous calendar year, at least one of which appeared in that <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> must not qualify for the dramatic presentation category. It must also not provide or be published by an entity that provides a quarter or more of the income of any one person working on the fancast. The name of the award is a portmanteau of fan and podcast. The Hugo Award for Best Fancast was first proposed as a category after the 2011 awards, and then appeared as a temporary category at the 2012 awards. Temporary awards are not required to be repeated in following years. The 2013 awards, however, did repeat the category, and afterwards it was ratified as a permanent category, and will appear in all future years.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, among the most active seismic areas in the Southeastern United States and one capable of producing moderately strong earthquakes, a few of which have caused damage. The frequency for non-damaging earthquakes from this zone measures out to about one per <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> has produced many faint earthquakes recorded on seismographs. Such earthquakes have been helpful in highlighting the activity of faults below the Paleozoic detachment. Fault-plane solutions of multiple earthquakes throughout the area confirmed strike-slip faulting between two steeply declining planes. Both right and left-lateral movement occurs in the area, most movement being associated with north-to-south planes (right-lateral) and east-to-west planes (left-lateral). All of these mechanisms indicate reactivation of basement faults below more-recent faults. These basement faults probably converge on one another, and one being strong and the other being weak, produce earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The rival American Football League {{arose in}} 1960 and {{challenged}} the NFL's dominance. The AFL began in relative obscurity but eventually thrived, {{with an initial}} television contract with the ABC network. The AFL's existence forced the conservative NFL to expand to Dallas and Minnesota {{in an attempt to}} destroy the new league. Meanwhile, the AFL introduced many new features to Professional Football in the United States: official time on the scoreboard clock, rather than on a watch in the referee's pocket, as the NFL did; optional two-point conversions by pass or run after touchdowns; names on the jerseys of players; and several others, including expansion of the role of minority players, actively recruited by the league in contrast to the NFL. The AFL also signed several star college players that had also been drafted by NFL teams. Competition for players heated up in 1965, when the AFL New York Jets signed rookie Joe Namath to a then-record US$437,000 contract. A five-year, $40million NBC television contract followed, which helped to sustain the young league. The bidding war for players ended in 1966, when NFL owners approached the AFL regarding a merger, and the two leagues agreed on one that would take full effect in 1970. This agreement provided for a common draft that would take place each <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> instituted an annual World Championship game to be played between the champions of each league. That game began play {{at the end of the}} 1966 season. Once the merger was completed, it was no longer a championship game between two leagues, and reverted to the NFL championship game, which came to be known as the Super Bowl.|$|E
