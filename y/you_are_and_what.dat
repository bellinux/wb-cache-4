500|$|In {{a letter}} dated 17 July 1919, Delius advised {{the younger man}} to {{concentrate}} either on writing or composing: [...] "I ... know how gifted <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> possibilities are in you". By this time Heseltine's privately expressed opinions on Delius's music were increasingly critical, although in public he continued to sing his former mentor's praises. In The Musical Times he cited Fennimore and Gerda, Delius's final opera, as [...] "one {{of the most successful}} experiments in a new direction that the operatic stage has yet seen".|$|E
500|$|US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt {{also worked}} on Waller's behalf. Historian Richard B. Sherman states that she became {{involved}} {{after receiving a}} letter from Murray, which prompted her to write Governor Price requesting that he investigate whether Waller had received a fair trial and delay the execution. Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, in contrast, holds that the First Lady intervened after receiving a handwritten note from Waller himself saying [...] "I have heard lots of people speak of what a nice lady <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> I can hear is that you believe in helping the poor ... Please write to the Governor and get him to have mercy on me and allow me a chance." [...] Whatever its beginnings, Roosevelt's involvement in the case caused her to be widely criticized in the white Southern press.|$|E
500|$|Quinn is {{described}} by Agron as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) enemy, and [...] "terrible, the meanest girl". Agron said that her favorite part of Quinn is that [...] "she's smart. But she's also human, and through her tough exterior, she's often a little girl lost." [...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee." [...] Agron commented: [...] "Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [...] didn't exist a little bit. But [...] Ryan Murphy {{has a way of}} taking everything and turning it upside down. That's the great thing about this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless of who <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably actually go through in high school." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Where have <b>you</b> <b>been,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> doing?" [...] asked Norah. She still {{retained}} {{her grip}} upon me, {{and in her}} grey eyes was quiet determination.|$|R
6000|$|... "Man," [...] {{said the}} awful figure {{addressing}} him, [...] "where have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> have <b>you</b> done since last we spoke {{together in the}} midday dark at Venice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray compose yourself, sir," [...] said Holmes, [...] "and {{let me have}} a clear {{account of}} who <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> it is that has befallen you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah {{then there}} <b>you</b> <b>are!</b> <b>And</b> <b>what</b> I don't {{for the life}} of me make out," [...] Chad pursued with {{resigned}} perplexity, [...] "is what you GAIN by it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where have <b>you</b> <b>been,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{hiding behind}} you?" [...] asked Meg, {{surprised}} to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy {{had been out}} so early.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all sad business," [...] groaned Mrs. McFarlane, [...] "and I can see you're keeping {{something}} back. How did Cliff {{happen to}} know just where <b>you</b> <b>were?</b> <b>And</b> <b>what</b> started <b>you</b> back without your father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where have <b>you</b> <b>been,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> {{doing all}} this time?" [...] said Jane, as Trefusis came up, hurrying after Agatha. [...] "I don't know what you call it, but I call it {{perfectly}} disgraceful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I {{had a bad}} character, a {{deceitful}} disposition; and I'll {{let everybody}} at Lowood know what <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> you have done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, monsieur," [...] said he, [...] "{{consider}} what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> {{you will}} be. Consider how {{you and your}} kind live by abuses, and consider the harvest that abuses must ultimately bring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} {{sure they will}} not; even I, knowing who <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> you have done to {{yourself}} can hardly see any resemblance between your face now, {{and what it was}} then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And don't {{you know}} that I won't have no Poll Parroting {{on the part of}} my daughter? No, nor yet that I won't take no Poll Parroting from no man? <b>And</b> who may <b>YOU</b> <b>be,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> may <b>YOU</b> want?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell us who <b>you</b> <b>be,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> mission calls <b>you</b> to this unknown world {{beneath the}} Valley Dor, then {{maybe we can}} see our way to let you pass upon the errand which we should like to {{undertake}} would our orders permit." ...|$|R
6000|$|Upon {{that speech}} Sir Ector de Maris {{gathered}} himself {{up from the}} dust and said: [...] "Sir Knight, I pray you of your knighthood to tell us who <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> your degree, for I declare to you, I believe <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{one of the greatest}} knights-champion of the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{an admirable}} young lady <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> jolly good company! We must be better acquainted, for {{never before have}} I met a girl with such {{exquisite}} coloring or such natural, artless manners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have led}} you to our house,' she said. 'If you know where <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> its name may be, for your own sake I pray you forget it when you leave these doors.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might take}} it, {{if you were}} not a stranger," [...] she said. [...] "Why don't you tell us who <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> your reason is for living all by {{yourself}} in this dull place?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{tell us how}} and why {{and when}} you came. Take off your coat, my dear! <b>And</b> here <b>are</b> the old slippers. Why didn't you let us know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> coming so soon? How have <b>you</b> <b>been?</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> makes <b>you</b> so late to-night? Betsey, you needn't put on your bonnet. And--oh, my dear boy, have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> to supper yet?" ...|$|R
50|$|Much like today, {{hair for}} the Romans {{was as much}} an {{expression}} of personal identity as clothes. Hairstyles were determined {{by a number of}} factors, namely gender, age, social status, wealth and profession. A woman's hairstyle expressed her individuality in the Ancient Roman World. How one dressed one's hair was an indication of who <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> your role in society was.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{said the}} stranger, as if {{following}} an aggrieved line of apology, [...] "if Barstow knew who <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> you'd done, <b>and</b> still thought you {{good enough to}} rastle round here and square up them Pike County fellers and them kids--what in thunder do you care if the others DO find you out, as long as Barstow sticks to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} {{are you talking}} about?" [...] it asked. [...] "I am Norris Vine, and I am {{speaking}} into my own rooms. I {{want to know who}} <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> are you doing there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does it not, indeed?" [...] exclaimed the nun, innocently. [...] "What {{a strange}} man <b>you</b> <b>are!</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> a {{remarkable}} religion yours must be! What do your priests say about ours? Are they learned men, your priests?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do believe}} it; I do, indeed. Nothing can ever alter my belief again. Will you not, then, {{tell me who}} <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> is this thing, which you call dishonourable, that brought you into Languedoc?" ...|$|E

It {{depended}} on who <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> believed. It <b>was</b> parents' day at the Children of God commune in Dallas, the one time a year when most of the parents of the 20 or so residents of the commune come to visit. ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So you are here?' said Sidonia. 'Turn {{now with}} me, for I see {{you are only}} lounging, and tell me when you came, where <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> you have done since we parted. I have been here myself but a few days.' ...|$|E
60|$|By restoration--judicious restoration, as Mr. Murray usually {{calls it}} --there is no saying {{how much you}} have lost, Putting the {{question}} of restoration out of your mind, however, for a while, think where <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> {{you have got to}} look at.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does the}} woman mean?" [...] said he, looking down towards the rug beneath his feet, but {{speaking}} quite out loud. [...] "Settle her {{position in the}} parish! Why, ma'am, I don't know who <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> your position is, or anything about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want {{to spoil}} your lunch," [...] he said, [...] "but Freddie knows all. He has tracked you down. He met Nelly Bryant, whom {{he seems to}} have made friends with in London, and she told him where <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> doing. For a girl who fled at his mere {{approach}} the night before last, you don't seem very agitated by the news," [...] he said, as Jill burst into a peal of laughter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye are {{a strange}} pair," [...] quoth Dingaan. [...] "Where have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> now, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> your {{business}} at the Place of the Elephant?" ...|$|R
