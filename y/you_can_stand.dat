500|$|An early painting, The Cabaret of Mère Anthony (1866), {{represents}} for Renoir [...] "some of {{the most}} agreeable memories" [...] of his life with friends at a village inn during this time. [...] He soon moved {{to the village of}} Chailly near Marlotte and the forest of Fontainebleau, and began working with model Lise Tréhot who posed for him between 1866 and 1872. Renoir began painting at La Grenouillère, a popular middle class day resort with a floating dance hall, in late 1868. [...] Like Monet and several other Impressionists, Renoir worked en plein air, painting outdoors, but unlike Monet, who was known for painting in the cold and snow, Renoir was not fond of cold temperatures. [...] Years later, he told art dealer Ambroise Vollard that he could not stand the cold: [...] "But then, even if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>stand</b> the cold, why paint snow? [...] It is a blight on the face of Nature." [...] Although it is unknown when his symptoms began, Renoir was known to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis from at least 1892 onward, an affliction which would severely restrict his artistic production in late life.|$|E

[...] It's where the stream runs {{out across the}} beach, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>stand</b> on the sands and look {{over the edge of}} the cliffs without even {{standing}} on your toes. [...] Farther along the cliffs are higher and crumbly and falling into the sea all the time, which was one reason why nobody wanted to buy Dilly Dally. [...] A few more years and it would be in the sea along with the cliff." ...|$|E
2500|$|Consumer Reports {{described}} the six-cylinder Chevy II as an [...] "ultra-sensible, conventional car with outstanding interior space," [...] but also reported [...] "higher than average" [...] interior noise levels. There were also {{complaints about the}} four-cylinder version's lack of refinement. [...] "CR hesitates to recommend the Four for normal use. The Four is an excellent hackabout for specialized local use – if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>stand</b> the vibration." [...] McCahill put it this way: [...] "The four wasn't the smoothest four I have ever driven, but it had nice response and will probably still be running long after Castro shaves his beard off." [...] Consumer Reports in 1963: [...] "New last year, the Chevy II has not yet developed into a smooth-riding, quiet, or in any sense luxurious car. It is an easy driving, agile one. By far its most important asset is a body with substantially the room of intermediate cars, but with a very compact silhouette and especially good entrance height." ...|$|E

The chandeliered room has ten tables for the usual fun and games, plus 30 slot machines lining the walls. Beyond the gambling room are the nightclub's two dining, dancing and show areas. The two areas are distinct: one is outdoors, with tall royal palms rising among and over the tables; the other is indoors and called the Crystal Arch. The Arch is indeed a huge, modernistic arch-like structure, and this area is used in inclement weather (and also when the outdoor area gets so crowded {{that there is no}} more room for customers). Tropicana's total seating capacity: 1,750, but of course <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>stand</b> at the bar or at the crap table, and the management won't object at all. Because of Tropicana's bucolic surroundings, the producer of the shows, Rodrigo Neira (better known simply as Rodney), can really spread himself. A Tropicana production number is not complete unless it includes at least half the chorus line dancing on catwalks among the trees. The schoolteacher from Paducah is suitable impressed when he sees scantily clad lassies scampering in front of him, to his right, to his left and above him. This is as hard on the neck muscles as watching a tennis match." ...|$|E
