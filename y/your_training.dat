Harry lost both legs after the patrol he was {{commanding}} ran over a roadside bomb. Parker later spoke about {{the aftermath of the}} incident, saying [...] "it was pretty bad at that stage, they didn't know if Harry would survive or not. It helped being a soldier because all <b>your</b> <b>training</b> is about remaining as calm and calculating as you can in very difficult circumstances. But it was foul." [...] Harry was injured shortly before Parker was due to take up the position of deputy commander of the International Security Assistance Force. [...] Parker did assume the post on schedule, later saying [...] "Harry would be horrified if I didn't go. He'd think I was a wimp".|$|E

50|$|Here is an {{everyday}} {{experience of the}} basic nature of the Descartes experiment: Consider sitting in <b>your</b> <b>train</b> and noticing a train originally at rest beside you in the railway station pulling away. Initially {{you think it is}} <b>your</b> own <b>train</b> accelerating, but then notice with surprise that you feel no force. Thus, it is not <b>your</b> own <b>train</b> moving, but the neighboring train. On the other hand, you would confirm <b>your</b> own <b>train</b> is accelerating if you sensed g-forces from the acceleration of <b>your</b> own <b>train.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{understand}} you,' said Mr. Gradgrind; 'you still {{refer to}} your father. I {{have heard from}} Miss Louisa that you still preserve that bottle. Well!

This excitement of yours is only automatic and conventional. You really don't mean it. You don't even feel it.

You can't {{altogether}} get rid of what you're taught when young, and it's harder when the notions you inherit are backed by <b>your</b> <b>training.</b> Well, I saw there was a danger of my turning out a hobo if I went back North without a job.

"And {{that reminds}} me, ungrateful dog that I am, that I owe as much [...] to <b>your</b> <b>training</b> as the rude country job-printer owes {{to the city}} [...] boss who takes him in hand and teaches him {{the right way to}} handle [...] his art.

6000|$|... "Yes; {{it is one}} of {{the most}} {{beautiful}} as well as useful of all the arts a woman can learn. Not so romantic, perhaps, as singing, painting, writing, or teaching, even; but one that makes many happy and comfortable, and home the sweetest place in the world. Yes, you may open your big eyes; but it is a fact that I had rather see you a good housekeeper than the greatest belle in the city. It need not interfere with any talent you may possess, but it is a necessary part of <b>your</b> <b>training,</b> and I hope that you will set about it at once, now that you are well and strong." ...|$|E

Mighty queer things happen in this profession of ours, and circumstances lead the best of us by the nose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My artist {{friends as}} a rule agree with me in these matters, [...] and that is another reason why your unsympathetic {{attitude}} [...] surprises and grieves me.
