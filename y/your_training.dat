Harry lost both legs after the patrol he was {{commanding}} ran over a roadside bomb.

[...] Harry was injured shortly before Parker was due to take up the position of deputy commander of the International Security Assistance Force. [...] Parker did assume the post on schedule, later saying [...] "Harry would be horrified if I didn't go. He'd think I was a wimp".|$|E

Thus, it is not <b>your</b> own <b>train</b> moving, but the neighboring train. On the other hand, you would confirm <b>your</b> own <b>train</b> is accelerating if you sensed g-forces from the acceleration of <b>your</b> own <b>train.</b>|$|R
