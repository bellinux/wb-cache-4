5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E
500|$|After {{nearly three}} hours of shouts from the angry crowd, {{officers}} moved in to quell the riot. Police reportedly covered their badges with black tape—preventing any identification—and attacked rioters. Dozens of police officers swept into the crowd, using tear gas to force protesters away from the building. Police were surprised at the resistance they faced from the protesters, who attempted to push them back using tree branches, chrome torn off city buses, and asphalt ripped from the street, as weapons. As one man ignited the last police car he shouted to a reporter [...] "Make sure <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paper that I ate too many Twinkies." [...] Sixty officers were injured, and about two dozen arrests were made.|$|E

What thrills me about Holby {{is that you}} get back what <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E

60|$|It was, therefore, in the {{interest}} of clearly ascertained economy that Lindora took her brood with her to a White Mountain hotel, where she made a merit of getting board for seventeen dollars and a half a week, when so many were paying twenty and twenty-five. Florindo came up twice during the summer, and stayed a fortnight each time, and fished, and said that it had been a complete rest. On the way back to town Lindora stopped for October in one of those nice spring-and-fall places where <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> half-season which is so unwholesome in the city after a long summer in the country, and afterward she always did this. Fortunately, Florindo was prospering, and he could afford the increased cost of this method of saving. The system was practised with great success for four or five years, and then, suddenly, it failed.|$|E
60|$|Dear Sir,--My {{attention}} was attracted {{the other day}} by the thoroughly pertinent questions which <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons, and which the Government failed to answer. It put an idea in my head that you were perhaps the man who might take up a task which I am almost ready to give up. Mataafa is now known to be my hobby. People laugh when they see any mention of his name over my signature, and the Times, while it still grants me hospitality, begins to lead the chorus. I know that nothing can be more fatal to Mataafa's cause than {{that he should be}} made ridiculous, and I cannot help feeling that a man who makes his bread by writing fiction labours under the disadvantage of suspicion when he touches on matters of fact. If I were even backed up before the world by one other voice, people might continue to listen, and in the end something might be done. But so long as I stand quite alone, telling the same story, which becomes, apparently, not only more tedious, but less credible by repetition, I feel that I am doing nothing good, possibly even some evil.|$|E

5000|$|Beckman {{was often}} {{said to be}} a Cassandra for prophesying doom, but he told The Times in April 1987 that he was simply a realist who {{believed}} that wealth could not come against a background of high unemployment and global economic stagnation. Of the stockmarket, which subsequently crashed in October 1987 on Black Monday, he said [...] "The market is rising because of the 'Greater Fool Theory'. You buy a share in the hope that a greater fool will eventually pay more for it. In the end it is bought by 'The Greatest Fool of All', just before the end. The market is like a balloon, the more air <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in,</b> <b>the</b> nearer you are to bursting point." ...|$|E
