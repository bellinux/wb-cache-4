40|$|MAXILLARY CENTRAL INCISOR CROWN-ROOT RELATIONSHIPS IN CLASS I NORMAL OCCLUSIONS AND <b>CLASS</b> <b>III</b> OPEN AND DEEP MALOCCLUSIONS By Jessica Fuller M. S. Thesis Research Project Introduction: The {{purposes}} of this thesis were several: (1) to examine a new crown-to-root angle based on anatomic points, the labial crown-root angle (LCRA), that was proposed in a recent University of Iowa thesis by Bauer, T. J. (2014) and correlate it with the collum angle (CA) values for Class I normal occlusions and <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> malocclusions; (2) to establish mean values for CA and LCRA for Class I normal occlusions and <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> open and deep bite malocclusions and statistically compare the groups; (3) to compare {{the significance of the}} correlation between overbite measures and CA and LCRA in the <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> sample. Only one study addressed the increased CA in <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> malocclusions however, the study did not include a normal occlusion control sample. Methods: 46 Class I normal samples, 20 <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> open bite samples and 22 <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> deep bite samples who met the inclusion criteria were measured cephalometrically. Relevant landmarks were placed, analyzed for reliability, and recorded for the measurements of interest. Results: A strong increasing correlation was found between CA and LCRA for all samples (Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation coefficient = 0. 82, p 3 ̆c. 0001). The mean CA for the <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> deep bite group (9. 32 ± 4. 46) was significantly different from the Class I normal core (3. 38 ± 1. 70), Class I expanded (3. 60 ± 1. 94) and <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> open bite (5. 24 ± 3. 99) groups (ANOVA). The mean LCRA for the <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> deep bite group (39. 67 ± 5. 64) was also significantly different from Class I normal core (31. 97 ± 4. 25), Class I expanded (33. 53 ± 5. 65) and <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> open bite (35. 55 ± 5. 65) groups (ANOVA). There was no significant correlation between CA and overbite within <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> open (p= 0. 8029) and <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> deep bite groups (p= 0. 2089) or LCRA and overbite within <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> open (p= 0. 7529) and <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> deep bite groups (p= 0. 1864). Conclusions: LCRA and CA were highly correlated in <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> patients. Patients with <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> deep bites had statistically higher means for CA and LCRA than patients with Class I normal occlusions and <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> open bite malocclusions.

40|$|<b>Class</b> <b>III</b> beta-tubulin {{is one of}} the {{critical}} proteins associated with microtubule assembly, important to many cellular functions including mitochondrial respiration and intracellular trafficking. Widely regarded as a specific neuronal marker in developmental neurobiology and stem cell research, it is also highly expressed {{in a wide range of}} tumors of both neuronal and non-neuronal origin. The expression of <b>class</b> <b>III</b> beta-tubulin is tightly controlled at multiple levels with tissue-dependent mechanisms of regulation. For instance, <b>class</b> <b>III</b> beta-tubulin expression is under the control of estrogens in breast cancer cells but is influenced by exposure to hypoxia and poor-nutrient supply in ovarian cancer. In some but not all cancers, <b>class</b> <b>III</b> beta-tubulin expression is purely a prognostic biomarker, predicting poor outcome of patients regardless of chemotherapy treatment. Moreover, the expression of <b>class</b> <b>III</b> beta-tubulin does not confer an aggressive phenotype by itself. Instead, <b>class</b> <b>III</b> beta-tubulin functions like a cytoskeletal gateway, which enhances the incorporation of pro-survival kinases into the cytoskeleton and protects them from degradation. The associations of <b>class</b> <b>III</b> beta-tubulin with survival kinase PIM- 1, RNA-binding protein HuR, microRNAs are examples highlighting the functional complexity of this protein. The utility of <b>class</b> <b>III</b> beta-tubulin as a prognostic biomarker can also greatly improve if combined with these pro-survival partners. Subsequently, pharmacogenetic approaches, designed to counteract and target these pathways and associated-factors concurrently, might lead to better therapies and prognostic tools for <b>class</b> <b>III</b> beta-tubulin expressing cancers...|$|R

METHODS: MCF- 7 (ER+ve) and MDA-MB- 231 (ER-ve) were either transfected with pALTER-TUBB 3 or siRNA-tubb 3 and 24 h later exposed to test compounds for a further 96 h for proliferation studies.

RESULTS: The model allowed for subtle changes in <b>class</b> <b>III</b> beta-tubulin expression to be achieved, which had no direct effect on the viability of the cells. <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> beta-tubulin overexpression conferred resistance to paclitaxel and vinorelbine, whereas downregulation of <b>class</b> <b>III</b> beta-tubulin rendered cells more sensitive to these two drugs.
