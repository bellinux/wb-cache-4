Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; [...] " [...] came in out of nowhere and just gave me, start to finish, the whole story." [...] Vitti said renting the film was the first thing he did after finishing the script. He remarked, [...] "It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find." ...|$|E
