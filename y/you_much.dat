500|$|Southey {{intended}} Madoc {{to rival}} {{the works of}} Homer, and Coleridge believed that the poem {{would be better than}} the Aeneid. However, Madoc received mixed reviews from critics; while one critic believed it was comparable to John Milton's Paradise Lost, another felt that it was unreadable. In letter written by William Wordsworth on 3 June 1805, he claimed that he was [...] "highly pleased with it; it abounds in beautiful pictures and descriptions happily introduced, and there is an animation diffused through the whole story though it cannot perhaps be said that any of the characters interest <b>you</b> <b>much,</b> except perhaps young Llewllyn whose situation is highly interesting, and he appears to me the best conceived and sustained character in the piece [...] The Poem fails in the highest gifts of the poet's mind Imagination in the true sense of the word, and knowledge of human Nature and human heart. There is nothing that shows the hand of the great Master". He followed this with a letter on 29 July 1805 saying [...] "Southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a Hero. The character of Madoc is often very insipid and contemptible [...] In short, according to my notion, the character is throughout languidly conceived". Dorothy Wordsworth, William's sister, wrote on 11 June 1805 to claim that [...] "We have read Madoc with great delight [...] I had one painful feeling throughout, that I did not care as much about Madoc as the Author wished me to do, and that the characters in general are not sufficiently distinct to make them have a separate after-existence in my affection." ...|$|E
500|$|Crush {{received}} [...] "favorable" [...] reviews, while CRUSH3D received [...] "average" [...] reviews, {{according to}} the review aggregation website Metacritic. The PSP version was highly praised for its innovative approach to gameplay. [...] Ryan Davis of GameSpot appreciated Crush for owing [...] "very little of its novel concept to games that preceded it". [...] Nick Suttner of 1UP called the game a [...] "cognitively rewarding, expertly designed puzzle experience that truly plays like nothing else". [...] Reviews were mixed on the game's learning curve. [...] IGN's Jeremy Dunham praised the ordering of the puzzle elements, that new gaming elements are introduced at [...] "an ideal pace", and that most puzzles have solutions where the player must [...] "think 'outside the box'". Eurogamers Dan Whitehead commented that the game introduces these elements too quickly and [...] "doesn't give <b>you</b> <b>much</b> time to put the basics into practice". Some critics found that elements of the game detracted from the game's uniqueness. X-Plays Greg Orlando, while stating that this was [...] "one of the most novel games ever made", noted that it was [...] "simply not very fun", as it lacked many player incentives beyond manipulating the world and collecting objects on each level. Reviewers noted that some puzzles were awkward due to {{the selection of the}} PlayStation Portable's controls. Reviewers found the game's story poor, but this was overcome by the gameplay elements; Charles Herold of The New York Times said [...] "the minimal story is as forgettable as its puzzles are ingenious." [...] Gus Mastrapa of The A.V. Club said that the game [...] "satisfies the innate gamer need to express the world in easy-to-manipulate numbers and objects." [...] GamesRadar included Crush in their list of the 100 most overlooked games of its generation. Editor Jason Fanelli stated that the ability to switch from 2D to 3D was [...] "one of the most unique (at the time) features we’ve ever seen." ...|$|E

It was less appreciated by British critics, {{in large part because of}} his favorable view of the French Revolution and of Napoleon Bonaparte. The British historian Thomas Carlyle, who wrote his own history of the French Revolution, complained that it [...] "was far as possible from meriting its high reputation", though he admitted that Thiers is [...] "a brisk man in his way, and will tell <b>you</b> <b>much</b> if you know nothing". The historian George Saintsbury wrote in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911): [...] "Thiers' historical work is marked by extreme inaccuracy, by prejudice which passes the limits of accidental unfairness, and by an almost complete indifference to the merits as compared with the successes of his heroes." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Chris Watters scored it 6.5 out of 10, writing [...] "Deadlight draws you in {{with its}} rich, {{pervasive}} atmosphere, but doesn't give <b>you</b> <b>much</b> to do once you're there", calling the game [...] "an alluringly dark, but disappointingly shallow experience." [...] He praised the graphics, arguing [...] "the artistic elements work in harmony to make Deadlight a visually compelling game." [...] However, he {{was critical of}} the gameplay, writing [...] "linearity isn't inherently negative, but performing the same few moves to progress down a clearly marked path doesn't hold its appeal for long." [...] He concluded [...] "In the three or so hours {{that it takes to}} complete the game, you feel less like you are trekking through a dangerous world, and more like you are acting out a script. Deadlights engrossing visuals make it fun to play the part, but you'll wish you had more lines." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{announcement}} of the storyline, Soaplife said it [...] "could be fun but could be the ruin of Kat if they get it wrong", and wondered if it would put EastEnders [...] "back on top of its game", saying, [...] "That depends on Kat. If we're made to love and care about her, yes. If she comes over as a conniving, sneaky cheat only interested in her own wants and desires, no." [...] They opined that Alfie {{should be the one}} having the affair, as he cannot do anything right in Kat's eyes. They also said they [...] "wondered which Kat we'd be getting back after Jessie Wallace's break. Would it be the tart with a heart that made Kat a soap icon? Or the alley Kat that we got last year (Kat down the alley with delivery man Mark was not her finest moment). Now with the reveal that she'll have a mystery that we can all spend weeks or months trying to guess , we fear it will be more alley Kat." [...] All About Soap thought that because of the way Kat got rid of Roxy after she moved in with Alfie while Kat was away, [...] "you'd think that [...] Kat was really committed to her husband [...] and determined to make her marriage work" [...] but called the affair [...] "sizzling", saying it would [...] "send shockwaves all round Albert Square!" [...] Soaplife said that the storyline {{may turn out to be}} a good mystery, but [...] "when it comes to affairs, we prefer ours with a heap-big dose of love". However, they later said the storyline was [...] "getting boring". In All About Soap, letters page editor Laura thought the affair would be [...] "the hottest thing in the Square this summer!" [...] Soaplife awarded the storyline a bronze medal in their [...] "2012 Soap Olympics" [...] for [...] "best storyline cycling", as Kat is [...] "cheating again. Round and round she goes." [...] Kate White from Inside Soap said: [...] "Well, Kathleen Slater Moon, if you were hoping to win our sympathy by suggesting that this secret fling business is all Alfie's fault, think again! Yes, it's a bit annoying when your other half is too busy to pay <b>you</b> <b>much</b> attention—but there should at least be an effort to sort out your issues before you decide cheating is the answer! We're finding it hard to have sympathy". The magazine later called the storyline [...] "unusual" [...] but said that [...] "Kat has been busy showing us how infidelity should be done". When the affair turned from lust to love, Soaplife said that it was [...] "what the affair needed right from the start in order to save Kat's reputation." [...] Steven Murphy, editor of Inside Soap said that when the storyline started, he and his colleagues were [...] "a little intrigued" [...] but after Michael was eliminated, they were [...] "totally obsessed!" [...] An Inside Soap reporter said that [...] " [...] decision to keep the man's identity a secret—and to have several characters reacting as if it could be them—means that this is soap like we've never seen it before", and added that [...] "it makes for frustrating viewing at times, but there's no denying that this plot has us well and truly hooked. It's not so much a 'whodunnit?' as a 'who-done-her?'" ...|$|E
