The caption for the page reads, [...] "Ted has a tricycle, so very small, He cannot ride it, because he's so tall. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> WHO the rider will be, Just open the flap, and then you will see." [...] Opening the flap reveals two monkeys riding a tricycle.|$|E

Big, burly drummers and farmers and ex-soldiers and high-collared dudes and sports that, a few moments before, were filling the car with noise and bragging, get so scared that their ears flop.|$|E

You will find out that it is worth while to wait for the farthing change, that it is worth while to walk a mile to save a penny, that a glass of beer is a luxury to be indulged in only at rare intervals, and that a collar can be worn for four days.|$|E

Why, otherwise, should he be so desperately anxious that she should not get so near him as to see his features? You describe him as bending over the handle-bar. Concealment again, you see.

'No, I {{destroyed}} it; but I {{remember that}} he said that a man had arrived at his station who declared that two months' journey beyond Mt Lekakisera, which no white man has yet visited -- at least, so far as I know -- he found a lake called Laga, and that then {{he went off to}} the north-east, a month's journey, over desert and thorn veldt and great mountains, till he came to a country where the people are white and live in stone houses. Here he was hospitably entertained for a while, till at last the priests of the country set it about that he was a devil, and the people drove him away, and he journeyed for eight months and reached Mackenzie's place, as I heard, dying. That's all I know; and if you ask me, I believe that it is a lie; but if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> more about it, you had better go up the Tana to Mackenzie's place and ask him for information.' ...|$|E

Hasn't some old Johnny somewhere {{described}} it as the poetry of the ploughshare? Why did we ever take to bothering about anything else-- shutting ourselves up in stuffy offices, worrying ourselves to death {{about a lot of}} rubbish that isn't any good to anybody? I wish I could put it properly, Dad; you would see just what I mean. Why don't we live in simply-built houses and get most everything we want out of the land: which we easily could? You take a dozen poor devils away from walking behind the plough and put them down into coal-mines, and set them running about half-naked among a lot of roaring furnaces, and between them they turn out a machine that does the ploughing for them. What is the sense of it? Of course some things are useful. I would like a motor-car, and railways and steamboats are all right; {{but it seems to me}} that half the fiddle- faddles we fancy we want we'd be just as well, if not better, without, and there would be all that time and energy to spare for the sort of things that everybody ought to have. It's everywhere just like it was at school. They kept us so hard at it, studying Greek roots, we hadn't time to learn English grammar. Look at young Dennis Yewbury. He's got two thousand acres up in Scotland. He could lead a jolly life turning the place into some real use. Instead of which he lets it all run to waste for nothing but to breed a few hundred birds that wouldn't keep a single family alive; while he works from morning till night at humbugging people in a beastly hole in the City, just to fill his house with a host of silly gim-cracks and dress up himself and his women-folk like peacocks. Of course we would always want clever chaps like you to tell us stories; and doctors we couldn't do without, though I guess if we were leading sensible lives we'd be able to get along with about half of them. It seems to me that what we want is a comfortable home, enough to eat and drink, and a few fal-lal sort of things to make the girls look pretty; and that all the rest is rot. We would all of us have time then to think and play a bit, and if we were all working fairly at something really useful and were contented with our own share, there'd be enough for everybody.|$|E

An outline of the Unit´s principal activities is published in a quarterly newsletter for the information of colleagues in the Parliament and in the other EU institutions.

5000|$|He {{is always}} called either [...] "The Man" [...] or fully [...] "The Man with the Yellow Hat".

5000|$|From Bulverism by C. S. Lewis:Suppose I think, {{after doing}} my accounts, that I {{have a large}} balance at the bank. And suppose <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> whether this belief of mine is [...] "wishful thinking." [...] You can never come to any {{conclusion}} by examining my psychological condition. Your only chance of finding out is {{to sit down and}} work through the sum yourself. When you have checked my figures, then, and then only, will you know whether I have that balance or not. If you find my arithmetic correct, then no amount of vapouring about my psychological condition can be anything but a waste of time. If you find my arithmetic wrong, then it may be relevant to explain psychologically how I came to be so bad at my arithmetic, and the doctrine of the concealed wish will become relevant — but only after you have yourself done the sum and discovered me to be wrong on purely arithmetical grounds. It is the same with all thinking and all systems of thought. If you try to find out which are tainted by speculating about the wishes of the thinkers, you are merely making a fool of yourself. You must first find out on purely logical grounds which of them do, in fact, break down as arguments. Afterwards, if you like, go on and discover the psychological causes of the error.|$|E

5000|$|Local search, like {{ordinary}} search, can {{be applied}} in two ways. As John Battelle coined it in his book [...] "The Search," [...] search can be either recovery search or discovery search.This perfect search also has perfect recall - it knows what you’ve seen, and can discern between a journey of discovery - where <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> something new - and recovery - where <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> something you’ve seen before.This applies especially to local search. Recovery search implies, for example, that a consumer knows who she is looking for (i.e., Main Street Pizza Parlor) {{but she does not}} know where they are, or needs their phone number. Discovery search implies that the searcher knows, for example, what she wants but not who she needs it from (i.e., pizza on Main Street in Springfield).|$|R
