The ultimate objective of <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> programs is to consider all the benefits of <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> participation {{rather than focusing on}} one or two at the cost of the other(s). It is suggested that researchers, sport administrators, coaches, and parents work together to promote sporting activities and programs that are more likely to enhance children’s physical health, psychosocial development and lifelong recreational or elite sport participation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Youth</b> <b>sport</b> {{coaches in}} the U. S. fulfill a vital role yet many are untrained or receive limited {{opportunities}} for coaching education. Due to the situated and social nature of sport coaching, coaches’ communities of practice (CCoP) have been offered as a complementary pathway for the continuing professional development of <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> coaches. The {{purpose of this study}} was to design and cultivate a <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> CCoP in order to identify (a) the types of coaches’ knowledge shared and (b) the value coaches found through their participation in the CCoP. Participants included five <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> coaches from one organization in an urban area of the northwestern U. S. Data collection included community session transcripts, reflective journals, and semi-structured interviews. Frameworks from both the sport coaching and social learning literature were used to analyze the data. The coaches’ emphasized professional knowledge in the areas of pedagogy and sport principles and interpersonal knowledge related to local sport culture and interacting with parents. Coaches also found immediate and potential value through their participation. The results also suggest culture should be considered as an additional construct located within coaches’ interpersonal knowledge.

40|$|<b>Youth</b> <b>sport</b> {{has been}} {{advocated}} {{as a vehicle}} through which more physically active lifestyles can be encouraged among children and adolescents. Employing objective assessments of physical activity (PA), {{the purpose of this}} thesis was to investigate the value of <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> as a context for PA promotion and obesity prevention. Results from Study 1 indicated 37 % of <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> football participants did not meet recommended levels of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) during their <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> engagement. Study 2 demonstrated negative associations between daily PA levels of grassroots footballers and obesity linked health outcomes, with the reverse true for sedentary time (ST). Guided by self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1987), findings from Studies 3 and 4 revealed perceptions of coach provided autonomy support were positively associated with sport related autonomous motivation, and in turn, higher MVPA participation (daily MVPA as well as PA accrued during <b>youth</b> <b>sport)</b> and lower ST. This thesis underlines the value of <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> as a setting through which levels of PA can be increased, and ST reduced among youth. Research described within also points to the important role of the coach-created environment and player motivation in predicting variability in PA engagement and ST among young grassroots footballers...|$|R
40|$|Nearly 90 % of American youth {{participate}} in organized <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> during childhood and/or adolescence. Parents are important contributors, as they typically encourage/ initiate children’s sport involvement and provide instrumental {{and emotional support}} for children over their careers. Although parent involvement is instrumental in <b>youth</b> <b>sport,</b> media and anecdotal reports often characterize sport parents as a necessary evil. This {{has led to a}} cultural debate on the appropriateness of parent involvement in <b>youth</b> <b>sport,</b> and what impact that might have on child outcomes. However, despite the rising costs associated with <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> participation, few researchers have examined the potential impact of family financial investment on parent and child outcomes in <b>youth</b> <b>sport.</b> As such, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine how families’ investment in travel and club sports impacted children’s sport enjoyment and motivation to participate. Parents and athletes from 203 families responded to survey items pertaining to family demographics, parent involvement (e. g., pressure and support), as well as the children’s sport enjoyment and motivation to participate. Data illuminate an inverse association between family financial investment and sport enjoyment via higher levels of parent pressure, highlighting the potentially harmful impact of families’ high financial investment in children’s organized <b>youth</b> <b>sport...</b>|$|R

5|$|Schnaufer, {{at the age}} of six, went to {{the local}} Volksschule (primary school) at Calw. After {{completing}} his fourth grade, he received two years of schooling at the Oberschule, also in Calw. At an early age he expressed his wish to join an organisation of military character and joined the Deutsches Jungvolk (German Youth) in 1933. After completing his sixth grade at school he took and passed the entry examination at the Backnang National Political Institutes of Education (Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalt—Napola), a secondary boarding school founded under the recently established Nazi state. The goal of the Napola schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military and administrative leadership of the Third Reich. Schnaufer was considered a very good student, finishing top of his class every year. Aged seventeen he graduated with his Abitur (diploma) in November 1939 with distinction. At the Napola school he also received the Reich <b>Youth</b> <b>Sports</b> Badge, the base-certificate of the German Life Saving Association (Deutsche Lebens-Rettungs-Gesellschaft), the bronze Hitler Youth-Performance Badge (HJ-Leistungsabzeichen), and completed his B-license to fly glider aircraft. In 1939 Schnaufer was one of two students posted to the Napola in Potsdam. The Flying Platoon (Fliegerzug) stationed in Potsdam centralised all the destined flyers from all the Napolas. Here he learned to fly glider aircraft, at first short hops on the DFS SG 38 Schulgleiter, and later on the two-seater Göppingen Gö 4 which was towed by a Klemm Kl 25. During his stay at Potsdam, the film producer Karl Ritter was making the Ufa film Cadets in Potsdam. The Napola had detached two companies to work on the film, among them Schnaufer. It remains unclear exactly what role he played in this film.|$|E

40|$|While the {{importance}} and scope of children’s sport participation has been a topic of research, to date, few researchers have explored the impact organized <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> may have on family life. In particular, {{little attention has been}} paid to the way in which family relationships, interactions, and values are shaped by children’s sport involvement. This study seeks to address this gap in the literature and the social and cultural context in which <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> participation occurs. Specifically, the connection between children’s participation in <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> and contemporary motherhood and fatherhood ideologies is explored, including the relation between <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> and being a “good parent”. Changing parenting ideologies and their implications for gender relations are also addressed. An interpretive approach was used to discover behavioural, relational, and emotional aspects of <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> and family life. The setting for the study was a rural community (which included both farm and non-farm residences) since such communities are characterized by fewer services (e. g., leisure facilities, public transportation, health care) and higher rates of poverty and unemployment. Semi-structured interviews and on-line participant journals (10 days duration) were used to discover divergent experiences of mothers, fathers, and children. A purposive sample of seven families (19 children, 7 mothers, and 6 fathers) participated in the study. Data analysis was guided by a constructivist grounded theory approach to facilitate understanding of participants’ perceptions and meanings of <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> participation. The data revealed three major themes. The first theme “Understanding Children’s Experiences” relates to children’s perceptions of their scheduled lives, the impact organized sport has on their relationships with their siblings, and how they perceive their parents’ involvement and support. The second theme “Parenting in Public and Private Spaces” reveals the parents’ perspectives on the high cost of <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> for the family unit (emotional, physical, and financial cost), how the parents’ involvement with the sport organization shapes the parent-child relationship, the judgment of other parents’ behaviours, and meaning and significance of being a “good parent”. The third theme that developed from the analysis, “The Nexus of Family Experiences”, illustrates the intersection of the children’s and parents’ perspectives. This theme reveals the complexity of the decision-making processes and the positive and negative experiences of <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> for different family members. The core theme, “Upholding Team Family”, represents the culmination of the children’s and parents’ experiences, and helps to capture and integrate the insights gained from the analysis as a whole. This theme focuses on the centrality of organized <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> in the construction of a sense of “team family”, as well as the sacrifices and contradictory aspects of maintaining this ideal. Further, the gendered nature of organized <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> involvement and how rurality shapes the families’ sport involvement, are also discussed. The themes that emerged from this study reflect the contradictory nature of organized <b>youth</b> <b>sport,</b> including the strengthening of familial relationships, as well as the tensions and disagreements arising out of divergent perspectives. Emphasis is put on the public nature of parenting in the <b>youth</b> <b>sport</b> context and its relationship to social constructions of being a “good parent”. In terms of broader implications, the study emphasizes the close connection between organized <b>youth</b> <b>sport,</b> and changing cultural ideals and practices associated with gender and parenting...|$|R
