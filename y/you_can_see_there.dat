But <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>there</b> is a pretty disposition of, and relation between, the projections of a fir-cone, though the studded spiral imitates nothing. Order exactly the same in kind, only much more complex; and an abstract beauty of surface rendered definite by increase and decline of light--(for every curve of surface has its own luminous law, and the light and shade on a parabolic solid differs, specifically, from that on an elliptical or spherical one)--it is the essential business of the sculptor to obtain; {{as it is the}} essential business of a painter to get good color, whether he imitates anything or not. At a distance from the picture, or carving, where the things represented become absolutely unintelligible, we must yet be able to say, at a glance, [...] "That is good painting, or good carving." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{a welcome}} and joyful sound! In the winter, when {{the days are}} short, and the sun, {{near the end of}} the six school hours, sinks so low that the light in the room grows dim and gray, with what impatience, my dear child, do you wait for this signal! But it is in the long summer days that you find school most tiresome. The air in the room is hot and drowsy, and outside <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>there</b> is a breeze blowing, for the trees are gently tossing their green boughs as if to twit you with having to work out sums in such glorious weather. And there come to your ears the {{pleasant}} sounds of the buzzing of insects and twittering of birds, and the brook splashing over the stones. Then the four walls of the school-room look very dreary, and the maps glare at you, and the black-boards frown darkly, and the benches seem very hard, and the ink-bespattered desks appear more grimy than ever.|$|E
60|$|But if the Mud Walls gave me {{at first}} but a faint Idea of the Place; I was pleasingly disappointed, as soon as I enter'd the Gates. The Town then show'd itself well built, and of Brick, and the Streets wide, long, and spacious. Those of Atocha, and Alcala, are as fine as any I ever saw; yet is it {{situated}} but very indifferently: For tho' they have {{what they call a}} River, to which they give the very fair Name of la Mansuera, and over which they have built a curious, long, and large Stone Bridge; yet is the Course of it, in Summer time especially, mostly dry. This gave occasion to that piece of Railery of a Foreign Embassador, That the King would have don wisely to have bought a River, before he built the Bridge. Nevertheless, that little Stream of a River which they boast of, they improve as much as possible; since down the Sides, as far as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>there</b> are Coops, or little Places hooped in, for People to wash their Linen (for they very rarely wash in their own Houses) nor is it really an unpleasing Sight, to view the regular Rows of them at that cleanly Operation.|$|E

60|$|There are no fish in Mono Lake--no frogs, no snakes, no polliwigs --nothing, in fact, {{that goes}} to make life desirable. Millions of wild ducks and sea-gulls swim about the surface, but no living thing exists under the surface, except a white {{feathery}} sort of worm, one half an inch long, {{which looks like a}} bit of white thread frayed out at the sides. If you dip up a gallon of water, you will get about fifteen thousand of these. They give to the water a sort of grayish-white appearance. Then there is a fly, which looks something like our house fly. These settle on the beach to eat the worms that wash ashore--and any time, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>there</b> a belt of flies an inch deep and six feet wide, and this belt extends clear around the lake--a belt of flies one hundred miles long. If you throw a stone among them, they swarm up so thick that they look dense, like a cloud. You can hold them under water as long as you please--they do not mind it--they are only proud of it. When you let them go, they pop up to the surface as dry as a patent office report, and walk off as unconcernedly {{as if they had been}} educated especially with a view to affording instructive entertainment to man in that particular way. Providence leaves nothing to go by chance. All things have their uses and their part and proper place in Nature's economy: the ducks eat the flies--the flies eat the worms--the Indians eat all three--the wild cats eat the Indians--the white folks eat the wild cats--and thus all things are lovely.|$|E

5000|$|There was {{a design}} I {{had done for}} Terminator 2. It was a machine/weapon/robot with 4 legs, like a crab, {{and it had a}} very {{distinct}} head shape. That design had not survived budget cuts, so it was never in the film (which had come out a few years before). Ron and I both liked that shape, and as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>there</b> is a distinct resemblance there to the final Starfury design. It was a case of “Can we take the essence of that shape - which has a cool and aggressive look - and merge it with a vectored thrust multi-engine configuration?” As it turned out, the answer was “Yes!” We tried a trilateral symmetry, but there’s a reason quadrilateral symmetry is preferable.

5000|$|... "Comets of Kandahar", {{one of four}} {{instrumental}}s on the album, {{also had}} its origins in Afghanistan: [...] "An instrumental piece isn’t really about anything, {{but you have to}} come up with names for these things. So the title came from something one of the Canadian soldiers said to me while we were standing there watching—what I learned was kind of a nightly pleasure for a lot of people on the base—the jet fighters taking off constantly, twenty-four hours a day, for missions or patrols. They go off in pairs, thirty seconds apart, and after dark you can’t see them; you just hear a roar. But a moment later you’ll see the flame, from the tail cone, coming out of the fighter. And that’s all <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see.</b> <b>There’s</b> this glowing purplish cone flying across the sky. Everyone stops to look at this because it’s a beautiful sight. So there we are standing, a bunch of us, and we’re all looking at it, and the soldier standing next to me said, 'The comets of Kandahar.' So that became the title of the piece." ...|$|R
