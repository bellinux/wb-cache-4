5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with <b>you</b> <b>what</b> song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

25|$|Bass once {{described}} his main goal for his title sequences as being to ‘’try {{to reach for}} a simple, visual phrase that tells <b>you</b> <b>what</b> the picture is all about and evokes {{the essence of the}} story”. Another philosophy that Bass described as influencing his title sequences was the goal of getting the audience to see familiar parts of their world in an unfamiliar way. Examples of this or what he described as “making the ordinary extraordinary” can be seen in Walk on the Wild Side (1962) where an ordinary cat becomes a mysterious prowling predator, and in Nine Hours to Rama (1963) where the interior workings of a clock become an expansive new landscape. In the 1950s, Saul Bass used a variety of techniques, from cut-out animation for Anatomy of a Murder (1958), to fully animated mini-movies such as the epilogue for Around the World in 80 Days (1956), and live-action sequences.|$|E

25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks <b>you</b> <b>what</b> city you're traveling to, but you feel that you would recognize the name if you saw it on a map of the country.|$|E
25|$|Attestations of Old Dutch {{sentences}} {{are extremely}} rare. The language is mostly recorded on fragmentary relics, and words have been reconstructed from Middle Dutch and loan words from Old Dutch in other languages. The oldest recorded {{is found in}} the Salic law. In this Frankish document written around 510 the oldest Dutch sentence has been identified: Maltho thi afrio lito ("I say to you, I free you, serf") used to free a serf. Another old fragment of Dutch is Visc flot aftar themo uuatare ("A fish was swimming in the water"). The oldest conserved larger Dutch text is the Utrecht baptismal vow (776–800) starting with Forsachistu diobolae... ec forsacho diabolae ("Do you forsake the devil?... I forsake the devil"). If only for its poetic content, the most famous Old Dutch sentence is probably Hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan, hinase hic enda tu, wat unbidan we nu ("All birds have started making nests, except me and <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> are we waiting for"), is dated to around the year 1100, written by a Flemish monk in a convent in Rochester, England. Since the sentence speaks to the imagination, it is often erroneously stated as the oldest Dutch sentence.|$|E

500|$|... "What You Want" [...] {{opens with}} rapid drums and soon moves into a guitar-driven mode, {{accompanied}} by synthesizers. Throughout the song, Lee uses [...] "pseudo operatic" [...] and [...] "poppy" [...] vocals. In the opening lines, she sings: [...] "Do what <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> you want / If {{you have a}} dream for better / Do what <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> you want / 'Til you don't want it anymore." [...] Those sounds are followed by a hard rock surging guitar and strings which were noted {{to be part of}} the band's characteristic sound. The chorus is instrumentally complete with crashing cymbals, [...] "thrashing, high-wired rawk" [...] guitars, electric guitars, keyboards and piano as Lee sings, [...] "Hello, hello, remember me? I’m everything you can’t control / Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe we can break through." [...] At the end of the song, Lee shouts the hook [...] "Do what <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> you want," [...] as her vocals are echoed and eventually fade away. Laurie Tuffrey of NME summarized the song as a [...] "standard goth-pop fare, full of rapid drum breaks, swathes of fuzzy riffing and a catchy, chant-friendly chorus."

500|$|The refrain {{is based}} on a Gm–E(add2)–B–F/A chord progression. Fraser McAlphine of the BBC wrote that Rihanna feels {{confined}} [...] "in a cell of [...] own creation". She sings without vibrato, a pulsating musical effect used to add expression. One commentator, The New York Times David Brownie, wrote that despite this, her voice subtly shows grief and regret. Eminem then [...] "zap out into a ballady rap": [...] "I can't tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> it really is/ I can only tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> it feels like." [...] The verses follow a Gm–E(add2)B–Fsus/A chord progression. Eminem regrets an end to an abusive, failed relationship, describing mutual violence and expressing both fondness and anger. The two artists' characters are portrayed in a romantic relationship when he responds to Rihanna by concluding the verse: [...] "I laid hands on her. I'll never stoop so low again/ I guess I don't know my own strength." [...] Rihanna sings the chorus again, backed by an electric guitar and a piano.|$|E

500|$|The game {{is noted}} for its simple combat system that would [...] "disappoint those craving sheer {{mechanical}} depth", as stated by GameSpots Miguel Lopez. [...] The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that [...] "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to do, even though the game is always telling <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to do". [...] Ico is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls [...] "painfully short" [...] with [...] "no replay outside of self-imposed challenges". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that [...] "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' {{in one or two}} sittings". [...] The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that [...] "Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not {{for the fact that the}} player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending." ...|$|E
