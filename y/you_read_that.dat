2500|$|According to {{historian}} Thomas Madden: The Inquisition was {{not born}} out of desire to crush diversity or oppress people; it was rather an attempt to stop unjust executions. Yes, <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> correctly. Heresy was a crime against the state. Roman law in the Code of Justinian made heresy a capital offense... In the early Middle Ages, people accused of heresy were judged by the local lord, many of whom lacked theological training. Madden claims that [...] "The simple {{fact is that the}} medieval Inquisition saved uncounted thousands of innocent (and even not-so-innocent) people who would otherwise have been roasted by secular lords or mob rule" [...]|$|E
2500|$|Thomas F. Madden {{describes}} {{the world that}} formed medieval politics: [...] "The Inquisition was not born out of desire to crush diversity or oppress people; it was rather an attempt to stop unjust executions. Yes, <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> correctly. Heresy was a crime against the state. Roman law in the Code of Justinian made it a capital offense. Rulers, whose authority was believed to come from God, had no patience for heretics". The monarchs decided to introduce the Inquisition to Castile to discover and punish crypto-Jews, and requested the pope's assent. Ferdinand II of Aragon pressured Pope Sixtus IV to agree to an Inquisition controlled by the monarchy by threatening to withdraw military support {{at a time when}} the Turks were a threat to Rome. The pope issued a bull to stop the Inquisition but was pressured into withdrawing it. [...] On 1 November 1478, Pope Sixtus IV published the Papal bull, Exigit Sinceras Devotionis Affectus, through which he gave the monarchs exclusive authority to name the inquisitors in their kingdoms. The first two inquisitors, Miguel de Morillo and Juan de San Martín, were not named, however, until two years later, on 27 September 1480 in Medina del Campo.|$|E
