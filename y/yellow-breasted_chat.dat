40|$|In western North America, most {{riparian}} habitats {{have been}} destroyed or degraded {{as a result of}} human settlement and urban development. I examined temporal trends in the abundance, richness and breeding performance of riparian birds in response to restoration of remnant riparian habitat within the south Okanagan Valley, an arid region of Canada. Total abundance and richness increased over the last decade. Restoration increased the abundance of <b>Yellow-breasted</b> <b>Chats</b> (Icteria virens auricollis), the target of management activities, but did not have a detectable effect on the abundance of other songbirds. The habitat characteristics and breeding performance of <b>Yellow-breasted</b> <b>Chats</b> in restored habitat are currently similar to those of <b>Yellow-breasted</b> <b>Chats</b> in reference sites.

40|$|Neotropical {{migratory birds}} and {{riparian}} forests have decreased in abundance {{over the past}} century. Decreases in bird populations {{have been linked to}} forest fragmentation. I performed bird surveys and monitored nesting success of Bell's Vireos (Vireo bellii) and <b>Yellow-breasted</b> <b>Chats</b> (Icteria virens) in a range of cottonwood/willow patch sizes and densities in the lower Colorado River valley to determine whether bird abundances, species richness, and reproductive success were related to cottonwood/willow patch size and/or tree density. Results suggest that neotropical migrants responded to patch size and tree density more than did resident birds. Results of breeding analyses suggest that small patches may be ecological sinks. Analyses excluding large patches indicated a threshold between 13 and 160 ha at which bird abundances stopped increasing with increasing patch size. This study demonstrated that neotropical migratory birds use small patches; however, large, dense patches are required for persistence of breeding populations...|$|R
40|$|Hosts {{frequently}} harbour multiple parasite infections, yet {{patterns of}} parasite co-occurrence are poorly documented in nature. In this study, we asked whether two common avian blood parasites, one haemosporidian and one trypanosome, affect each other's occurrence in individuals {{of a single}} host species. We used molecular genotyping to survey protozoan parasites in the peripheral blood of <b>yellow-breasted</b> <b>chats</b> (Aves: Passeriformes [Parulidae]: Icteria virens) from the Ozarks of Southern Missouri. We also determined whether single and co-infections differently influence white blood cell and polychromatic erythrocyte counts, the latter being a measure of regenerative anaemia. We found a positive association between the haemosporidian and trypanosome parasites, such that infection by one increases the probability that an individual host is infected by the other. Adult individuals {{were more likely than}} juveniles to exhibit haemosporidian infection, but co-infections and single trypanosome infections were not age-related. We found evidence of pathogenicity of trypanosomes in that infected individuals exhibited similar levels of regenerative anaemia as birds infected with haemosporidian parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Counts of white blood cells did not differ with respect to infection status...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, little {{information}} was available on patterns of brood parasitism by Brownheaded Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) {{in the southeastern}} United States, a region into which cowbirds expanded their range only during {{the last half of}} the Twentieth Century and where their abundance is relatively low. We compiled parasitism data from several published and unpublished studies conducted in Georgia and South Carolina from 1993 - 2000 to examine levels of brood parasitism and determine frequent host species. The combined dataset included 1, 372 nests of 24 species reported in the literature to have been parasitized by cowbirds. The parasitism rate on all species combined was 8. 2 %. Considering only those species that served as hosts in these studies (n = I 2), the parasitism rate was 9. 3 %. Seven species were parasitized at rates 2 10 %. Based on the extent of parasitism (among studies and locations), their relative abundance, and the sample size of nests, Prairie Warblers (Dendroicta discolor), Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina), <b>Yellow-breasted</b> <b>Chats</b> (Icteria virens), and Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), all shrub nesters, appear to be the most important cowbird hosts in the region. Parasitism on some species reported as frequent hosts elsewhere was extremely low or not documented. We conclude that the impact of brood parasitism on the seasonal fecundity of hosts in the region probably is minimal, but additional work is warranted on species of concern, such as the Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris) ...|$|R
40|$|I visit {{a lot of}} {{properties}} across the South each year. Without exception, there is one rec-ommendation I have given everyone—get rid of the tall fescue and/or bermudagrass. I have never made an initial property visit in the South (or Midwest or Northeast, for that matter) where I didn’t find one of these grasses. Few landowners realize that just by eradi-cating these grasses, they can enhance habitat for white-tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, wild turkeys, bobwhite quail, mourning doves, field sparrows, indigo buntings, dickcissels, blue grosbeaks, <b>yellow-breasted</b> <b>chats,</b> American goldfinch, loggerhead shrikes, and many other species. And tall fescue and bermudagrass aren’t the only culprits. In my opinion (and in that of {{a whole lot of}} other biologists), you can add orchardgrass, timothy, bluegrass, john-songrass, crabgrass, goosegrass, bahiagrass, vaseygrass, velvetgrass, japangrass, and, cer-tainly, cogongrass. Why? None of these grass-es provide quality cover, forage, or seed for wildlife, none are native to North America, some are extremely invasive, and they all dis-place more desirable plants. Yes, I know deer may eat some of them at various times of the year, turkeys may eat bahiagrass seed, and quail and several other birds may eat crabgrass or johnsongrass seed. But why have a plant(s) that provides marginal cover, forage, or seed take up space where more desirable plants could grow?!? Make no mistake, you can increase the carrying capacity of your property for many wildlife species just by eradicating these grasses. Now, before you think I’m a native plant purist, let me explain. I do encourage people to promote native plants when possible and prac-tical, but I think foremost about landowner objectives and what would benefit wildlife. Thus, I’m also a proponent of food plots, for example, if they fit in with the landowner’s objectives. Of all the food plot plantings I might recommend, only a couple are native to North America. Therefore, I don’t have a problem with someone using a non-native plant to meet a specific objective, as long as that plant is no...|$|R
40|$|<b>Yellow-breasted</b> <b>Chats</b> (Icteria virens) are a Neotropical {{migratory bird}} species that breeds in shrubland habitat in Illinois. Chats are a diurnally active species but males {{are known to}} sing often at night. This {{behavior}} suggests that chats may engage in other behaviors related to breeding at night. I investigated whether chats engage in significant movements at night, and if so, why. I used an automated radio telemetry system to quantify the nocturnal movements {{of male and female}} chats. I found that males and females moved at night, and that they moved significantly more often when the female of a given pair was fertile. Both males and females moved most often on nights when the moon was least illuminated, but there was no indication that birds engaged in more movements at a certain time of night or during a specific stage of the breeding season. These data, combined with data from other studies of extra-pair copulations and extra-territorial movements of chats, suggest that birds might engage in these movements to assess potential mates and/or copulate with an extra-pair mate. Foraying nocturnally on dark nights by females may allow them to stay undetected by their mates. Night song may also serve as a cue of habitat quality to migrants during both the spring migration and during the breeding season. Like most other passerines, chats migrate at night and likely select a place to land, either their final destination or a stopover site, while it is still dark or shortly after sunrise. I attempted to attract migrating chats to a predetermined site that lacked appropriate habitat by playing chat song at night. If nocturnal song was used by chats when selecting breeding or stopover sites, then I expected to capture chats on nights when I played chat songs. Significantly more individuals (eight males, seven females) were captured on mornings following treatments (playbacks conducted) relative to control nights when no songs were broadcast (2. 5 vs. 0. 0 birds/morning, respectively). This research has documented that nocturnal behaviors are common in chats and that these behaviors may be important in the selection of mates and habitats. Little {{attention has been paid to}} what diurnally active birds do at night; however, this study highlights the potential importance of nighttime activity...|$|R

40|$|I {{evaluated}} the {{spatial and temporal}} patterns of the avian communities in the Colorado River delta, Mexico, and their relationship with vegetation type and surface water. I also developed plausible conservation and restoration guidelines for riparian areas and native birds in the region. The study included monthly point counts at 30 transects (240 points) from May 2002 to July 2003, breeding counts at 175 sites (3 times per year) during 2002 and 2003, and habitat measurements at the survey points. The most common species were Mourning Doves, Red-winged Blackbirds, and Brown-headed Cowbirds, but another 64 species were commonly found, including Verdins, Song Sparrows, <b>Yellow-breasted</b> <b>Chats</b> and Abert's Towhees. Surface water {{was the most important}} habitat feature related to avian richness and density regardless of vegetation type or land cover (P < 0. 005). During summer, species richness was explained by variations in water and the cover of cottonwoods (r 2 = 0. 56, P < 0. 001), and the variation in bird densities was explained by variations in water and the cover of willows (r 2 = 0. 35, P = 0. 003). When comparing native versus saltcedar dominated sites, both with the presence (wet) or absence (dry) of surface water, the diversity of birds was more influenced by the presence of water than by vegetation type. Bird abundance was more influenced by vegetation type, but water also had an important effect, as wet sites had higher bird abundance than dry sites with the same vegetation type, and saltcedar wet areas had similar avian abundance to native dry sites. On all cases, the presence of water was an important factor determining the ecological value, in terms of avian richness, abundance, and diversity, of both native riparian and saltcedar areas. Saltcedar areas with surface water had avian characteristics similar to native riparian sites. The dedication of instream flows and pulse floods, the maintenance of vegetation cover and structural diversity, and an increase of older riparian stands will secure the viability of existing bird populations and will increase the probability of recovery of the species that are still extirpated from the floodplain of the Colorado River in Mexico...|$|R

50|$|The <b>yellow-breasted</b> <b>chat</b> is a shy, skulking {{species of}} bird, often being only heard but not seen. The {{breeding}} habitats {{of this species}} are dense, brushy areas and hedgerows. The nests of these birds are bulky cups made of grasses, leaves, strips of bark, stems of weeds and lined with finer grasses, wiry plant stems, pine needles and sometimes roots and hair. Nests are invariably placed in thick shrubs and often only about 2.5 m above the ground. They will lay from 3 to 5 creamy white eggs with reddish brown blotches or speckles, incubated by the female, hatch in 11 to 12 days. Both parents tend the young, who fledge in approximately 8 to 11 days. Chats are apparently vigilant guards of their nests, as parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds is not as frequent as with other cup nest builders. However, {{they are not as}} monogamous as other warblers.
