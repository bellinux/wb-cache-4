25|$|Particle {{kinematics}} is {{the study}} of the trajectory of a particle. The position of a particle is defined as the coordinate vector from the origin of a coordinate frame to the particle. For example, consider a tower 50 m south from <b>your</b> <b>home,</b> where the coordinate frame is located at <b>your</b> <b>home,</b> such that East is the x-direction and North is the y-direction, then the coordinate vector {{to the base of the}} tower is r = (0, −50, 0). If the tower is 50m high, then the coordinate vector to the top of the tower is r = (0, −50, 50).|$|E

25|$|Toon Boom Animation's Toon Boom Harmony {{software}} {{was used as}} the main software package for the production of the film, as the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) system that Disney developed with Pixar in the 1980s for use on their previous traditionally animated films had become outdated. The Harmony {{software was}} augmented with a number of plug-ins to provide CAPS-like effects such as shading on cheeks and smoke effects. The reinstated traditional unit's first production, a 2007 Goofy cartoon short entitled How to Hook Up <b>Your</b> <b>Home</b> Theater, was partly animated without paper by using Harmony and Wacom Cintiq pressure-sensitive tablets. The character animators found some difficulty with this approach, and decided to use traditional paper and pencil drawings, which were then scanned into the computer systems, for The Princess and the Frog.|$|E
25|$|The {{player can}} lose {{a game in}} several ways; by losing all his lives or through an action that makes a mission {{impossible}} to complete. These include destroying a mission critical object, killing someone who was to be captured or rescued, killing too many friendlies, allowing an objective to leave the battlefield, failing to protect a friendly target from being captured or destroyed, destroying <b>your</b> <b>home</b> base or landing zones, or waiting too long to complete a mission objective. After such an occurrence, the player must return to his home base and the level restarts from the beginning. In Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, if a player fails to return they are warned to return to base and after three warnings, STRIKE shuts down the players vehicle and the level will be restarted.|$|E
25|$|New {{digital signal}} {{processing}} functionalities such as Room Correction, Bass Management, Loudness Equalization and Speaker Fill have been introduced. Speaker Fill mixes 2-channel content to use all available speakers {{in a manner similar}} to Creative's CMSS. Bass Management can be used to redirect the subwoofer signal to the main speakers. If a channel is missing, a feature called Channel Phantoming allows the best use of the speakers that are there, by redirecting the sound of the missing channels through these speakers. Whether you have a multi-channel or stereo sound system in <b>your</b> <b>home</b> theater or living room, Windows Vista also includes the ability to calibrate your speakers for your room. By placing a microphone where you plan to sit and then running a wizard that measures the room response, Windows Vista can automatically set the levels, delay and frequency balance for each channel accordingly for this position. For PCs equipped with stereo headphones, Vista adds the ability to have surround sound using a new feature called Headphone Virtualization, which uses technology based upon a Head-related transfer function.|$|E

They {{make you feel like}} the most horrible person in the world and that your house is the temple of doom." [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] features a scene based specifically on this instance in which a saleswoman (voiced by cast member Tress MacNeille) selling childproofing items visits Homer and Marge and exaggerates the dangers in their home.

She became active with the Canadian National Council for Combating Venereal Diseases (CNCCVD), which worked against the sexual double-standard which Pankhurst considered particularly harmful to women. During a tour of Bathurst, the mayor showed her a new building which would become the Home for Fallen Women. Pankhurst replied: [...] "Ah! Where is <b>your</b> <b>Home</b> for Fallen Men?" [...] Before long, however, she grew tired of long Canadian winters, and she ran out of money. She returned to England in late 1925.|$|E

500|$|Billings met Louis Saekow {{through a}} string of friends but was {{hesitant}} to hire him. Inspired by Avalon Hill's games, Billings wanted SSI's games to look professional and include maps, detailed manuals, and excellent box art. Two months prior, Saekow had postponed medical school to pursue his {{dream of becoming a}} graphic designer. To secure the job, Saekow told Billings that he could withhold pay if the work was unsatisfactory. In creating the box art, Saekow used a stat camera; his roommate worked for a magazine company and helped him sneak in to use its camera after hours. Saekow's cousin then handled printing the packaging. Without any storage for the complete products, Billings stored the first [...] in his bedroom. In February 1980, he distributed [...] to [...] owners, and displayed the game at the Applefest exposition a month later. SSI purchased a full-page advertisement in the March 1980 BYTE which stated [...] "Now there's a true historical wargame for <b>your</b> <b>home</b> computer ... There's never been anything like it". It mentioned the ability to play against the computer or another person, and save a game in progress.

Other defendants sued in the case include Reddit, The Atlanta-Journal Constitution, Digg, Geeknet (owner of Slashdot), TechCrunch, Newsvine, and Yahoo. Drew Curtis argued that Fark does not produce [...] "news releases" [...] or [...] "press releases", as the lawsuit stated, and instead provides a forum for humorous links to stories on other websites. The case was settled in August 2011, for the sum of $0. Curtis later described the entire ordeal as, [...] "a nightmare", saying, [...] "Imagine someone breaking into <b>your</b> <b>home,</b> then being forced {{to sit on the}} couch while their lawyers file motions over how much stuff they can take." [...] At the 2012 TED Conference in Long Beach, California, he referred to patent trolls as [...] "terrorists", comparing them to the Abu Sayyaf terror group in the Philippines, which kidnapped people for ransom, collected small sums of money, expanded with more personnel and equipment, and then kidnapped more people for higher ransoms.|$|E
500|$|The title OK Computer {{is taken}} from the 1978 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio series, in which the {{character}} Zaphod Beeblebrox speaks the phrase [...] "Okay, computer, I want full manual control now." [...] The members of Radiohead listened to the series on the bus during their 1996 tour and Yorke made a note of the phrase. [...] "OK Computer" [...] was a working title for the song [...] "Palo Alto", which had been considered for inclusion on the album. The title stuck with the band; according to Jonny Greenwood, [...] " [...] started attaching itself and creating all these weird resonances with {{what we were trying}} to do." [...] Yorke said it [...] "refers to embracing the future, it refers to being terrified of the future, of our future, of everyone else's. It's to do with standing in a room where all these appliances are going off and all these machines and computers and so on... and the sound it makes." [...] Yorke described the title as [...] "a really resigned, terrified phrase", to him similar to the Coca-Cola advertisement [...] "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing". Wired writer Leander Kahney suggests that it is an homage to Macintosh computers, as the Mac's speech recognition software responds to the command [...] "OK computer" [...] as an alternative to clicking the [...] "OK" [...] button.

And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Cristina and Burke's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them." [...] Lulevtich praised Meredith's story arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, [...] "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode." [...] Writing for IGN, Laura Burrows was favorable of the episode. Regarding the storylines developed in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come", Burrows elaborated, [...] "The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to re-sit his internship. This created new drama and also opened up the hospital to {{a whole new set of}} interns rife with their own set of emotional baggage and drama. There were a series of interesting and new plots." ...|$|E
