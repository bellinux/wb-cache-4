50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} {{on how to}} express this objection. William F. Vallicella holds that organized complexity as such does not need explanation, because when {{in search of an}} ultimate explanation, one must in the end accept an entity whose complexity has no external explanation. Dawkins has stated that we should search for simple beginnings for explanations, like in evolution which moves from simple to complex, and so what we ultimately accept with no external explanation must be simple for it to be a good explanation. And Plantinga writes that when not in search for an ultimate explanation of organized complexity, it is perfectly fine to explain one kind of complexity, that of terrestrial life, in terms of another kind of complexity, namely divine activity. Dawkins addresses this point in his debate with John Lennox over The God Delusion, saying that it would be perfectly reasonable to infer from artifacts on earth or another planet that an intelligence existed, but that <b>you</b> would <b>still</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> explain that intelligence, which evolution does, while for God's existence there is no such explanation.|$|R

The goals of the course are: for the student a) to be familiar adequately {{with all of the}} texts and stories of Genesis. This means that you will know the literal presentation of the entire book by your reading and rereading of the texts themselves in translation. b) to appreciate the literary structure of several narratives for the purpose of their help in theological interpretation c) to be able to evaluate the various perspectives of myth, covenant and history in light of the texts and the history of interpretation. d) to be thoroughly familiar with a chosen text in Genesis {{from the point of view}} of literary analysis, history of interpretation and theological import. This will arise from your focus on a chosen text or topic for a major term paper. A textbook for the course is not required, but I have ordered a number of copies of the NIBC Commentary on Genesis by John E. Hartley at the Crux Book Store at Wycliffe College.

Over the years, we have identified a structure of three consecutive workshops; a Design Narratives Workshop, a Pattern Mining Workshop and a Design scenarios Workshop.

40|$|Measuring {{is a key}} to {{scientific}} progress. This is particularly true for research concerning complex systems, whether natural or humanbuilt. Multilingual and multimedia information access systems, such as search engines, are increasingly complex: they need to satisfy diverse user needs and support challenging tasks. Their development calls for proper evaluation methodologies to ensure that they meet the expected user requirements and provide the desired effectiveness. In this context, failure analysis is crucial to understand the behaviour of complex systems. Unfortunately, this is an especially challenging activity, requiring vast amounts of human effort to inspect query-by-query the output of a system in order to understand what went well or bad. It is therefore fundamental to provide automated tools to examine system behaviour, both visually and analytically. Moreover, once you understand the reason behind a failure, <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> conduct a "what-if" analysis to understand what among the different possible solutions is most promising and effective before actually starting to modify your system. This paper provides an analytical model for examining performances of IR systems, based on the discounted cumulative gain family of metrics, and visualization for interacting and exploring the performances of the system under examination. Moreover, we propose machine learning approach to learn the ranking model of the examined system {{in order to be able}} to conduct a "what-if" analysis and visually explore what can happen if you adopt a given solution before having to actually implement it.

A repeated measure analysis of variance contrasting the production of the first half with that of the second half of the training (end of training—first half of the training) shows very large and significant increases in all the indicators of use (respectively F(1.183)=[*] 134.275 for number of recipes, F(1.183)=[*] 261.344 for number of pictures, F(1.183)=[*] 251.15 for number of recipes with ideal-pictures and F(1.183)=[*] 307.993 for numbers of recipes with at least one prompt answered in the learning journal).

At the same time, it confirms our hypothesis that towards this activity, learners actually present a high tendency to procrastinate. Nevertheless, important differences exist between learners in the proportions of recipes, pictures, recipes with ideal-pictures, and learning journal entries they had already produced in the first half of their training. While some learners did not generate any recipes during the first half of their training, others had already completed all their recipes during that time. Similarly, some learners had no pictures in their database at midterm while others had already entered ¾ of them halfway in their training. In the next section, we will explore whether these differences in the pacing of their usage of LearnDoc relate with overall grade differences at the final exams.|$|E

40|$|We {{live in a}} {{world where}} {{consuming}} has a whole other meaning than it used to in a more traditional society. The postmodern society, as we know it, is setting up standards, containing unofficial instructions on life about how it should be and on how to live a proper life. For example the fact that iPads now can be seen as a standard in kindergartens, or the fact that parents are spending thousands of money on communion parties. One might argue that it is difficult for some consumers to catch up on this consuming race. If you do not have enough economically capital, for example, if you are a lone supplier, or on public benefits you will have limited opportunities to consume. Its not only about being poor, it is about having trouble consuming the way the society´s standards are build up. Even though you have enough money for basic needs like food, medicine, ect. <b>you</b> <b>still</b> have a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> consume like everyone else in this society. In addition, smart TVs, iPhones, and so on are things that can be seen as so called consumerist standards.

Social exclusion can have a lot of consequences that can lead to even worse consequences.

The figure below shows the overall landscape of the pattern language. It starts with the most fundamental pattern, the User Interface Layer. Two patterns describe the architecture of this layer: Separate Transformation explains how to deal with complex interactions while Widget Model helps to structure presentation. Though both patterns seem to describe different philosophies, they are often combined to form the basic architecture of the User Interface Layer. <b>Still</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> deal with more issues. At first you have to provide Context Support between different interactions of the user. Depending on the requirements and architecture of your system you can apply several patterns for this. For the sake of brevity this document contains only thumbnails of them. Another area of interest concerns Domain Layer Access, which again lays the foundation of several other patterns. While some of them are well-known design patterns, others are special to user interfaces. This set of patterns forms the coarse landscape of most architectures around. Some Terms Explained I have used several terms in this paper not everyone may share. I give a rough definition here and some further hints where to find detailed information about it.
