5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not <b>your</b> <b>back</b> wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E

25|$|To say the least, a {{fight at}} close range is {{absorbing}} as a spectacle. No man wants to take his eyes from it until that time comes when he makes up his mind to run away. To deliberately stand up and turn <b>your</b> <b>back</b> to a battle is in itself hard work. To deliberately stand up and turn <b>your</b> <b>back</b> to a battle and hear immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.|$|E

500|$|Many {{fans were}} unhappy with Doggett's condescension towards Scully during her apology. Robert Patrick, {{the actor who}} portrayed Doggett, however, had a {{different}} interpretation: [...] "The whole essence of the scene was, 'Look, I'm here for you. I've got <b>your</b> <b>back.</b> We're partners now.' And you give that {{the weight of a}} marine saying to someone, 'I'll jump on a grenade for you, so you can trust me.' The idea was to really assure the fans that the show was continuing on." ...|$|E

500|$|Those within TNA held strong {{negative}} feelings toward Hall for missing the event; many felt {{he should have}} at least tried {{to make it to the}} show. Dixie Carter was upset at Joe's comments prior to the main event, believing Joe tried to go [...] "into business for himself." [...] Chris Sokol's wrote in his review: [...] "The old saying was, 'Don't turn <b>your</b> <b>back</b> on the Wolfpack.'

500|$|I often {{experience}} combat as {{it should}} be. I see myself {{in the middle of}} a British [...] swarm, firing from every position and never getting caught. Our aircraft are basic elements, Stahlschmidt, which have got to be mastered. You've got to be able to shoot from any position. From left or right turns, out of a roll, on <b>your</b> <b>back,</b> whenever. Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics. Attack tactics, that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle – a series of unpredictable movements and actions, never the same, always stemming from the situation at hand. Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside.|$|E
500|$|The celebration proved popular, {{and when}} the Queen {{came of age in}} 1898, her inauguration was {{postponed}} a week to 6 September so as not to interfere with Koninginnedag. [...] The annual holiday fell {{on the final day of}} school summer vacation, which made it popular among schoolchildren. It is uncertain how much Wilhelmina enjoyed the festivities; although writer Mike Peek, in a 2011 magazine article about Koninginnedag, suggests she was enthusiastic, there is a story of Wilhelmina, after a tired return from one of these birthday processions, making her doll bow until the toy's hair was dishevelled, and telling it, [...] "Now you shall sit in a carriage and bow until <b>your</b> <b>back</b> aches, and see how much you like being a Queen!" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Blaze a 50" [...] {{features}} a violin-based instrumental and a complex narrative that follows {{a tale of}} murder, sex, and betrayal. Nas narrates the tale in conventional fashion until the ending, at which the track rewinds to an earlier point and he revises his original ending. [...] "Everybody's Crazy" [...] features complex rhymes and braggadocio rap by Nas: [...] "Gangsta see, gangsta do / A Langston Hughes predecessor / Gun in my dresser, slang I use." [...] In [...] "Purple"s narrative, Nas lights up a blunt and expresses his thoughts, including criticism of hoodlums and their effect on their neighborhoods: [...] "The 'hood love you, but behind <b>your</b> <b>back</b> they pray for the day / A bullet hit your heart and ambulance take you away / That ain't love it's hate / Think of all the mothers at wakes / Whose sons you've killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?"

500|$|Brosnan has {{expressed}} contempt for his education by the Christian Brothers. However, in 2013 he commented, [...] "It always {{helps to have}} a bit of prayer in <b>your</b> <b>back</b> pocket. At the end of the day, you have to have something and for me that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, my faith... God has been good to me. My faith has been good to me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... I might not have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." [...] Brosnan attends Mass, but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said [...] "I also love the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. It's my own private faith. I don't preach it, but it's a faith that is a comfort to me when the night is long." ...|$|E
500|$|Finally, a Bedouin story {{states that}} Allah created the Arabian horse {{from the south}} wind and exclaimed, [...] "I create thee, Oh Arabian. To thy forelock, I bind Victory in battle. On thy back, I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins. I {{establish}} thee {{as one of the}} Glories of the Earth... I give thee flight without wings." [...] Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind: [...] "I want to make a creature out of you. Condense." [...] Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a kamayt-colored animal (a bay or burnt chestnut) and said: [...] "I call you Horse; I make you Arabian and I give you the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals. Men shall follow you wherever you go; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit; you shall fly without wings; riches shall be on <b>your</b> <b>back</b> and fortune shall come through your meditation." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Wall Street Part of Town" [...] {{incorporates}} mandolin, Americana guitar riffs, {{and offers}} encouragement to protesters. Literary journalist Alec Wilkinson {{writes that the}} song's narrator is [...] "looking for refuge {{in the part of}} town where the wind always blows at <b>your</b> <b>back</b> and the ground tilts in your favor." [...] "Guantanamo" [...] features cascading guitar by Cooder and handclaps. The song is about the nadir of human depravity. A slow, 12-bar blues lament, [...] "Cold Cold Feeling" [...] features juke joint, bottleneck guitar, and lyrics placing Barack Obama as the narrator singing his blues in the White House. Cooder meant to draw sympathy from listeners for Barack Obama. Geoff Cowart of musicOMH draws similarities of the song to [...] "the voodoo blues of Screaming Jay Hawkins". [...] "Going to Tampa" [...] is a string band country song in Alla breve meter. Using scathing humor and burlesque lyrical elements, the song's farcical lyrics depict a fictional hijacking of the 2012 Republican National Convention by the Tea Party, as Cooder accuses both parties of racism and social engineering.|$|E
500|$|Alf made no real {{attempt to}} contact John {{again until the}} height of Beatlemania (claiming {{he did not know}} who the Beatles were). He was working as a kitchen porter at the Greyhound Hotel at Hampton Court, in Middlesex, when someone pointed out a {{photograph}} of John Lennon in a newspaper and asked whether he was related to him. Alfred and Charlie visited one of the Beatles' Christmas shows at the Finsbury Park Empire in London. When the Beatles were filming a scene for A Hard Day's Night in the Scala Theatre in Soho in April 1964, Alf walked into Brian Epstein's NEMS office in Argyle Street with a journalist. [...] "I'm John Lennon's father", he explained to the receptionist. When Epstein was informed, he [...] "went into a panic", and immediately sent a car to bring John to NEMS office. Alf was shabbily dressed, with his unkempt, thinning grey hair greased back. He stuck out his hand, but John did not take it, saying [...] "What do you want?". Alf placated John somewhat by saying, [...] "You can't turn <b>your</b> <b>back</b> on your family, no matter what they've done." [...] Their conversation did not last long, as John soon ordered Alf and the journalist out of the NEMS office. The Beatles' personal stories were kept out of the newspapers—by agreement with journalists who were offered exclusive stories in return—but one day John opened a copy of the Daily Express and saw a photo of his father.|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered chronic back pain. [...] "When <b>your</b> <b>back</b> is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just kind of hard to keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't know if it was going to be on a label or if we were going to put it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time. [...] "Once MCA jumped on board, it was kind of like, [...] "Whatever! That's cool. Cheers! Put it out, we don't really care!" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Something New" [...] was {{recorded}} in May 2012 and produced by Girls Aloud's long-time collaborator Brian Higgins. The uptempo dance song and was written in A major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 115 beats per minute. [...] "Something New" [...] opens with Cole and Nadine Coyle singing [...] "Go, girls, g-g-go, go, go / We girls gonna take control / You boys better know, know, know / We girls gonna run this show" [...] over a piano melody. According to The Sun contributor Alison Maloney, [...] "after a generic dance beat kicks in, {{the rest of the}} track is a mish-mash of rap and mixed solos." [...] As the chorus begins, the five girls join together and sing, [...] "All I want is something new / Something I can hold on to / I don’t wanna talk / I just wanna dance / Baby let it drop / Catch me if you can." [...] Maloney deemed that the moment where the track's style returns [...] "to the more recognisable Girls Aloud sound." [...] It ends with the group shouting, [...] "Boy you better watch <b>your</b> <b>back</b> / Cause we're the leaders of the pack." [...] A reviewer for Heat notice similarities to David Guetta productions and compared it to songs by Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga. Michael Cragg of The Guardian compared the verse's structure to the one of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] (2007), and thought that [...] "Something New" [...] echoed the group's previous single, [...] "Something Kinda Ooooh" [...] (2006), {{not only because of the}} title, [...] "but it also has the same slightly demented feel to it, all distorted backing vocals, strange rap sections and a brilliantly effortless chorus that soars out of an amazing bridge bit." [...] Most critics also had a similar perception to Cragg regarding the song's [...] "odd" [...] structure, which is noted as [...] "typical" [...] and the group's [...] "signature style".|$|E
500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, <b>your</b> <b>back,</b> your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob." [...] His motto comes from Plutarch, [...] "The deceived is wiser than one not deceived." ...|$|E
