500|$|Mike G is {{the only}} {{performer}} on [...] "Forest Green", which reviewers described as a lurching banger with a creepy, hypnotic beat. [...] "Lean" [...] is a parody song {{in the style of}} Waka Flocka Flame, an absurdist take on rap music with lines like “If I was a dinosaur, I’d be a flexasaurus”. Syd the Kyd makes another singing appearance on [...] "Analog 2". The song features Ocean singing a chorus over a production of what writers thought of as atmospheric, with a sultry swirl of synths, and a segue with 12 seconds of silence. Tyler raps with relative innocence about hanging out with his girlfriend, and Syd the Kid muses about moonlight kisses and rooftop sexual encounters. Hodgy is the main contributor to [...] "50", a bass-driven, comical song that takes cues from the comedy troupe The Lonely Island. [...] "50" [...] demonstrates both an aggressive and comical side to the album, with verses like [...] "I'll fuck <b>your</b> <b>grandmother</b> up." ...|$|E
500|$|The Molloy {{character}} {{is based on}} actor David Niven's performance as the character A. J. Raffles, a gentleman thief, in the 1939 film Raffles. The music heard {{at the beginning of}} the episode during the burglaries is taken from the film The Pink Panther, in which Niven played The Phantom, a similar character. Flanders tells Homer that his Shroud of Turin beach towels were stolen during one of the burglaries. Apu protects the Kwik-E mart with a rifle in a way similar to many of the images of Korean Grocery store owners during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.] Homer's dream of riding a nuclear bomb into oblivion is a reference to the famous scene from the film [...] Homer's line [...] "So I said, Look buddy, your car was upside-down when I got here. And as for <b>your</b> <b>grandmother,</b> she shouldn't have mouthed off like that!" [...] is a reference to Flannery O'Connor's short story [...] "A Good Man Is Hard to Find". The scene of Homer and Principal Skinner talking in front of the museum is a reference to a scene from the television series Dragnet. In a reference to the plot of the 1963 film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Molloy sends the residents of Springfield on a hunt for a treasure that is buried under a big letter. The ending sequence of the episode also references the film by using the same music and camera angles. In another scene that references It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Bart tricks American actor Phil Silvers into driving his car into a river, just like Silvers's character did in the film.|$|E

2500|$|In 1945, Brando's agent {{recommended}} he take a co-starring role in The Eagle Has Two Heads with Tallulah Bankhead, {{produced by}} Jack Wilson. Bankhead had {{turned down the}} role of Blanche Dubois in A Streetcar Named Desire, which Williams had written for her, to tour the play for the 1946-1947 season. Bankhead recognized Brando's potential, despite her disdain (which most Broadway veterans shared) for method acting, and agreed to hire him even though he auditioned poorly. The two clashed greatly during the pre-Broadway tour, with Bankhead reminding Brando of his mother, being her age and also having a drinking problem. Wilson was largely tolerant of Brando's behavior, but he reached his limit when Brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the November 28, 1946, opening. [...] "I don't care what <b>your</b> <b>grandmother</b> did," [...] Wilson exclaimed, [...] "and that Method stuff, I {{want to know what}} you're going to do!" [...] Brando in turn raised his voice, and acted with great power and passion. [...] "It was marvelous," [...] a cast member recalled. [...] "Everybody hugged him and kissed him. He came ambling offstage and said to me, 'They don't think you can act unless you can yell.'" ...|$|E
