6000|$|... "Precisely! Well, {{what are}} you going to do now? Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> your first reverse, or are you going to renew the experiment?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For five years," [...] he said abstractedly, [...] "you and I and Arthur {{have lived}} here together. Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> those five years? Think!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{listen to}} me. I {{can give you}} this chance. Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> that <b>with</b> my advice you could have succeeded in Mrs. Maynard's case?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{a parcel}} of loons," [...] exclaimed Media. [...] "But go your ways, if <b>you</b> are <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> your locomotion, well and good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Hilda, [...] "it doesn't matter, but {{you have}} a suspiciously complacent look. One could imagine that <b>you</b> felt <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Were <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> your pupils, or did any {{circumstance}} {{in their}} conduct give you cause for complaint? Conceal nothing from me, repose in me entire confidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{give you}} the promise with all my heart; {{and it is not}} just words, it is a promise; you shall have him back without a hurt. Do you believe? And are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> me now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> your experiment, girls, or do {{you want}} another week of it?" [...] she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with {{brightening}} faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.|$|E
6000|$|She frowned--vaguely stirred to {{irritation}} by his ill-concealed indifference. [...] "I trust," [...] she rejoined pointedly, [...] "that <b>you</b> are <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> your {{trade in}} Grenoble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope I am too {{polite to}} criticize cotton as {{compared}} with curled hair," [...] said the King, [...] "especially as <b>you</b> seem <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have all}} been a little engrossed, have we not?" [...] she murmured. [...] "I hope that <b>you</b> are <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the way things have turned out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Monsieur," [...] quoth Sir Percy after {{a slight}} pause, and {{meeting with a}} swift glance of lazy irony his opponent's fixed gaze. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the weapons? Which of the two shall be yours, and which mine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why aren't <b>you</b> <b>{{satisfied}}</b> <b>with</b> me?--I'm {{not satisfied}} with you. Paul used {{to come to me}} and take me like a man does. You only leave me alone or take me like your cattle, quickly, to forget me again--so that you can forget me again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was expecting}} to see you, baron. I {{received}} your note saying that you had taken the command of your regiment, and would do yourself the honour of presenting yourself {{as soon as you}} had put matters in trim. Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> your men and your officers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all," [...] {{said the}} Prince, {{looking up from}} the wine list, [...] "why cannot I be <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>you?</b> And why cannot <b>you</b> be <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> me? It would save so much trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} <b>you</b> are <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> your day's work, Madame; I fear me our British country folk hold {{the strings of}} their purses {{somewhat}} tightly these times." ...|$|R
6000|$|He pondered {{a fitting}} reply, {{but at last}} gave it up and said: [...] "If <b>you</b> are <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> your sketch, we'll start. I see the teams are ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{travelled}} gentleman get odd notions," [...] she said, [...] "and {{more particularly}} on such subjects. I always feel afraid to discuss them with foreigners, though {{with my own}} countrymen I have few reserves. Pray, Mr. Truck, are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> America?--Do you find it the country you expected to see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, I {{will pay}} your {{training}} expenses and two pounds a week over. Here are five pounds as a guarantee. You will fight when I consider {{that you are}} ready, and that the circumstances are favourable. If you win your fight, you shall have fifty pounds. Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the terms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't explain, but I'm {{convinced}} of its correctness," [...] Clarke rejoined, watching him. [...] "One {{would imagine that}} the most important matter is that you were driven out of a calling you liked and were sent here, ruined in repute and fortune. Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> your lot? Haven't you the courage to insist upon being reinstated?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> not <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> {{the honors}} <b>you</b> have already got, you greedy man?" [...] he said, laying his hand affectionately on Mr. Ogilvy, who only sighed for reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> are <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> us, guv'nor," [...] Burt struck in, {{pushing his}} bulky form {{in front of}} Farintosh. [...] "We have done our work all right, haven't we?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have made}} me ill again," [...] she said severely, [...] "and now I hope <b>you</b> are <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> your work. Youâ€™ll kill me before you have done with me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why? Don't you see {{anything}} to criticise in me? Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> me in every way? You ought to think. You ought to think now. Do you think that I am doing right in all respects? Am I all that I could be to you, and to you alone? If I am wrong in the least thing, criticise me, and I will try to be better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} wondering, I suppose, {{like all the}} rest of the world," [...] he began, [...] "why I sent for you here. I am going to tell you. But first of all let me know this. Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> what I have done for you, and for your people? In other words, have you any feeling of what people, I believe, call {{gratitude}} towards me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Clear your head, child, of the {{nonsense}} {{that has}} got into it--I can't think how. Rich Mr. Dunboyne has taught his heir to despise the base act of marrying for money. He knows that Philip will meet young ladies at my house; {{and he has}} written {{to me on the}} subject of his son's choice of a wife. 'Let Philip find good principles, good temper, and good looks; and I promise beforehand to find the money.' There is what he says. Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> Philip's father, now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Romola, {{look and}} see if <b>you</b> are <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the portraits old Piero has made of us. Is it not a dainty device? and the credit of {{choosing}} it is mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the good}} knight my master's," [...] {{answered}} Gurth, [...] "of which, assuredly, I would not have spoken a word, had <b>you</b> been <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> working your will upon mine own property." ...|$|R
5000|$|Voters {{are asked}} the question: 'Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> or {{dissatisfied}} <b>with</b> the way -name- is doing his/her job as Prime Minister?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were nothing}} to me, and Junius {{was a great}} deal," [...] she answered. [...] "And yet I think I was fair enough. The only money you paid was what Mr Candy charged; and when I spoke of {{receiving}} money for my services when the affair was finished I only did it that it might all be more business like, and that you should not drop me and set somebody else looking after Junius. That was the great thing I was afraid of, so I did all I could to make <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is in order, {{excellent}} Demetrius. Caleb can {{now appear}} in the Forum, if it pleases him, and lecture upon the fall of Jerusalem {{for the benefit of}} the vulgar. Well, here also is a letter from the divine--or rather the half divine--Domitian to yourself, Demetrius of Alexandria, also witnessed by myself and sealed. It promises to you that if you give evidence enabling him to arrest that miscreant who dared to bid against him--no, do not be alarmed, the lady was not knocked down to you--you shall be allowed to take possession of her or to buy her at a reasonable valuation, not to exceed fifteen sestertia. That is as much as she will fetch now in the open market. Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> this document?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miller then unreeled a spool of silk twist, {{and this}} I tied {{squarely}} to {{the arm of}} the chair at a point about six feet from the loose end which I intended to hold. I knotted the silk about the psychic's wrists, drawing it to a hard knot each time, and gave the spool to Miller, while retaining the loose end of the thread in my own hands. The psychic could neither touch the tips of her fingers together nor lift her arms an inch from the chair. She was as secure as if bound with a rope, but as an extra precaution I passed the thread beneath the chair-arm and pulled it taut. [...] "This will enable us to feel the lightest movement of her hands," [...] I said to Miller, who had copied my device. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the conditions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know they}} are in force; but, what are the red-skins about? Is the hatchet buried, among the Six Nations, that <b>you</b> are <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> being a runner, when scalps may be had near Ticonderoga?" ...|$|R
5000|$|If <b>you</b> are <b>satisfied</b> {{from the}} life of this world (dunya) with what is {{sufficient}} for you, then the minimum is sufficient, But if <b>you</b> are not <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> what is sufficient, then nothing can <b>satisfy</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'He must and shall!' {{answered}} Redgauntlet, briefly. 'Go to the front, Cristal--I {{would speak}} with my nephew. I trust, Sir Arthur Redgauntlet, <b>you</b> are <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> {{the manner in}} which I have discharged my duty to your sister?' ...|$|R
