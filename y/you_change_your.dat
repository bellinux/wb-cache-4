500|$|When the Associated Press picked Petoskey {{as only a}} second-team All-American in 1933, ten-year-old Mary Lee Grossman from Saginaw, Michigan protested in {{a letter}} to AP sports editor, Alan Gould, that he had [...] "chosen wrong" [...] in leaving Petoskey and Whitey Wistert off the first-team. [...] To avoid any {{appearance}} of bias, the Saginaw native noted: [...] "You may think I am a friend of these boys but I do not know either of them. [...] I hope <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind." [...] Gould responded to Miss Grossman in his column: [...] "You may be right, Mary Lee, but it's too late now to change our mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Juggling (ch. 4), Easwaran {{describes}} {{feats of}} juggling that he witnessed in San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square, stating that [...] "what {{that young man}} learned {{to do with his}} body, you can learn to do with your mind." [...] Mental juggling involves [...] "likes and dislikes.... Can <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> likes at will?.... We need to learn to enjoy doing something we dislike or to enjoy not doing something we like, when it is in the long-term best interests of others or ourselves." [...] Easwaran describes his own experiences in changing his eating habits, stating that he learned from Mahatma Gandhi that [...] "training the palate is a powerful aid in training the mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the number}} of {{children}} with intersex conditions referred to Lawson Wilkins' new pediatric endocrinology clinic at Hopkins increased, it was recognized that doctors [...] "couldn't tell by looking" [...] at the external genitalia, and many errors of diagnosis based on outward appearance had led to anomalous sex assignments. Although it seems obvious now that a doctor could not announce to an eight-year-old boy and his parents that [...] "we have just discovered that you are 'really' a girl, with female chromosomes, and ovaries and uterus inside, and we recommend that <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> sex to match your chromosomes and internal organs," [...] a few such events occurred around the world as doctors and parents tried to make use of new information.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas {{was educated}} at Macaulay Church of England Primary School, Victoria Rise, Clapham until 1974, where his party trick was {{to recite the}} first verses of the four gospels from memory. He then won a {{scholarship}} to attend the independent Christ's Hospital School, where he attained O-levels and A-levels in English, history, and politics and economics. At school, Thomas was influenced by his drama teacher, Duncan Noel-Paton, and by Bertolt Brecht's play The Caucasian Chalk Circle, in which the audience's sympathies are swayed from one view of a political argument to the other; speaking of this to The Guardian in 1999, he said [...] "I was amazed that a play could make <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind". He went on to be awarded a degree in Theatre Arts at Bretton Hall College.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, McGraw {{entered the}} weight loss business, selling shakes, energy bars, and supplements. These {{products}} were promoted {{on his show}} with his sisters Deana and Brenda and nephew Tony among the featured testimonials on the show. [...] These products' labels, which carried the brand name [...] "Shape It Up, Woo, Woo!", stated: [...] "These products contain scientifically researched levels of ingredients that can help <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> behavior {{to take control of}} your weight." [...] This met with swift criticism from various sources, accusing McGraw (a clinical psychologist, and not a physician) of lacking the expertise to recommend weight loss products. Facing a Federal Trade Commission investigation into Shape Up's claims, McGraw pulled his supplements off the market in March 2004, and the FTC dropped its probe. In October 2005, several people who used McGraw's products declared an intent to file a class action lawsuit against him, claiming that although the supplements cost $120 per month they did not stimulate weight loss.|$|E

2500|$|This {{question}} {{is called the}} Monty Hall problem due to its resembling scenarios on the game show Let's Make a Deal; its answer existed before it was used in [...] "Ask Marilyn". She said the selection should be switched to door #2 {{because it has a}} 2/3 chance of success, while door #1 has just 1/3. To summarize, 2/3 of the time the opened door #3 will indicate the location of the door with the car (the door you had not picked and the one not opened by the host). Only 1/3 of the time will the opened door #3 mislead you into changing from the winning door to a losing door. These probabilities assume <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> choice each time door #3 is opened, and that the host always opens a door with a goat. This response provoked letters from thousands of readers, nearly all arguing doors #1 and #2 each have an equal chance of success. A follow-up column reaffirming her position served only to intensify the debate and soon became a feature article {{on the front page of}} The New York Times. Parade received around 10,000 letters from readers who thought her wrong.|$|E
