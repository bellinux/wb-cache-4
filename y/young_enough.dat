5|$|One day, Charles Smithson, an {{orphaned}} gentleman, and Ernestina Freeman, his fiancée and {{a daughter}} of a wealthy tradesman, see Sarah walking along the cliffside. Ernestina tells Charles something of Sarah's story, and he becomes curious about her. Though continuing to court Ernestina, Charles has several more encounters with Sarah, meeting her clandestinely three times. During these meetings, Sarah tells Charles of her history, and asks for his emotional and social support. During the same period, he learns of the possible loss of place as heir to his elderly uncle, who has become engaged to a woman <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to bear a child. Meanwhile, Charles's servant Sam {{falls in love with}} Mary, the maid of Ernestina's aunt.|$|E
25|$|The planets {{detected}} {{through direct}} imaging currently {{fall into two}} categories. First, planets are found around stars more massive than the Sun which are <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to have protoplanetary disks. The second category consists of possible sub-brown dwarfs found around very dim stars, or brown dwarfs which are at least 100 AU away from their parent stars.|$|E
25|$|Barnum {{was one of}} {{the very}} first circus owners to move his circus by train (and {{probably}} the very first to buy his own train). His friend, W.C. Coup, helped him get railroad cars to make his tour traveling easier. Given the lack of paved highways in America, {{this turned out to be}} a shrewd business move that vastly enlarged Barnum's geographical reach. In this new field, Barnum leaned more on the advice of Coup, Bailey and other business partners, most of whom were <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to be his sons.|$|E

50|$|If {{the second}} {{possibility}} were true {{it would mean}} that the Gurler House is one year younger than it is traditionally thought to be, being built in 1858 instead of 1857. Records show that Young took out a mortgage on the land for $537 in February 1858. It is thought that this money could have given the <b>Youngs</b> <b>enough</b> cash to build the Gurler House over a more humble home such as a log cabin.|$|R

25|$|Most {{likely he}} was born in Melun, but he lived most of his life in Paris. The {{earliest}} records of his life date from 1527, {{when he was in the}} service of the king. In 1530 he was charged with playing ball at Notre Dame Cathedral as well as refusing to go to a service, both dangerous irreverences that almost cost him prison timebut he was <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to be forgiven. From this event a birthdate between 1510 and 1520 can be inferred. In 1536 he became a master of choristers at the Sainte-Chapelle (choir), and he remained at this post, with a few additional benefices, for the rest of his life.|$|E
25|$|After Joan Crawford's third divorce, Gable and she {{resumed their}} affair and lived {{together}} for a brief time. Gable was acclaimed for his performance in The Hucksters (1947), a satire of postwar Madison Avenue corruption and immorality. A very public and brief romance with Paulette Goddard occurred after that. In 1949, Gable married Sylvia Ashley, a British model and actress who was previously married to Douglas Fairbanks. The relationship was profoundly unsuccessful; they divorced in 1952. Soon followed Never Let Me Go (1953), opposite Gene Tierney. Tierney was a favorite of Gable {{and he was very}} disappointed when she was replaced in Mogambo (because of her mental health problems) by Grace Kelly. Mogambo (1953), directed by John Ford, was a somewhat sanitized remake of his earlier Pre-Code film Red Dust, with Jean Harlow and Mary Astor, which had been a greater success. Gable's on-location affair with Grace Kelly (1929–1982), who was <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to be his daughter, gradually ended after filming was completed.|$|E
25|$|Roly {{was cast}} {{less than a}} week before the filming of EastEnders began. From the {{beginning}} it was decided that the occupants of The Queen Victoria pub, Den, Angie and Sharon Watts, were to have a German Shepherd named Prince. However, finding an Alsatian that was light enough in colour not to merge into the background of the set proved to be difficult. Eventually, the co-creator/producer of the show, Julia Smith, was contacted by a company named Janimals, who specialised in providing and training animals for television and films. They had found a seven-month-old Poodle, called Roly, who might still be <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to be trained. Training was said to take three weeks, and as the Poodle was a similar size to an Alsatian, Roly got the part. Roly was made the property of the BBC, given an ID card, and taken to live with Julia Smith at her home in London. Roly and Willy the pug shared a dressing room at Elstree studios.|$|E

25|$|Shahid {{was born}} in Anaheim, California, but his parents, Pakistani immigrants, moved to Karachi {{when he was an}} infant. However, they {{returned}} to California when he was six years old, settling in Cypress. Shahid attended Cypress High School, playing basketball for the school team, and played club cricket in the Southern California Cricket Association (SCCA). His debut for the U.S. under-19 team came when he was 17, at the 2009 Under-19 World Cup Qualifier in Canada. There, he took six wickets from six matches, with a best of 2/12 from 7.4 overs against Vanuatu. At the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand, Shahid featured in four matches, all of which had under-19 One Day International (ODI) status. His best figures came in the final match of the tournament, the 15th-place playoff against Afghanistan, where he took 3/18 from seven overs to be named man of the match. Shahid was still <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to play at the 2011 Under-19 World Cup Qualifier, but the U.S. failed to qualify for the 2012 World Cup (where he would have been ineligible).|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{admixture}} analyses {{based on}} data of several individuals of modern populations, estimate that the genes of the Bulgarians have two sources and a main admixture event between 1000 and 1600 YBP. The genes that are provisionally or indicatively {{to be associated with}} the Balto-Slavic donor group constitute about 40-45% of the total, i.e. Belarusian-like, of which a Lithuanian-like admixture is estimated at 23.2% and a Polish-like admixture at 19.3%. Early gene flows between southeastern and eastern Europe make it difficult to obtain a correct estimate, although <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> identical by descent segments confirmed such connection and that the East and West Slavs share more identical by descent segments with South Slavs than with Greeks, inter-Slavic populations (a group of Romanians, Gagauz), but less with Balts, while the South Slavs share similar number with East and West Slavs, but fewer with Greeks. Genetically and linguistically the Slavic ancestors of the modern South Slavs had divided mainly into two groups, each of which took a migration stream either through the west or the east of the Carpathian Mountains. The western Balkans was settled with Sclaveni, the east with Antes. Haplogroup R1a, the major haplogroup among Slavic tribes, reveals that the haplogroup of the Serbo-Croat group is mainly constituted by R1a-L1280 or R1a-CTS3402, while the Macedono-Bulgarian is exclusively made up of the R1a-L1029. A pattern of distribution of IBD segments between South Slavs and East and West Slavs suggests a shared ancestry or a modest gene flow.|$|E
500|$|A secretive CIA agent. In late August 2010, Stallone {{expressed}} an interest in having Willis return in the sequel (expanding upon his brief cameo in the original) as a potential [...] "super-villain".

His supporters dismiss Carter as a disgruntled former aide who was miffed at not being asked to accompany Gingrich to Washington.|$|E
500|$|Time Out New York {{gave the}} film 4 stars out of 5, calling it [...] "acceptable escapism for those {{old enough to}} see it yet still <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to shriek at undead dreamboats." [...] Jordan Mintzer from Variety stated, [...] "Stewart is {{the heart and soul}} of the film", and added that she [...] "gives both weight and depth to dialogue...that would sound like typical chick-lit blather in the mouth of a less {{engaging}} actress, and she makes Bella's psychological wounds seem like the real deal." ...|$|E
500|$|Julia Garner {{was cast}} {{less than a}} week before filming began. Another actor, Peter Vack, had {{recommended}} her to Thomas, who said that Garner [...] "was one of the only actresses I found who looked <b>young</b> <b>enough,</b> but also had a mature emotional depth". Electrick Children marked Garner's first lead role in a film, and Thomas thought that her inexperience in acting made her [...] "very teen-like". Thomas sought out Rory Culkin to play Clyde, while Billy Zane was cast on the recommendation of the casting director, who was a friend of Zane.|$|E

500|$|When {{ending the}} second season, the {{producers}} and crew {{thought it would}} be the last. However, to their surprise Millennium was renewed for a third season. Many of the cliffhanger plot threads from the season finale were written off as the hallucinations of Frank Black. When creating the third season, they {{wanted to go back to}} the stand alone storytelling format used in the first season; to do so they had Frank join the FBI and receive a new [...] "skeptical" [...] partner with whom he could work. Regarding Hollis, producer Michael Duggan said [...] "she's not a rookie ... but she's <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to be in awe of Frank Black's rep as a legendary crime solver".|$|E
500|$|Hollis was {{conceived}} as a [...] "skeptical" [...] partner for Black, to allow the third season {{to return to the}} stand-alone plot format of the series' first season. About Hollis, producer Michael Duggan said: [...] "She's not a rookie... but she's <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to be in awe of Frank Black's rep as a legendary crime solver". Reaction to the character was mixed; she was described as [...] "pass emotional baggage off as character development", and her introduction was said to be overly similar to the character dynamic in Millennium sister series The X-Files. Scott's acting in the role was praised, with critics calling her [...] "bracing" [...] and noting that she [...] "works hard to mine some sort of truth" [...] from Hollis' character.|$|E
500|$|The {{book has}} a {{particular}} appeal to young people, an appeal that led historian James Baker to describe it as [...] "more important than its detractors think, although {{not as important as}} Rand fans imagine". Philosopher Allan Bloom said the novel is [...] "hardly literature", but when he asked his students which books mattered to them, someone always was influenced by The Fountainhead. Journalist Nora Ephron wrote that she had loved the novel when she was 18, but admitted that she [...] "missed the point", which she suggested is largely subliminal sexual metaphor. Ephron wrote that she decided upon rereading that [...] "it is better read when one is <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to miss the point. Otherwise, one cannot help thinking it is a very silly book." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} establishing Ellie's physical appearance was [...] "critical". They {{felt that she}} needed to appear <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to make her relationship with Joel—who is in his 40s—believable, but old enough to be credible as a resourceful teenager capable of surviving. A redesign of Ellie's physical appearance was publicized in May 2012; Druckmann stated that the change was to make her look more like Johnson. Prior to the redesign, comparisons were made between Ellie and actress Ellen Page; in June 2013, Page accused Naughty Dog of [...] "ripping off [...] likeness". The team felt that Ellie was important for the game's marketing; Druckmann said that, when asked to move the image of Ellie {{from the front of the}} game's packaging to the back, [...] "everyone at Naughty Dog just flat-out refused".|$|E

When questioned about the inspiration for Ellie as a gameplay feature, Druckmann recalled when he and Straley were brainstorming ideas for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and created a mute character who would summon the player to follow them, creating a [...] "beautiful" [...] relationship through gameplay alone. Though this concept was never included in the final game, the idea was raised when the team were discussing a new project, ultimately inspiring Ellie. Following the release of Left Behind, in which Ellie is seen kissing her friend Riley, Druckmann has confirmed that she is gay.|$|E
500|$|According to Wallenstein, {{historians and}} other writers [...] "have had great {{difficulty}} {{coming to grips}} with Mason in his historical context, and they have jumbled the story in related ways, misleading each other and following each other's errors". Some of this is due to conflation of Mason's views on slavery with that of his desire to ban the African slave trade, which he unquestionably opposed and fought against. His record otherwise is mixed: Virginia banned the importation of slaves from abroad in 1778, while Mason was in the House of Delegates. In 1782, after he had returned to Gunston Hall, it enacted legislation that allowed manumission of adult slaves <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> to support themselves (not older than 45), but a proposal, supported by Mason, to require freed slaves to leave Virginia within a year or be sold at auction, was defeated. Broadwater asserted, [...] "Mason must have shared the fears of Jefferson and countless other whites that whites and free blacks could not live together".|$|E
