500|$|A {{number of}} criticisms {{were made of}} Finnish society in {{response}} to the shootings. Bishop Peura asked whether the nation had been blind to young people's problems, and Juha Mieto, Centre Party member and Kauhajoki representative, said that societal [...] "malaise" [...] was due to a decline in traditional lifestyles, and lack of order. Psychologist Salli Saari, from the Helsinki University Central Hospital, said that the country had not responded adequately to calls after the Jokela incident that boys had been neglected within the schooling system. Matti Rimpelä, a professor of welfare in Helsinki, attributed the problems with young people to a lack of institutional support in schools and daycare, which had not been provided due to Finland's rapid change from being a predominantly rural country to a [...] "post-industrial information society". Rimpelä and Jukka Mäkelä, a child psychologist at the National Research Development Centre for Welfare and Health in Helsinki, concurred that Finland had a cultural problem surrounding suicide, while daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat wrote in an editorial that, [...] "The Web cannot be held responsible for this, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> ask how much the Web feeds the dark side of human nature".|$|E

Matlock, directing him to attempt to hinder Curtis advices down the White River by [...] "falling trees into all fords. Destroying all bridges and ferry boats, and in every way obstructing the roads. Destroying all forage and subsistence that cannot be removed within five miles of the road. Call out the entire Negro force in every direction along the Augusta and Jacksonport roads. Burn all bridges and block up all boards especially of village creek. If followed by the enemy attack him at all points continuing however the work of obstruction. In falling back obstruct every foot of road. Place your train at some convenient place well in your rear. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> accomplish what is above directed, {{and at the same}} time strike the enemy at Smithville do, so risk nothing in this. The work of obstruction is the greatest importance. You are expected to do your whole duty. Your movements are part of a general plan. Your failure would defeat the whole.

2500|$|Game Informers Andrew Reiner {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "while failing to {{transform}} the classic film into an engrossing interactive experience, the game does shine when it doesn't {{have to rely on}} the film license to pull it along." [...] GameSpy's William Abner scored the PC version 3 out of 5, and was critical of the use of the license; [...] "where the original movie was full of political intrigue, wicked subplots and occasional gratuitous violence, the game is all about the violence." [...] He wrote [...] "Being a Godfather game, you'd expect things to be a bit less [...] "insane" [...] than your run-of-the-mill Grand Theft Auto clone. But there's more gunplay, more Blues Brothers-inspired car chases, and more thuggery in general, in 30 minutes of the game than in the entire movie trilogy." [...] He concluded [...] "if you can {{think of it as a}} generic gangland-themed game without constantly comparing it to the films it borrows its license from, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> have a good time. That said, it's hard to play The Godfather without thinking that this was a missed opportunity." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored the Xbox version 6 out of 10, calling it [...] "way too short, far too easy, too damned repetitive and far too in awe of Grand Theft Auto to be held up as anything other than a rather lightweight copycat offering." [...] Although he was critical of the length of the game's story in relation to the extortion gameplay, he felt the combat went some way to redeeming the game; [...] "the one main saving grace is that the combat is actually fun enough to nullify the overwhelming repetition." [...] He argued the game [...] "offers a decent amount of fun, with great combat, occasionally inspired set-pieces, but sub-par driving and a half-baked story mode with barely enough variety to fill a long evening." ...|$|E

Perhaps the most important was that we wanted the book to provide the tools to make gaming in an urban environment as different an experience as the DM and players wanted it to be. While <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>can</b> use Cityscape as nothing more than a guide to running a [...] "street crawl" [...] or [...] "sewer crawl" [...] adventure, we tried to delve into much more depth than just that.

40|$|This is not {{a course}} about {{performance}} analysis or about writing efficient programs, although it often touches on these topics. Both are much too large to be covered, even superficially, in a single lecture devoted to performance. There are many books on performance analysis 1 and a few on efficient programs 2. Our goal in this handout is more modest: to explain how to take a system apart and understand its performance well enough for most practical purposes. The analysis is necessarily rather rough and ready, but nearly always a rough analysis is adequate, often it’s the best <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do, and <b>certainly</b> it’s much better than what you usually see, which is no analysis at all. Note that performance analysis {{is not the same}} as performance measurement, which is more common. What is performance? The critical measures are bandwidth and latency. We neglect other aspects that are sometimes important: availability (discussed later when we deal with replication), connectivity (discussed later when we deal with switched networks), and storage capacity When should you work on performance?
