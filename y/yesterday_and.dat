5|$|During {{a tour of}} the Philippines {{the month}} after the <b>Yesterday</b> <b>and</b> Today furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had {{expected}} them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations. They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty. Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, Eugen Relgis visited Israel and Jerusalem, {{tightening}} his {{links with}} the Romanian Israeli community, including the Menora Association and Rabbi David Șafran.

25|$|In 1990, Richard Pascale {{wrote that}} {{relentless}} change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves. His famous maxim is “Nothing fails like success” {{by which he}} means that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, We tend to depend on what worked <b>yesterday</b> <b>and</b> refuse {{to let go of}} what worked so well for us in the past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self-renewal based on constructive conflict.|$|E

25|$|Released on 20 June 1966, the <b>Yesterday</b> <b>and</b> Today album's {{controversial}} cover (see section below) {{marked the}} first time the Beatles' judgement was criticised by the media and distributors. After advance copies were sent to disc jockeys and record reviewers, negative reaction to the cover photo was so strong Capitol recalled 750,000 copies from distributors to replace the cover. The total cost to Capitol to replace the cover and promotional materials was $250,000, wiping out their initial profit. Nevertheless, the album reached #1 on the US Billboard charts by 30 July 1966 and certified gold soon after. It stayed at number one for five weeks.|$|E
