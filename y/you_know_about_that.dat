500|$|The band made {{an attempt}} to begin writing for a {{follow-up}} and had written and began recording one song titled [...] "Circle of the Noose", {{but it was never}} completed or officially released. The song, which is the last to feature guitar work from Navarro prior to his departure, was a tribute to the late qawwali-devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Navarro described the song as totally pop, dirge-like and said the song was one of the favorite songs he had done with the band. He said [...] "The best way I can describe it is it's like pepped- up '60s folk with '90s ideals, but I would hate to label it as folk because it's not, it moves." [...] On June 7, 2011, Navarro was asked by a Chili Peppers fan on his blog about [...] "Circle of the Noose" [...] and said he didn't have the recordings but would love to hear them. Flea was also asked in 2011 through his Twitter page about the song and was shocked that anyone knew about it. He responded by saying [...] "Holy cow! how in the hell do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> It had a sample of nusrat fateh Ali khan in it...never was finished". On February 3, 2016, a rough mix of [...] "Circle of the Noose", which had been recorded on March 16, 1998, was leaked to the internet. Dave Navarro tweeted [...] "WOW what a trip down memory lane" [...] in response to the leak.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Nonsense!' replied her sister. 'Why shouldn't Mr Cheggs {{be jealous}} if he likes? I like that, certainly.

6000|$|... "Better, but {{not out of}} her room. It {{has been}} a {{tolerable}} state of things of late. Not a creature to speak to, except, now and then, Clara coming down to maunder and sigh over all she has to do, and my father, who has been thoroughly in a rage <b>about</b> Elliot.

6000|$|... "She {{has been}} here this afternoon. This is her work," [...] Duge said grimly. [...] "We had some trouble before, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Canadian Pacific report. It was after that, that I was obliged to send her away altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not altogether," [...] {{retorted}} Josie. [...] "I {{have already}} secured proof that will convict two persons, at least.

6000|$|... "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> do you?" [...] Sergeant Bowen {{asked in}} turn. [...] "So they {{made no secret}} of it. Ay, lad, I know it; every man in the {{regiment}} knew it. And good cause I had to know it, it was that that ruined me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure <b>you</b> must <b>know</b> more <b>about</b> <b>that</b> than I do. I'll like it first-rate if you could, for I--well, to be plain, I like you." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "'My call is this,' said Ben. 'That gun was in {{my family}} sixty years. My father used it before I did, hunting birds. He killed a lot of birds with it.

6000|$|... "It's {{hard to tell}} {{just where}} he stands. I suspect that a hopeful {{temperament}} and fondness for round numbers have always caused him to set his figures beyond his actual worth. I don't say that he's been dishonest about it, but he's had a loose way of estimating his assets; he's reckoned his wealth {{on the basis of}} his capital, and some of his capital is borrowed. He's lost heavily by some of the recent failures, and there's been a terrible shrinkage in his values. I don't mean merely in the stock of paint on hand, but in a kind of competition which has become very threatening. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> West Virginian paint?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Queen Victoria {{wrote me}} that she felt just as I did about it--she said {{that as much as}} she was opposed to Greeley and the spirit he showed in the {{correspondence}} with me, she would not have had Sadowa happen for hundreds of dollars. I can show you her letter, {{if you would like to}} see it. But gentlemen, much as you may think <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> unhappy correspondence, you cannot know the straight of it till you hear it from my lips. It has always been garbled in the journals, and even in history. Yes, even in history--think of it! Let me--please let me, give you the matter, exactly as it occurred. I truly will not abuse your confidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ever since I {{started in}} to monkey with that darned Mervo," [...] he said sadly, [...] "there ain't a thing gone right. I haven't {{been able to}} turn around without bumping into myself. Everything I touch turns to mud. I guess I can still breathe, but I'm not betting on that lasting long. Of all the darned hoodoos that island was the worst. Say, I gotta close down that Casino. What do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>that!</b> Sure thing. The old lady won't stand for it. I had a letter from her." [...] He turned to Betty. [...] "You got her all worked up, Betty. I'm not blaming you. It's just my jinx. She took it into her head I'd been {{treating}} you mean, and she kicked at the Casino. I gotta close it down or nix on the heir thing. That was enough for me.

2500|$|Gibson was surly and brusque {{even with}} his teammates. When his catcher Tim McCarver went to the mound for a conference, Gibson brushed him off, saying [...] "The only thing <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> {{pitching}} is <b>that</b> it's hard to hit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My boy, don't {{be afraid}} of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for all the world. No--I'd protect you--I'd protect you.

5000|$|Colin McGuire of PopMatters states [...] "Here, he overshadows {{any work}} hehas {{previously}} done by keeping his Southern hip-hop roots intact while putting just enough {{attention on the}} hooks that one could easily find half of these songs that paint T.I. vs. T.I.P's canvas on your favorite Hot 100 radio station. And he does it better than he has {{ever been able to}} do it before. Harris {{has come a long way}} from initially snapping back as the rubber band man. And now, with another hip-hop masterpiece under his belt, maybe Cohen can have a laugh himself as well." [...] Ian Cohen of Stylus Magazine stated [...] "The biggest failing of T.I. vs. T.I.P.: though his singles are obsessed with knowledge of self and others, during the span of a seemingly endless album that centers around an identity crisis, T.I. mostly fails to realize the difference between introspection and self-absorption. It's more of a hastily assembled construct grafted onto the persona of a generic trap star who doesn't seem capable of taking real artistic chances. In his mind, anyone who criticizes T.I. is [...] "just another hater who's broke again," [...] waiting for some backpacker epiphany that will never come, like Little Brother becoming commercially relevant or Freddie Foxxx coming out of hiding to lyrically knuckle this guy down. It's like T.I.'s been speaking in code to us all along: What <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> You know what it is. You don’t know me. But you know what? After spending hours with T.I. vs. T.I.P. chasm-like emptiness, I can’t see why anyone would care." [...] Nick Marx of Tiny Mix Tapes noted [...] "After reaching his creative apex, is there a more predictable and plodding step down for an artist than a concept album? Did anyone even know (or care) that the two iterations of Clifford Harris' moniker represent, respectively, his business and street sides? T.I. vs T.I.P. is mercifully light on the requisite skits illustrating its dichotomy, but you almost wish there were more of them to explain the album's weird alchemy of simultaneously overwrought and undercooked production and flaccid, self-absorbed lyricism." [...] Brendan Frederick of XXL Magazine notes [...] "Atlanta rapper Clifford Harris opened this old wound four years ago on [...] "T.I. vs. T.I.P.," [...] a highlight from his sophomore opus, Trap Muzik, where T.I.P., his reckless, shit-talking core, battled T.I., the consummate professional/smooth operator. After a tumultuous 2006 filled with highs (King solidified his place as one of hip-hop's illuminati) and lows (the senseless murder of his best friend), Tip re-examines his schizophrenic psyche on his fifth album, T.I. vs. T.I.P. Call it trap therapy. Hopefully, someday we'll find out what really makes T.I. tick." ...|$|E
