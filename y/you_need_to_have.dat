500|$|Horrible Histories was immediately, {{and almost}} universally, greeted with {{critical}} enthusiasm. On its debut, Alice-Azania Jarvis of The Independent described {{the show as}} [...] "fun, filthy and genuinely engaging, in a peer-to-peer way." [...] Harry Venning in The Stage approved the [...] "seriously funny, beautifully performed and endlessly inventive sketches" [...] along with [...] "plenty of crowd-pleasing fart and poo gags." [...] By the second series, the show's cross-generational appeal was beginning to attract significant attention from adult media. Naomi West of The Daily Telegraph characterised the first series as [...] "boundary-pushing", suggesting that [...] "the bold decision to approach the series {{in the same way}} as an adult show has been the key to its success... delivers more laughs than most post-watershed comedies." [...] James Delingpole in The Spectator likewise recommended the show to viewers of all ages, saying that [...] "Even though there are vast quantities of entirely gratuitous fart, bottom and wee wee jokes, the cumulative effect—bizarrely—is one of dumbing up rather than down." [...] Discussing the first two series in The Guardian, television writer Jesse Armstrong said that [...] "Hit shows are very difficult to achieve. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> everything just right—that's what's so terrifying. But Horrible Histories has a great cast and brilliant writers. They're also blessed with great source material. The tone is perfect and it is done in a non-patronising, engaging way".|$|E

[...] A Daily Post reporter quipped [...] "No wedding goes without a hitch in soapland, and Toadie and Sonya's is no exception." [...] On the day the episode was broadcast in the UK, All About Soaps Claire Crick wrote [...] "There's just one thing <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{at the top of your}} to-do list today… and that's watch Neighbours!

2500|$|The 2011/12 season saw Sammy improve as a batsman: in {{the series}} against India and Australia Sammy scored over 100runs, which he had not done {{previously}} in a Test series. This trend continued when the West Indies toured England in May 2012. Sammy began the series with scores of 17 and 37 in the first Test at Lord's, during which he passed 3,000runs in first-class cricket. In the following Test, in his 26th Test, Sammy registered his maiden Test century. It was just the seventh time a number eight batsman had scored a century for the West Indies. Sammy partnered Marlon Samuels in a 204-run stand, the second-highest for the West Indies' seventh wicket. The West Indies lost the Test and drew the next one to lose the series 2–0; Sammy finished with 201runs from five innings and was his team's third highest run-scorer {{in the series}} while his six wickets cost 48.50runs each.• Commenting on Sammy's performance in the series, former West Indies captain Viv Richards said [...] "All {{of a sudden there}} was this new-found confidence. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a leader who can come out to the middle and make some sort of contribution. He has done enough and should not feel he has one foot in and one foot out as far as the leadership in concerned. He has done his bit to provide a winning environment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tyler {{stated that}} his usual {{approach}} to taking over a franchise from another composer is to [...] "try {{to take from}} what's before me and also forge ahead". So, though Tyler [...] "was really married to" [...] the idea of reprising Silvestri's Avengers theme from the first film in the sequel and wanted to keep in-line with [...] "the language of what Alan had done in The Avengers", he instead began by composing a [...] "classic, epic" [...] suite of his own for the film. Titled [...] "Rise Together", Tyler said that it [...] "is much more about pageantry and a march, and there's a slight militaristic aspect. I tend {{to stay away from}} that, but I felt that that, combined with a choir, would make them feel larger than life. And certainly, this is when they're 'rising together,' so <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> that unifying heroic theme with them." [...] Elfman then took Silvestri's theme and [...] "pulled it into" [...] the new material for the sequel to make a [...] "kind of a hybrid" [...] theme for the film. Tyler also looked to reference his own Iron Man and Thor themes in the score, as well as previous Captain America material, [...] "in order to create a similar musical universe", especially since those character's post-Avengers solo films [...] "set up" [...] Age of Ultron.|$|E

500|$|Cliff Fletcher, who drafted {{him into}} the NHL, {{described}} Nieuwendyk as being a [...] "pre-eminent two-way guy who had 50-goal seasons", adding that [...] "{{he had a great}} stick around the net, he had a great shot, he saw the ice well, he could skate, he had the size – he <b>had</b> everything <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have.</b> History has indicated that wherever he went, the team was competitive. The more that was on the line in big games, the better Joe played." [...] He was an offensive centre in Calgary and power play specialist, able to withstand the physical punishment required {{to stand in front of}} the net and battle defencemen for the puck. He led the NHL in power play goals in 1987–88 with 31 and finished in the top ten on four other occasions. [...] Wayne Gretzky, who also played box lacrosse in his youth, argued that the skills Nieuwendyk learned dodging opposing players in that sport aided his development as a hockey player. Nieuwendyk was regarded as a top faceoff man, a skill that Team Canada relied on during the Olympics. He was a checking-line centre at the 2002 Olympics, relied on for his defensive and faceoff abilities.|$|R
