500|$|The Diocletianic {{persecution}} {{was ultimately}} unsuccessful. As one modern historian has put it, {{it was simply}} [...] "too little and too late". Christians were never purged systematically {{in any part of}} the empire, and Christian evasion continually undermined the edicts' enforcement. Some bribed their way to freedom. The Christian Copres escaped on a technicality: To avoid sacrificing in court, he gave his brother power of attorney, and had him do it instead. Many simply fled. Eusebius, in his Vita Constantini, declared that [...] "once more the fields and woods received the worshippers of God". To contemporary theologians, there was no sin in this behavior. Lactantius held that Christ himself had encouraged it, and Bishop Peter of Alexandria quoted [...] ("when they persecute <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> city, flee ye into another") in support of the tactic.|$|E

500|$|Theo {{responds}} that {{he should}} accept his son's weaknesses and love him unconditionally because they are father and son—a typical sentimental idiom in family sitcoms of that time, and one which generated the typical applause from the studio audience. [...] Cliff, however, to the audience's surprise and amused approval, immediately and angrily calls this sentiment [...] "the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life". He completely rejects the notion that loving his son means he must quietly and willingly accept it when the boy does not give his best effort in school, and famously threatened him with the often quoted line, [...] "I brought <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world, and I'll take you out."
