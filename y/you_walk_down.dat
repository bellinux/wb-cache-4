I {{decided to make}} a film I would love to have seen as a kid, full of cheap tricks like a haunted house at a fair where <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the corridor and things jump out at you." [...] The film has often been cited as an allegory on the virtue of sexual purity and the danger of casual sex, although Carpenter has explained that this was not his intent: [...] "It has been suggested that I was making some kind of moral statement. Believe me, I'm not. In Halloween, I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers." ...|$|E
2500|$|On being wealthy, he {{said that}} [...] "if people know you're rich, they don't talk with you when <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the street." [...] He kept his wealth an open secret, {{amassing}} media outlets, hotels and casinos with a net worth widely estimated at {{more than a billion}} dollars. Griffin stated he did not really know his worth because it [...] "would keep me from sleeping at night". Former First Lady Nancy Reagan and he exchanged birthday greetings each July 6 for their shared birthday. Griffin was also an honorary pallbearer at the funeral of President Ronald Reagan in 2004, having been friends with both of the Reagans for many years.|$|E

6000|$|... “Oh! Nothing,” said Ossipon, gazing earnestly and quivering {{inwardly}} {{with the}} desire to find out something, but obviously intimidated by the little man’s overwhelming air of unconcern. When talking with this comrade—which happened but rarely—the big Ossipon suffered from a sense of moral and even physical insignificance. However, he ventured another question. “Did <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> here?” ...|$|E

Begin on the {{starboard}} hand, for instance, as <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> Cheapside, and count as you go; my life for it, you'll reel off more houses in half an hour's walk than {{are to be found}} in all that there village yonder. Then you'll remember, sir, that the starboard hand only has half, every Jack having his Jenny. I look upon Lunnun as the finest sight in nature, Captain Cuffe, after all I have seen in many cruises!" ...|$|E

6000|$|March 24. The {{spring is}} fairly with us now. Outside my {{laboratory}} window the great chestnut-tree is all {{covered with the}} big, glutinous, gummy buds, {{some of which have}} already begun to break into little green shuttlecocks. As <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the lanes you are conscious of the rich, silent forces of nature working all around you. The wet earth smells fruitful and luscious. Green shoots are peeping out everywhere. The twigs are stiff with their sap; and the moist, heavy English air is laden with a faintly resinous perfume. Buds in the hedges, lambs beneath them--everywhere the work of reproduction going forward! ...|$|E

6000|$|Often, as <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> a street, a man {{or woman}} passes you by. You look up at them and say to yourself, [...] "I seem to know that face"; but you can put no name to it, attach to it no {{definite}} idea, no associations of any sort. That was just how Woodbury struck me when I first came back to it. The houses, the streets, the people, were in a way familiar; yet I could no more have found my way alone from the station to The Grange than I could find my way alone from here to Kamschatka.|$|E
50|$|The bunker {{also had}} its own very large {{electricity}} generating plant.

50|$|Hitting Town is a play of {{just seven}} {{juxtaposed}} scenes, loosely shaped around {{a visit by}} Ralph to his sister Clare’s flat in their home town, Leicester. Clare is depressed having recently split up with her boyfriend. Ralph offers to take her out, ‘hitting the town’ as it were. The brother and sister travel through a landscape of Wimpy bars, shopping malls, subterranean discos, ending up in bed together. Set {{at the time of}} the Guildford and Birmingham bombings the play creates a feel for the contemporary mid-1970s. Poliakoff described the atmosphere of the time, ‘as <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the streets <b>you</b> expected cars to blow up in front of you’ (1997).|$|R

60|$|You {{are afraid}} to poke your nose into any {{room in the house}} now; so, after walking {{up and down the stairs}} for a while, you go and sit in your own bedroom. This becomes uninteresting, however, after a time, and so you put on your hat and stroll out into the garden. <b>You</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the path, and as you pass the summer-house you glance in, and there are those two young idiots, huddled up into one corner of it; and they see you, and are evidently under the idea that, for some wicked purpose of your own, you are {{following}} them about.|$|E
6000|$|And yet {{the last}} look of them--he {{stepping}} from the kerb and she following him round {{the edge of}} the big building brims me with wonder--floods me anew. Mysterious figures! Mother and son. Who are you? Why do <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the street? Where to-night will you sleep, and then, to-morrow? Oh, how it whirls and surges--floats me afresh! I start after them. People drive this way and that. The white light splutters and pours. Plate-glass windows. Carnations; chrysanthemums. Ivy in dark gardens. Milk carts at the door. Wherever I go, mysterious figures, I see you, turning the corner, mothers and sons; you, you, you. I hasten, I follow. This, I fancy, must be the sea. Grey is the landscape; dim as ashes; the water murmurs and moves. If I fall on my knees, if I go through the ritual, the ancient antics, it's you, unknown figures, you I adore; if I open my arms, it's you I embrace, you I draw to me--adorable world! ...|$|E

5000|$|I got {{pissed off}} with fashion {{designer}} {{at a party}} always going on about fashion.

I just wanted it to be the individual who created his own fashion. ... was a terrible brawl. I kicked him, and I kicked his girlfriend up the arse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Action, yes, but how?" [...] Wilmore queried. [...] "You can't {{be always}} hanging about the courts, {{waiting for the}} chance of {{defending}} some poor devil who's been wrongfully accused--there aren't enough of them, for one thing. On the other hand, <b>you</b> can't <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> Regent Street, brandishing a two-edged sword and hunting for pickpockets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I must go back,' {{he said to}} Waverley,'to my cove; will <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> {{the glen}} wi' me?' They went out together, and {{followed}} a narrow and entangled foot-path, which the occasional passage of anglers or wood-cutters had traced {{by the side of}} the stream. On their way the Baron explained to Waverley that he would be under no danger in remaining a day or two at Tully-Veolan, and even in being seen walking about, if he used the precaution of pretending that he was looking at the estate as agent or surveyor for an English gentleman who designed to be purchaser. With this view he recommended to him to visit the Bailie, who still lived at the factor's house, called Little Veolan, about a mile from the village, though he was to remove at next term. Stanley's passport would be an answer to the officer who commanded the military; and as to any of the country people who might recognise Waverley, the Baron assured him he was in no danger of being betrayed by them.|$|E
60|$|Let me {{specialize}} a visit I made to {{the collection}} of barrack-like one-story edifices, Campbell hospital, out on the flats, {{at the end of}} the then horse railway route, on Seventh street. There is a long building appropriated to each ward. Let us go into ward 6. It contains, to-day, I should judge, eighty or a hundred patients, half sick, half wounded. The edifice is nothing but boards, well whitewash'd inside, and the usual slender-framed iron bedsteads, narrow and plain. <b>You</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the central passage, with a row on either side, their feet towards you, and their heads to the wall. There are fires in large stoves, and the prevailing white of the walls is reliev'd by some ornaments, stars, circles, &c., made of evergreens. The view of the whole edifice and occupants can be taken at once, for there is no partition. You may hear groans or other sounds of unendurable suffering from two or three of the cots, but in the main there is quiet--almost a painful absence of demonstration; but the pallid face, the dull'd eye, and the moisture of the lip, are demonstration enough. Most of these sick or hurt are evidently young fellows from the country, farmers' sons, and such like. Look at the fine large frames, the bright and broad countenances, and the many yet lingering proofs of strong constitution and physique. Look at the patient and mute manner of our American wounded as they lie in such a sad collection; representatives from all New England, and from New York, and New Jersey, and Pennsylvania--indeed from all the States and all the cities--largely from the west. Most of them are entirely without friends or acquaintances here--no familiar face, and hardly a word of judicious sympathy or cheer, through their sometimes long and tedious sickness, or the pangs of aggravated wounds.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2010, Cele made {{comments}} {{regarding the}} SAPS, {{telling them to}} [...] "shape up or ship out", and saying [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the street, people must envy your body." [...] One of his comments, [...] "Stomach in, chest out", has become viral in South Africa and has inspired several techno remixes using audio from his speech.|$|E
5000|$|... "Divided States of America", a song on {{the album}} was {{explained}} by O’Donoghue, who said [...] "We were in America when Trump's inauguration was happening, and <b>you</b> couldn’t <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the street without seeing how divided America was. The guy selling cigarettes could be a Democrat and the guy he's selling them to could be a Trump supporter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ill? Never in my life," [...] she replied. [...] "Only I {{have been}} hurrying--we are late already for the performance--and seeing you there, well, {{it was quite}} a shock, <b>you</b> know. <b>Walk</b> <b>down</b> with us and tell me all about it. Tell us what you are doing here--or rather, don't talk for a moment! It is all so amazing." ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{that his}} father stopped {{him as he was}} about to leave the room. [...] "One more word, Silverbridge. Do you {{remember}} what you were saying when <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to the House with me from your club that night?" [...] Silverbridge remembered very well what he had said. He had undertaken to ask Mabel Grex to be his wife, and had received his father's ready approval to the proposition. But at this moment he was unwilling to refer to that matter. [...] "I have thought about it very much since that," [...] said the Duke. [...] "I may say that I have been thinking of it every day. If there were anything to tell me, you would let me know;--would you not?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Towards {{the bottom}} of the blocks of {{accommodation}} there is the porter's office, and as <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> through the car park in front of the office, East Slope Bar is to the right. This bar is probably the most [...] "pub-like" [...] of the bars on campus and is generally very lively in the evenings. On many weekday and weekend nights there is live music or a DJ set.|$|E
50|$|As <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> towards Mt. Achasan {{from the}} summit of Yongmasan, {{you will find the}} ruins of a small fort of the Goguryeo era (BC37~AD668) built at a {{strategic}} point overlooking the area of Jungnangcheon Stream. On the way up, you will find numerous observation platforms from which one can see a great view of some of the landmarks of Seoul such as the Hangang Bridge, Mt. Namsan, 63 City building, and Gangnam COEX.|$|E
5000|$|In North American {{media of}} later decades, [...] "Main Street" [...] {{represents}} {{the interests of}} everyday people and small business owners, in contrast with [...] "Wall Street" [...] (in the United States) or [...] "Bay Street" [...] (in Canada), symbolizing the interests of large national corporations. Thus, in the 1949 movie adaptation of On The Town, the song [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>Down</b> Main Street With Me" [...] refers to small-town values and social life. Main Street Republicans, for example, see themselves as supporting those values as against urbane or [...] "Wall Street" [...] tendencies.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure Nat {{will look}} well after us," [...] Myra said confidently; [...] "besides, mamma, I {{am certain that}} <b>you</b> could not <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> there. <b>You</b> know <b>you</b> never do <b>walk,</b> and I cannot {{recollect}} your walking so far as you have done to-day." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'It isn't far to walk, sir. Perhaps some day, {{when the}} May-fly is gone off, {{and the fish}} won't rise awhile, <b>you</b> could <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> and see. I beg your pardon, sir, though, for {{thinking}} of such a thing. [...] They are not places fit for gentlemen, that's certain.' There was a staid irony in his tone, which Lancelot felt.|$|R
