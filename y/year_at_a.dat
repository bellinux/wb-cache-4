5|$|While {{traditionally}} the Sirens had been depicted as human–animal chimeras, Etty portrayed them as naked young women, {{on an island}} strewn with decaying corpses. The painting divided opinion {{at the time of}} its first exhibition, with some critics greatly admiring it while others derided it as tasteless and unpleasant. Possibly owing to its unusually large size, 442.5cm by 297cm (14ft 6in by 9ft 9in), the work initially failed to sell, and was bought later that <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> bargain price by the Manchester merchant Daniel Grant.

5|$|A {{temporary}} slipway {{was built}} at the New Admiralty Shipyard in January 1871 and construction of Novgorod, named after the city, began on 13 April. Using two shifts to speed construction, her hull was completed by 29 December, when the official keel-laying ceremony was held. Within two weeks it was disassembled, and the first shipment of parts arrived at Nikolaev on 2 April 1872. Reassembly began on a specially-prepared slipway eight days later. As there was no rail line between Saint Petersburg and Nikolaev, the components had to be railed to Odessa, where they were transshipped onto river barges and steamers. The boilers were too large {{and had to be}} shipped by freighter from the Baltic Sea to Odessa for transshipment. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of parts and the workforce's lack of experience; the ship was finally launched on 2 June 1873, with Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich in attendance. Novgorods guns were mounted in September, and she entered service the following <b>year,</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cost of 2,830,000 rubles.|$|E

After the marriage Sudirman lived at his father-in-law's house in Cilacap so he could save money for his own home. The couple went on to have three sons, Ahmad Tidarwono, Muhammad Teguh Bambang Tjahjadi, and Taufik Effendi, and four daughters, Didi Praptiastuti, Didi Sutjiati, Didi Pudjiati, and Titi Wahjuti Satyaningrum.|$|E

HBO's president Chris Albrecht said the network would have considered otherwise if the producers had been willing to lower the price of an episode to US$2million; but the running costs for the sizable cast, the all-on-location shooting and the number of episodes per season were too enormous for them.|$|E
