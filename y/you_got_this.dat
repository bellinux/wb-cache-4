500|$|Miss Rosa {{undertakes}} chemotherapy {{to treat}} her cancer which leaves her bald. Rosenblat did not shave her head for the role because she worried about other roles. She had to wear a silicone [...] "appliance" [...] {{on her head and}} neck. Each morning on set makeup artist Josh Turri made up the appliance onto her. The process would take approximately three hours and Turri added false beauty marks, eyebrows and small veins to complete Miss Rosa's look. Rosenblat described him as [...] "utterly brilliant and a perfectionist ... so <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> entirely organic sense that I was utterly bald and suffering [...] cancer." [...] While on set fellow actors and crew members incorrectly assumed she had shaved her head. The weather during filming also affected Miss Rosa's costumer. During warm weather crew shielded Rosenblat from the sun with umbrellas because the heat would cause the make up to crack. Other breaches were caused by perspiration and Turri would drain water from underneath the prosthetics prior to repairing it. At the end of each shoot it took Rosenblat 45 minutes to remove the appliance.|$|E
2500|$|I love Shakespeare. He wrote {{some of the}} rawest stories, man. I mean look at Romeo and Juliet. That's {{some serious}} ghetto shit. <b>You</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> guy Romeo from the Bloods who falls for Juliet, a female from the Crips, and {{everybody}} in both gangs is against them. So they have to sneak out and they end up dead for nothing. Real tragic stuff. And look how Shakespeare busts it up with Macbeth. He creates a tale about this king's wife who convinces a happy man to chase after her and kill her husband so he can take over the country. After he commits the murder, the dude starts having delusions just like in a Scarface song. I mean the king's wife just screws this guy's whole life up for nothing [...]|$|E
2500|$|Leykis denied {{allegations}} that the call {{was part of a}} hoax set up by the show, and producers turned over all information they had about the caller to police who began an investigation. Leykis discussed the confession on subsequent episodes of his show, urging listeners to phone a toll-free number if they had possibly relevant information, and offering a cash reward for information leading to conviction of the woman for murder. About a month later, former talk show host Geraldo Rivera asked Leykis about the incident on his Geraldo at Large syndicated television program. [...] Geraldo: [...] "So what was your first reaction when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> call?" [...] Leykis: [...] "I was shocked. You know, people call talk shows and say all kinds of things, but they never confess to murder." ...|$|E

6000|$|JULIA.--And {{you were}} always our best friend, Captain Touchit. When our misfortunes came, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> me <b>this</b> {{situation}} with Mrs. Milliken--and, and--don't you see?-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo, Portney!" [...] {{suddenly}} cried a {{voice to}} Earl, as he was walking around among the tents. [...] "I didn't know <b>you</b> had <b>got</b> <b>this</b> far." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{fair and}} true. And <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> young woman {{to show you}} the way, because she knows it so well and you know so little about it yourself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{he said to}} the {{question}} in her eyes, [...] "that's my room. <b>You</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> one--for your own. It's how people do now. People of our position.... There's no lock." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the reverse}} {{side of the}} wrapper which comes with this book, {{you will find a}} {{wonderful}} list of stories which you can buy at the same store where <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> book.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{tells me}} you're none too {{fit to be}} round alone; <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>this</b> thing on the brain. I guess you'd better be quiet," [...] said the policeman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not sich a chump as to do {{anything}} of that kind, old man. <b>You</b> <b>got</b> into <b>this</b> trouble through tryin' to help me, an' I'll stay right side of you till it's over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, marm, {{that you}} are a little more comfortable, perhaps you will tell me how as <b>you</b> <b>got</b> into <b>this</b> way, and you with a rich husband, as I well knows, to love and cherish you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no use {{talking to}} you," [...] she said impatiently. [...] "I {{believe you are}} homesick. That letter <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> morning looked suspicious. Anyhow, I hope you'll get over it before I get back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you {{are going}} to make it all the worse by being stupid," [...] cried the girl petulantly. [...] "Why can't you be nice, as you used to be before <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> silly notion into your head?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I look at it?" [...] his Majesty asked, and Rosina, {{all in a}} flutter, took it off {{and gave}} if to him. [...] "H'm!" [...] said the king. [...] "Very curious and pretty! May I ask you where <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this,</b> Rosina?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Englishman looked grave: [...] "And tell me," [...] he said, [...] "have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> {{anything}} in <b>this</b> place that may prove compromising {{to any of}} you?" ...|$|R
60|$|THE CALIFORNIAN (to MR. ROBERTS). Stranger, I'm sorry I <b>got</b> <b>you</b> into <b>this</b> scrape.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah yes, so you did; it {{was very}} good of you"--Nick remembered. [...] "I ought to have {{returned}} your visit or left a card or written my name--to have done something in Great Stanhope Street, oughtn't I? <b>You</b> hadn't <b>got</b> <b>this</b> new thing then, or I'd have 'called.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> {{beautiful}} 'Lyra Innocentium' for me? How {{very kind}} of you, Norman. It is just what I wished for. Such lovely binding--and those embossed edges to the leaves. Oh! they make a pattern as they open! I never saw anything like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Less of the Merchant Prince, my lad," [...] said Sally, firmly. [...] "You just confine {{yourself}} to explaining how <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> way, {{instead of taking}} up my valuable time telling me what you mean {{to do in the}} future. You've lost all your money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I cannot. She {{is the one}} comfort I have. Where am I {{going to}} find another woman who can make dresses like Anne--she saves me a hundred a year--I don't care if she flirted with fifty ticket collectors. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> story from Effie; the child ought to be whipped for tale-bearing, and I daresay {{that it is not}} true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know her, I tell you,' he continued. 'She {{was alive}} and hearty yesterday. It's {{impossible}} she can be dead; it's impossible <b>you</b> should have <b>got</b> <b>this</b> body fairly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I little {{know how}} <b>you</b> <b>got</b> into <b>this</b> fix, but I mean to find out," [...] said Marilla. [...] "Come {{right down to}} the kitchen--it's too cold up here--and tell me just what you've done. I've been expecting {{something}} queer for some time. <b>You</b> haven't <b>got</b> into any scrape for over two months, and I was sure another one was due. Now, then, {{what did you do to}} your hair?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} may say it has come {{especially}} to-day. We know now that <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>this</b> increase to your income, and nothing is any longer in doubt that we cannot ourselves settle. I need not say that my dearest wish is to remain here, but you know my mind upon that subject." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you how that is. I didn't want to speak of it but since you've brought it up: Chet Dashaway {{probably}} resents the fact that <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> new furniture down in the Cities instead of here. I didn't want to raise any objection at the time but----After all, I make my money here and they naturally expect me to spend it here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Pratt {{stared in}} dull surprise, which turned slowly to anger. [...] "What's {{the matter with}} you now?" [...] he roared. [...] "Damn you, anyway. You've upset my whole house with your crazy notions. Everything was moving along nicely till <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> bug of a big speech into your head, and then {{everything}} in my life turns topsy-turvy. To hell with you and your book! You can't use me to advertise yourself. I want you to understand that right now. I see your scheme, and it don't work with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|And then, as {{luck would}} have it, Grace Crawley got up and left the room. Lily still waited for a few minutes, and, in order that her {{patience}} might be thoroughly exercised, she said a word or two about her sister Bell; how the eldest child's whooping-cough was nearly well, and how the baby was doing wonderful things with its first tooth. But as Mrs. Dale had already seen Bell's letter, all this was not intensely interesting. At last Lily came to the point and asked her question. [...] "Mamma, from whom was that other letter which <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> morning?" ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know how}} <b>you</b> <b>got</b> hold of <b>this</b> letter, Lady Mereston. I agree with you, it is compromising. But Kate and Peter are dead now, and there's {{nothing to prevent}} me from telling the truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, that's {{a foolish}} question. S'posen <b>you</b> <b>got</b> the shop <b>this</b> very minute, an' {{wanted to write}} a letter, or figger up how much anythin' cost? What kind of a fist would you make of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know her, I tell you," [...] he continued. [...] "She {{was alive}} and hearty yesterday. It's {{impossible}} she can be dead; it's impossible <b>you</b> should have <b>got</b> <b>this</b> body fairly." ...|$|R
6000|$|But yet she much {{wished that}} the letter had never been written, and would have given very much {{to be able to}} put it out of the way without {{injustice}} to Lily. To her thinking it would be impossible that Lily should be happy in marrying such a man. Such a marriage now would be, as Mrs. Dale thought, a degradation to her daughter. A terrible injury had been done to her; but such reparation as this would, in Mrs. Dale's eyes, only make the injury deeper. And yet Lily loved the man; and, loving him, how could she resist the temptation of his offer? [...] "Mamma, from whom was that letter which <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> morning?" [...] Lily asked. For a few moments Mrs. Dale remained silent. [...] "Mamma," [...] continued Lily, [...] "I think I know whom it was from. If you tell me to ask nothing further, of course I will not." ...|$|E
5000|$|In his memoirs, Moiseev wrote: [...] "When in 15 years I visited Belarus again, I've {{noticed that}} my Bulba was being danced everywhere. I would ask them: 'Where have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> dance?' They would answer: 'It {{has always been}} around.' At the same time, folklorists assured me that this dance {{appeared}} in Belarus only after my choreography. If your creation is accepted by folk so as to consider it to be their own, {{this would be the}} highest form of the recognition!" ...|$|E
50|$|The Head of the U.N. Humanitarian Assistance Team {{realized}} that the U.N. {{did not have a}} body bag and was forced to make one from a light blue UNICEF tarp and tape:You wanna do it right. You want to … zip it, but <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> UN light-blue body bag, and we're going to make and fold the edges over. And we're folding them up, and the creases aren't right, because his feet are so damn big. … And you don't want that for him. You want it to be like, you know, just laid out perfectly. So that when people look at him, they know that he was something great.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{them all}} below," [...] he said, turning to his men. [...] "Put the {{heaviest}} irons <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> on <b>this</b> fellow, and fasten them with staples into the deck.|$|R
60|$|SHE. Can't you? Well, I can. I can see Georgina rubbing those poems into Teddy. [Facing him determinedly] And I tell you, Henry Apjohn, that <b>you</b> <b>got</b> me into <b>this</b> mess; and {{you must}} {{get me out of}} it again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Right {{this minute}} he's our cook," [...] drawled Long Jim, [...] "and we ain't exactly {{particular}} about going hungry to please {{a bunch of}} strangers. Cut it short, Mister. If <b>you</b> ain't <b>got</b> a warrant, <b>you</b> ain't <b>got</b> <b>this</b> man. Maybe we don't sport finger-bowls and silk socks, but we're civilised enough not to let no slim dude walk off with one of our boys without proper authority. So you can just meander along back where you come from. Ain't that right, boys?" ...|$|R
