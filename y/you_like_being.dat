500|$|The celebration proved popular, {{and when}} the Queen {{came of age in}} 1898, her inauguration was {{postponed}} a week to 6 September so as not to interfere with Koninginnedag. [...] The annual holiday fell {{on the final day of}} school summer vacation, which made it popular among schoolchildren. It is uncertain how much Wilhelmina enjoyed the festivities; although writer Mike Peek, in a 2011 magazine article about Koninginnedag, suggests she was enthusiastic, there is a story of Wilhelmina, after a tired return from one of these birthday processions, making her doll bow until the toy's hair was dishevelled, and telling it, [...] "Now you shall sit in a carriage and bow until your back aches, and see how much <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a Queen!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The book {{includes}} more than 50 letters written to the First Pets by children and more than 80 photographs of Socks and Buddy. [...] Examples of questions that letters asked include, [...] "Who do you like best? Mr. Clinton? Mrs. Clinton or Chelsea?" [...] and, [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a dog, Buddy? I like being a person." [...] Socks was also {{asked if he was}} allowed to watch MTV and both pets were also asked if they ever got petted by the Spice Girls.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> alone?" [...] {{said the}} hunter, after a pause, during which Bladud {{saw that he}} was eyeing him keenly, though he pretended not to observe this.|$|R
6000|$|... "How'd <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> hog-tied?" [...] queried his conqueror, rubbing Baldy's nose. [...] "Now, {{after this}} you'll have some manners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Juxtaposition--or you {{may call}} it propinquity--or, if <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> <b>being</b> rather too near for one {{maintaining}} the position of an ideal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, Miss Brangwen,' she said, in her {{slightly}} whining, insinuating voice, 'and how do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> {{back in the}} old place, then?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good. I {{will take}} your word for it, {{and you can go}} in and come out as <b>you</b> <b>like</b> without <b>being</b> watched, and you need not fear that we shall pay you another visit." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clementina began again, {{and again}} Milray stopped her. [...] "You mustn't bear malice. I {{can hear the}} grudge in your voice; but I didn't mean to laugh at <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> made fun of, do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{it seems}} to me so different," [...] he said sadly, [...] "{{it seems to}} me you can live your own life, and be independent, and think as <b>you</b> <b>like</b> without <b>being</b> choked with harassments. I feel as if I could keep on—like that——" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{good to see}} you again, Josie," [...] said O'Gorman, as they seated {{themselves}} on the bench. [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a sleuth?" ...|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. Oh, if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> hurt, all right. I'll {{hurt you}} as much as you like, without any extra charge for the {{beneficial}} effect on your character.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come and {{sit next}} me, uncle," [...] Clara cried, [...] "and {{tell me how}} <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> {{guardian}} to an heiress. How I have blessed that dear departed aunt of mine {{every day of my}} life." ...|$|E

6000|$|Winifred {{looked at}} him disapprovingly. [...] "Civilization," [...] she said, [...] "implies responsibility. You can't live just as <b>you</b> <b>like</b> without its <b>being</b> {{detrimental}} to the community." ...|$|R
6000|$|Staniford laughed. [...] "I {{see that}} it isn't the other world that's got hold of you! It's this world! I don't believe you'll be unhappy in Italy. But it's {{pleasant}} to think you've been so contented on the Aroostook that you hate to leave it. I don't believe there's {{a man on the}} ship that wouldn't feel personally flattered to know that <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> here. Even that poor fellow who parted from us at Messina was anxious that you should think as kindly of him as you could. He knew that he had behaved in a way to shock you, and he was very sorry. He left a message with me for you. He thought <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> to know that he was ashamed of himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let me hear no abuse. Your boy is {{not likely}} to behave well, if you set him the example of being saucy.' Then stooping down to Master Fodge, and taking him by the shoulder, 'Do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> beaten?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Hello, Curiosity,' says I. 'Get still {{a minute}} and let's {{have a look at}} your freakship. How do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> the willopus-wallopus or the bim-bam from Borneo, or {{whatever}} name you are denounced by in the side-show business?' ...|$|E
6000|$|RUFIO (to Cleopatra). We {{shall have}} to go away {{presently}} and cut some of your Egyptians' heads off. How will <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> left here with the chance of being captured by that little brother of yours if we are beaten? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What's beautiful?" [...] cried Sir Isaac in protesting scorn. [...] "What's noble? ROT! Doing {{your duty}} if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> and <b>being</b> sensible, that's noble and beautiful, but not {{fretting}} about and running yourself into danger. You've {{got to have}} a sense of humour, Elly, in this life----" [...] He created a quotation. [...] "As you make your bed--so shall you lie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not--if {{it means}} {{what it sounds}} as if it did," [...] Jacob replied. [...] "I am asked here because I am very rich and because the Marquis is {{interested}} in money-making schemes. Do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a nursery governess?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} fine for you," [...] said Mildred. [...] "You don't {{have any of}} the disagreeable part of it. How would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> kept awake for an hour {{in the middle of the}} night because her ladyship wouldn't go to sleep?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is known}} from Tarleton Four Corners to Harwich," [...] said Cynthia, [...] "all that distance.

30|$|Gambling {{drives a}} wedge in your {{relationship}} and pulls it apart, and it becomes destructive. <b>You</b> feel <b>like</b> they’re <b>being</b> unfaithful to you, because it takes up such {{a huge part of}} the relationship (Jill).|$|R

60|$|This, however, he {{also got}} used to, {{when he saw}} that they could never hit him, and in this way he flew about all that year, until the troll called him home again, said some strange words to him, and gave him his human shape again. 'Well, how did <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a raven?' said the troll.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--existence!" [...] the Prince vaguely commented. [...] "You think I {{ought to}} argue for more than mere existence?" [...] she asked. [...] "I don't see why MY existence--even reduced as much as <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to <b>being</b> merely mine--should be so impossible. There are things, of sorts, I {{should be able to}} have--things I should be able to be. The {{position}} of a single woman to-day is very favourable, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} as well for you to remember, Grandcourt, that you are coming under closer fire now. There can be none of the {{ordinary}} flirting done, which may mean everything or nothing. You must {{make up your mind}} whether you wish to be accepted; and more than that, how <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>being</b> refused. Either one or the other. You can't be philandering after her again for six weeks." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I am {{sometimes}} seen {{as somebody}} who exaggerates when I say that Croatia is about to surrender its independence so I shall let the Croatian people make that judgment. Unfortunately, {{they have not yet}} been consulted directly. I just hope that that consultation will be carried out freely and fairly.
