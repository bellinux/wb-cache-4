5|$|<b>Ytterbium</b> {{is found}} with other rare earth {{elements}} in several rare minerals. It is most often recovered commercially from monazite sand (0.03% <b>ytterbium).</b> The element {{is also found in}} euxenite and xenotime. The main mining areas are China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. Reserves of <b>ytterbium</b> are estimated as one million tonnes. <b>Ytterbium</b> is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths, but ion-exchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the mid- to late 20th century have simplified separation. Compounds of <b>ytterbium</b> are rare and have not yet been well characterized. The abundance of <b>ytterbium</b> in the Earth's crust is about 3mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ytterbium</b> metal tarnishes {{slowly in}} air. Finely {{dispersed}} <b>ytterbium</b> readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen. Mixtures of powdered <b>ytterbium</b> with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald-green flame. <b>Ytterbium</b> reacts with hydrogen to form various non-stoichiometric hydrides. <b>Ytterbium</b> dissolves slowly in water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>ytterbium</b> {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} {{airtight}} containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of <b>ytterbium</b> are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, <b>ytterbium</b> compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic <b>ytterbium</b> dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. <b>Ytterbium</b> fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
5|$|As an even-numbered lanthanide, in {{accordance}} with the Oddo-Harkins rule, <b>ytterbium</b> is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors, thulium and lutetium, which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0.5% each. The world production of <b>ytterbium</b> is only about 50 tonnes per year, reflecting that it has few commercial applications. Microscopic traces of <b>ytterbium</b> are used as a dopant in the , a solid-state laser in which <b>ytterbium</b> is the element that undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} and physical properties of <b>ytterbium</b> {{could not be}} determined with any precision until 1953, when the first nearly pure <b>ytterbium</b> metal was produced by using ion-exchange processes. The price of <b>ytterbium</b> was relatively stable between 1953 and 1998 at about US $1,000/kg.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{behavior of}} <b>ytterbium</b> {{is similar to}} that of the rest of the lanthanides. Most <b>ytterbium</b> compounds are found in the +3 oxidation state, and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless. Like europium, samarium, and thulium, the trihalides of <b>ytterbium</b> can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen, zinc dust, or by the addition of metallic <b>ytterbium.</b> The +2 oxidation state occurs only in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds; for example, ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) shows the same structure as calcium oxide (CaO).|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of <b>ytterbium</b> {{range in}} atomic weight from 147.9674 {{atomic mass unit}} (u) for 148Yb to 180.9562u for 181Yb. The primary decay mode of <b>ytterbium</b> isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope, 174Yb, is electron capture, and the primary decay mode for those heavier than 174Yb is beta decay. The primary decay products of <b>ytterbium</b> isotopes lighter than 174Yb are thulium isotopes, and the primary decay products of <b>ytterbium</b> isotopes with heavier than 174Yb are lutetium isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ytterbium</b> +3 ion {{is used as}} a doping {{material}} in active laser media, specifically in solid state lasers and double clad fiber lasers. <b>Ytterbium</b> lasers are highly efficient, have long lifetimes and can generate short pulses; <b>ytterbium</b> can also easily be incorporated into the material used to make the laser. <b>Ytterbium</b> lasers commonly radiate in the 1.06–1.12µm band being optically pumped at wavelength 900nm–1µm, dependently on the host and application. The small quantum defect makes <b>ytterbium</b> a prospective dopant for efficient lasers and power scaling.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ytterbium</b> {{can also}} be used as a dopant to help improve the grain refinement, strength, and other {{mechanical}} properties of stainless steel. Some <b>ytterbium</b> alloys have rarely been used in dentistry.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the other rare-earth metals, which usually have antiferromagnetic and/or ferromagnetic properties at low temperatures, <b>ytterbium</b> is paramagnetic at temperatures above 1.0 kelvin. However, the alpha allotrope is diamagnetic. With a melting point of 824°C and a boiling point of 1196°C, <b>ytterbium</b> has the smallest liquid range of all the metals.|$|E
5|$|Natural <b>ytterbium</b> is {{a mixture}} of seven stable isotopes, which {{altogether}} are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of the minerals monazite, euxenite, and xenotime. The <b>ytterbium</b> concentration is low because it is found only among many other rare earth elements; moreover, it is among the least abundant. Once extracted and prepared, <b>ytterbium</b> is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant. The metal is a fire and explosion hazard.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ytterbium</b> metal {{increases}} its {{electrical resistivity}} when subjected to high stresses. This property {{is used in}} stress gauges to monitor ground deformations from earthquakes and explosions.|$|E
5|$|A pair of {{experimental}} atomic clocks based on <b>ytterbium</b> atoms at the National Institute of Standards and Technology {{has set a}} record for stability. NIST physicists reported in the August 22, 2013 issue of Science Express that the <b>ytterbium</b> clocks' ticks are stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion (1 followed by 18 zeros), roughly 10 times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks. The clocks would be accurate within a second for a period comparable {{to the age of}} the universe.|$|E
5|$|Although usually trivalent, <b>ytterbium</b> readily forms {{divalent}} compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution. <b>Ytterbium</b> metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the French chemist Georges Urbain {{separated}} Marignac's ytterbia {{into two}} components: neoytterbia and lutecia. Neoytterbia later {{became known as}} the element <b>ytterbium,</b> and lutecia {{became known as the}} element lutetium. The Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time, but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium; the American chemist Charles James also independently isolated these elements at about the same time. Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party. The Commission on Atomic Mass, consisting of Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Georges Urbain, which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, {{based on the fact that}} the separation of lutetium from Marignac's <b>ytterbium</b> was first described by Urbain. After Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to <b>ytterbium.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} <b>ytterbium</b> from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. <b>Ytterbium</b> can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|E
5|$|Natural <b>ytterbium</b> is {{composed}} of seven stable isotopes: 168Yb, 170Yb, 171Yb, 172Yb, 173Yb, 174Yb, and 176Yb, with 174Yb being the most common, at 31.8% of the natural abundance). 27 radioisotopes have been observed, with the most stable ones being 169Yb with a half-life of 32.0 days, 175Yb with a half-life of 4.18 days, and 166Yb with a half-life of 56.7 hours. All of its remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are {{less than two hours}} and most of these have half-lives are less than 20 minutes. <b>Ytterbium</b> also has 12 meta states, with the most stable being 169mYb (t1/2 46 seconds).|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium, {{like all}} of the {{lanthanides}} (except lanthanum, <b>ytterbium,</b> and lutetium, which have no unpaired 4f electrons), is paramagnetic at room temperature. Unlike some other rare-earth metals, which show antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures, praseodymium is paramagnetic at all temperatures above 1K.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ytterbium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolYb and atomic number70. It is the fourteenth and penultimate {{element in the}} lanthanide series, which {{is the basis of}} the relative stability of its +2 oxidation state. However, like the other lanthanides, its most common oxidation state is +3, as in its oxide, halides, and other compounds. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble <b>ytterbium</b> compounds form complexes with nine water molecules. Because of its closed-shell electron configuration, its density and melting and boiling points differ significantly from those of most other lanthanides.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ytterbium</b> is a soft, {{malleable}} and ductile {{chemical element}} that displays a bright silvery luster when pure. It {{is a rare}} earth element, and it is readily dissolved by the strong mineral acids. It reacts slowly with cold water and it oxidizes slowly in air.|$|E
5|$|Currently, <b>ytterbium</b> {{is being}} {{investigated}} as a possible replacement for magnesium in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic infrared decoy flares. As ytterbium(III) oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the infrared range than magnesium oxide, a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV).|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the Dubna team {{carried out}} {{chemical}} experiments on element 102 {{and concluded that}} it behaved as the heavier homologue of <b>ytterbium.</b> The Russian scientists proposed the name joliotium (Jo) for the new element after Irène Joliot-Curie, who had recently died, creating an element naming controversy {{that would not be}} resolved for several decades, which each group using its own proposed names.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, nobelium is located {{to the right}} of the actinide mendelevium, to the left of the actinide lawrencium, and below the lanthanide <b>ytterbium.</b> Nobelium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities, and bulk preparation is currently impossible. Nevertheless, a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes of hafnium and {{lutetium}} (along with <b>ytterbium)</b> {{are also}} used in isotope geochemistry and geochronological applications. It is often used as a tracer of isotopic evolution of Earth’s mantle through time. This is because 176Lu decays to 176Hf with a half-life of approximately 37 billion years.|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of thulium {{range from}} 145Tm to 179Tm. The primary decay mode before {{the most abundant}} stable isotope, 169Tm, is electron capture, and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay products before 169Tm are element 68 (erbium) isotopes, and the primary products after are element 70 (<b>ytterbium)</b> isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Visible light waves {{oscillate}} {{faster than}} microwaves, and therefore optical clocks {{can be more}} precise than caesium atomic clocks. The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt is working on several such optical clocks. The model with one single <b>ytterbium</b> ion caught in an ion trap is highly accurate. The optical clock based on it is exact to 17 digits after the decimal point.|$|E
5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} nobelium behaves as a heavier homolog to <b>ytterbium</b> in the periodic table. The chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known: they are mostly only known in aqueous solution. Before nobelium's discovery, {{it was predicted that}} it would show a stable +2 oxidation state as well as the +3 state characteristic of the other actinides: these predictions were later confirmed, as the +2 state is much more stable than the +3 state in aqueous solution {{and it is difficult to}} keep nobelium in the +3 state.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium, {{derived from}} the Latin Lutetia (Paris), was {{independently}} discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. They found it as an impurity in ytterbia, which was thought by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac to consist entirely of <b>ytterbium.</b> The scientists proposed different names for the elements: Urbain chose neoytterbium and lutecium, whereas Welsbach chose aldebaranium and cassiopeium (after Aldebaran and Cassiopeia). Both of these articles accused the other man of publishing results based on those of the author.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>ytterbium</b> halides {{are used}} as {{reagents}} in organic synthesis. For example, ytterbium(III) chloride (YbCl3) is a Lewis acid {{and can be used}} as a catalyst in the Aldol and Diels–Alder reactions. Ytterbium(II) iodide (YbI2) may be used, like samarium(II) iodide, as a reducing agent for coupling reactions. Ytterbium(III) fluoride (YbF3) is used as an inert and non-toxic tooth filling as it continuously releases fluoride ions, which are good for dental health, and is also a good X-ray contrast agent.|$|E
5|$|The International Commission on Atomic Weights, {{which was}} then {{responsible}} for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, {{based on the fact}} that the separation of lutetium from Marignac's <b>ytterbium</b> was first described by Urbain; after Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to <b>ytterbium.</b> Until the 1950s, some German-speaking chemists called lutetium by Welsbach's name, cassiopeium; in 1949, the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. The reason for this was that Welsbach's 1907 samples of lutetium had been pure, while Urbain's 1907 samples only contained traces of lutetium. This later misled Urbain into thinking that he had discovered element 72, which he named celtium, which was actually very pure lutetium. The later discrediting of Urbain's work on element 72 led to a reappraisal of Welsbach's work on element 71, so that the element was renamed to cassiopeium in German-speaking countries for some time. Charles James, who stayed out of the priority argument, worked on a much larger scale and possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time. Pure lutetium metal was first produced in 1953.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ytterbium</b> is {{separated}} from other rare earths either by ion exchange or by reduction with sodium amalgam. In the latter method, a buffered acidic solution of trivalent rare earths is treated with molten sodium-mercury alloy, which reduces and dissolves Yb3+. The alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid. The metal is extracted from the solution as oxalate and converted to oxide by heating. The oxide is reduced to metal by heating with lanthanum, aluminium, cerium or zirconium in high vacuum. The metal is purified by sublimation and collected over a condensed plate.|$|E
5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and <b>ytterbium,</b> strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and <b>ytterbium,</b> calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve even higher power levels in ytterbium-based fiber systems. all factors of the fiber must be considered. These can be {{achieved}} only via optimization of all the <b>ytterbium</b> fiber parameters, ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties, {{in order to reduce}} the splice losses within the cavity. Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity. The optimization of the ytterbium-doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber, and improved photodarkening performance, all of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 µm systems.|$|E
5|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in the power scaling lasers and amplifiers produced with <b>ytterbium</b> (Yb) doped optical fibers. Power levels have increased from the 1kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb-doped fibers. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities (M2<1.1) at power levels of 1.5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~1064 nm in a broadband configuration. Ytterbium-doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter, which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering and stimulated Raman scattering, which limit the achievement of higher power levels, and provide a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium-doped fibers.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium {{can form}} alloys and {{intermediate}} compounds with most other metals. Exceptions include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals; and magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium of the alkaline earth metals; and europium and <b>ytterbium</b> {{of the rare}} earth metals. Partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and tungsten, which are soluble in liquid plutonium, but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium. Gallium, aluminium, americium, scandium and cerium can stabilize the δ phase of plutonium for room temperature. Silicon, indium, zinc and zirconium allow formation of metastable δ state when rapidly cooled. High amounts of hafnium, holmium and thallium also allows some retention of the δ phase at room temperature. Neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the α phase at higher temperatures.|$|E
