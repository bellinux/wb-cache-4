5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Mari√†, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; <b>you</b> <b>taught</b> us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E
500|$|Knowles {{commented on}} the song, [...] "It's energetic, {{aggressive}} and filled with hard beats". She explained that the album was completed in three weeks, which is the reason most of the record, including [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] sounds aggressive. She further clarified {{that she did not}} intend to write an angry song, [...] "Swizz's [...] had that tough vibe, like the guy had cheated, and I wanted to write something honest. If you're in a relationship, even if the man's cheating and you end up not wanting him, the thought of another woman benefiting from the lessons <b>you</b> <b>taught</b> him." [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] features Knowles as the female protagonist impersonating a threatened woman involved in a love triangle. She is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from all the efforts she put on to make her lover a better man. Frances Romero of Time magazine noted that Knowles' anger is due to her man's wandering eye, her desire to leave, and the thought of having to give him up to some unworthy woman.|$|E
2500|$|Not yet {{formally}} {{nominated for}} the Vice Presidency, John Edwards took the stage at the Convention to give the first major national speech of his political career. Delegates raised red-and-white vertical [...] "Edwards" [...] banners and chanted his name. The theme of Edwards's address was the divide between the [...] "two Americas," [...] his populist message throughout the primary campaign and now one embraced by Kerry. He tied the division to his own roots in North Carolina, and introduced his family to the audience. Edwards addressed his parents from the podium: [...] "You taught me the values that I carry in my heart: faith, family, responsibility, opportunity for everyone. <b>You</b> <b>taught</b> me that there's dignity and honor in a hard day's work. <b>You</b> <b>taught</b> me to always look out for our neighbors, to never look down on anybody, and treat everybody with respect." ...|$|E

2500|$|Williams' first music album, Nobody Nowhere, {{appeared}} in 2000 with Paul Farrer. Two tracks, [...] "Sometimes" [...] and [...] "Beyond the When", {{feature in the}} Tokyo Broadcasting System Television series, Things <b>You</b> <b>Taught</b> Me (2000). The 12-part series follows {{the life of an}} autistic woman developing her human interaction skills. In July 2005, she followed with a second album, Mutation. It was recorded with Akash, an Australian music composer, producer and arranger. Both albums feature music and lyrics by Williams with the second also including her spoken word poetry. Williams was a self-taught painter, beginning in adulthood. She was also a sculptor and has completed life-sized sculptures.|$|E
2500|$|Limestone Lad was {{scheduled}} to be offered for sale as a three-year-old gelding at Tattersalls Ireland in June 1995, but was withdrawn from the auction after the auctioneer's vet found that he had an abnormal heartbeat. The gelding was officially trained throughout his racing career by James Bowe, although the day-to-day handling was managed by his son Michael on the family farm which was also home to 60 cattle and 150 sheep. Commenting on the process of training the horse Michael Bowe said [...] "Everything <b>you</b> <b>taught</b> him, you had to do it slowly and carefully - but once he picked it up he would die or do it. He was so genuine, all {{he wanted to do was}} to please you". [...] He was often subjected to demanding schedules, with few breaks: Bowe explained the strategy by saying [...] "He is happiest racing frequently and the more you take him racing the more he likes it".|$|E
2500|$|Seemingly finding {{parenting}} difficult, Henry Sr. mostly bonded {{with his}} son through their mutual fascination with history. After {{the death of his}} wife Anna from influenza, the gulf between father and son grew {{to the point where they}} rarely spoke. Henry claims that he taught his son [...] "self reliance" [...] this way, while Indiana felt that his father simply cared more about his intellectual pursuits than he did about his own son, saying [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>taught</b> me, was that I was less important to you than some people who'd been dead for 500 years in another country." [...] To Indiana's constant exasperation, Henry refers to his son only as [...] "Junior" [...] (ironically, Indiana does the same thing to his own son), until the end of The Last Crusade when he finally calls him [...] "Indiana". As he was not a hands-on father, Indiana resented his father's aloof, distant nature, which may have influenced his own inability to settle down and start a family for much of his life, and also resented his father's lifelong pursuit of the quest for the Holy Grail. When Henry explains that the search for the Grail is [...] "a race against evil", Indy lashes out at him: [...] "This is an obsession, Dad! I never understood it! Never!" [...] Because of aloofness as a father, Indy embraced his father's friend Marcus Brody as a father figure and role model. Another factor which deteriorated Indiana and Henry's relationship was Indiana going off to enlist in the Belgian Army for World War I in 1916 without his father's consent, and the two went three years without seeing each other.|$|E
