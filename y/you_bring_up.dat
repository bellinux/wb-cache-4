2500|$|As scripted by writer Rockne S. O'Bannon, Alien Nation was {{originally}} called, Future Tense. The film {{took some of}} its concept from the TV series In the Heat of the Night, with science fiction elements integrated in the plot. During production, the film had a working title called, Outer Heat, which essentially was an amalgam of In the Heat of the Night and a 1960s science fiction TV series, The Outer Limits. Jack Collis emphasized that the film was not a [...] "space epic" [...] but more of an action film. He admitted, [...] "We did build a spaceship, but it's a simple thing that you see on a TV monitor describing the landing of the aliens several years ago, before they became assimilated into our society. It gives us a background {{but not a lot}} of detail, ..." [...] Collis noted that the film was even [...] "reminiscent of the work I did in Cocoon." [...] An earlier draft of the film was actually written by director James Cameron in 1987, but his name however, was not credited in the final cut of the film. One conceit of the script was that immigrations officials ran out of names for the 300,000 aliens, and began to name them after familiar appellations of the past. Actor Mandy Patinkin's original name for his character was set to be George Jetson. However, three days before the start of shooting, Hanna-Barbera wouldn't allow the name to be used. Expressing his disappointment, Patinkin said, [...] "I assumed that the name of the character I agreed to play was George Jetson. And I was pretty pissed off that there was a screw-up and that the name couldn't be used." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I thought it made a tremendous difference to the piece that the guy's name was George Jetson because it gave a cartoon feeling, an innocence that was important to the movie's whole idea. It's a great loss to the piece that we couldn't recover, a great misfortune that couldn't be solved. It would have helped a lot." [...] In reference to the cartoon character, the producers would leave in the name [...] "George" [...] as a substitute. Patinkin added, [...] "Everything in the script is Jetson, everything on the makeup is labeled Jetson, we always refer to him as Jetson. Not even George, but Jetson. So in our minds, he's George Jetson. So as far as I'm concerned, anybody who sees the movie, they're watching George Jetson no matter what the hell they call him." [...] To understand his role of being a police officer, Patinkin spent two weeks hanging out with the New York City Police Department. He took their training course, joined them on patrol, and spent time with them at the firing range. Commenting on the character development of Francisco, he said [...] "It's one of the better jobs that people from his race have acquired. He feels very {{proud of the fact that}} he's able to be a cop." [...] In 2013, when asked about his role in the film, Caan initially replied, [...] "Why would <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> that?" [...] before stating, [...] "Yeah, well, I don’t know. I don’t have too many... I mean, I loved Mandy Patinkin. Mandy was a riot. But... I don’t know. It was a lot of silly stuff, creatively. And we had this English director who I wasn’t really that fond of. I mean, nice guy, but... it was just one of those things where, you know, you don’t quit, you get through it. It certainly wasn’t one of... I wouldn’t write it down as one of my favorite movies. But it was pretty popular." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the {{commencement}} of the change," [...] he said. [...] "After this I'll pitch every bottle <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> from the settlement into the river." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Giant, <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> that camp-fire," [...] said Snap. We'll want it here later. Bring {{all those}} half-burnt logs, too, so that we'll {{have plenty of}} firewood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, bother his shoes!" [...] said Charley, in a {{voice of}} great disappointment. [...] "Why didn't <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> him <b>up</b> without shoes, man, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{what are}} <b>you</b> <b>bringing</b> that <b>up</b> here for?" [...] he asked. [...] "Have you been diving; for I see your clothes are {{dripping}} with water?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am. But I think I won't {{come down}} to-night. Will <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> supper <b>up</b> on a tray, and I'll {{have a cup}} of tea as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now for {{the remains}} of our supper, father," [...] Dick said, [...] "and that big water jug. I will carry them up. Ned, do <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> that long coil of thin rope." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Coulter," [...] he said, [...] "the enemy has twelve pieces {{over there}} on the next ridge. If I rightly {{understand}} the general, he directs that <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> a gun and engage them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Here, fellow!' cried Saxon, seizing a trooper by the arm. 'Make for the rear! Gallop {{as though}} the devil were behind <b>you!</b> <b>Bring</b> <b>up</b> a pair of {{ammunition}} waggons, and we shall see whether we cannot bridge this infernal puddle.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I hadn't {{intended}} to, {{but since}} <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> it <b>up</b> yourself, I don't mind saying the grocery bills are about twice what {{they ought to}} be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no; we must simply {{tell him}} {{that they are not}} {{intended}} for small boys. If <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> him <b>up</b> properly, after that he won t touch them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you already}} have the Commander's chickens--which <b>you</b> are <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> as swans, by the way," [...] said Hurlstone mischievously. [...] "You wouldn't surely abandon the nest again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{driven to}} the last ditch, Anne, when <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> Miss Cornelia as a reinforcement. She will say, 'Just like a man,' and rage furiously. No matter. This is no affair for Miss Cornelia to settle. Leslie alone must decide it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not for long, I imagine," [...] I replied; [...] "so let us make haste. I will go first, and <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> the rear, with Woola between. Come," [...] {{and with}} the words I dashed forward, across the fetid mass of putrefaction.|$|E
60|$|If <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> your {{children}} {{in a way which}} puts them out of sympathy with the religious feelings of the nation in which they live, the chances are, that they will ultimately turn out ruffians or fanatics--and one as likely as the other.|$|E
50|$|Seven decades later, Eppinga {{said she}} {{finds that the}} topic of what {{happened}} at Papago Park still brings mixed reactions. “There’s still feelings, if <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> it <b>up,</b> of what was wrong or right in the case,” she said.|$|R
60|$|MRS WARREN. No: I'd <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to {{be a real}} {{daughter}} to me, and not what you are now, with your pride and your prejudices and the college education you stole from me: yes, stole: deny it if you can: what was it but stealing? I'd <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> in my own house, I would.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing. But {{that time}} is past. I couldn't recall it if I wished. Why did <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> it <b>up?</b> You've broken your word. You know I wouldn't have let you keep coming here if you hadn't promised never to refer to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will but {{dispose of}} this young fellow," [...] said Claverhouse, {{from the other side}} of the hall, [...] "and then, Lord Evandale--I am sorry to {{interrupt}} again your conversation--but then we must mount.--Bothwell, why do not <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> the prisoner? and, hark ye, let two files load their carabines." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you for {{thinking}} of it, Tim, but we dine with the general. When {{you have got}} the horses comfortable, and lit your fire, one of <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> our cloaks to the house. Keep the horses' saddles on, with loosened girths. We may want them suddenly, at any moment of the night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, gentlemen, we {{had better}} go to our posts," [...] the Major said. [...] "Doolan, please place your watch on the {{platforms}} by the wall. I will take my party up onto the terrace. Doctor, will <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> some of those rockets you made the other day? We must try {{and find out what}} they are doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I {{could never}} have a dolly like that," [...] she said. [...] "She must cost an awful lot. But it's enough {{just to look at}} her. Tommy, will <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> me <b>up</b> here every day just to look at her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May I ask <b>you</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> some herbs {{from the}} farm garden to make a savory omelet? Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley. I will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelet," [...] said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; tell Miss Anty {{to make me}} a cup of tea, and do <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> it <b>up</b> here." [...] This was a feeler. If {{anything}} was the matter with Anty, Terry would be sure to tell him now; but he only said, [...] "Yis, yer honer," [...] and retreated.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This must be stopped,' said Saxon curtly. 'We cannot {{afford to}} insult and estray the whole Church of England to please a few hot-headed ranters. The pillage of this Cathedral would do our cause {{more harm than}} a pitched battle lost. Do <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> your company, Sir Gervas, and we shall {{do what we can}} to hold them in check until they come.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> {{his name}} at every turn?" [...] asked Zenobia in an undertone, {{and with a}} malign look which wandered from my face to Priscilla's. [...] "You know not what you do! It is dangerous, sir, believe me, to tamper thus with earnest human passions, out of your own mere idleness, and for your sport. I will endure it no longer! Take care {{that it does not}} happen again! I warn you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No, {{that was}} not my thought,” he began again. “There {{is no doubt about}} you knowing your business—no doubt at all; and that’s {{precisely}} why I—” He stopped short, and changing his tone: “What could <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> against Michaelis of a definite nature? I mean apart {{from the fact that the}} two men under suspicion—you’re certain there were two of them—came last from a railway station within three miles of the village where Michaelis is living now.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lige," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, putting up his feet, [...] "do you {{remember}} the French toys <b>you</b> used to <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> here from New Orleans?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is the well-spring of truth, but <b>you</b> can't <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> {{the whole}} well with one bucket"--and she added, [...] "I know his average, {{therefore}} he never deceives me. I discount him thirty per cent. for embroidery, {{and what is}} left is perfect and priceless truth, without a flaw in it anywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} by {{the expression}} of your countenance," [...] continued the other, [...] "that I am expected to speak. I had no more to say, than to make the simple suggestion that your plan would be {{most likely to be}} executed, were I to lead the van, and were <b>you</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> the rear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be {{careful when}} <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> ashore. Let the men row very gently, after they once get away, {{so as not}} to attract any attention. Let them take cutlasses, but no pistols. If a shot were fired the {{batteries}} would be sure, at once, there was some mischief going on. A little shouting won't matter so much; it might be merely a quarrel. Of course, the instant you are on board you will cut the cables, and get up sail.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may bring}} my harness from below," [...] said Sir Nigel to his squires, [...] "and also, I pray <b>you,</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> Sir Oliver's {{and we shall}} don it here. Ye may then see to your own gear; for this day you will, I hope, make a very honorable {{entrance}} into the field of chivalry, and prove yourselves to be very worthy and valiant squires. And now, Sir Oliver, as to our dispositions: would it please you that I should order them or will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, by the way, so he was. The time's {{getting on}} too," [...] said his lordship, {{looking at his}} watch. [...] "But he only got to Diplow the other day. He came to us on Tuesday {{and said he had}} been a little bothered. He may have been pulled in another direction. Why, Gascoigne!"--the rector was just then {{crossing}} at a little distance with Gwendolen on his arm, and turned in compliance with the call--"this is a little too bad; you not only beat us yourself, but <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> your niece to beat all the archeresses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely she can," [...] John Petersham said. [...] "The squire dines at five. If <b>you</b> will <b>bring</b> her <b>up</b> at six, I {{will take}} her in to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it {{possible}} Nature can {{have made such}} a fault?" [...] said Charles. [...] "Can she have left so curious a piece as thou art without the melody of voice, whilst she has made thee so exquisitely sensible to the beauty of sound?--Stay: what means this? and what young fellow are <b>you</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> there? Oh, {{the master of the}} show, I suppose.--Friend," [...] he added, addressing himself to Peveril, who, on the signal of Fenella, stepped forward almost instinctively, and kneeled down, [...] "we thank thee for the pleasure of this morning.--My Lord Marquis, you rooked me at piquet last night; for which disloyal deed thou shalt now atone, by giving a couple of pieces to this honest youth, and five to the girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aye--indeed?--he {{must be in}} high {{trust for}} so young a gentleman. I wish you joy, sir,' bowing to Fairford. 'By'r lady, as Shakespeare says, <b>you</b> are <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> a neck for a fair end. Come, patron, we will drink to Mr. What-shall-call-um. What is his name? Did you tell me? And have I forgot it already.' ...|$|R
