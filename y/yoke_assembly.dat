2500|$|The {{solution}} to the static convergence and purity problems {{is a set of}} color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection <b>yoke</b> <b>assembly</b> and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their magnetic fields parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field vector can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [...] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{means of}} core {{fabrication}} are to glue the laminations or weld them {{to form the}} yoke structure. These means result in good <b>yoke</b> <b>assemblies</b> for shorter (< 0. 6 meter) magnets. However, because of weld distortions or mechanical strength limitations, welding and/or gluing techniques result in cores with poor mechanical precision or limited mechanical strength for longer cores. The SPEAR 3 gradient dipole magnets are up to 1. 45 meters long and require distortions of < 0. 05 mm. Therefore, the SPEAR 3 gradient dipole core design incorporated an assembly technique, originally devised for the PEPI Insertion quadrupoles and later adapted for the ALS gradient magnets. This technique involves fabricating a rigid frame for the core, precisely stacking and compressing the laminations using hydraulic jacks and granite surfaces and straight edges, and fixing the laminations in the frame by filling the grooves between the laminations and frame using steel loaded epoxy. Although this technique {{has been used in}} the past, it has never been fully described and published. This paper is written to provide {{a detailed description of the}} procedure and to present measurement data demonstrating the mechanical precision and stiffness of the resulting product. CORE CONFIGURATION five tension plates and two solid end plates. The tension plates are bolted and dowel pinned to end plates. After the laminations are stacked and compressed in the frame, steel loaded epoxy is injected into the grooves, permanently fixing the laminations in the frame. The frame is designed to take all the bending and twisting stresses due to the weight of the laminations and the points of support...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of an inductive coupling system, the magnetic coupling between the primary (4) and secondary (8) windings is increased by adding auxiliary windings (26, 28) on the primary (2) and/or secondary (6) <b>yokes</b> of the <b>assembly</b> near the air gap (18) between the yokes. Capacitors (30, 32) {{are connected to the}} auxiliary windings (26, 28) which, together with the inductance of the auxiliary windings, resonate at the operating frequency of the primary AC voltage (Vp). The effect is an improved magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary windings (4, 8) without increasing the size of the magnetic assembly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} method for the optimal design of su-perconducting magnet systems for {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI). The method integrates a linear-programming technique with the finite-element method (FEM) to calculate minimum-volume coil configurations subject to magnetic field homogeneity constraints for MRI systems that contain general nonaxisymmet-ric magnetic yoke structures. The method rapidly converges and only requires {{a small number of}} iterations and FEM analyses to be performed. In particular, the method is well suited for magnet design problems that necessitate large 3 -D FEM models. We demonstrate the method with the optimal design of an open and compact 0. 5 T <b>yoked</b> biplanar magnet <b>assembly</b> considered for use in an integrated medical linear accelerator and MRI system. In particular, the coil configuration for this magnet design is con-structed from a MgB 2 high-temperature superconducting mater-ial that operates in a conduction-cooled cryogen-free environment.

50|$|The DPS employs two linear {{actuators}} and a central pivoting armature {{that holds the}} iris. The two parallel {{linear actuators}} have coordinated motion {{in such a way}} as to produce both x and y motions of the iris. For illustrative purposes think of the way, a tank moves. If both tank treads move forward/backward the “gun tip” moves forward/backward (both treads moving normally). If one tread moves opposite to the other (turning, both treads moving differentially) the “gun tip” would move left or right. It is this type of differential motion that allows the iris to be positioned in any area of the optical axis in the lens, and do it in the smallest possible space. The linear actuators consist of a moving coil and fixed magnetic <b>yoke</b> <b>assembly,</b> very similar to the typical actuator that controls the read/write heads in a computer hard drive. By incorporating miniature, high-resolution optical encoders, the entire scanner mechanism control system becomes digital.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] - Walking Line Assembly (WLA) is {{performed}} by positioning workers along assembly line at every process {{stations in the}} production line as and when required. This has benefitted the assembly and fabrication industry {{without the need for}} a dedicated layout, thereby leading to reduction in the fixed costs. This paper describes the application of WLA in prototype fabrication of yoke sub-assembly and details its effectiveness. The WLA procedure is described in two parts: Part I presents the technical aspects and challenges involved in development and fabrication of engine mount <b>yoke</b> tube <b>assembly</b> for a civil aircraft. This highlights the importance and significance of the parts, brackets, dimensional robustness, procedures, assembly, jigs and fixtures associated and the necessity of categorizing it as Class- 1. Activities representing reverse engineering process and fabrication of yoke tube are detailed comprehensively. Part II presents the WLA model adopted for this assembly. Comparison with conventional methods and layouts of fixed and walking line assembly are done. Further, WLA is modified with a common stage set on every process where the expected capability of the task in shop floor is brought out in consensus with the operational demand and standards. This is achieved with very little disturbance to the existing aircraft fixed line fabrication set up. This model has given encouraging results by expediting the processes and provides an ideal option for building of prototypes in development stage of an aircraft project.

Parts are first manually tacked together in an assembly jig, They are then removed from the jig, rotated horizontally and craned into an automated fastening machine. Finally they are removed from the fastening machines and craned to a third station where the manual tacks are removed and the parts are prepped for final wing box assembly.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} testing of a miniature one-pole, three-position pressure valve and actuation mechanism. This valve was designed primarily for installation with a pressure transducer directly in a wind-tunnel model, thereby reducing lag time effects resulting from long connecting tubes to the transducer. This valve provides for the in-situ calibration of the transducer during testing by providing one position for transducer zero, a second position for a known calibrate pressure, and a third position for measurement of the unknown test pressure. The valve is driven from the spring loaded test pressure position to the zero and calibrate positions by a pneumatically operated dual-piston <b>yoke</b> <b>assembly.</b> Large numbers of transducers can be simultaneously calibrated from a remote location {{in a matter of}} seconds...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the corrosion resistance of the prototype iron-platinum (FePt) magnets and non-encapsulated neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets in three different pH environments. Methods. The corrosion resistance of the magnets was studied using a corrosion indicator, the breakaway force. The breakaway forces of the magnets after immersion in three media, namely 1 % lactic acid solution (pH= 2. 7), 0. 1 % sodium sulphide solution (pH= 12) and adjusted artificial saliva (pH= 6. 8) were compared after 28 and 60 -day periods. Results. By day 7, all NdFeB magnets dissolved completely in the acid medium, and they showed significantly lower breakaway forces at day 28 and day 60 in artificial saliva (90 %, 69 %) and in alkaline medium (67 %, 42 %). In contrast, the FePt magnets did not show a drop in the breakaway forces after immersion in acid or artificial saliva, although approximately half of the original breakaway forces were recorded at day 28 and day 60 after immersion in strong alkali. Conclusions. The new iron-platinum magnets, which require no <b>yoke</b> <b>assembly</b> or protective casing, has good corrosion resistance for the oral environment. If its retentive force can be improved without increasing its thickness (0. 3 mm), then it will have distinct advantages for clinical use. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) {{spacecraft}} {{was successfully}} inserted into an elliptical orbit around Mars on 9 / 12 / 97, 01 : 53 : 49 UTC. This orbit was near polar (inclination = 93. 26 deg) with an orbital period of 44. 993 hours and apoapsis and periapsis altitudes of 54, 025. 9 km and 262. 9 km respectively. After a short aerobraking (AB) initiation interval (9 / 12 / 97 to 10 / 2 / 97), the main phase of AB or orbit period reduction was established. However shortly thereafter, {{a significant problem}} with the minus-Y axis solar array developed which necessitated a temporary suspension of AB. Ultimately, this forced the Project to abandon the original plan to complete AB on 1 / 18 / 98 and establish the mapping orbit on 3 / 15 / 98. The revised plan called for a reduced level of AB, thus subjecting the solar array and <b>yoke</b> <b>assembly</b> to less aerodynamic stress. After 201 orbits and 196 days after MOI, {{the first phase of}} AB has ended, the orbital period was 11. 64 hours with apoapsis and periapsis altitudes of 17, 870. 3 and 170. 7 km respectively. At present, MGS is in a science phasing orbit (SPO) and shall acquire science data from 3 / 28 / 98 to 9 / 11 / 98.
