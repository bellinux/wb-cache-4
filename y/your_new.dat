500|$|Since Feynman was {{no longer}} working at the Los Alamos Laboratory, he {{was no longer}} exempt from the draft and was called up by the Army in the fall of 1946. He avoided this by faking mental illness, and the Army gave him a 4-F {{exemption}} on mental grounds. This may not have been an incorrect assessment; his father died suddenly on October 8, 1946, and Feynman suffered from depression. On October 17, 1946, he wrote a letter to Arline, expressing his deep love and heartbreak. This letter was sealed and only opened after his death.

500|$|Before {{the first}} episode aired, {{journalist}} Patrick Strudwick asked, [...] "Channel 4, why call <b>your</b> <b>new</b> documentary My Transsexual Summer? It sounds like gender tourism, a fun little trip to the other side." [...] Sarah Dean, an entertainment editor for The Huffington Post UK, called the title [...] "sensationalist". Although Sarah Lake of Trans Media Watch found the title contentious, she defended it {{by pointing out that}} transition is a temporary process like coming of age; even so, she believed the title to be [...] "only slightly better" [...] than the [...] "dire and totally inappropriate" [...] working title, Girls Will Be Boys and Boys Will Be Girls. Her overall assessment was that [...] "although the programme makers undeniably made some compromises to draw in viewers, millions will have enjoyed the company of these seven, shared in their lives and learned a lesson in diversity.… They will now have an entry point to broadening their understanding of the rich and joyful diversity of gender experience, something which has always existed but of which they were previously unaware." ...|$|E
500|$|Work at {{the pump}} {{stations}} and marine terminal, which had not stopped during the winter, continued throughout the 1976 construction season. Pump Station 6, {{just south of the}} Yukon River, had to be redesigned after excavation revealed ice-rich permafrost below the site. Five pump stations needed at startup (when throughput was lower) received their pumps, turbines, and piping. As they were completed, the pump stations received hydrostatic testing, in which portions of pipe were filled with water and subjected to pressures in excess of the eventual operating conditions. Following this testing, the initial five pump stations were disconnected from the main pipeline and had oil run through them on a continuous loop. [...] "It's very similar to <b>your</b> <b>new</b> automobile," [...] one worker said. [...] "You drive it around for ten days so that any components that are going to fail are given time to fail." [...] Work on additional pump stations, which would not be needed until the pipeline was brought to full capacity, was not pressed forward.|$|E

He commented, [...] "Every few years a sim comes along that lets reviewers use the 'sets new standards for graphics' cliché, and Flight Unlimited is the 1995 entry in this club." [...] Bob and John Nolan called Flight Unlimited [...] "the ultimate show off piece for <b>your</b> <b>new</b> Pentium", thanks to [...] "unbelievable" [...] graphics superior to those of any other computer game. Gaudiosi concurred: he characterized the visuals as [...] "photo-sharp" [...] and [...] "better than any I have seen". PC Magazines staff found the graphics [...] "impressive" [...] and [...] "even more stunning than those in Microsoft Flight Simulator". Ware noted the [...] "stunning 3-D photo-realistic scenery", while Bailey stated that the [...] "graphics are brilliantly rendered and whiz by smoothly". Buchanan called Flight Unlimiteds terrain [...] "just superb" [...] and Vizard described it as [...] "amazingly real". Buchanan believed that [...] "what you hear in Flight Unlimited {{is every bit as}} good as what you see", thanks to [...] "utterly convincing" [...] sound effects. Atkin praised the instructor as [...] "one of the best uses of voice ever in a multimedia title".|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to praise for Iridions graphics, its actual gameplay was generally panned. IGN's Craig Harris wrote that [...] "Shin'en's shooter for the Game Boy Advance will impress {{with all its}} effects, but that's about it." [...] He noted that the player is limited to shooting and dodging, making gameplay repetitive. Harris and Concepcion complained that on a small screen distances are hard to judge; the player's ship is hit by bullets {{that appear to be}} in the distance. Bub and Game Informers Jay Fitzloff criticized the craft placement, as the player's view was often obscured by their own ship. Lopez also gave Iridion low marks, warning that [...] "after the initial 'wow' wears off, you'll be stuck with an empty experience." [...] Edge observed that Iridion is [...] "a sweet number that will entertain, if only for a week or so". Allgame's Skyler Miller said Iridion 3D {{was nothing more than a}} technology demo and awarded it two out of five stars. A more positive review came from GamePro, whose reviewer summed up his experience by writing that [...] "if you're looking for some classic shooter action on <b>your</b> <b>new</b> GBA, Iridion 3D will fit the bill nicely without blowing you away." ...|$|E

[...] "He accepts his injury, he accepts his compromised status in society ... Peggy says, 'Forget this. I'm Peggy Carter. I'm going to do something else.' I think that's the difference between the two of them." [...] Considering a potentially romantic relationship between Sousa and Carter, Gjokaj said, [...] "I think there’s definitely a situation where … if she hadn't dated Captain America, he might ask her out for a drink. It’s like if <b>your</b> <b>new</b> girlfriend dated Ryan Gosling. It’s going to make you sweat a bit." [...] For the second season, Gjokaj said, [...] "you’ll see him deal with actually being part of the machine. Not trying to get [...] the machine, but being the boss. The first season was him trying to be listened to, and now he’s being listened to by a lot of people." [...] The costumes for the SSR agents in the series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters: Sousa wears [...] "sweater vests under his sport coats and pleated pants".|$|E

500|$|The {{commercial}} breakthrough {{from these}} scenes began initially in the UK, and {{was led by}} {{a small group of}} bands. The Strokes emerged from the New York club scene with their debut album, Is This It (2001), which debuted at No. 2 in the UK and cracked the Top 50 in America. The White Stripes, from Detroit, released their third album, White Blood Cells (2001), which charted decently in both the US and the UK, as well as spawning two transatlantic Top 25 singles. The Hives, from Sweden, became a mainstream success with their compilation album <b>Your</b> <b>New</b> Favourite Band (2001) which peaked at No. 7 on the UK charts. Also in 2001, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's debut album hit No. 5 in the UK. The Vines, from Australia, released Highly Evolved in 2002, which was a top 5 success in both England and Australia, and peaked at No. 11 in the US. Along with the Strokes, White Stripes, Hives and others, they were christened by parts of the media as the [...] "The" [...] bands, and dubbed [...] "the saviours of rock 'n' roll", prompting Rolling Stone magazine to declare on its September 2002 cover, [...] "Rock is Back!" [...] This press attention, in turn, led to accusations of hype, and some dismissed the scene as unoriginal, image-conscious and tuneless. According to Reynolds, [...] "apart from maybe the White Stripes, none could really be described as retro".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Results May Vary was mainly negative. The album received [...] "generally unfavorable reviews" [...] on Metacritic, {{with a score}} of 33 out of 100. This is the second lowest score on Metacritic, above only Kevin Federline's album Playing with Fire. According to AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?". In a review of Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hitz compilation, Erlewine called [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] the worst in the band's [...] "never-ending series of embarrassing covers". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Durst's problems are ever-present - and does anybody still care?". Stylus criticized Results May Vary, calling it [...] "an album that {{can only be described as}} abysmal". Rob O'Connor of Yahoo! Launch also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "No, Fred, the results don't vary. The results are consistent throughout <b>your</b> <b>new</b> album—consistently crappy." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit have decided to expose their tender side. They really shouldn't have bothered [...] having seen Limp Bizkit's 'other side', you want the old, unapologetic, meathead version back". Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "Results May Vary has a few highlights — 'Almost Over' (very Everlast) and 'Phenomenon' (very Primus) — but way too few to justify all the time and energy spent".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} most songs in Laundry Service {{are based on}} issues and themes related to love, {{as they had been}} written after Shakira began a {{relationship}} Antonio de la Rúa, the son of former Argentine president Fernando de la Rúa. [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] is an [...] "ode" [...] to the positivity one gains when pursuing a relationship with a good person. Shakira shows an [...] "important side" [...] in [...] "The One", which is a song about how [...] "you love your guy so much that you’re actually going to learn to cook" [...] and contains lines like [...] "To buy more thongs and write more happy songs, it always takes a little help from someone." [...] In [...] "Rules", she aims to make her lover realise that he is [...] "condemned" [...] to her and lists [...] "all the things <b>your</b> <b>new</b> boy can do." [...] Songs like [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] and [...] "Fool" [...] also deal with issues related to love but in a different manner. The former is dramatic and humorous in approach as Shakira commands her partner to end a love triangle and choose between her and the other lady; it was described as a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train." [...] In the song, Shakira asserts that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible", which a reviewer commented was a [...] "brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers [...]" [...] "Fool" [...] discusses how Shakira continues to try to build up a relationship with a [...] "shitty, self-absorbed man" [...] even after suffering a [...] "soul-crushing defeat." ...|$|E
