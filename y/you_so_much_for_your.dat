I tried to save myself trouble at Christmas by just sending flowers to all my friends, but it wouldn’t work; Gertrude has eleven hot-houses and about thirty gardeners, so it would have been ridiculous to send flowers to her, and Milly has just started a florist’s shop, so it was equally out of the {{question}} there. The stress of having to decide in a hurry what to give to Gertrude and Milly just when I thought I’d got the whole question nicely off my mind completely ruined my Christmas, and then the awful monotony of the letters of thanks: ‘Thank <b>you</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> lovely flowers. It was so good of you to think of me.’ Of course in the majority of cases I hadn’t thought about the recipients at all; their names were down in my list of ‘people who must not be left out.’ If I trusted to remembering them there would be some awful sins of omission.” ...|$|E

40|$|For {{much of its}} century long history, Nucor Corporation and its {{predecessors}} displayed turbulent financial performance. Several attempts at a strategic realignment proved unsuccessful, and in 1965, the company faced insolvency. Since that time, however, the company has rallied around its steel operations to become the largest steel producer in the United States, with $ 12. 7 billion in net annual sales. This thesis examines Nucor’s development from an unprofitable conglomerate to a highly efficient enterprise. Specific focus {{on the evolution of}} the activity system underlying the organization lays the groundwork for systematic analysis of why some companies succeed while others fail. iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to extend my appreciation to Everett Keech, my capstone advisor.

40|$|What an {{incredible}} journey this has been. And like every good journey, it is marked {{not only by}} the paths I have taken or the things I have accom-plished, but also, and perhaps most importantly, by the people who have accompanied me along the way. This particular journey began a few years ago, when Xavier Serra welcomed me into the Music Technology Group. I am extremely grateful to him for giving me this opportunity, and for accom-panying me in this journey ever since. Even before starting at the MTG, I was interested in the computational aspects of melody, melodic similarity and retrieval (perhaps it was the combined effect of being a jazz-fusion gui-tarist and a computer scientist). Once at the MTG, it very quickly became evident to me that if I wanted to explore this area, there was no better person to do it with than Emilia Gómez. Now, as I near the end of this journey, I can say I feel extremely fortunate to have had Emilia to guide me through it.
