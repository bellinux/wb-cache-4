500|$|The song {{received}} acclaim from critics. [...] James Montgomery of MTV News {{said of the}} song, [...] "there {{are moments}} on Stairs that stop you dead in your tracks, send shivers up <b>your</b> <b>spine</b> and make you go 'Whoa'... like the first four-and-a-half minutes of 'I Will Possess Your Heart,' a propulsive whirl of stalking bass line, spindly guitars and stabbing piano." [...] Will Hermes noted in Rolling Stone that the sense of menace in the song was [...] "playing against type for a guy with one of rock's purest voices—a vibrato-less, bell-clear high tenor whose choirboy quality only throws the darkness here into relief." [...] Blender Jonah Weiner concurred, stating [...] "it's a pleasant surprise to hear Gibbard inhabit such a self-consciously creepy role, rather than play the occasionally errant, essentially good-hearted boyfriend who soft-shoes through {{so many of his}} tales." [...] In 2011, Tyler Kane of Paste included the song in a list of [...] "the 25 creepiest songs about love".|$|E
2500|$|NME {{called it}} a [...] "assive, massive massive hit" [...] adding [...] "Piano tinkles, drum machine coughs like an athsmatic whippet and Alicia strokes <b>your</b> <b>spine</b> with ice cubes and {{spatters}} your spotty back with hot candle wax". The song was described as [...] "gospel fervor of lovesick righteousness" [...] by Beth Johnson of Entertainment Weekly. Robert Hilburn of The Los Angeles Times described the song as having [...] "the neo-soul vitality of Macy Gray and Jill Scott." [...] Sam Faulkner of NME said that the song had [...] "deeper moments [...] creep up and grab you exemplified." [...] Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters said that the song [...] "combines Key's natural blues register with a subtle, and brilliantly so, sample of James Brown's 'It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World'." [...] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone said [...] "there's no denying the serious early Aretha vibe permeating the hit." ...|$|E
2500|$|The game's {{sound was}} praised. Arnold Katayev, {{reviewer}} of PSX Extreme, stated that [...] "Gran Turismo 5 actually sounds fantastic. Having sampled {{a number of}} cars in the game that I either own, drive frequently, or have driven numerous times before, I've verified how they all sound. My 350Z sounded pitch perfect as you start it up upon selecting it. Same goes for my 370Z, it sounds spot on. Even a bunch of the standard cars sounded good, and sound even better with a few exhaust mods", while TweakTown said that [...] "some cars just sounding flat when you feel they shouldn’t, and others just sending a shiver up <b>your</b> <b>spine</b> as you hit redline". Gamingreality awarded the sound 9/10, stating that [...] "The sounds are clear, crisp, and distinct. The engine sounds are great and {{make you feel like}} the car is actually near you. The engine sounds on premium cars change when you make adjustments to it just like in real life".|$|E

5000|$|The ongoing {{theme of}} Barbarism vs. Civilization, which pervades the entire Conan series, {{is present in}} this story in two crucifixions. Conan is able to endure and survive his crucifixion, and the {{subsequent}} journey without water, thanks to his barbarian stamina. When Constantius is finally crucified, Conan states [...] "You are more fit to inflict torture than endure it. ...

Conan, as chief of the Zuagirs, mops up the remaining Shemites, capturing Constantius in the process, and leaves to raid the nearby Turanians. Before leaving Khauran, he crucifies Constantius by the stump of the crucifix from which he escaped, commenting with irony to the crucified Constantius the difference between their respective situations: [...] "I hung there on a cross as you are hanging, and I lived, thanks to circumstances and a stamina peculiar to barbarians. But you civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to <b>your</b> <b>spines</b> as are ours. Your fortitude consists mainly in inflicting torment, not in enduring it. You will be dead before sundown. And so, Falcon, I leave you to the companionship of another bird of the desert." ...|$|R

B. H. Since ancient times, the abrupt appearance and spread of mal-adies has demanded and defied explanation by mankind. In 400 b. c., Hippocrates suggested that the environment, includ-ing water and air, were important, and in the second century a. d., Galen suggested that outbreaks of illnesses were caused by inhaled air. For centuries thereafter, the prime theories pro-posed that illnesses arose from mystical influences and noxious effluvia borne by air [1]. The widespread devastation inflicted by plagues was thought to result from inhaling the putrescent vapors of decaying corpses. This belief in “miasmas ” (derived from the Greek word for pollution) engendered perhaps the first infection-control procedures. The unfortunate souls as-signed to handle the corpses were gowned in long robes with hoods to which were attached beaks stuffed with herbs, which were intended to filter the miasmas from the air (figure 1). Epidemics of influenza were similarly believed to erupt from the dispersion of mystical elements. Indeed, our current ter...|$|R
40|$|It {{seems like}} {{everyone}} has a great idea for a research study. However, translating an idea into a research question that can be studied scientifically can be a challenging undertaking, especially if an individual is fairly new to research. The goal of this brief fact sheet is to provide guidance {{on how to get}} through this important first step in completing a research study. A well-written research question is very focused and specific. If you make the analogy that a research study is much like the human skeleton, you will understand the importance of linking all the parts together for a successful study. The research question is the “spine ” of the study since it supports the study design (arms) and methods (rib cage), which then directs the statistical methods (legs). If <b>your</b> research question (<b>spine)</b> is not well constructed, then the entire study (skeleton) collapses. Think of the review of the literature as the “head ” of the skeleton since it leads to the spine and must have a strong connection! A well-written research question contains the key variables, the relationship between the variables, and the population to be studied (Norwood, 2000; Polit & Beck, 2004). For example, what is the correlation between hope and uncertainty in individuals awaiting renal transplantation? Can you identify the problems with the following research questions: 1. What are the levels for individuals awaiting renal transplantation...|$|R

If you attentively regard almost any quadruped's spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae {{of which he was}} inlaying, in a sort of basso-relieve, the beaked prow of his canoe.

6000|$|The patients, or {{whatever}} other visitors were ever admitted into the Doctor's study, carried abroad strange {{accounts of the}} squalor of dust and cobwebs in which the learned and scientific person lived; and the dust, they averred, {{was all the more}} disagreeable, because it could not well be other than dead men's almost intangible atoms, resurrected from the adjoining graveyard. As for the cobwebs, they were no signs of housewifely neglect on the part of crusty Hannah, the handmaiden; but the Doctor's scientific material, carefully encouraged and preserved, each filmy thread more valuable to him than so much golden wire. Of all barbarous haunts in Christendom or elsewhere, this study was the one most overrun with spiders. They dangled from the ceiling, crept upon the tables, lurked in the corners, and wove the intricacy of their webs wherever they could hitch the end from point to point across the window-panes, and even across {{the upper part of the}} doorway, and in the chimney-place. It seemed impossible to move without breaking some of these mystic threads.

What they fed upon (for all the flies for miles about would not have sufficed them) was a secret known only to the Doctor. Whence they came was another riddle; though, from certain inquiries and transactions of Doctor Grimshawe's with some of the shipmasters of the port, who followed the East and West Indian, the African and the South American trade, it was supposed that this odd philosopher was in the habit of importing choice monstrosities in the spider kind from all those tropic regions.

The sun is pretty warm sometimes at this season, but {{as soon as you get}} out of it you will freeze to death if you are not careful. The only way to keep warm is to be in the sun, out of the wind, and that won't work on rainy days, and winter is the rainy season, you know. In the houses it is as cold as ice, and the fires don't amount to anything. You might as well light a bundle of wooden tooth-picks and put it in the fire-place. If you could sleep all the time you might be comfortable, for they give you a feather-bed to cover yourself with. Outside you may do well enough if you keep up a steady walking, but indoors you will have hard work to keep warm. You must wear chest-protectors. They sell them down there--great big ones, made of rabbit-skins; and a nice thing for a man to have to wear in the house is a pair of cloth bags lined with fur. They would keep his feet and legs warm when he isn't walking. It is well, too, to have a pair of smaller fur bags for your hands when you are in the house. You can have a little hole in the end of one of them through which you can stick a pen-holder, and then you can write letters.
