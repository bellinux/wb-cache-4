5000|$|When Nikkatsu {{offered him}} a chance to leave TV and create a new genre of pink film in 1976, Hasebe was at first reluctant. Not {{interested}} in directing typical sex films, Hasebe instead conceived of the [...] "Violent pink" [...] genre. The Weissers, in their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films describe the Violent pink" [...] films as [...] "vicious and mean-spirited productions, without delving into the more traditional whip-n-bondage aspects of the S&M genre", and compare the genre to the American [...] "roughies." [...] Warning the studio about his intentions, Hasebe asked [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me? <b>You</b> must be aware--my craft is very bloody." [...] Nikkatsu, desperate at the time for a new direction for their Roman porno films, agreed to give him creative freedom.

2500|$|Nikkatsu {{had started}} its SM line of Roman porno films in 1974 with the hits Flower and Snake and Wife to Be Sacrificed both {{featuring}} actress Naomi Tani {{and directed by}} Masaru Konuma. After this first highly successful venture into sexual violence, the studio's output became increasingly rougher. According to director Yasuharu Hasebe, by 1976 the studio {{was looking for a}} new direction, and contacted him to develop films in a new style to be called [...] "Violent Pink". These would be comparable to the U.S. [...] "roughies" [...] film genre, violent and misogynistic, but without the whips, bondage and other traditional accoutrements of the S genre. Hasebe had worked with the studio in the 1960s during their [...] "Nikkatsu Action" [...] era, but was not comfortable with the pink film genre to which the studio had turned with the inception of the Roman porno series in 1971. Reluctant to work in the sex film genre, Hasebe later recalled warning the studio, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me?... <b>You</b> must be aware-- my craft is very bloody." ...|$|R

[...] There are {{two versions of the}} Bond theme. The first is the lushly orchestrated track featured during the opening and closing credits of the film.

You’ve got a daughter and a son there, and this is a big step to take. Have you really thought it through? You could go back to the Russian embassy right now (she was staying there in their dormitory) and simply go to sleep and forget it, and get up Wednesday morning and on to Moscow, as your schedule calls for." [...] She immediately said, [...] "If this is your decision, I shall go to the press tonight; and announce that (a) democratic India will not take me (they had turned her down prior to her coming) and (b), now democratic America refuses to take me." [...] Well, she didn't need to do it; I was just trying it on for size to be sure she had thought it through. But she was very quick on this. Chester Bowles ...|$|R

5000|$|Mohinder {{returns to}} India to scatter his father's ashes. He debates whether {{to return to}} his job as a college professor. His former girlfriend Mira invites him to {{interview}} for a job at a company doing genetics research where she has just been made a department head. However, she says he must not mention his father's research into the evolution of superpowers or consider continuing it. Moving into his father's office, Mohinder sees a running program on the computer; after pressing delete, an [...] "are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> quit" [...] message appears on the screen and Mohinder hesitates to select yes. Mohinder talks with his mother about her decision to let his father go to the United States to look for Sylar. His mother tells {{him for the first time}} about his sister, Shanti, who died when she was five, two years after Mohinder was born. Shanti was [...] "special", according to her mother, and their father loved her so much that he was afraid Mohinder would find his love for his son wanting in comparison. Mohinder also has a series of dreams, depicting a young Indian boy who guides him to various scenes showing his parents arguing and showing his father's murder in his taxi cab by a man whose face was obscured, but was wearing a watch with a broken face, showing seven minutes to twelve (or midnight). After another dream where the boy was trying to get into a locked drawer in Mohinder's desk, Mohinder realizes the key in his father's journal was to that drawer, and opens it, finding a file titled [...] "SANJOG, Iyer", containing a photo of the boy. Continuing their journey to New York, Hiro and Ando stop at a diner in Midland, Texas, and meet a waitress named Charlie, who recently developed a near perfect ability to quickly memorize any information. As Hiro talks to Charlie, the man in the baseball cap who earlier had attempted to kidnap Molly from FBI custody [...] - [...] Sylar [...] - [...] is watching them talk. As he does so, he uses telekinesis to draw a cup of coffee to his hand from across the table. He also is shown wearing the same watch as the murderer of Mohinder's father, which also is set to seven minutes to midnight. Charlie is later found murdered in the diner's storeroom, with her brain removed in the same manner as Sylar's victims. Hiro tells Ando that he can prevent Charlie's death by going back in time to the day before and preventing her from going to work; however, Hiro fails to return five seconds after his departure, as he promised Ando he would. A worried Ando paces next to a wall of pictures, which he does not notice. One of the pictures, which before had shown Charlie with a birthday cake in the diner, now shows Hiro as well, implying that he went further back in time than just the day before.|$|E
