500|$|In 1942, Clark Shaughnessy {{was hired}} as head coach. Shaughnessy had {{achieved}} fame at Stanford, where he installed his quarterback-centric version of the T-formation as his primary offensive scheme. In response, Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner had said, [...] "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> all the football I ever knew in the Pacific Ocean." [...] Stanford, which had gone 1–7–1 the previous season, went undefeated in Shaughnessy's first year and earned the number-two ranking in the final AP Poll. Shaughnessy was named 1940 College Coach of the Year for the turnaround performance. Under Shaughnessy, the Terps went 7–2, {{with one of the}} losses a 0–42 shutout at Duke, which in five seasons had won the Southern Conference three times and been ranked in the AP top-20 four times. After one season, Shaughnessy left Maryland for Pittsburgh.|$|E
500|$|The graphic emblem most {{associated}} with the straight edge movement is a black [...] "X", typically drawn on the wearer's hands with a marker. According to MacKaye, [...] "We were in San Francisco, and we played a place called Mabuhay Gardens. They figured out we were underage, and they wouldn't let us play. We worked out a deal with their management that {{we just wanted to}} play and we weren't going to drink, so they got a marker and put a big 'X' on our hand, So we came back to Washington D.C. and went to this nightclub, the 9:30, and said 'Hey look, we're not going to drink and we will put this 'X' on our hand. If you see us drinking <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> us out forever. We are not going to drink, we just came to see the music'". The band adopted the marking, and though it was initially meant to signify youth, it became a wider emblem for bands prepared to play to audiences under the legal age to be served alcohol. MacKaye noted that at the time the symbol [...] "wasn't supposed to signify straight edge—it was supposed to signify kids. It was about being young punk rockers... it represents youth".|$|E
500|$|To {{match the}} themes Draiman had in mind, {{he told his}} bandmates, [...] "give me your darkest, nastiest, [...] {{aggressive}} tribal rhythmic shit <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> at me". Prior {{to the release of}} the album, guitarist Dan Donegan supported this, stating, [...] "musically, it's a lot ballsier than we've written [...]" [...] He continued, saying, [...] " [...] trying to get a good blend of the elements of the past three CDs to try to evolve into something fresh and new for us as well." [...] Dan Marsicano of 411mania commented on the song [...] "Perfect Insanity", claiming it has [...] "...a short but sweet shredding solo, double bass drum work, and fast picked riffing...". He goes on to propose the same for the song [...] "Divide", saying it [...] "follows the same pattern , with aggressive guitar work followed through by Draiman's vocals..." [...] Marsicano also proposes that [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] has [...] "...a memorable solo and a dark theme surrounding it," [...] and says that [...] "The Night" [...] is an [...] "epic-sounding track that has one of the best solos that Donegan has ever done and a catchy chorus." [...] Chris Akin of Metaleater proposes that the album is full of hooks, and that guitarist Donegan takes a [...] "much more 80s approach", due to his guitar solos. Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone proposes that the album contains [...] "meticulously constructed guitar skronk, serrated verses and cathartic refrains".|$|E

Hallows opined that Pickard is [...] "probably the person I've cried at the most, some of the more difficult stories he's done, even though you know the story that's coming up, you can't help but have a lump in your throat". Another series producer Bryan Kirkwood praised Pickard's acting skills, stating that he felt Pickard is a [...] "brilliant" [...] actor. He said he was [...] "particularly pleased in moving Tony away from the buffoon he had become over the years into heartbreaking stories such Grace's death and his relationship with Jacqui. He's a touching and sensitive actor who's always over-looked". Series producer Paul Marquess praised Pickard, saying he felt that [...] "there's only so many daft Tony stories you can do. He's so key to the show and so able and adept". Pickard's colleague Gemma Merna praised Pickard saying Pickard has [...] "had some great storylines", adding that if she was [...] "half as successful as Nick is on the show and liked as much then I would love to stay".|$|E
2500|$|Stanford center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd {{been reading}} about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among {{ourselves}} that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." [...] In his first address to the team, Shaughnessy told them, [...] "Boys, I am not to be addressed as 'Clark' or, especially, [...] 'Soup'. To you, I am 'Mr. Shaughnessy' or 'Coach.' Nothing else. I am a professor of football... Now, I have a formation for {{you that if you}} learn it well will take you to the Rose Bowl." [...] He asserted that one of his plays, a line plunge by a back without a blocker, would score ten to twelve touchdowns alone, which was more than the Indians had scored the entire previous season. The players were understandably skeptical, and they were not alone. Football innovator and single-wing proponent Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner said before the season, [...] "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> all the football I ever knew into the Pacific Ocean." [...] Shaughnessy later discovered that the players, who were mostly returners from the 1939 team, were talented, but not suited to the single wing. As a contemporary newspaper noted, [...] "The [...] team looked great in some games and sour in others. The machinery was there but it wasn't running as smoothly as had been hoped for." ...|$|E
