25|$|In {{a report}} of the same match, Spanish {{newspaper}} El Mundo said: Bale combines the height and build of an 800-metre runner like Steve Ovett with the acceleration and directness of a rugby winger like Bryan Habana. And, when he gets to the byline, he delivers curling crosses like a Brazilian. Big words? Yes, but that's what Bale is like – easily the greatest sensation in the opening month and a half of the Champions League. Ask Maicon what he thinks after the two exhibitions Bale turned in against Inter. <b>Yesterday</b> <b>he</b> left Maicon for dead and then a wily old fox like Lúcio was left in his wake like someone trying to follow the vapour trail of an aeroplane. Three goals and two assists – against the European champions. His performances have been stunning.|$|E

2500|$|However, Forman comfortably {{held his}} seat in the 1987 general election. His radical image tended to prevent Labour and Liberal {{supporters}} indulging in tactical voting (that is, jointly backing his strongest opponent) in order to turn him out. Forman appeared to be more popular in Carshalton than was the local Conservative party and his political fortunes {{seemed to be in}} the ascendant.“Has Chancellor Nigel Lawson gone soft? <b>Yesterday</b> <b>he</b> appointed as his PPS a Tory so wet he drips. As recently as last year, Nigel Forman, vice-chairman of the party's backbench finance committee, was publicly calling on the Chancellor to 'give top priority to the unemployment challenge'. The year before, in Mastering British Politics, he wrote: 'Occasionally, in the course of its long history, the Conservative party has been swept along on the wave of some particular ideology, but such periods have not usually lasted or brought enduring political success'.” – [...] "Rising Damp", The Times, June 1987.|$|E
2500|$|The second common {{misconception}} is {{that all}} out-of-court statements are hearsay. This is not the case. An out of court statement {{may or may not}} be hearsay depending on the purpose for which it is offered. If the statement is being offered to prove the truth of what it asserts, then it becomes hearsay. When offered for any other purpose the statement is not hearsay. For example: Witness testifies that <b>yesterday</b> <b>he</b> spoke to Jim (who was in Vermont) on the phone and that Jim made the following statement, [...] "It's raining in Vermont!" [...] If the attorney is seeking to use this statement to prove that it was in fact raining in Vermont, then it is hearsay. But, if the attorney is seeking to use the statement to prove that the phone lines were working that day, or that Jim had not lost the power of speech, or for any other purpose, then the statement is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and therefore it is not hearsay.|$|E
2500|$|Alfred Richardson {{had married}} Emily Ethel Marden in Birmingham at St Silas’ Church, Lozells, on 13 August 1898. Ethel (1877–1963) was a {{daughter}} of Inspector Thomas Marden (1847–1913) of the Birmingham City Police, and the first of their two children was born in March 1902 in Newcastle-under-Lyme, the second in 1905. In February 1903 {{he found that the}} Council Watch Committee of Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, was advertising for a new Chief Constable. Halifax was regarded as a 'tough town'. There were thirty one applicants including five army officers, three Chief Constables and a number of Police Inspectors among them. Richardson was in the Final Interview. The Police sub-committee selected six for the final interview and held a ballot as to who would be offered the position. Richardson received a substantial majority. His salary was to be £250 per annum with an annual increase of £25 until £350 was reached. £50 per annum was paid in lieu of house coal, light, water, taxes and clothing. Two and a half percent of salary was paid into the Police Pension fund. He tendered his resignation to the Newcastle-under-Lyme Watch Committee in March 1903. The local newspaper, the Halifax Guardian, carried the news in an article: 'Young Chief of Police. Mr A. H. Richardson was appointed Chief Constable of Halifax <b>yesterday.</b> <b>He</b> is one of the youngest Chief Constables in the country being at present but thirty one years of age.'
