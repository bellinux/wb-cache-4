500|$|During the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1994, Sega of America {{research}} and development head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Nakayama, in which Nakayama {{stressed the importance of}} coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar. [...] Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz. [...] One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as [...] "Project Jupiter", an entirely new independent console. [...] Project Jupiter was initially slated to be {{a new version of the}} Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited 3D capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the Sega Virtua Processor chip. [...] Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months. [...] According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, [...] "Oh, that's just a horrible idea. [...] If all you're going to do is enhance the system, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>make</b> it an add-on. [...] If it's a new system with legitimate new software, great. [...] But if the only thing it does is double the colors...." [...] Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions. [...] One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system. [...] This would come in the form of an add-on. [...] From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed [...] "Project Mars", was advanced.|$|E

[...] Following his May 2009 vote against recognizing gay marriages, Barry was criticized for what activists believed to be an apparent flip-flop. Councilman Phil Mendelson said he {{was surprised by the}} vote because Barry had signed on as a co-introducer of the marriage bill. Barry said his position had not changed and warned that the council needed to move slowly on this issue.

Within minutes of {{accepting}} the ride, Bonin asked Pugh whether {{he would like to}} engage in sex with him. Pugh later stated he panicked and stuttered upon hearing this question and, after sitting in silence for several minutes, attempted to leave the vehicle once Bonin had slowed the van at a stoplight. In response, Bonin wordlessly leaned across and grabbed Pugh by the collar, dragging him back into the passenger seat. According to Pugh, Bonin then confided in him that he enjoyed abducting young male hitchhikers on Friday and Saturday nights, whom he then restrained and abused before strangling them to death with their own T-shirts. In a matter-of-fact tone, Bonin then informed Pugh: [...] "If you want to kill somebody, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>make</b> a plan and find a place to dump the body before you even pick a victim." [...] Bonin then informed Pugh he had not chosen to refrain from assaulting and killing him out of sentiment; he'd been spared because the pair had been seen leaving Fraser's party together.|$|E

2500|$|In late May 2002, Chrétien {{tried to}} curtail Martin's by-then open {{campaign}} for {{the leadership of the}} party by delivering a lecture to Cabinet to stop raising money for leadership bids within the Liberal Party. At what was described as a [...] "stormy" [...] Cabinet meeting on May 30, 2002, Chrétien stated that he intended to serve out his entire term, and ordered the end of all leadership fundraising. Martin left his cabinet on June 2, 2002. Martin claimed that Chrétien dismissed him from Cabinet, while Chrétien said that Martin had resigned. In his memoirs, Chrétien wrote that he regretted not having fired Martin a few years earlier. In the aftermath of Martin's departure from the Cabinet, there occurred an angry caucus meeting on June 5, 2002, where much of the caucus came out in support of Martin; demanded that he fire his much hated communications director Françoise Ducros, who many MPs claimed was impossible to work with, leading to a chorus of MPs chanting [...] "Bring back Peter, bring back Peter" [...] (a reference to Ducros's predecessor Peter Donolo); and several pro-Martin M.Ps asked forthright for Chrétien to resign. Liberal MP Dan McTeague told Chrétien that [...] "You made a decision for Paul Martin. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>make</b> the same decision for yourself". Many of the MPs accused the PMO of riding roughshod over them, and accused the prime minister of being a bully. Liberal MP Carolyn Parrish recalled about that caucus meeting that she could not believe that [...] "these ungrateful sons of bitches", as she called the pro-Martin MPs, would attack Chrétien at a caucus meeting so openly. For Chrétien's reaction, Parrish stated: [...] "His face was evil.
