25|$|In {{order to}} avoid bloodshed“, I advise you to spare your {{soldiers}} not force us to fight, {{and go back to}} where you bad and evil strangers were and leave us alone: we will resolutely and fiercely defend this place and fight <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> for the land of our ancestors and for the welfare of our future generations. Have pity on people and cease to destroy them: we did not give life to anyone nor do {{we have the right to}} take it away from others: but because you shall not send your soldiers to a certain death, since we are not to surrender the fortress without a fierce and bitter resistance.|$|E
25|$|After The Tracey Ullman Show, Ullman {{went on to}} {{make her}} big screen {{starring}} debut with I Love <b>You</b> <b>To</b> <b>Death</b> in 1990. That same year she hit the stage with actor Morgan Freeman for Shakespeare in the Park's production of The Taming of the Shrew; she then made her Broadway debut with her one-woman show, The Big Love. She had no aspirations {{to return to the}} television. In 1991, she had given birth to her second child, Johnny, and her husband was bidding on a television franchise in the South of England. Along with the bid he included a potential television programming lineup. Listed was a Tracey Ullman special. Ullman thought nothing would come of it, but to her horror, she learnt that the bid was successful.|$|E

25|$|Reeves' {{agent was}} {{amenable}} to the project, but Phoenix's agent {{would not even}} show the screenplay to the young actor. Not to be deterred, Van Sant {{got the idea for}} Reeves to personally deliver the film's treatment to Phoenix at his home in Florida. Reeves did so over the Christmas holidays, riding his 1974 Norton Commando motorcycle from his family home in Canada to the Phoenix family ranch in Micanopy, Florida, outside Gainesville. Reeves was no stranger to River Phoenix or members of his family, having worked previously with River on Lawrence Kasdan's I Love <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>Death</b> and with his brother Joaquin and girlfriend Martha Plimpton on Ron Howard's Parenthood. After reading the treatment, Phoenix agreed {{to play the role of}} Scott. However, since Van Sant had already cast Reeves in the role, they had to convince River to take on the edgier role of drug-addicted hustler Mike Waters. The director promised not to make either actor do anything embarrassing.|$|E
500|$|Before Hendrix was 19 years old, law {{enforcement}} authorities had twice caught him riding in stolen cars. When given a choice between spending time in prison or joining the Army, he chose the latter and enlisted on May 31, 1961. After completing eight weeks of basic training at Fort Ord, California, {{he was assigned to}} the 101st Airborne Division and stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He arrived there on November 8, and soon afterward he wrote to his father: [...] "There's nothing but physical training and harassment here for two weeks, then when you go to jump school... you get hell. They work <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> fussing and fighting." [...] In his next letter home, Hendrix, who had left his guitar at his girlfriend Betty Jean Morgan's house in Seattle, asked his father to send it to him as soon as possible, stating: [...] "I really need it now." [...] His father obliged and sent the red Silvertone Danelectro on which Hendrix had hand-painted the words [...] "Betty Jean" [...] to Fort Campbell. His apparent obsession with the instrument contributed to his neglect of his duties, which led to verbal taunting and physical abuse from his peers, who at least once hid the guitar from him until he had begged for its return.|$|E
500|$|Jamie Waylett of The Advocate {{was more}} critical, saying [...] "Madonna {{delivers}} the worst performance {{in recent memory}} as the heroine of an attempt at screwball comedy. Watching her try to look like Marilyn Monroe and sound like Betty Boop, though, is {{a sure sign that}} this film was a disaster in the making. At the same time, it seems inconceivable that anyone would sit down and plan something so dreadful." [...] Carole Kass of the Richmond Times-Dispatch felt that since [...] "Madonna is the idol of teen-agers. If they imitate her hair and her makeup, these 'wanna-bes' who want to be like Madonna and dress like Madonna may be cute. But, as a popular personality, Madonna has a responsibility to her fans. And shoplifting is something not to promote. Nor is smoking." [...] Dan Dinicola of The Schenectady Gazette felt that [...] "Who's That Girl is not simply an awful film, it is positively unbearable. It's a movie without a head or a brain, a picture of such crass stupidity that it can't even make you angry. Instead it numbs <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> with its moronic platitudes, its pretensions to comedy. [...] It's a vanity project which is so amateurly produced and conceived that it makes you want to cringe in shame. [...] Madonna {{is no more than a}} novelty item." [...] Johanna Steinmetz of the Chicago Tribune complimented Dunne's acting and said: [...] "Fortunately the film has Griffin Dunne. Dunne, working in a domain once ruled by Cary Grant, manages to be stuffy, naive and vulnerable but never undignified as Loudon Trott, the New York lawyer." [...] Jean Rosenbluth of Rolling Stone was harsh about the film, saying [...] "The question posed by the film's title was Who's that girl? The answer provided by the box-office receipts was, alas, 'The same one who appeared in Shanghai Surprise and bored us to death'." ...|$|E

O father, I have got {{knowledge}} which you have not, so follow me. I will guide you to a straight path." [...] His father replied angrily: [...] "Do you reject my gods, O Ibrahim? If you don't stop I will stone <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>death!</b> Get away from me before I punish you!" [...] Ibrahim replied: [...] "Peace be on you! I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you." ...|$|E

[...] Despite {{an effort to}} sham mental illness, he was convicted by the Nuremberg Military Tribunal in the Einsatzgruppen trial for having {{a key role in}} the Rumbula and a number of other mass murders in Eastern Europe. [...] On April 9, 1948, Presiding judge Michael Musmanno pronounced the tribunal's sentence on Strauch: [...] "Defendant EDUARD STRAUCH, on the counts of the indictment on which you have been convicted, the Tribunal sentences <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> by hanging." [...] Unlike his co-defendants Otto Ohlendorf and Paul Blobel, Strauch did not hang. [...] Instead, he was handed over to authorities in Belgium, where he had committed other crimes, for trial. [...] He died in Belgian custody on September 11, 1955.|$|E
