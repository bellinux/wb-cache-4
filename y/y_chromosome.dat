This fundamental discovery provided a new concept of Chromosomal translocation of sex-determining region from <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> to X chromosomes causing sex reversal in mice.

5|$|Male elands have 31 diploid {{chromosomes}} {{and females}} have 32. The male (<b>Y)</b> <b>chromosome</b> has been translocated {{to the short}} arm of an autosome. Both the X and Y replicate late; they do not match well and are variable. The chromosomes resemble those of the greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros).|$|E
40|$|Observation of premeiotic nuclei {{of plants}} {{containing}} different numbers (from one to five) of <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> reveal that is such plants prior to meiosis all <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are in fuzzy state, while in nuclei of tapetal cells or nuclei from anther stalk {{the number of}} big chromocentres is directly correlated {{with the number of}} <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in given plants. This finding provides a further indication of genetic activity of <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in this particular stage of the life cycle (premeiosis). Another indication of genetical activity of <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> was obtained from analysis of the rate of RNA synthesis in premeiosis. It was found that PMC's in the last premeioitc interphase exhibit a high rate of 3 H-uridine incorporation.

5|$|The addax has 29 {{pairs of}} {{chromosomes}}. All chromosomes are acrocentric {{except for the}} first pair of autosomes, which are submetacentric. The X chromosome is {{the largest of the}} acrocentric chromosomes, and the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> is medium-sized. The short and long arms of the pair of submetacentric autosomes correspond respectively to the 27th and 1st chromosomes in cattle and goats. In a study, the banding patterns of chromosomes in addax were found to be similar to those in four other species of the subfamily Hippotraginae.|$|E
5|$|The animal has a {{karyotype}} of 46 chromosomes, with a {{total of}} 50 major arms on the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes). The X chromosome is submetacentric (with one arm slightly longer than the other) and the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> is small and acrocentric (with one very short and one long arm). The karyotype is conserved among species of Miniopterus; the number of chromosomes and arms is identical in M.griveaudi, the Malagasy M.aelleni and M.gleni, and even the Asian M.fuliginosus.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} {{in the blue}} wildebeest is 58. Chromosomes were studied in a male and a female wildebeest.

Metaphases were studied in the male's chromosomes, and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well, similar to those in the female both in size and morphology. the rest were acrocentric. The X chromosome is a large acrocentric while the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> a minute one.|$|E

5|$|The {{karyotype}} contains 52chromosomes with a {{total of}} 58major arms (2n=52, FN=58). The non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) are mostly acrocentric, having a long and a short arm, or telocentric, having only one arm, but there are also three large metacentric pairs, which have two major arms, and a small metacentric pair. The <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> is metacentric and the X chromosome is variable, ranging from nearly metacentric to acrocentric in five specimens studied.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, sexual {{differentiation}} {{is determined}} by the sperm that carries either an X or a Y (male) chromosome. The <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> contains a sex-determining gene (SRY) that encodes a transcription factor for the protein tdf (testis determining factor) and triggers the creation of testosterone and Anti-Müllerian hormone for the embryo's development into a male. This differentiation begins about eight or nine weeks after conception. Some sources state that it continues until the twelfth week, while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex organs are fully developed by the sixteenth week.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome.</b> The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size and shape of a pea, and is estimated to have more than 8,000 sensory nerve endings.|$|E

5|$|The {{karyotype}} generally includes 56chromosomes with a {{total of}} 54major arms (2n=56, FN=54) in specimens from both Bolivia and Brazil; a poorly prepared Paraguayan specimen seems to have a similar karyotype. In this karyotype, all autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short as to be almost invisible). However, in two specimens from the Brazilian states of Tocantins and São Paulo, one pair of autosomes contains both an acrocentric and a metacentric chromosome (with two equally long arms), yielding an FN of 55. One arm of the metacentric chromosome consists entirely of heterochromatin. Apparently, a whole heterochromatic arm was added to this chromosome; cases of similar variation are known from the rodents Peromyscus, Clyomys, and Thaptomys. Both sex chromosomes are acrocentric, and X is larger than Y. In addition to heterochromatin near the centromere, the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> contains two large blocks of heterochromatin on its long arm. The karyotype is closely similar to that of Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} includes 80 chromosomes with a {{total of}} 86 major arms (2n=80; FN=86). The X chromosome is subtelocentric (with one pair of long arms and one pair of short arms) and the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> is acrocentric (with only one pair of arms, or with a minute second pair). Among the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), the four metacentric or submetacentric (with two pairs of arms as long as or not much shorter than the other) pairs of chromosomes are small, and the 35 pairs of acrocentrics range from large to small. Some of those have a minute second pair of arms and could also be classified as subtelocentric, which would raise FN to 90. This karyotype is similar to other known karyotypes of members of Euryoryzomys.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> is {{much larger}} than mtDNA, and is {{relatively}} homogeneous; therefore it has taken much longer to find distinct lineages and to analyse them. Conversely, because the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> is so large by comparison, it holds more genetic information. <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> studies show similar findings to those made with mtDNA. The estimate for {{the age of the}} ancestral <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> for all extant Y chromosomes is given at about 70,000 years ago and is also placed in Africa; the individual who contributed this Y chromosomal heritage is sometimes referred to as <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> Adam. The difference in dates between <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> Adam and mitochondrial Eve is usually attributed to a higher extinction rate for Y chromosomes due to greater differential reproductive success between individual men, which means that a small number of very successful men may produce many children, while a larger number of less successful men will produce far fewer children.|$|E

25|$|The human <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> is {{particularly}} exposed to high mutation rates {{due to the}} environment in which it is housed. The <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> is passed exclusively through sperm, which undergo multiple cell divisions during gametogenesis. Each cellular division provides further opportunity to accumulate base pair mutations. Additionally, sperm are stored in the highly oxidative environment of the testis, which encourages further mutation. These two conditions combined put the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> at a greater risk of mutation {{than the rest of the}} genome. The increased mutation risk for the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> is reported by Graves as a factor 4.8. However, her original reference obtains this number for the relative mutation rates in male and female germ lines for the lineage leading to humans.|$|E

40|$|Genetic linkage acting through {{crossing-over}} between X and X <b>chromosomes,</b> X and <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and autosomal {{gene recombination}} {{are the most}} important sources of color pattern polymorphisms in animals. Variability in male color patterns and fin morphologies in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a livebearing fish is an example of extreme pattern polymorphism. We explored the possibility that crossing-over between <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> can also contribute to the high degree of pattern polymorphism in guppies because YY individuals are easily induced in the boratory. However, note that YY individuals are also produced in natural populations. Our results indicated that YY crossing-over was another important source of phenotypic variability - probably because recombination may be possible ver the entire length of <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and at very high frequencies due to high degrees of homology. Thus, crossing-over between <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> is yet another mechanism that can contribute to extreme pattern polymorphism in the guppy, a popular aquarium and important research model species...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms {{involved}} in eroding fitness of evolving <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{have been the}} focus of much theoretical and empirical work. Evolving <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are expected to accumulate transposable elements (TEs), but it is not known whether such accumulation contributes to their genetic degeneration. Among TEs, miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements are nonautonomous DNA transposons, often inserted in introns and untranslated regions of genes. Thus, if they invade Y-linked genes and selection against their insertion is ineffective, they could contribute to genetic degeneration of evolving <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Here, we examine the population dynamics of active MITEs in the young <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of the plant Silene latifolia and compare their distribution with those in recombining genomic regions. To isolate active MITEs, we developed a straightforward approach {{on the basis of the}} assumption that recent transposon insertions or excisions create singleton or low-frequency size polymorphisms that can be detected in alleles from natural populations. Transposon display was then used to infer the distribution of MITE insertion frequencies. The overall frequency spectrum showed an excess of singleton and low-frequency insertions, which suggests that these elements are readily removed from recombining chromosomes. In contrast, insertions on the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> were present at high frequencies. Their potential contribution to Y degeneration is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{formation}} of the XY body at pachytene and expression studies of a few X-linked genes, the X and <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> seem to undergo transcriptional inactivation during mammalian spermatogenesis. However, the extent and the mechanism of X and Y inactivation are not known. Here, we show that both the X and <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> undergo sequential changes in their histone modifications beginning at the pachytene stage of meiosis. These changes usually are associated with transcriptional inactivation in somatic cells, and they coincide with the exclusion of the phosphorylated (active) form of RNA polymerase II from the XY body. Both sex chromosomes undergo extensive deacetylation at histones H 3 and H 4 and (di) methylation of lysine (K) 9 on histone H 3; however, there are no changes in H 3 –K 4 methylation. These changes persist even when the XY body disappears in late pachytene, and the X and <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> segregate from one another after the first meiotic division. By the spermatid stage, histone modifications of the X and <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> revert to those of active chromatin and RNA polymerase II reengages with both chromosomes. Our observations indicate that X and Y inactivation is extensive and persists even when the X and <b>Y</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are separated in secondary spermatocytes.
