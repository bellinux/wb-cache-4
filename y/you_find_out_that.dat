500|$|The {{music video}} {{was greeted with}} {{widespread}} critical acclaim. Music journalist Mark Pytlik wrote the visual [...] "marked an unquestionable creative apex for Björk's visual work, a perfect synthesis of form and content". IGN gave the video a score of 9/10, writing it is an [...] "utterly gorgeous sight to behold" [...] and [...] "just about perfect". Times Craig Duff called it a milestone in computer animation and stated that [...] "no robot had expressed the sensuality that director Chris Cunningham imbues in a Björk-bot in the video". MusicRadar considered the music video to be [...] "one of the most visually striking promos of Björk's career." [...] NME also praised the [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] clip as one of Björk's best, and particularly commended the wide angle shot of the cyborgs kissing as the chorus kicks in. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine dubbed it [...] "the perfect pre-millennial precursor to our current gadget-assisted culture of self-love" [...] and also wrote, [...] "When it was released, I thought it looked cool and {{stressed the importance of}} loving yourself. Now I think it's a terrifying and sealed-off nightmare wherein <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> you are the only person who will ever love you." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Scott Plagenhoef considered that [...] "the strongest single images from any video of the 1990s come from [...] ", also calling it [...] "strange and moving". CMJ New Music Monthlys Douglas Wolk called the video [...] "magnificent" [...] and praised it for [...] " [...] out the beauty of the song".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "White Horse" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because she understood the direction Swift wanted to take {{and how to make}} the video different than the prior ones they filmed. The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for [...] "Picture to Burn", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was not the person who someone was unfaithful to, but rather the one who someone was unfaithful with: [...] "This girl falls in love with this guy and he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] <b>You</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without even knowing it." [...] Swift chose actor Stephen Colletti to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series , where she acknowledged him to be [...] "cute", and later on One Tree Hill, where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character. Swift chose Colletti primarily because of his sweet and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. [...] "That's always the hardest thing, when someone has you fooled so much that you think they're never gonna hurt you. And then they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.|$|E

6000|$|Again {{the little}} twinkle showed in Larry's eyes. [...] "Well," [...] he said quietly, [...] "that {{you should have}} taken me when you had men of his kind to choose from means a good deal. I wouldn't like <b>you</b> to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had been mistaken, Hetty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want to 'tell,'" [...] said Kate. [...] "I'll be as {{silent as}} the tomb if I {{can only have}} the truth from you. All I want is that you shouldn't keep from me how <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> you really are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] she {{answered}} candidly, [...] "I {{knew nothing of}} the sort. How did <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> I {{was still on the}} ship, or that the ship was still above water? And even if you knew both, why should you risk your life just on the faint chance of rescuing a girl whom you never saw?" ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{things you}} CAN'T find out; {{but you will}} never know you can't by {{guessing}} and supposing: no, {{you have to be}} patient and go on experimenting until <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> you can't find out. And it is delightful to have it that way, it makes the world so interesting. If there wasn't anything to find out, it would be dull. Even trying to find out and not finding out is just as interesting as trying to find out and finding out, and I don't know but more so. The secret of the water was a treasure until I GOT it; then the excitement all went away, and I recognized a sense of loss.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not afraid," [...] she said. [...] "You {{will make}} {{inquiries}} when I have gone, and <b>you</b> will <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> I have spoken the truth.

6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] he said, smiling a little grimly, [...] "that the Vincents {{had better be}} kept away from your house until you have gone.

Yes, I {{think those}} boys guilty, and in the end <b>you</b> will <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> I am right," [...] added Job Haskers as he went off, smiling grimly to himself, {{as if it was a}} {{pleasure}} to him to have the boys thus accused.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid, Dinah, {{that their}} passions {{will be so}} much aroused at the {{wholesale}} murder of the whites that they will shoot every black they come across, man or woman, and you would be shot long before you could {{get close enough to}} explain why you had come. No, I think the only thing to be done, as far as I can see, is that you should go down {{from time to time to}} let us know how things are going. I do not think that the whites are likely to get very far along the road. You may be sure that when the troops started from the town news was sent at once to the leaders, and it is likely that they will move a great number of men down to oppose them, and will likely enough drive them back. However, the great thing for us is to know where they are and what they are doing. It is likely that now the whites have advanced there will no longer be any watch kept to prevent people, in hiding like ourselves, from going down to the town; if <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> that is so, we will put madame on her barrow again, and carry her down. Of course we should have to chance being met when going through the forest, but we must risk that." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{do not be}} astonished, do not be disheartened, if, {{when the}} trouble comes, there comes with it, as to Jacob, a more terrible {{struggle}} far, a struggle too deep for words; if <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> fine words and set prayers are nothing in the hour of need, and {{that you will not}} be heard for your much speaking. Ah! the darkness of that time, which perhaps goes on for days, for months, all alone between you and God himself. Clergymen and good people may come in with kind words and true words: but they give no comfort; your heart is still dark, still full of doubt; you want God himself to speak to your heart, and tell you that he is love. And you have no words to pray with at last; you have used them all up; and you can only cling humbly to God, and hold fast. One moment you feel like a poor slave clinging to his stern master's arm, and entreating him not to kill him outright. The next you feel like a child clinging to its father, and entreating him to save him from some horrible monster which is going to devour it: but you have no words to pray with, only sighs, and tears, and groans; you feel that you know not what to pray for as you ought, know not what is good for you; dare ask for nothing, lest it should be the wrong thing. And the longer you struggle, the weaker you become, as Jacob did, till your very bones seem out of joint, your very heart broken within you, and life seems not worth having, or death either.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2011 Census, {{there was}} a 20% rise in people who {{identify}} as Aboriginal. One explanation for this is: [...] "the definition being the way it is, it's quite elastic. <b>You</b> can <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> your great-great grandmother was Aboriginal and therefore under that definition you can identify. It's that person's right to identify so [...] that's what explains the large increase." ...|$|R

5000|$|Bogdanovich reminisced in 2004:The previews were edgy and {{the studio}} {{wanted me to}} take most of the drama out, play it more comedy and turn it more into a What's Up Doc?, which it really wasn't.
