2500|$|After a brief slump, Mantle {{was sent}} {{down to the}} Yankees' top farm team, the Kansas City Blues. However, {{he was not able}} to find the power he once had in the lower minors. Out of frustration, he called his father one day and told him, [...] "I don't think I can play {{baseball}} anymore." [...] Mutt drove up to Kansas City that day. When he arrived, he started packing his son's clothes and, according to Mantle's memory, said [...] "I thought I raised a man. I see I raised a coward instead. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to Oklahoma and work the mines with me." [...] Mantle immediately broke out of his slump, going on to hit [...]361 with 11 homers and 50 RBIs during his stay in Kansas City.|$|E
2500|$|Chesterton's {{fence is}} the {{principle}} that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood. The quotation is from Chesterton’s 1929 book The Thing: Why I am a Catholic, in the chapter, [...] "The Drift from Domesticity": [...] "In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists {{in such a case}} a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away." [...] To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: [...] "If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lisa Faulkner plays PRHO Victoria Merrick, {{who appears}} from Holby City first episode until series three, episode 26. The {{character}} was killed-off at Faulkner's request, {{who wanted to}} have a [...] "gruesome death". She added that [...] "it’s only afterwards that you really realise it means <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> even if you wanted to." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think that}} I shall go. If he--is married, <b>you</b> know--I <b>can</b> always <b>come</b> <b>back</b> again, and perhaps Pigott is right; the letter might miscarry, {{and there is}} so much at stake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{reasonable}} enough," [...] Cuthbert agreed. [...] "I expect the gates {{will be open}} {{in a day or}} two, and I shall go to England at once and try {{to get to the bottom}} of this matter. I should think the Prussians will let Englishmen pass out at once. Would you mind going with me as far as Calais?

5000|$|His brother Al {{had been}} signed by Capitol Records and Tom {{was asked to}} play steel guitar at a 1962 {{recording}} session. Buck Owens happened {{to be at the}} session and heard Brumley play, saying that he would hire him to play if he ever had the chance. Brumley lived in North Hollywood, played at clubs in the area, and moved to Kingsland, Texas, to work at his father-in-law's construction firm. There he got a call to play with Owens, and his reluctance to be back on the night scene and bars was overcome by his father in law, who told him, [...] "You know, if you don't do this, you'll wish you had. So I want you to try it. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> always <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to Kingsland, but at least you'll know {{what you want to do}} and won't be sorry".|$|R
5000|$|Several major country hits followed, {{many of them}} remakes of pop/rock {{classics}} such as [...] "Baby I'm Yours," [...] "Be My Baby," [...] and [...] "To Know Him is to Love Him". Among the {{new country}} songs she had hits with were the top tens [...] "There's a Party Goin' On," [...] "Good News," [...] and [...] "Darling, <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Always <b>Come</b> <b>Back</b> Home." [...] She also continued to have hits with cover versions of pop hits like [...] "House of the Rising Sun", a hit for The Animals, [...] "Reflections" [...] (different from the Diana Ross and the Supremes hit), and [...] "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman", an Aretha Franklin hit. Miller's last top 30 country hit was 1977's [...] "When the New Wears Off Our Love" [...] {{and two years later}} she made her final chart appearance.|$|R
5000|$|His {{acting career}} {{came to an}} end after an {{exchange}} with Steven Spielberg when he went to audition for a part in the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark. He once recalled a difficult journey to the studio followed by a lengthy wait: [...] "Eventually a rather small man came into the room. 'I'm Steven Spielberg. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> tomorrow?' he announced, not expecting a negative. 'No, I fucking can't,' I replied in traditional Glasgow fashion. And {{that was the end of}} my acting career." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The game's up and I'm {{out of it}}! Take {{my advice}} and clear out of it too, until <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> in better shape. Don't be such a fool as to try and follow me. Your father isn't one, and that's where you've slipped up." ...|$|E
5000|$|For {{the next}} few years, Jack Greene was a drummer, guitarist, vocalist, and master of ceremonies for the Troubadors' performances. He soon began serving as opening act {{on a regular basis}} for Tubb, as well as playing in the band. In 1964, Jack {{released}} his first solo record with The Last Letter. The song originally appeared on one of Ernest Tubb's live albums but drew enough attention that Tubb's record label, Decca Records, released it as a single. Another single, [...] "Don't You Ever Get Tired (Of Hurting Me)", followed in 1965 but failed to make the Country music charts, having the bad luck to come out {{at the same time as}} Ray Price's version. Tubb encouraged Jack Greene to leave the Texas Troubadors and pursue a solo career. Said Greene in an interview, [...] "Ernest told me 'Son I believe it's time to go.' But also said 'If you can't make it <b>you</b> <b>can</b> always <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and be a Troubador'." ...|$|R
40|$|Aloud, yes, {{read this}} poety out loud – to {{yourself}} {{if no one}} else will listen, or taking turns, as a shared project – indoors or out, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get a quiet spot. Try on the various voices & their outlooks. Perform them if you will. Experiment with putting on one character, then another. Figure out which voicings fit. Confer. Retune.

Note how the voicings grow to form a new world-view both positive & prophetic, but then retreat, regroup & grow again, though toward a different climax – operatic, tragic: fatal passion’s dream of deathless art.

You might ride off from the skirts of the forest; I would lead the hunt that way, and the three days' riding would bring you to Normady, for you had best cross to England immediately.

40|$|Abstract: This short comment {{confirms}} Longo's observation {{about the}} importance of symmetries for understanding space and time, but raises the additional issue of the transition from reversible to irreversible transformations. I have little to criticize in Giuseppe Longo's (2010) comment on my paper "The Self-organization of Time and Causality " (Heylighen, 2010). I can only agree with Longo's emphasis on the duality symmetry/symmetry breaking as a foundation for our understanding of space and time. Space, indeed, is characterized in the first place by symmetry, i. e. by the fact that translations from one point of space to another point can be perfectly reversed. The movement or translation from a position X to a position Y is the exact mirror image of the translation from Y to X. This expresses our intuition that space is something that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> freely travel in without making any irreversible changes, since <b>you</b> <b>can</b> always <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to the same place, i. e. point in space. Time, on the other hand, is characterized by the opposite: antisymmetry. A causal process leading from an event A to an event B by definition cannot be reversed: once B occurs, A is irrevocably in the past, and can no longer be reached from B. This expresses our intuition {{that it is impossible to}} travel in time in any other way than forward. In my paper [Heylighen, 2010], I have tried to explain tha...|$|R
