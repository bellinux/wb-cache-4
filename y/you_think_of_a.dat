500|$|Dear M. Rousseau, Bordeaux–Paris is {{approaching}} and this great annual event which {{has done so}} much to promote cycling has given us an idea. What would <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> training race which preceded Bordeaux–Paris by four weeks? The distance between Paris and Roubaix is roughly 280km, {{so it would be}} child's play for the future participants of Bordeaux–Paris. The finish would take place at the Roubaix vélodrome after several laps of the track. Everyone would be assured of an enthusiastic welcome as most of our citizens have never had the privilege of seeing the spectacle of a major road race and we count on enough friends to believe that Roubaix is truly a hospitable town. As prizes we already have subscribed to a first prize of 1,000 francs {{in the name of the}} Roubaix velodrome and we will be busy establishing a generous prize list which will be to the satisfaction of all. But for the moment, can we count on the patronage of Le Vélo and on your support for organising the start? ...|$|E
500|$|Regarded as an auteur filmmaker, Nolan's visual style often emphasises urban settings, men in suits, muted colours, {{dialogue}} scenes {{framed in}} wide close-up with a shallow {{depth of field}} and modern locations and architecture. Aesthetically, the director favours deep, evocative shadows, documentary-style lighting, natural settings and real filming locations over studio work. Nolan has noted {{that many of his}} films are heavily influenced by film noir. He has continuously experimented with metafictive elements, temporal shifts, elliptical cutting, solipsistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, labyrinthine plots and the merging of style and form. Discussing The Tree of Life (2011), Nolan spoke of Terrence Malick's work and how it has influenced his own approach to style, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> visual style, when you think of the visual language of a film, there tends to be a natural separation of the visual style and the narrative elements. But with the greats, whether it's Stanley Kubrick or Terrence Malick or Hitchcock, what you're seeing is an inseparable, a vital relationship between the image and the story it's telling".|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E

6000|$|He was out, too, when I {{called at}} his hotel; but once, I {{had the good}} fortune to see him, with his hat curiously on one side, looking as pleased as Punch, and being driven, in an open cab, in the Champs Elysées. [...] "That's ANOTHER tip-top chap," [...] said he, when we met, at length. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Earl's son, my boy? Honorable Tom Ringwood, son of the Earl of Cinqbars: what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that, eh?" ...|$|R

500|$|Kurtzman {{continued}} {{to correspond with}} Hefner and Playboy executive editor Ray Russell, who was interested in Kurtzman's idea of a comic strip suitable for the magazine's audience and suggested [...] "satire... as an excuse or rationale for a slick magazine to be publishing a comic strip." [...] Although single-panel cartoons were an established part of the magazine, a comic strip was unprecedented {{and had to be}} justified. Kurtzman submitted some Goodman Beaver strips and was surprised to receive a favorable response from Hefner, who liked the [...] "fresh and eager" [...] character. He especially enjoyed [...] "Goodman Goes Playboy", which featured a boisterous romp in Hefner's mansion. Hefner nevertheless insisted that the material was not right for his magazine, but requested an explanation of the character with a suggestion: [...] "Maybe there is a way of launching a similar series... that can somehow be related to Playboy". Kurtzman replied that Goodman Beaver [...] "could be foolish {{and at the same time}} wise," [...] and that he [...] "innocently partakes of the bad while espousing the good." [...] He further stated that Beaver's innocent, restive, and charming nature allotted him especial creative freedom. A week later, Kurtzman wrote to Hefner, [...] "What would <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> girl character... whom I could apply to my kind of situations?" [...] Six weeks later Hefner replied, [...] "I think your notion of doing a Goodman Beaver strip of two, three, or four pages, but using a sexy girl... is a bull's eye. We can run it every issue." ...|$|E

"Of course," [...] said I, [...] "when you say Chinaman, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{creature}} with a pigtail, long nails, and insanitary habits, {{and when you}} say negro <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> filthy-headed, black creature in an old hat.

6000|$|HE--I haven't struck 'em yet. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{interviewing}} <b>a</b> widow {{two hours}} after her husband's death, to get her version of his life? ...|$|R

6000|$|I only envy these people; I envy {{them their}} honest admiration, if it be honest--their delight, {{if they feel}} delight. I harbor no {{animosity}} toward any of them. But {{at the same time}} the thought will intrude itself upon me, How can they see what is not visible? What would <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man who looked at some decayed, blind, toothless, pock-marked Cleopatra, and said: [...] "What matchless beauty! What soul! What expression!" [...] What would <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man who gazed upon a dingy, foggy sunset, and said: [...] "What sublimity! What feeling! What richness of coloring!"

6000|$|... "After all, that isn't a great drawback. Anyway, I'm {{grateful}} for the trout." [...] Then, somewhat to his surprise, she abruptly changed the subject. [...] "I wonder what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tacit promise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, Edie, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> neat {{cottage and}} a garden, and a daily dole, {{and nothing to}} do but to dig a little in your garden when you pleased yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Fulkerson {{appeared}} {{not to be}} very strenuous {{about the}} attack on the novelist. [...] "Say!" [...] he called out, gayly, [...] "what should <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> paper defending the late lamented system of slavery'?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{it is as}} bad as that. It is {{much worse}} than that, if you knew it all. You cannot {{conceive}} how low we have fallen.

6000|$|But {{while we}} are hauling strange things up from the deep, suppose we take {{something}} that is not exactly a fish, but which is alive and lives in the water. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> living thing like this? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{may have}} the very model I want for them to-morrow. Little Nanina has just given me the strangest message. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mysterious lady admirer who offers to sit for the bust and arms of my Minerva?" ...|$|E
