Following Schaller, Dian Fossey began what would become an 18-year study in 1967. Fossey made new observations, completed the first accurate census, and established active conservation practices, such as anti-poaching patrols. The Digit Fund, which Dian Fossey started, continued her work and was later renamed the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International. The Fund's Karisoke Research Center monitors and protects the mountain gorillas of the Virungas. Close monitoring and research of the Bwindi mountain gorillas began in the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|In 1959, when Schaller {{was only}} 26, he {{traveled}} to Central Africa to study and live with the mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) of the Virunga Volcanoes. Little was known {{about the life of}} gorillas in the wild until the publication of The Mountain Gorilla: Ecology and Behavior in 1963, that first conveyed to the general public just how profoundly intelligent and gentle gorillas really are, contrary to then-common beliefs. Schaller also, in 1964, recounted this epic two-year study in The <b>Year</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gorilla,</b> which also provides a broader historical perspective on the efforts to save one of humankind's nearest relatives from the brink of extinction.|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since my}} first contact with {{chimpanzees}} in 1960, I have devoted {{my life to}} the study and protection of great apes. The gorilla, the largest and perhaps most peaceful of the great apes, once enjoyed the seclusion of vast tracts of African forest. Today, much like the chimpanzee, the gorilla is endangered {{largely due to the}} destruction of its forest Jane Goodall, Ph. D., DBE habitat, civil conflict and poaching. We {{have a long way to}} go toward reversing the gorilla’s decline. It is time for us to pool all our resources towards saving these magnificent creatures. I am pleased to lend my voice to the <b>Year</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gorilla</b> 2009, a global UN-backed educational and conservation campaign aimed at ensuring a future for this close cousin of humankind. ...|$|E
