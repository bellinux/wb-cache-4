500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{announced}} by Fox in July 2013 to premiere {{in the fall}} of 2014. In May 2014, the network presented two clips from the episode at their annual upfront presentation. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly about the episode, MacFarlane stated that the key to a good crossover episode is [...] "really about the character interaction. People want to see Peter interact with Homer. They want to see Bart interact with Stewie. In a way, the story in a crossover episode, while it has to be there, is never quite as important as how the characters interact with each other." [...] The Simpsons creator Groening added, [...] "In this case, it's two really vivid shows and seeing what they can do together. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them having a good time and <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Peter and Homer duke it out".|$|E
500|$|On the {{introduction}} of young Sherlock, Moffat noted {{that it was the}} logical course to take after {{the introduction}} of the Holmes parents: [...] "Once you've got the parents in and you've got the sibling rivalry and stuff, people start to think, 'well what was young Sherlock like?' You just want those things, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> those things, it's part of updating it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Aura", this set's opener, {{manages to}} be a {{multitude}} of songs at once, jumping from nosebleed bass to (Middle) Eastern-coloured tones, a Spaghetti Western monologue to a stars-bound middle-eight, from quite-deliberately provocative talk of slavery {{and the meaning of}} the burqa to mindless cosmic love waffle.

500|$|Though {{the lyrics}} of the song like [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me down on my knees?" [...] portray female helplessness, the video {{performance}} acts as a counter-text to it. When this line is sung, Madonna is shown kneeling {{on the road in}} front of the advancing car, then turns her head back while exposing her throat back in a posture of submission. However, her voice tone and her look at the camera portray a hardness and defiance that contradict the submissiveness of her body posture and turn the question of the line into a challenge for her lover.|$|E
500|$|Among the studio's action movies, one {{standout}} {{production was}} a 1927 Tarzan picture. Author Edgar Rice Burroughs declared, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{the personification of}} Tarzan of the Apes as I visualize him, see the film Tarzan and the Golden Lion with Mr. James Pierce." [...] The Film Daily reviewer wrote that the movie [...] "has a rather new order of thrills and atmosphere that might prove distinctly attractive." [...] The two-reeler West of Hot Dog (1924), according to historian Simon Louvish, contains [...] "one of Stan 's finest gags," [...] involving a level of cinematic technique that bears comparison to Buster Keaton's classic Sherlock, Jr.|$|E
500|$|Wadia {{warns that}} Yusef will {{ultimately}} get worse as time progresses. She said to Inside Soap: [...] "I was filming out on location recently with Ace {{and a bunch}} of women came over to him and said, 'God, you're such a horrible man!' It's funny because Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven't even seen the worst of Yusef yet!" [...] Wadia continued: [...] "Let's just say that what happens is the complete opposite of what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she definitely has feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her. I wouldn't be surprised if Zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that's going to happen." ...|$|E

500|$|Jon Favreau {{said it was}} {{originally}} his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man, with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in Iron Man. Millar argued the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical. Favreau concurred, deciding, [...] "I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is the guy <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> fight. Then you work {{your way to the}} time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope. You just can't do it." [...] Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin [...] "allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} {{theme in}} many of García Márquez's work is {{the setting of the}} village he calls Macondo. He uses his home town of Aracataca, Colombia as a cultural, historical and geographical reference to create this imaginary town, but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area. García Márquez shares, [...] "Macondo {{is not so much a}} place as a state of mind, which allows you to see what you want, and how <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it." [...] Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo, there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location. So while they are often set with [...] "a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland... otherwise unspecified, in accordance with García Márquez's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis." [...] This fictional town has become well known in the literary world. As Stavans notes of Macondo, [...] "its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers, politicians, and tourist agents..." [...] makes it [...] "...hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication." [...] In Leaf Storm García Márquez depicts the realities of the Banana Boom in Macondo, which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies. As well, One Hundred Years of Solitude takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom.|$|E
500|$|More modern {{reception}} for Vampyr {{has been more}} positive. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of critics have given the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 30, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Full of disorienting visual effects, Carl Theodor Dreyer's Vampyr is as theoretically unsettling as it is conceptually disturbing." [...] Todd Kristel of the online film database AllMovie gave the film {{four and a half}} stars out of five, stating that [...] "Vampyr isn't the easiest classic film to enjoy, even if you are a fan of 1930s horror movies...If you're patient with the slow pacing and ambiguous story line of Vampyr, you'll find that this film offers many striking images" [...] and that although the film is [...] "not exciting in terms of pacing, it's a good choice if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a film that establishes a compelling mood". Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The greatness of Carl Dreyer's [...] derives partly from its handling of the vampire theme in terms of sexuality and eroticism and partly from its highly distinctive, dreamy look, but it also {{has something to do with}} Dreyer's radical recasting of narrative form". J. Hoberman of the Village Voice wrote that [...] "Vampyr is Dreyer's most radical film—maybe one of my dozen favorite movies by any director". Anton Bitel of Channel 4 awarded the film four and a half stars out of five, comparing it to the silent vampire film Nosferatu, stating that it is [...] "lesser known (but in many ways superior)" [...] and that the film is [...] "a triumph of the irrational, Dreyer's eerie memento mori never allows either protagonist or viewer fully to wake up from its surreal nightmare".|$|E

500|$|The Daily Mirror {{described}} {{the program as}} [...] "far too funny". A review in The Daily Mirror was positive, commenting, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a brilliant spoof about Tom Cruise's faith in Scientology and his relationship with Katie Holmes, {{look no further than}} C4's Star Stories." [...] She commented, [...] "It's so absurd, even Tom will laugh." [...] The Advertiser described Star Stories as [...] "a surprisingly funny sendup of movie stars and pop groups", and noted of the episode's title, [...] "This week's episode is titled Being Tom Cruise [...] - How Scientology isn't in Any Way Mental, which should give you some idea of the vein of humour mined." [...] The Sunday Times observed, [...] "Just when you thought you might go a week without seeing a mention of brand Beckham, here is a documentary on their best friends, brand Tom Cruise, as recorded by the least reverential writers and least convincing lookalikes on the planet. Scientologists might prefer something on the Sci-fi channel." [...] Victoria Segal, Sally Kinnes and Sarah Dempster of The Sunday Times highlighted the episode in their [...] "Critics' Choice" [...] column. They commented that the show's producers [...] " [...] their own account of his career, his love life and his religion: It's all about aliens. Comedy so broad it barely fits on the screen, it is hard not to be amused". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun highlighted the program as his [...] "Top Choice". Adams commented, [...] "This ruthless but spot-on parody re-enacts Cruise's life and career through Hollywood gossip, rumour and exaggeration (his father is a midget, Katie Holmes a robot, Nicole Kidman a beer-swilling bogan), but is an antidote to every interview he's ever done." [...] Writing for The Newcastle Herald, Anita Beaumont commented, [...] "This is really silly stuff, but it is amusing enough to enliven a fairly dull night of TV." [...] The Sunday Mirror wrote that the program [...] "was as subtle as a sledge hammer". Simon Hoggart of The Spectator called the program [...] "a magnificently over-the-top anti-celebrity festival".|$|E

2500|$|In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were {{attracted}} to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rather than {{destroying}} film studios, videotape sales {{became increasingly}} {{important to their}} revenue. The press discussed the VCR [...] "and the viewing habits it has engendered — the Saturday night trip down to the tape rental store to pick out {{for a couple of}} bucks the movie <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it". Film studios opened new divisions to produce prerecorded tapes, and by 1985 their sales were about the same as box office revenue; the Associated Press reported that [...] "because of the VCR, even a bad movie can make money". Although the VCR received blame for a 25% decline in the summer 1985 box office compared to 1984's, and closing movie theaters, by 1987 it was credited with causing a record-high box office, as videotapes' popularity encouraged consumers' interest in films and watching them in theaters. Cable movie channels worried about VCRs affecting subscriptions, but began to offer more films for owners who wanted to build a home library, even encouraging time shifting by broadcasting the movies during the night so VCRs could record them while their owners slept.|$|E
