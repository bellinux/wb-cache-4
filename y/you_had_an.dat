500|$|The process {{used by the}} {{character}} Watney to produce water was accurate and is being used by NASA for a planned Martian rover. The radioisotope thermoelectric generator was also appropriately used for heat. When his rations begin to run low, Watney builds an improvised garden using Martian soil and the crew's feces as a fertilizer. [...] "We could probably grow something on Mars", said Michael Shara, curator, Department of Astrophysics, Division of Physical Sciences at the American Museum of Natural History. It is also believed that microbial organisms {{have the potential to}} live on Mars. In one scene, the glass face shield on Watney's helmet cracks; as oxygen momentarily drops below the critical level, he quickly patches the helmet with duct tape and avoids suffocation.

500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Carey {{announced}} a world tour in April 2003. , [...] "" [...] was her most extensive tour, lasting over eight months and performing sixty-nine shows in venues worldwide. Before tickets {{went on sale}} in the US, venues were switched from large arenas to smaller, more intimate theater shows. According to Carey, the change was made {{in order to give}} fans a more intimate show, and something more Broadway-influenced. She said, [...] "It's much more intimate so you'll feel like <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> experience. You experience a night with me." [...] However, while smaller productions were booked for the US leg of the tour, Carey performed at stadia and arenas in Asia and Europe, and performed for a crowd of over 35,000 in Manila, 50,000 in Malaysia, and to over 70,000 people in China. In the UK, it was Carey's first tour to feature shows outside London; she performed in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester.|$|E

2500|$|Ruppelt {{concluded}} that Adamski was a talented con artist whose UFO stories {{were designed to}} make money from his gullible followers and listeners, and he compared Adamski to the famed hoaxer, carnival, and circus showman PT Barnum. In describing Adamski's speaking style, Ruppelt wrote [...] "to {{look at the man}} and listen to his story <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> immediate urge to believe him...he was dressed in well-worn, but neat, overalls. He had slightly graying hair and the most honest pair of eyes I've ever seen. He spoke softly and naively, almost pathetically, giving the impression that 'most people think I'm crazy, but honestly, I'm really not.'" [...] According to Ruppelt, Adamski had a persuasive effect on his audience, [...] "you could actually have heard the proverbial pin drop" [...] in the restaurant as Adamski told of his initial 1952 meeting with Orthon. When Adamski finished his story, Ruppelt noted that many of his listeners purchased copies of Adamski's UFO photos that were on sale in the restaurant. At another lecture led by Adamski and other well-known contactees, Ruppelt wrote that [...] "people shelled out hard cash to hear Adamski's story." ...|$|E
