Company head George Lucas had {{requested}} a tie-in video {{game for the}} movie of the same name, which was under production at Lucasfilm. As was common with Lucasfilm Games projects, Lucas himself provided very little direction to the team. Labyrinth was the first licensed game developed by the company: earlier products, such as Rescue on Fractalus! and The Eidolon, had been original intellectual properties. According to project leader David Fox, working with a license [...] "frees you up in some ways and restricts you, too". With their adaptation, the team was not pressured to reuse events and characters from the Labyrinth film; but they [...] "felt obligated" [...] to follow the source material. Because they saw the film as an adventure story, they chose to set their adaptation in the adventure game genre. However, Fox disliked the genre's then-reliance on text parsers and syntax guessing, and so he created the word wheel menus as a replacement. They were meant to supply [...] "a limited set of words that still let <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things", in order to streamline the game without hampering the player's freedom. The game's visual design was shared by Lucasfilm's Habitat, a massively multiplayer online game under production at the time.|$|E

5000|$|Bullington {{signed a}} 1-year, $650,000 contract, {{with a team}} option for a second year, and {{reported}} to spring camp with the Toyo Carp. When asked why he decided to come to Japan, he said [...] "The last few years I had to start the season from the minors and wait for a players at the MLB level to have a bad streak or get injured. As a minor league, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> traveling and sometimes you need to move a lot. In Japan I can stay {{in one place and}} focus on baseball. And I also get to experience a new culture. Actually, {{there were a number of}} NPB clubs that contacted me during the season last year. That helped my family prepare for this year. And when I got an offer from Hiroshima, I jumped on it. My wife supports this decision." [...] He began his Japanese career 3-0 with a 1.96 ERA and 1 complete game in 3 starts during April, earning him the Nihon Seimei Most Valuable Pitcher in the Central League for the month of April. He went 9-4 with a 2.06 ERA in the first half, earning him a spot in the 2011 NPB All-Star Series. He pitched two innings in Game 3 of the series, allowing two hits, one being a solo home run to Takahiro Okada, and struck out one. Bullington finished the season 13-11 with a 2.42 ERA over 204 innings. His 2.42 ERA was the sixth lowest ERA in the Central League among eligible pitchers. He set numerous career bests, and threw over 200 innings for the first time in his career, turning in the best season of his career to date. On his first season in Japan, Bullington said [...] "I'm thinking that I'd like to stay with the Carp. If the team needs me, then I need the Carp. I like it here in Japan; my family does as well." [...] Hiroshima re-signed him in the offseason to a 1-year contract worth $1,744,300.|$|E

40|$|In {{the species}} {{distribution}} modelling (SDM) example {{which you will}} work through in this supplementary workbook, you will be measuring the species distribution by comparing the locations where a particular species, the harbour porpoise, was recorded as present during the surveys and the locations which were surveyed but where the species was not recorded. This will be done by creating {{what is known as}} a presence-absence raster data layer in a GIS project. During this process, you will make a number of key decisions that will have major implications as to whether your SDM project will succeed or not. This includes making decisions about the resolution at which you will sample your species distribution and defining the extent of your study area. You may also make decisions about whether to include or exclude certain subsets of data in your analysis to limit the potential for false absences within your data or to account for seasonal and/or spatial variations in the niche occupied by your target species. These decisions should not be taken lightly and may require that you not only know a lot about the ecology of the species you are modelling and about your specific study area, but also that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> background reading to ensure you understand the implications of any decisions you make at this stage on the statistical analysis you use to create your SDM. For the purposes of this exercise, these decisions have been made for you, but you should think carefully before applying them to your own data or research project. Before you start this exercise, you will first need to create a new folder on your C: drive called GIS_EXERCISES_ 3. To do this on a computer with the Windows 7 operating system, click on the START menu and select MY COMPUTER.
