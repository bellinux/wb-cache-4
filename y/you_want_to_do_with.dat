The album included popular songs from musicals identified by a poll on her radio show, in which 400,000 listeners voted.

Paige also appeared in concert in Scandinavia, Hong Kong, Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore.

[...] The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: [...] "Based around a points system and six-sided dice, GURPS succeeds better than most 'generic' games. The rules are flexible and its well supported - regardless of what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it, you'll probably find a supplement with some advice and background. The game suffers from being a little too detailed at times, and can get bogged down in numbers. Still, it's an adaptable system with some superb supplements." ...|$|E
