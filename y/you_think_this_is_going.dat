Try to put into words the kind of pleasure the film gave you overall, both at the time you were watching and now when you sit and think about it. J: Erm. I felt free somehow and very "oof"! [sound of sharp intake of breath] and um, it felt like you know those wheels, you know in a funfair, something like that when I left, very "woah-oah " [wobbling and physical instability]. [Javita, Interview 9] Hollywood in the 1990 s was a complicated place, and source of films. As well as the tent-pole summer and Christmas blockbusters, and the array of genre or mixed-genre films, through its finance houses and distribution channels also came an important sequence of "independent " films [...] films often characterised by twisted narratives of various kinds.

5000|$|A suggestive {{question}} {{is one that}} implies that a certain answer should be given in response, or falsely presents a presupposition in the question as accepted fact. [...] Such a question distorts the memory thereby tricking the person into answering in a specific way that {{might or might not}} be true or consistent with their actual feelings, and can be deliberate or unintentional. For example, the phrasing [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> wrong?" [...] is more suggestive than [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> wrong?" [...] despite the difference of only one word. The former may subtly pressure the respondent into responding [...] "yes," [...] whereas the latter is far more direct. Repeated questions can make people think their first answer is wrong and lead them to change their answer, or it can cause people to continuously answer until the interrogator gets the exact response that they desire. The diction used by the interviewer can also be an influencing factor to the response given by the interrogated individual.|$|R
