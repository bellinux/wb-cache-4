2500|$|When President Jimmy Carter in 1979 {{broke off}} {{relations}} with the ROC {{in order to establish}} {{relations with the}} PRC, Congress responded by passing the Taiwan Relations Act that maintained relations, but stopped short of full recognition of the ROC. In 1982 President Ronald Reagan also saw that the Six Assurances were adopted, the fifth being that the United States would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, United States policy has remained ambiguous. In the House International Relations Committee on April 21, 2004, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, James A. Kelly, was asked by Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) whether America's commitment to Taiwan's democracy conflicted with the so-called One-China Policy. He admitted the difficulty of defining the U.S.'s position: [...] "I didn’t really define it, and I’m not sure I very easily could define it." [...] He added, [...] "I can tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not. It is not the One-China principle that Beijing suggests." ...|$|E

'I tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> Captin,' said Mr. Levison, {{leaning over}} the back of a chair, and {{speaking}} with callous composure; 'I tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> me and my pardner are very willing always to assist you; but we want to know when the marriage is to come off, and that's the truth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better!" [...] {{said the}} good woman, [...] "I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> Miss Patsey, I've been a {{thinking}} over the matter {{a deal for}} the last week, and I've been a-trying my appetite, and a-trying my eyes, and a-trying how I could walk about, and work, and sew, and I just tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> Miss Patsey, I'm well!" ...|$|E
60|$|So he {{told his}} story to the genius, but I cannot tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> as I do not know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, almost grimly, [...] "I had {{a better}} reason. I cannot tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> but <b>it</b> may become {{apparent}} presently." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘But <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> father?’ said Meg. ‘Come. <b>You</b> haven’t guessed <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> And <b>you</b> must guess <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> I can’t {{think of}} taking it out, till <b>you</b> guess <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Don’t be {{in such a}} hurry! Wait a minute! A {{little bit more of}} the cover. Now guess!’ ...|$|R
60|$|In {{order to}} a right {{handling}} of this matter, I shall divide this head into these two parts--A. Show <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to suffer for well-doing, or for righteousness. B. Show <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to suffer for righteousness' sake. I put this distinction, because I {{find that it}} is one thing to suffer for righteousness, and another to suffer for righteousness' sake.|$|E
60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. Yes, and I {{will tell}} <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> It is {{his love for}} you, Lady Windermere.|$|E
60|$|ROUS. Sim Harness has our answer. He'll tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> We're {{waiting for}} him. He'll speak for us.|$|E
60|$|Before I {{proceed to}} an {{observation}} upon the words, I must, but briefly, touch upon two things: namely, FIRST, Show <b>you</b> <b>what</b> Jerusalem now <b>was.</b> SECOND, Show <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to preach the gospel to them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] {{she went}} on confidentially, [...] "something has come into my mind lately. I spoke about it yesterday, but I did not tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>You</b> need never be afraid of me any more. I understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was not that,' said Nell, glancing {{round with}} a slight shudder. 'Indeed I cannot tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> but when I saw the outside, from the church porch, the same feeling came over me. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> its being so old and grey perhaps.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Riga!" [...] cried Harry, enraged at his impudence--"I tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> Captain Riga; this won't do--where's the rhino?" ...|$|E
60|$|I tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> boys, I {{have built}} a great many ships, and I feel very much like {{building}} another.|$|E
60|$|Let me try {{to convey}} to <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> I perceive, what aspect this scheme seems {{to bear on the}} whole towards me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Weh-hey!" [...] {{said the}} tranter. [...] "I tell <b>thee</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> Dick. That there maid is taking up thy {{thoughts}} more than's good for thee, my sonny. Thou'rt never happy now unless th'rt making thyself miserable {{about her in}} one way or another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a chance," [...] was {{the gloomy}} reply. [...] "It {{was put on}} two covered trucks and sent up to London by the first train. Captain Griffiths can tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like, I dare say. You were down there, weren't you, sir?" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{has been}} no thought of {{removing}} General Fremont on any ground connected with his proclamation, and {{if there has been}} any wish for his removal on any ground, our mutual friend Sam. Glover can probably tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> I hope no real necessity for it exists on any ground.|$|R
60|$|To {{begin with}} the first, namely, to show <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to suffer for righteousness. Now that may be done either passively or actively.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> Bishop,' said Norris, 'I believe I'm {{going to}} be a rank failure this season. Being captain does put one off.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will tell}} <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> I {{want you to}} explain to me why you won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture. I want the real reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure; Anneke had {{something}} to say about you, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so much out of the way, I can hardly tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> now. Oh! I remember: she said 'I have seen Mr. Littlepage, and think he has grown since we last met; he promises to make a man one of these days.' What could t'at mean, Corny?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{for your}} {{exceeding}} minuteness," [...] he said, [...] "in describing the monster, I {{might never have}} had it {{in my power to}} demonstrate to <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class of Insecta--or insects. The account runs thus: ...|$|R
60|$|Thus have I showed <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for Jesus to {{come into}} the world--namely, to be born of a woman, to take flesh, and to become God-man in one person. I come now to the third question; but before I speak {{particularly}} to that, I will produce further testimony that we find upon record concerning the truth of all this.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, I tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> my lad,' {{replied the}} Captain, who had at length {{concluded}} {{on a course}} of action; 'I've been turning that there, over.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> Aby, you {{may just}} drop that, for I won't have {{the young lady}} bothered about it, nor yet the young lady's father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> old feller, {{this has}} been a reg'lar puddin' for us, an' I'd give a good deal to see another jest like it." ...|$|E
60|$|P.S.--I don't {{write my}} name very plain, but <b>you</b> know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> know, so never mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Most {{people would}} think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a very great service, Lord Oliphant. However, I may not tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> {{although}} I have heard all the details from my father-in-law, Mr. Goldsworthy. They were told in confidence, {{and in order to}} enlighten me as to the relations between Mr. Harvey and Sir Cyril, and as they relate to painful family matters I am bound to preserve an absolute silence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And suppose I was," [...] said Bunter. [...] "Do <b>you</b> know <b>what</b> I had seen? Can you {{conceive}} {{the sort}} of ghost that would haunt a man like me? Do you think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a ladyish, afternoon call, another-cup-of-tea-please apparition that visits your Professor Cranks and that journalist chap you are always talking about? No; I can't tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like. Every man has his own ghosts. You couldn't conceive..." ...|$|R

6000|$|This {{was not to}} be borne. [...] "I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> Mr. Neefit," [...] said Ralph, [...] "you'd better let me alone, or else I {{shall be}} off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> Mary. You expect {{too much}} from him. He has not had his own way with either of us, {{and of course he}} feels it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Netta," [...] cried her husband, half {{angry at}} her incomprehensible calmness, [...] "don't <b>you</b> see <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is?</b> <b>It's</b> terrible, terrible!" ...|$|R
