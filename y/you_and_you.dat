So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E

25|$|It's {{a complex}} {{question}} to answer, really. As musicians {{you try to}} find a name for your band that represents <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> never really do, because, basically, names for bands lose their meaning after a while. They become a series of sounds that you associate with people in music. The most important thing for a name is that you can imagine forty-thousand people screaming it in unison.|$|E

500|$|Bundy also {{confided in}} Special Agent William Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. Hagmaier {{was struck by}} the [...] "deep, almost mystical satisfaction" [...] that Bundy took in murder. [...] "He said that after a while, murder is not just a crime of lust or violence", Hagmaier related. [...] "It becomes possession. They are part of you ... becomes a part of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> [...] are forever one ... and the grounds where you kill them or leave them become sacred to <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will always be drawn back to them." [...] Bundy told Hagmaier that he {{considered}} himself to be an [...] "amateur", an [...] "impulsive" [...] killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his [...] "prime" [...] or [...] "predator" [...] phase at about the time of Lynda Healy's murder in 1974. This implied that he began killing well before 1974—though he never explicitly admitted doing so.|$|E

500|$|... "It's All Too Much" [...] was remixed for {{inclusion}} on the Yellow Submarine album on 16 October 1968. The vocals and handclaps were processed using automatic double tracking, so allowing these parts to be split across the stereo image. For this version, {{the song was}} edited down from the original eight minutes to a running time of 6:28, making it the longest officially released Beatles track written by Harrison. The edit was achieved by cutting a 35-second portion from around the three-minute mark, thereby removing the third chorus and the fourth verse (the last of which, beginning with the line [...] "Time for {{me to look at}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> to look at me", had appeared in the film), and by fading out before the final minute of the coda.|$|E
500|$|At Wimbledon, Raonic {{was again}} seeded eighth. He {{defeated}} Matthew Ebden, Jack Sock, Łukasz Kubot, Nishikori, and Kyrgios {{to reach his}} first major semifinal. He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's {{a lot of good}} things to take from it. ... But when you get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] You feel it in front of <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> want to grab it." [...] Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} Hmong {{refugees}} {{had settled in}} Philadelphia {{after the end of}} the 1970s Laotian Civil War associated with the Vietnam War. [...] They were attacked in discriminatory acts, and the city's Commission on Human Relations held hearings on the incidents. Anne Fadiman, author of The Spirit Catches <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>You</b> Fall Down, said that lower-class residents resented the Hmong receiving a $100,000 federal grant for employment assistance when they were also out of work; they believed that American citizens should be getting assistance. Between 1982 and 1984, three quarters of the Hmong people who had settled in Philadelphia left for other cities in the United States to join relatives who were already there. Vietnamese and other immigrants from Asia have settled in the city, many near the Italian Market area. [...] In addition, numerous Hispanic immigrants from Central and South America have entered the city, settling in North Philadelphia.|$|E

500|$|... "Walk Away" [...] is a piano-driven waltz ballad. Written {{in the key}} of G major, it is a downtempo song, with a {{moderate}} slow and bluesy tempo of 52 beats per minute. It {{is followed by a}} chord progression of EmC7 in the verses. Aguilera's vocal range on the song span nearly two octaves, from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of G5. In the track, Aguilera uses a [...] "sultry lower range". Lyrically, [...] "Walk Away" [...] is about an abusive relationship, where she uses a [...] "clever" [...] metaphor. At the song's beginning, the lyrics [...] "What do you do, when you know something's bad for <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> still can't let go?" [...] are spoken by Aguilera. In the first verse, she sings, [...] "Your love was like candy/ Artificially sweet, I was deceived by your wrapping". The track was described as a non-sense song by Amanda Murray for Sputnikmusic.|$|E
500|$|Goodnight Vienna {{followed}} in 1974 {{and was also}} successful, reaching number eight in the US and number 30 in the UK. Featuring musical contributions from Lennon, Elton John and Harry Nilsson, the album included a cover of the Platters' [...] "Only <b>You</b> (<b>And</b> <b>You</b> Alone)", which peaked at number six in the US and number 28 in the UK, and Hoyt Axton's [...] "No No Song", which was a US number three and Starr's seventh consecutive top-ten hit. The John-written [...] "Snookeroo" [...] failed to chart in the UK, however, when issued there as the second single from the album. During this period Starr became romantically involved with Lynsey de Paul. He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for Vera Lynn, [...] "Don't You Remember When", and he inspired another De Paul song, [...] "If I Don't Get You the Next One Will", which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because he was asleep in his office.|$|E
500|$|Leno {{began to}} drink heavily after performances, and, by 1901, {{like his father}} and {{stepfather}} before him, he had become an alcoholic. He gradually declined physically and mentally and displayed frequent bouts of erratic behaviour that began to affect his work. By 1902, Leno's angry and violent behaviour directed at fellow cast members, friends and family had become frequent. Once composed, he would become remorseful and apologetic. His erratic behaviour was often {{a result of his}} diminishing ability to remember his lines and inaudibility in performance. Leno also suffered increasing deafness, which eventually caused problems on and off stage. In 1901, during a production of Bluebeard, Leno missed his verbal cue and, as a result, was left stuck up a tower for more than twenty minutes. At the end of the run of Mother Goose in 1903, producer Arthur Collins gave a tribute to Leno and presented him, on behalf of the Drury Lane Theatre's management, with an expensive silver dinner service. Leno rose to his feet and said: [...] "Governor, it's a magnificent present! I congratulate <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> deserve it!" ...|$|E

500|$|Despite being a World Cup {{winner in}} the {{previous}} summer, Banks was dropped {{towards the end of}} the 1966–67 season in favour of highly promising teenage reserve Peter Shilton. Manager Matt Gillies was blunt, telling Banks [...] "we [...] think your best days are behind <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> should move on". Teammate Richie Norman told Banks that Gillies was pressured into the decision, Shilton having told the board he would leave the club unless he was given first team football. Banks was transfer listed at £50,000, the same price the club received for Derek Dougan in March 1967. However, many of the big clubs were unwilling to spend such a sum on a goalkeeper. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly showed strong interest, but could not convince the club's board of directors to agree to such a large fee for a goalkeeper. West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood was prepared to match the fee, but instead signed Kilmarnock's Bobby Ferguson for £65,000 because he had already agreed terms with Kilmarnock and did not want to go back on his word. Terms were instead agreed with Stoke City, a mid-table First Division side.|$|E
500|$|... "Bad Romance" [...] is an electropop and dance-pop {{song with}} house, new wave and techno influences. According to the sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a metronome of 119 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor, with Gaga's vocal range spanning from the low-note of E3 to the high-note of C5. The song follows in the chord progression of Am–C–F–C–G in the verses and F–G–Am–C–F–G–E–Am in the chorus. The song opens with Gaga singing {{a portion of the}} chorus, then transitioning into the [...] "Rah-rah--ah-ah-ah, Roma-roma-ma, Gaga-ooh-la-la" [...] hook, which—according to an interview Gaga gave for the Carpool Karaoke segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2016—is an abbreviation of the word [...] "romance". It is followed by the sound of drum beats and keyboards. After the first verse, the pre-chorus follows, with Gaga voicing the lines, [...] "You know that I want <b>you,</b> <b>And</b> <b>you</b> know that I need you, I want your bad, your bad romance". The full-throated chorus then follows, where she sings, [...] "I want your love, And I want your revenge, You and me could write a bad romance ... Caught in a bad romance".|$|E
500|$|Producer Oren Koules told horror news website ShockTilYouDrop.com {{that there}} are eleven traps in the film, the most ever in the franchise. [...] There is one [...] "trap" [...] scene in the film that {{producers}} would not allow in previous Saw films that they described as [...] "too violent", [...] "too disgusting", and [...] "just wrong". [...] Melton later confirmed that was the [...] "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a [...] "chain reaction" [...] with other characters. Gabby West {{was part of the}} trap. She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary! They put so much of it on, you can't see and they put it in your ears so you can barely hear anything. That was part of the prep for the film, which was really cool, to have a dummy made of yourself. But scary." [...] Over 25 gallons of fake blood was used in the film, which was two and half times more than Saw II.|$|E
