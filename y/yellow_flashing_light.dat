50|$|Since August 16, 2000, British Columbia {{has allowed}} LSVs on its roads, but this {{exception}} to the federal law was designed mainly for large slow-moving farm equipment. Although the ZENN was technically legal in British Columbia, the cars would have needed to be equipped with warning signs and <b>yellow</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> to distinguish themselves as slow-moving. ZENN Motor Company did not see these conditions as viable to establish a retailer market. After ZENN received its National Safety Mark, the province of British Columbia vowed to improve their support for electric vehicles, and granted the right to each municipality to make LSVs legal on their roads. As of November 2008, the city of Vancouver and the township of Oak Bay, a suburb near Victoria are the only municipalities to grant LSV use.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Peter Care, who had previously worked with the band on music videos for [...] "Drive" [...] and [...] "Man on the Moon" [...] in 1992. It features the band playing along to the song under bright blue, red and <b>yellow</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>lights.</b> Michael Stipe appears timid behind the microphone until the first chorus, breaking into an energetic dance. Prominent in the guitar solo, Peter Buck uses Kurt Cobain's Jag-Stang that he received as a gift from Courtney Love after Cobain died; he plays it upside-down as Cobain was left-handed. Singer Stipe's newly shaven head and bassist Mike Mills's new look (long-hair {{and the use of}} Nudie suits) prominent on the 1995 Monster world tour, were given wide exposure in this video. The suit seen in the music video was in fact owned by musician Gram Parsons.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Presently in work zones, {{standard}} barricade {{warning lights}} {{are used to}} provide channelizing and warning functions. These <b>yellow</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> are presently used for different work zone activities. Concepts for a non-standard barricade lighting system were developed and evaluated: <b>flashing</b> red <b>lights</b> when traffic is stopped or very slow within a work zone, <b>flashing</b> green <b>lights</b> when a work zone is inactive and traffic should proceed normally, expanding yellow lights when drivers should slow down and exercise enhanced caution, and sweeping yellow lights when lane closures require drivers {{to move to the}} right or left. Prototype units were designed and fabricated. A survey of driver understanding of these functions indicated that drivers would probably understand all of the functions but that the flashing red and green functions could result in conflicts with other roadway traffic control devices.

5000|$|Due to {{the many}} tunnels on the new railway line from Würzburg to Hanover, special rescue {{vehicles}} were needed. The Bundesbahn developed the Tunnel Emergency Train (Tunnelhilfszug or TuHi) as an external rescue system. In May 1988 the first TuHi went into service at Fulda. Diesel engine 212 244-8 was used as Locomotive 1 and 212 257-0 as Locomotive 2. The Würzburg TuHi followed in August 1988 using 212 236-4 as Locomotive 1 and 212 352-9 as Locomotive 2. Number 212 271-1 was held in reserve. All five 212s for TuHi were rebuilt between May and August 1988 at AW Kassel. Both TuHi are one-way trains, i.e. they can only be used in one direction. They consist of transport wagon 1, the equipment wagon, the fire fighting wagon, the centre wagon, the first aid coach and transport wagon 2. Locos 1 and 2 are also different. Loco 1 has a video and infra-red camera, two large and two small headlights and <b>yellow</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>lights.</b> Loco 2 {{does not have an}} infra-red camera. With effect from 1 January 1989 the five engines of Class 214 were reclassified, retaining their serial numbers. Official all 5 locos are allocated to Bw Würzburg. Both engines with the Fulda TuHi had [...] "Bw Fulda" [...] incorrectly painted on them.|$|R
40|$|<b>Flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>light</b> for {{pedestrians}} {{is considered}} {{as an alternative}} for ignoring red traffic lights by pedestrians. In the governmental policy to decrease the "small" criminal- ity the introduction of <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> for pedestrians has a high priority and therefore to decrease again the respect for red light for other road users. Alternatives as the electronic detection of waiting pedestrians are discussed, and a modification of the traffic regulations is proposed...|$|R
5000|$|As Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel is in a {{jail cell}} on a desert {{asteroid}} (his cell being secretly decked out with various lab equipment that he can hide from prison guards by voice command), his experiment bounty hunter, Gantu, must send any experiments he captures to him via [...] "molecular teleportation." [...] As seen in the series and the movie that started it, molecular teleportation consists of a large glass container lowering down over the object for transport. When the teleporter is charged, a swirling, <b>yellow</b> <b>flash</b> of <b>light</b> and smoke surrounds the object before it disappears in a flash. Another such <b>flash</b> of <b>light</b> and smoke appears in the destination teleporter where the object reappears. The glass enclosure on these teleporters are an absolute necessity as opening them will automatically cancel a teleport.|$|R
5000|$|London has {{two sets}} of {{numbered}} lights. The Hal Rogers Parkway, starting at KY 192 (which is not numbered, {{as it is a}} <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>light</b> for parkway traffic instead of a fully controlled signal) and ending at US 25, uses increasing westbound numbering. KY 192, starting at the I-75 interchange, uses increasing eastbound numbering until the Hal Rogers Parkway.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, a law {{was passed}} {{revising}} Oregon's school speed limit laws. In school zones, on roads with speed limits of 30 mph or below, drivers were required to slow to 20 mph 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, {{regardless of whether or}} not children were present. This replaced most 'when children are present' placards. If the speed limit was 35 mph or higher, the school zone limit would be imposed either by <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>lights</b> or a placard denoting times and days of the week when the limit was in effect. The at-all-times rule was highly unpopular with motorists and was widely ignored. In 2006, the law was revised again, taking away the 'at all times' requirement and replacing it with a time-of-day system (usually school days, 7 a.m. to 5 pm). School crossings with <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>lights</b> remain. In many communities, school zones are strictly enforced and speed traps in these areas are commonly employed.|$|R
5000|$|The alert button {{is used to}} {{acknowledge}} the passing of a restrictive signal. It also helps to release the emergency brake when equipment TBL1+ train stopped. The <b>yellow</b> <b>light</b> <b>flashes</b> when the train passes a signal showing restrictive aspects to request acknowledgement from the driver, and then remains lit until the train has not met unrestricted signal (but it may be turned off by pressingon this indicator).|$|R
5000|$|Marked crosswalks {{are usually}} placed at traffic intersections or crossroads, but are {{occasionally}} used at mid-block locations where pedestrian generators are present {{such as at}} transit stops, schools, retail, or housing destinations. In the United States, these [...] "mid-block crossings" [...] may include additional regulatory signage such as [...] "PED XING" [...] (for [...] "pedestrian crossing"), <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> beacons, stop or yield signs, or by actuated or automatic signals. Some more innovative crossing treatments include in-pavement flashers, <b>yellow</b> <b>flashing</b> warning <b>lights</b> installed in the roadway, or HAWK beacon—an overhead signal {{with a pair of}} red beacons above an amber beacon, when a pedestrian is detected or actuates the device it begins a sequence of amber flashing followed by a solid red, followed by a flashing red phase that allows motorists to proceed, only if the pedestrian(s) are clear of the travel way.|$|R
5000|$|In some areas, a [...] "prepare to stop" [...] {{sign with}} two {{alternately}} <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>lights</b> is installed in locations where a high-speed road (design speed usually at least 55 mph / 90 km/h) leads up to a traffic light, where the traffic light is obscured {{from a distance}} (or both conditions), or before the first traffic signal after {{a long stretch of}} road with no signals. This is installed so that drivers can view it from a distance. This light begins blinking with enough time for the driver to see it and slow down before the intersection light turns yellow, then red. The <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>light</b> can go out immediately when the light turns green, or it may continue for several seconds after the intersection light has turned green, as it usually takes a line of cars some time to accelerate to cruising speed from a red light. These are relatively common in areas such as the United States, Canada, Western Australia, New South Wales and New Zealand. Japan uses a variant signal with two lamps, a green one and a <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> one, for the same purpose.|$|R
2500|$|Some recent {{innovations}} in Australia are to provide crossbucks {{with a pair}} of <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>lights</b> at about [...] before the level crossing, called Advance Active Warning Signals (AAWS). This is done particularly where there are curves and other visibility problems on the road. [...] AAWS are used where road speeds are high, and braking distances are extended, or where the level crossing is obscured by blind curves or sunlight. Another innovation is to transmit level crossing warning signals by radio into the cabin of nearby vehicles. This would be particularly useful at passive crossings, which are not yet fitted with <b>flashing</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{road ahead}} bends south and then east, a four-lane divided road {{making use of}} the thin land between I-84 and the {{northern}} section of East Branch. There is one <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>light,</b> at the northern terminus of NY 121, and then two miles (3 km) later, still next to the interstate, US 6 and US 202 cross into Danbury, Connecticut alongside it just before the Saw Mill Road exit.|$|R
25|$|The Transportation Department of the City of Durham {{maintains}} Gregson Street, {{which runs}} under the bridge. The city installed height detectors on Gregson a block before the bridge. When an over-height truck passes by the detector, <b>yellow</b> warning <b>lights</b> <b>flash</b> {{to alert the}} drivers of trucks that will not clear the low underpass. Unfortunately, many drivers fail to heed the warnings, and crash into the bridge.|$|R
5000|$|The {{temporal}} {{sensitivity and}} resolution of human vision {{varies depending on}} the type and characteristics of visual stimulus, and it differs between individuals. The human visual system can process 1 to 5 images per second and perceive them individually, while higher rates are perceived as motion. [...] Modulated light (such as a computer display) is perceived as stable by the majority of participants in studies when the rate is higher than 50 Hz through 90 Hz. This perception of modulated light as steady is known as the flicker fusion threshold. However, when the modulated light is non-uniform and contains an image, the flicker fusion threshold can be much higher, in the hundreds of hertz. With regard to image recognition, people have been found to recognize a specific image in an unbroken series of different images, each of which lasts as little as 13 milliseconds. Persistence of vision sometimes accounts for very short single-millisecond visual stimulus having a perceived duration of between 100 ms and 400 ms. Multiple stimuli that are very short are sometimes perceived as a single stimulus, such as a 10 ms green <b>flash</b> of <b>light</b> immediately followed by a 10 ms red <b>flash</b> of <b>light</b> perceived as a single <b>yellow</b> <b>flash</b> of <b>light.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Institute for Perception-TNO {{carried out}} two {{studies on the}} {{categorisation}} and recognition of roads within built-up areas and on "red-light discipline".

Special emphasis {{is given to the}} proposed <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>light</b> traffic signal for pedestrians. Thereafter the problem of cyclists and moped riders neglecting the red traffic signal in combination with traffic coming from the right and having priority is emphasised...|$|R
40|$|This NordFoU report {{presents}} the results from a joint Nordic project investigating how to provide a good visual environment at night time for road works. As {{a part of this}} it shows how glare can be reduced and its adverse effects to the motorists mitigated. The primary aim of the project was that it should result in recommendations as bases for the improvement and coordination of existing regulations in the Nordic countries by giving • Proposals regarding glare limitation • Proposals for the requirements for yellow warning/flashing lights • Proposals for the requirements on work zone illumination both with regard {{to the needs of the}} road workers and to avoid the glare of drivers • Recommendations regarding specular reflection on wet road surfaces The background for the project is that road-works very often mean a restriction of the space available for the road users and thereby also a reduction of the passability. The passage of road-works is a complicated situation for the driver and therefore poses high demands on the traffic controls used (signs, channelling devices, etc.). To avoid disturbances in dense traffic during daytime road works are to an increasing extent carried out during hours at night when traffic volumes are lower. The requirements on the traffic controls are however considerably different during daylight than during night to provide acceptable visual conditions for the road users. A considerable difficulty for the driver who is passing the work zone in the dark is to obtain a visual impression of sufficient quality despite glare from meeting traffic, <b>yellow</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>lights,</b> and work zone illumination. This is required to get a correct comprehension on which speed to hold and where to place the vehicle when passing the work zone...|$|R
50|$|The {{tapering}} 6.7 m wooden {{tower is}} of the salt shaker design, painted white, with a red lantern and balcony, although pictures from 2008 show an all-white tower and lantern. It has a broad vertical red stripe to mark the range line, matching the stripe on the front range tower. Both {{the front and rear}} lights display an occulting <b>yellow</b> <b>light,</b> <b>flashing</b> every eleven seconds, and both have a range of 16 nautical miles. The light is automatic, but only operates seasonally between April and December.|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{the only}} means for race {{officials}} to communicate to drivers was through the usage of flags. With the advent of two-way or full-duplex radios, {{this is not necessarily}} the case. Most drivers racing on paved short track oval courses do not rely on flags; rather, they are informed of track conditions by their crew chiefs and spotters or by <b>yellow</b> / red <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> found on most oval tracks. Occasionally, though, some drivers must rely on the use of flags for information when they experience radio malfunctions. Flags are still used to tell the crowd of spectators what is happening. Dirt track and lower level racers are less likely to have radios than their paved track counterparts.|$|R
5000|$|In international-level motorsport, races with rolling starts are {{typically}} {{started by the}} starter changing the starting lights from red to green after a specified number of green flag pace laps behind either a lead car or safety car. In this case the red lights are pre-illuminated {{part of the way}} around the final pace lap and are changed to green once the starter is happy with the composition of the field. International rolling starts may be aborted by leaving the red lights illuminated and the displaying of an [...] "Extra Formation Lap" [...] board and/or <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each channel has a label {{identifying}} it and {{indicator lights}} and buttons to control settings. A typical channel has a busy light, a call light, select light, select button, and a transmit button. The steady, red busy light indicates another dispatch position is transmitting on the channel. The <b>flashing</b> <b>yellow</b> call <b>light</b> indicates a field unit is {{talking on the}} channel. The call light usually blinks for several seconds after a transmission ends allowing a busy dispatcher to look up from a telephone call and determine which channel the last message came from.|$|R
