How you conduct yourself with your ministry’s chil-dren, their parents, your colleagues, and others in the congregation and community is noticed and has a dramatic impact on how others will view you, your ministry, your congregation, and, most importantly, your Savior. May the Lord, who has called you to serve him in early childhood ministry, give you the faith, energy, insight, and commitment to let who you are in Jesus shine brightly and lovingly through you all year long. There is nothing better to tell on yourself! I have a file of little snippets of writings that I have gathered over the years.
