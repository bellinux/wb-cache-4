5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Blatty worked {{as the public}} {{relations}} director at Loyola University of Los Angeles and as a publicity director at the University of Southern California. He published his first book, Which Way to Mecca, Jack? in 1960, a humorous look at both his early life, and {{his work at the}} United States Information Agency in Lebanon. In 1961, while still working in public relations, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> Your Life, winning $10,000, enough money to quit his job and to write full-time. Thereafter, he never held a regular job.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> Your Life debuted on TV on October 5, 1950, Groucho had grown a real {{mustache}} (which {{he had already}} sported earlier in the films Copacabana and Love Happy).|$|E
25|$|He made 13 {{feature films}} with his {{siblings}} the Marx Brothers (Harpo Marx and Chico Marx), {{of whom he}} was the third-born. He also had a successful solo career, most notably as {{the host of the}} radio and television game show <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> Your Life.|$|E
25|$|From the 1940s onward Chico and Harpo {{appeared}} {{separately and}} together in nightclubs and casinos. Chico fronted a big band, the Chico Marx Orchestra (with 17-year-old Mel Tormé as a vocalist). Groucho made several radio appearances during the 1940s {{and starred in}} <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> Your Life, which ran from 1947 to 1961 on NBC radio and television. He authored several books, including Groucho and Me (1959), Memoirs of a Mangy Lover (1964) and The Groucho Letters (1967).|$|E

25|$|Marx {{was asked}} to apply the greasepaint {{mustache}} once more for <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> Your Life {{when it came to}} television, but he refused, opting instead to grow a real one, which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life. By this time, his eyesight had weakened enough for him actually to need corrective lenses; before then, his eyeglasses had merely been a stage prop. He debuted this new, and now much-older, appearance in Love Happy, the Marx Brothers's last film as a comedy team.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{included}} two bridges, two tunnels, and five trestles. After leaving the Colfax depot, the road headed north, {{parallel with the}} Central Pacific Railroad, then crossed Bear River, and into Nevada County. One of the first stations was at the town of <b>You</b> <b>Bet,</b> which serviced the Goodwin Drift Gravel Mine. The road proceeded into Chicago Park, a fruit and grape growers colony, and then continued into Grass Valley. All cars and locomotives had Westinghouse railway brakes, and cars used for passenger service had Miller Platform couplers. As the first contractor, Beatty, was unable to complete the project, a second, J. K. Bynre, was brought in; construction was completed {{in the spring of}} 1876. The inaugural train, from Colfax to Grass Valley, ran on April 11 and by May 20, the first train reached Nevada City.|$|E
25|$|Freeman {{left the}} BBC {{to work for}} Capital Radio from 1979 to 1988, {{presenting}} the Top 40 of the 70s, on 31 December 1979. He later revived Pick of the Pops on 13 March 1982 (now called Pick of the Pops Take Two, combining the current Top 15 with an earlier chart) and The Rock Show previous to that on 7 January 1980. He returned to the BBC and Radio 1 in January 1989 to revive The Rock Show and Pick of the Pops. This run of Pick of the Pops ended on 27 December 1992 but he continued to host The Rock Show until 23 October 1993, when he, with other long-serving DJs, left the station as it was revamped by controller Matthew Bannister. In 1990, he appeared as a celebrity guest on the television series <b>You</b> <b>Bet!,</b> made by London Weekend Television and hosted by Sir Bruce Forsyth. He {{was the subject of}} This Is Your Life in 1987 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.|$|E

500|$|On January 17, 2016, Attorney General of Texas Ken Paxton {{issued an}} opinion, stating that [...] "it is {{prohibited}} gambling in Texas if <b>you</b> <b>bet</b> {{on the performance}} of a participant in a sporting event and the house takes a cut." [...] On the other hand, Paxton stated that traditional, season-length fantasy sports were legal. Prior to the ruling, it was also reported that Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery, had been investigating ways of integrating DFS into the state lottery system, including attempts to pursue DraftKings as a partner for a proposed game which would have offered credit for the service as prizes. FanDuel ceased serving residents of Texas, but DraftKings filed a request for declaratory judgment on March 4, 2016, seeking clarification on the matter.|$|E
500|$|Although the Mattachine Society {{had existed}} since the 1950s, {{many of their}} methods now seemed too mild for people who had {{witnessed}} or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, [...] "The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World." [...] When a Mattachine officer suggested an [...] "amicable and sweet" [...] candlelight vigil demonstration, {{a man in the}} audience fumed and shouted, [...] "Sweet! Bullshit! That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play." [...] With a flyer announcing: [...] "Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> Your Sweet Ass We Are!", the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use [...] "gay" [...] in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the Daughters of Bilitis, and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the game}} spread {{throughout}} Texas, hold 'em {{was introduced to}} Las Vegas in 1967 {{by a group of}} Texan gamblers and card players, including Crandell Addington, Doyle Brunson, and Amarillo Slim. This is when [...] "ace high" [...] was changed from the original form in which aces were low. [...] Addington said {{the first time he saw}} the game was in 1959. [...] "They didn't call it Texas hold 'em at the time, they just called it hold 'em.… I thought then that if it were to catch on, it would become the game. Draw poker, <b>you</b> <b>bet</b> only twice; hold 'em, <b>you</b> <b>bet</b> four times. That meant you could play strategically. This was more of a thinking man's game." ...|$|E
6000|$|Poverty {{was another}} vice which the {{peculiar}} physical deficiency of Dammit's mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, {{and this was}} the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that I ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as [...] "I'll <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> a dollar." [...] It was usually [...] "I'll <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> what you please," [...] or [...] "I'll <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> what you dare," [...] or [...] "I'll <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> a trifle," [...] or else, more significantly still, [...] "I'll bet the Devil my head." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1965, [...] Groucho {{starred in}} a weekly show for British TV titled Groucho, [...] {{broadcast}} on ITV. The program was along similar lines to <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> Your Life, with Keith Fordyce {{taking on the}} Fenneman role. However, it was poorly received and lasted only 11 weeks.|$|E
2500|$|<b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> Your Life {{debuted in}} October 1947 on ABC radio (which aired it from 1947 to 1949), {{sponsored}} by costume jewelry manufacturer Allen Gellman; {{and then on}} CBS (1949–50), and finally NBC, continuing until May 1961—on radio only, 1947–1950; on both radio and television, 1950–1960; and on television only, 1960–1961. The show proved a huge hit, {{being one of the}} most popular on television by the mid-1950s. With George Fenneman as his announcer and straight man, Groucho entertained his audiences with improvised conversation with his guests. Since <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> Your Life was mostly ad-libbed and unscripted—although writers did pre-interview the guests and feed Groucho ready-made lines in advance—the producers insisted that the network prerecord it (instead of it being broadcast live). There were two reasons for this: prerecording provided Groucho with time to fish around for funny exchanges and any intervening dead spots to be edited out; and secondly to protect the network, since Groucho was a notorious loose cannon and known to say almost anything. The television show ran for 11 successful seasons until it was canceled in 1961. Automobile marque DeSoto was a longtime major sponsor. For the DeSoto ads Marx would sometimes say: [...] "Tell 'em Groucho sent you", or [...] "Try a DeSoto before you decide".|$|E
2500|$|Then on Cagewarriors.com, Hardy posted {{photos of}} Davis which {{resulted}} in many being edited in [...] "humorous" [...] fashions by forum users.
