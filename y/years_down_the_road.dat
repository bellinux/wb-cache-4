The party had one representative in Osterøy municipal council at the time.

[...] When the city's solicitor resigned due to a sexual harassment scandal, and council negotiated a $160,000 settlement with him, Reimer expressed frustration that the city's law department was not {{under the jurisdiction of the}} city manager, where she felt that the settlement would have been better-handled.

The soundtrack was recorded in partnership with 'Bostich + Fussible' (real names: Ramón Amezcua and Pepe Mogt) who remixed some of the Luzia songs composed by Simon Carpentier. In an interview with Billboard.com, Alain Vinet, Cirque's musical director {{the reason for the}} partnership was because [...] "Normally, the albums come out six months <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> or a <b>year</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>the</b> show opens, because when we are in creation, the musicians are really, really busy; it’s impossible for us to take them out of the creation.

[...] Rather than remixing all the songs from the show, 10 songs were chosen that represent 10 of the main themes in the show and although the melody is very similar to the live songs, the rhythm has been altered to achieve a more dance-orientated, pop-music style.|$|R
