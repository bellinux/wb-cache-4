Journalist Maureen Freely wrote of Millett's viewpoint regarding activism in her later years: [...] "The best thing about being a [...] is that she can say what she pleases because 'nobody's giving me a chair in anything. I'm too old, mean and ornery. Everything depends on how well <b>you</b> <b>argue.</b>|$|E

[...] Publishers wrote, [...] "Trump and Kiyosaki ... together are a strangely winning combination". The review concluded, [...] "Bottom line: these Messrs. Money-bags know their business. We're talking billionaires here, and really, how can <b>you</b> <b>argue</b> with success?" [...] Kiplinger's Personal Finance gave the work a critical book review writing, [...] "unimpressive book. Why We Want You to Be Rich is a thinly veiled infomercial for more financial-advice products from Kiyosaki, Trump and their minions." [...] The review noted, [...] "They sell positive thinking and can-do haziness -- specific details cost extra." ...|$|E
2500|$|Van Til {{sought a}} third way from Kuyper and Warfield. His answer to the {{question}} [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>argue</b> with someone who has different presuppositions?" [...] is the transcendental argument, an argument that seeks to prove that certain presuppositions are necessary for the possibility of rationality. The Christian and non-Christian have different presuppositions, but, according to Van Til, only the Christian's presuppositions allow for the possibility of human rationality or intelligible experience. By rejecting an absolutely rational God that determines whatsoever comes to pass and presupposing that some non-rational force ultimately determines the nature of the universe, the non-Christian cannot account for rationality. Van Til claims that non-Christian presuppositions reduce to absurdity and are self-defeating. Thus, non-Christians can reason, but they are being inconsistent with their presuppositions when they do so. The unbeliever's ability to reason is based on the fact that, despite what he believes, he is God's creature living in God's world.|$|E

40|$|The Constitution we {{have now}} is redacted. Any {{practicing}} lawyer will tell you that you cannot go into court and argue the Ninth Amendment. You cannot go into court and argue the Privileges or Immunities Clause. Until United States v. Lopez <b>you</b> could not <b>argue</b> the Commerce Clause; after Gonzales v. Raich, it is not clear <b>you</b> can <b>argue</b> the Commerce Clause anymore. <b>You</b> cannot <b>argue</b> the Necessary and Proper Clause. <b>You</b> cannot <b>argue</b> the Republican Guarantee Clause. <b>You</b> cannot <b>argue</b> the Second Amendment outside the Fifth Circuit. Whole sections of the Constitution are now gone. This is the lost Constitution. It is not a set of pre- 1937 results; it is a set of post- 1789 provisions of the Constitution that are, for all practical purposes, dead letters. Identifying the original meaning of these lost clauses and how their restoration would affect the Constitution as a whole is what Restoring the Lost Constitution is about. However it is labeled, this is a substantially different project than the one that is characterized—mischaracterized—as the Constitution in exile movement...|$|R

60|$|One can dimly {{reconstruct}} James's {{train of}} thought. He is in despair; {{things are going}} badly at the theatre, and life has lost its savour. His eye, as he sits, is caught by Elizabeth's profile. It is a pretty--above all, a soothing--profile. An almost painful sentimentality sweeps over James Boyd. There she sits, his only friend in this cruel city. If <b>you</b> <b>argue</b> {{that there is no}} necessity to spring at your only friend and nearly choke her, <b>you</b> <b>argue</b> soundly; the point is well taken. But James Boyd was beyond the reach of sound argument. Much rehearsing had frayed his nerves to ribbons. One may say that he was not responsible for his actions.|$|E

40|$|SD: <b>You</b> <b>argued</b> that {{algebraic}} generalism faces two problems: logical double-counting and the idler’s revenge.

That’s why I’m {{not yet ready to}} give up on fundamental individuals. SD: I think the two problems facing algebraic generalism are not as pressing as you suggest, so I’m happy to concede that your chalice is poisoned. Still, let me raise one worry about your argument against functorese generalism. Could you remind me how it proceeds? JT: Sure. Assume that quantifier generalism is wrong because it violates the prin-ciple I called ∃-Ground, which says that existential quantifications are grounded in their instances. If an individual a is F, this principle implies: (1) (∃x) Fx because Fa. The argument’s first stage argues from (1) to the truth of its counterpart in th...|$|R
