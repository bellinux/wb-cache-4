25|$|The steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail vise is the distance of the dog from the edge of the vise. Ideally, the dog hole strip should be fairly close to the edge of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling you to put more power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action vise the dog hole strip is still pretty far from the edge. So if you decide to use a quick-action vise as a tail vise, get the smallest good one <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>find.</b>|$|E
25|$|Around April 19, 2000 Blizzard {{released}} new screenshots of Warcraft III, {{these were}} completely without interface. These screenshots showed heroes {{and a number}} of abilities. More screenshots came around May 2000.

The gold display was still eye-shaped, but the last screenshot before E3 2000 shows a rectangle-shaped gold display. Most models, icons, textures and abilities that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> on these screenshots never appeared in the retail version.

The next major changes came between ECTS 2000 and E3 2001, when a different interface and the Night Elf race was revealed.|$|E
