40|$|During the {{development}} of a low cost industrial optical sensor an unexpected drift phenomenon has shown to be critical to performance. The sensor is based on LED's as light sources and the main source of error could be tracked to the instability of the spatial radiation pattern of the LED's. This instability due to the construction of the sensor introduced an error in the intensity feedback loop. Alternative designs including a <b>Y-coupler,</b> a scattering arrangement and a mirror beam splitter have been investigated and the results are presented...|$|E
40|$|Integrated optical {{devices are}} {{expected}} to play a promising role {{in the field of}} quantum information science and technology. In this paper, we propose a scheme for the generation of nondegenerate, copolarised, modal, and path- entangled photons using a directional coupler and an asymmetric <b>Y-coupler</b> geometry in type 0 phase-matched domain engineered lithium niobate(LN) waveguide. The nonlinearity in LN is tailored {{in such a way that}} quasi phase matching conditions for two different spontaneous parametric down conversion processes are obeyed simultaneously, leading to a modal and path-entangled state at the output. Assuming typical values of various parameters, we show, through numerical simulations, that an almost maximally entangled state is achievable over a wide range of waveguide parameters. For the degenerate case, the scheme gives a NOON state for N = 2. The generated entangled photon pairs should have potential applications in quantum information schemes and also in quantum metrology. By appropriate domain engineering and component designing, the idea can be further extended to generate hyperentangled and two-photon multipath-entangled states, which may have further applications in quantum computation protocols.

40|$|We have {{fabricated}} {{straight line}} structures and <b>Y-couplers</b> in X-cut lithium niobate crystals using femtosecond laser pulses. A systematic characterization study was performed initially {{to determine the}} effects of pulse energy on feature size. The optimal parameters were determined from experiments and simulations obtained using a two dimensional split step beam propagation method. Later the waveguides and couplers were fabricated using these optimized parameters. We present our results on the physical and optical characterization of these structures...|$|R
40|$|A {{monolithically}} integrated optical {{displacement sensor}} fabricated in the GaAs-AlGaAs material system is reported. The single-chip device {{consists of a}} distributed Bragg reflector laser, two photodetectors, two phase modulators, two <b>Y-couplers,</b> and two directional couplers. It is configured as a double Michelson interferometer and allows the determination of both magnitude and direction of a displacement. The detection of two 90 /spl deg/ phase-shifted interferometer signals also resulted in on improved phase interpolation of o/ 20. Despite the relatively simple fabrication process, the integration of rather complex optical functions could be realized...|$|R
