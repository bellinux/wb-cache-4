5|$|Nafaryus hears a rumor about Gabriel {{being the}} savior of the people. He and his family travel to Ravenskill to see him for {{themselves}} ("Lord Nafaryus"). In the Ravenskill town square, Gabriel is performing for the people when the royal family shows up. He continues playing at the emperor's request ("A Savior in the Square"), nearly bringing them all to tears ("When <b>Your</b> <b>Time</b> Has Come"). As he plays, Faythe remembers how she found a music player {{when she was a}} child and kept it a secret all her life, and as she and Gabriel stare at each other and fall in love ("Act of Faythe"). Nafaryus, though briefly moved by Gabriel's song, sees him as a threat to his rule and gives the people of the town three days to deliver their savior to him or he will destroy the town ("Three Days"). Arhys hides his brother and refuses to give him up ("Brother, Can You Hear Me?").|$|E

But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

He attracted attention by his stylish play, controlling the game with [...] "unhurried artistry". He refused to conform with the [...] "efficient" [...] style that dominated British football or the energetic, physical style that was typical of Rangers at the time. Indeed, although Rangers insisted that players tuck their shirts completely into their shorts, Baxter always let part of his dangle over his left hip.

500|$|In {{a review}} for Carey's 2001 album, Greatest Hits, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine felt {{the album was}} solely a string of Carey's most {{commercial}} and popular hits, however, not her best.

[...] In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "choice cut" [...] rating, indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth <b>your</b> <b>time</b> or money; Some (choice cut)s are arbitrarily personal, others inescapably social." [...] His [...] "choice cut" [...] was Fantasy (with O.D.B.) ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Christgau {{labeled the}} song as a [...] "choice cut" [...] (...) , {{signifying}} that it [...] "is a good song on an album that isn't worth <b>your</b> <b>time</b> or money".

While comparing the five The Neptunes-produced tracks on the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found it [...] to be [...] "rather embarrassing" [...] and [...] "cloying and crass", rather than [...] "effortless and effervescent".

500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Spencer Owen of Pitchfork {{called the}} album [...] "harmless and pretty... nothing else". Barry Walters, writing in The Village Voice, similarly writes that [...] "there's little on Parachutes that demands attention or punctures the pensive spell, and, unlike Travis's, Coldplay's hooks are slight." [...] In his Consumer Guide column for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau selected [...] "Yellow" [...] and [...] "Don't Panic" [...] as [...] "choice cuts", indicating good songs on [...] "an album that isn't worth <b>your</b> <b>time</b> or money." [...] Setareh Yousefi of Stylus Magazine felt that [...] "the finer moments of Parachutes are blended with some boring sappy songs", with Martin's [...] "powerful voice" [...] ultimately being [...] "in many ways wasted on songs that are alright but not bewildering." ...|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Rodney Dugue of The Village Voice {{felt that}} the album [...] "never settles on a sound" [...] and only cited its three Timbaland-produced songs as highlights. Although he found the ballads to be {{improvements}} from Rihanna's previous albums, Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani criticized the lyrics, particularly those written by Justin Timberlake, as an [...] "Achilles' high heel for Rihanna". Alex Macpherson of The Guardian found Rihanna to be [...] "ill-suited" [...] for its dance-pop songs and stated, [...] "The gimmicky samples and pounding beats bury her personality, and the summery reggae of her first two albums is sorely missed."

[...] Nic Rowen (Destructoid) noted fans of the genre will probably enjoy Nuka-World, but others will be left unsatisfied. [...] Tassi believed it was worth the $20.
