50|$|Yaw dampers usually {{consist of}} a <b>yaw</b> rate <b>sensor</b> (either a {{gyroscope}} or angular accelerometer), a computer/amplifier and a servo actuator. The yaw damper uses <b>yaw</b> rate <b>sensor</b> to sense when the aircraft begins a Dutch roll. A computer processes the signals from the <b>yaw</b> rate <b>sensor</b> to {{determine the amount of}} rudder movement that is required to dampen out the Dutch roll. The computer then commands the servo actuator to move the rudder that amount. The Dutch roll is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of yaw damper system installed.|$|R

40|$|A spinner {{anemometer}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the yaw misalignment and flow inclination experienced by a wind turbine. Previous calibration methods used to calibrate a spinner anemometer for flow angle measurements were based on measurements of a spinner anemometer with default settings (arbitrary values, generally k 1,d  [*]=[*]  1 and k 2,d  [*]=[*]  1) and a reference yaw misalignment signal measured with a <b>yaw</b> position <b>sensor.</b> The <b>yaw</b> position <b>sensor</b> is normally present in wind turbines for control purposes; however, such a signal is not always available for a spinner anemometer calibration. Therefore, an additional <b>yaw</b> position <b>sensor</b> was installed prior to the spinner anemometer calibration. An innovative method to calibrate the spinner anemometer without a <b>yaw</b> positions <b>sensor</b> was then developed. It was noted that a non-calibrated spinner anemometer that overestimates (underestimates) the inflow angle will also overestimate (underestimate) the wind speed when there is a yaw misalignment. The new method leverages the non-linearity of the spinner anemometer algorithm to find the calibration factor  F α by an optimization process that minimizes the dependency of the wind speed on the yaw misalignment. The new calibration method was found to be rather robust, with F α  values within ± 2. 7  % of the mean value for four successive tests at the same rotor position...|$|R

50|$|VSA {{combines}} the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and Traction Control System (TCS) with side-slip control to help stabilize the vehicle whenever it turns {{more or less}} than desired. ABS is an existing system that prevents the vehicle's wheels from locking up under braking, especially in slippery road conditions. For the ABS to work, the system relies on the computed input from a steering angle sensor to monitor the driver's steering direction, the <b>yaw</b> <b>sensor</b> to detect the momentum of which the wheels are steering (yaw rate), and a lateral acceleration (g-force) sensor to signal the changes in speed. At the same time, the TCS will prevent wheel slip during acceleration while the side-slip control stabilizes cornering when the rear or front wheels slip sideways (during oversteer and understeer).|$|E
5000|$|EBD {{may work}} in {{conjunction}} with ABS and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) to minimize yaw accelerations during turns. ESC compares the steering wheel angle to vehicle turning rate using a yaw rate sensor. [...] "Yaw" [...] is the vehicle's rotation around its vertical center of gravity (turning left or right). If the <b>yaw</b> <b>sensor</b> detects more/less yaw than the steering wheel angle should create, the car is understeering or oversteering and ESC activates one of the front or rear brakes to rotate the car back onto its intended course. For example, if a car is making a left turn and begins to understeer (the car plows forward {{to the outside of}} the turn) ESC activates the left rear brake, which will help turn the car left. The sensors are so sensitive, and the actuation is so quick that the system may correct direction before the driver reacts. ABS helps prevent wheel lock-up and EBD helps apply appropriate brake force to make ESC work effectively and easily.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{need for}} micromechanical {{inertial}} sensors is increasing in future electronic stability control (ESC) and other positioning, navigation and guidance systems. Due {{to the rising}} density of sensors in automotive and consumer devices the goal {{is not only to}} get high performance, robustness and smaller package sizes, but also to optimize the energy management of the overall sensor system. This paper presents an evaluation concept for a surface micromachined <b>yaw</b> rate <b>sensor.</b> Within this evaluation concept an energy-efficient operation of the drive mode of the <b>yaw</b> rate <b>sensor</b> is enabled.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{characterization}} of a vibratory <b>yaw</b> rate MEMS <b>sensor</b> that uses in-plane motion for both actuation and sensing. The design criterion for the rate sensor {{is based on a}} high sensitivity and low bandwidth. The required sensitivity of the <b>yaw</b> rate <b>sensor</b> is attained by using the in-plane motion in which the dominant damping mechanism is the fluid loss due to slide film damping i. e. two–three orders of magnitude less than the squeeze-film damping in other rate sensors with out-of-plane motion. The low bandwidth is achieved by matching the drive and the sense mode frequencies. Based on these factors, the <b>yaw</b> rate <b>sensor</b> is designed and finally realized using surface micromachining. The in-plane motion of the sensor is experimentally characterized to determine the sense and the drive mode frequencies, and corresponding damping ratios. It is found that the experimental results match well with the numerical and the analytical models with less than 5 % error in frequencies measurements. The measured quality factor of the sensor is approximately 467, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that for a similar rate sensor with out-of-plane sense direction...|$|R
40|$|A three-axis {{closed-loop}} attitude-control {{system for}} earth-observatory momentum-bias spacecraft is proposed. A horizon scanner and magnetometer are employed to measure attitude errors; no <b>yaw</b> <b>sensor</b> is required. Appropriate control signals are generated {{and used to}} command variable-strength electromagnets, which interact with the geomagnetic field to reduce observed errors. This system provides for initial acquisition, precession control, nutation damping, and pitch-axis momentum control.

Yaw attitude information is also required once every orbit.

50|$|The sport {{differential}} operates {{by using}} two superposition ("step up") gears at the differential, which are operated via multi-plate clutches {{each side of}} the differential crown wheel. When required by the software (using lateral and longitudinal <b>yaw</b> <b>sensors,</b> the ABS wheel sensors, and a steering wheel sensor), the control software (located in a control unit close to the rear differential), actuates the relevant clutch pack. This has the effect of taking the output shaft drive through the step-up gear to the attached wheel, while the other shaft continues to drive its wheel directly (i.e., the clutch pack not actuated). The higher speed output shaft produces increased torque to the wheel, producing a yaw (turning) moment. In normal operation increased torque is delivered to the wheel {{on the outside of the}} turn thereby increasing the vehicles turning moment, in other words, its willingness to turn in the direction pointed by the steering wheel.|$|R

40|$|A Martin-Marietta study {{comparing}} {{the application of}} laser, video, or RF sensors was conducted in 1982. The study concluded that video was the most attractive sensor (the video also {{could be used for}} operator monitoring). The Retro-Reflector field Tracker from the Solar Array Flight Experiment was chosen as a 'first generation' sensor and integrated with guidance algorithms for evaluation on the air-bearing vehicle. Results indicated that this sensor was not applicable for the noise environment posed by the multi-layer insulation used on most spacecraft. A 'second generation' sensor was developed to be used with a modified RMS target. This sensor utilized two sets of laser diodes to acquire three optically filtered targets. The targets were illuminated first with a 780 nanometer diode, followed by illumination with a 830 nm diode. The second digitized picture was subtracted from the first to get a low-noise image. The centroids of the retroreflectors were used then to uniquely derive target attitude and range. The sensor presently operates to 80 feet and within +/- 40 degrees in pitch and <b>yaw.</b> <b>Sensor</b> operability is a concern if the sun is within a +/- 40 degree cone angle to the target. The present sensor performance characteristics are less than 1 percent range error and less than 1 degree angle error.

Performance improvements also are anticipated. TRW currently is developing a system that utilizes dual cameras with simultaneous diode illumination. Although further development is being pursued, the basic system has proven sound, and the sensor is essentially ready for application...|$|E
40|$|Although motion {{processing}} in insects {{has been}} extensively studied for over almost 40 years, velocity detection in insects and how the insect brain computes the velocity of a moving feature, independent of its size or contrast, is a major enigma that remains unsolved. This study examines the accuracy of velocity estimation using two biologi-cally inspired models of motion detection, (i) the Horridge template model and (ii) the Reichardt correlator model. Various extensions and enhancements of these models are implemented {{with the goal of}} achieving robust velocity measurements. The template model is one of the prominant models of motion detection, which was proposed by Horridge in 1990. This Thesis further extends this model with the aim of improving accuracy in velocity detection using chrominance as well as luminance channels with various error checking mechanisms using different stimuli. Then the template model response is compared with Dror's elaborated Reichardt model and electro-physiological experimental results obtained from the fly visual system using similar stimuli in each case. A modified Reichardt model is shown to give a more similar response to that of fly neurons. In order to improve velocity performance of the Reichardt model, it is necessary to reduce contrast dependance of the correlator response as well as to make it independent {{of the structure of the}} visual stimuli. With this aim, the Reichardt model is then further elaborated to include contrast adaptation by a feedback adaptive mechanism and a clear reduction in contrast dependency is demonstrated. The deviation of the correlator response depending on the stimulus is termed as pattern noise. To reduce this pattern noise, the Reichardt correlator model is further extended to implement compressive non-linearity or saturation. It is seen that saturation has a profound effect on the shape of the pattern noise. Further studies on pattern noise is then performed in this Thesis using different stimuli at different speeds and contrasts. Work carried out in this Thesis on the affect of various receptive field shapes on the pattern noise reveals circular sampled arrays reduce pattern noise and hence, based on this result, a small 16 pixel <b>yaw</b> <b>sensor</b> using our elaborated model is built that shows promising performance with various potential applications.
