Horror tropes noted by journalists include the Insidious-inspired arrival of [...] "Blue Demon Dwarf" [...] and Madam Talbot's demonic voice, {{reminiscent of a}} similar voice in The Exorcist. For one critic, Pete's initial failure to believe the prank results in a memorable sequence that [...] "was a lovely statement about how old-fashioned horror imagery and well-worn tropes can be terrifying in the right hands, and plain ludicrous if <b>you</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> enter {{into the spirit of}} things".|$|E
2500|$|Australian Major General Jim Molan (retired), {{who served}} as chief of {{operations}} of the Iraq multinational force in 2004–05, stated that [...] "The Goldstone report is an opinion by one group of people putting forward their judgments, with limited access to the facts, and reflecting their own prejudices. The difference in tone and attitude in the report when discussing Israeli and Hamas actions is surprising." ... "as a soldier who has run a war against an opponent not dissimilar to Hamas, facing problems perhaps similar to those faced by Israeli commanders, my sympathies tend to lie with the Israelis." ... "But having stated my prejudice, I think I may be more honest than Goldstone, who seems to pass off his prejudices in a report that cannot be based on fact, and uses judicial language and credibility to do so. It comes down to equality of scepticism: if <b>you</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> believe anything the Israelis say, then {{you have no right}} to unquestioningly accept what Hamas says." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, 22-year-old Melinda Duckett {{committed}} suicide following an interview conducted by Grace concerning {{the disappearance of}} Duckett's 2-year-old son Trenton. Grace interviewed Duckett {{less than two weeks}} after the child went missing, questioning her for her alleged lack of openness regarding her son's disappearance, asking Duckett [...] "Where were you? Why aren't you telling us where you were that day?" [...] Duckett appeared confused and was unable to answer whether or not she had taken a polygraph test. When Grace asked her why she could not account for specific details, Duckett began to reply, [...] "Because I was told not to," [...] to which Grace responded, [...] "Ms. Duckett, you are not telling us for a reason. What is the reason? <b>You</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> give even the simplest facts of where you were with your son before he went missing. It is day twelve." [...] According to the CNN transcript, Duckett replied, [...] "(INAUDIBLE) with all media. It's not just there, just all media. Period." [...] Grace then moved on to a psychologist who asserted that Duckett was [...] "skirting around the issue." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Islamic prophet, Muhammad's first {{interaction}} {{with the people of}} Egypt occurred in 628, during the Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma). He sent Hatib bin Abi Baltaeh with a letter to the king of Egypt (in reality Emperor Heraclius) and Alexandria called Muqawqis In the letter Muhammad said: [...] "I invite you to accept Islam, Allah the sublime, shall reward you doubly. But if <b>you</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> do so, you will bear the burden of the transgression of all the Copts". During this expedition one of Muhammad's envoys Dihyah bin Khalifa Kalbi was attacked, Muhammad sent Zayd ibn Haritha to help him. Dihya approached the Banu Dubayb (a tribe which converted to Islam and had good relations with Muslims) for help. When the news reached Muhammad, he immediately dispatched Zayd ibn Haritha with 500 men to battle. The Muslim army fought with Banu Judham, killed several of them (inflicting heavy casualties), including their chief, Al-Hunayd ibn Arid and his son, and captured 1000 camels, 5000 of their cattle and 100 women and boys. The new chief of the Banu Judham who had embraced Islam appealed to Muhammad to release his fellow tribesmen, and Muhammad released them.|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the words}} [...] "and it bred worms and rotted" [...] in [...] a Midrash asked whether {{anything}} exists that first produces worms and then rots (implying that surely, rot precedes worms). Answering in the negative, the Midrash taught that God wished to reveal to people the deeds {{of those who}} disobeyed and saved the manna, so God caused many worms to breed during that night so that the sinners should {{not be able to}} smell the staleness of the manna in the evening and throw it out. The Midrash told that Moses became so angry with them that he forgot to tell them to gather two omers for each person on the sixth day. So when they went out and gathered on the sixth day and found a double portion, the princes told Moses, as [...] reports, [...] "And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses." [...] The Midrash noted that Moses told them (in [...] ), [...] "This is that which the Lord has spoken," [...] not [...] "which I have spoken," [...] because Moses had forgotten. For this reason, the Midrash taught, in [...] God asked, [...] "How long will <b>you</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> keep My commandments and My laws?" [...] including Moses among them (as Moses should not have given vent to his anger, thereby forgetting God’s command).|$|E
2500|$|The United States Senate finally {{ratified}} the Treaty of Payne's Landing in April 1834. The treaty {{had given the}} Seminoles three years to move west of the Mississippi. The government interpreted the three years as starting 1832, and expected the Seminoles to move in 1835. Fort King was reopened in 1834. A new Seminole agent, Wiley Thompson, had been appointed in 1834, and the task of persuading the Seminoles to move fell to him. He called the chiefs together at Fort King in October 1834 {{to talk to them}} about the removal to the west. The Seminoles informed Thompson that they had no intention of moving, and that they did not feel bound by the Treaty of Payne's Landing. Thompson requested reinforcements for Fort King and Fort Brooke, reporting that, [...] "the Indians after they had received the Annuity, purchased an unusually large quantity of Powder & Lead." [...] General Clinch also warned Washington that the Seminoles did not intend to move, and that more troops would be needed to force them to move. In March 1835 Thompson called the chiefs together to read a letter from President Andrew Jackson to them. In his letter, Jackson said, [...] "Should <b>you</b> ... <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> move, I have then directed the Commanding officer to remove you by force." [...] The chiefs asked for thirty days to respond. A month later the Seminole chiefs told Thompson that they would not move west. Thompson and the chiefs began arguing, and General Clinch had to intervene to prevent bloodshed. Eventually, eight of the chiefs agreed to move west, but asked to delay the move {{until the end of the}} year, and Thompson and Clinch agreed.|$|E
