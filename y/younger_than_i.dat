5|$|When I met him for {{the first}} time he was a few years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am now, and I was barely on the edge of manhood. He drew me into a vortex of his endless campaigns and projects... He {{introduced}} me to Bach and Brahms, and to the importance of maintaining a balance in life between the pursuit of our individual pleasures and engagements in, and responsibility for, the social condition. He believed that no class, caste or genre of people were exempt from this obligation.|$|E
500|$|In one of {{his final}} interviews, Carradine stated that at 71, he was still [...] "in {{excellent}} shape," [...] attributing it to a good diet and having a youthful circle of friends. [...] "Everybody that I know is at least 10 or 20 years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am. My wife Annie is 24 years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am. My daughter asks why I don't hang with women my age and I say, 'Most of the women my age are a lot older than me! ...|$|E
500|$|Bell stated {{she never}} thought of herself as womanly because [...] "I always play and look and act 10 years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am," [...] however, she said, [...] "Something magical {{happened}} when I turned 25—I {{looked in the mirror}} and was like, You might not get carded for an R-rated movie anymore. Like I didn't have a little stick figure anymore." [...] Bell has said that many of her characters are tomboys because she was [...] "not homely enough to play the nerdy girl and not nearly pretty enough to play the pretty girl".|$|E
6000|$|... "If you had lived, my dear, you {{and your}} England would have talked with a <b>younger</b> Germany--better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> can ever do...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord! I'm a <b>younger</b> man <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was a {{few days}} ago. Before the snow flies? That's hardly another month. Pan, how'll we travel?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "They {{told us to}} {{keep our}} lights on for the next contestant, who was more <b>than</b> 10 years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> me. <b>I</b> refused and was taken off." ...|$|R
2500|$|Mel Gibson {{was cast}} as English settler John Smith {{following}} {{a desire to}} make [...] "something for my kids." [...] In a notable contrast to previous voice actors for Disney animated features, Gibson provided the singing voice for his character, which the actor has described as {{the most difficult part}} of his role. Christian Bale auditioned for the role of Thomas. As he explained in an interview with Disney Adventures, [...] "the directors played with Thomas being Irish and Scottish and <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, so I had to raise my voice and do different accents. But the more we did it, the more he became like me--older and English." [...] Richard White, the voice of Gaston in Beauty and the Beast was supposed to voice Ratcliffe, but the crew was worried he might sound too much like Gaston, so he was replaced by his co-star David Ogden Stiers. Russell Means was cast as Chief Powhatan, though he expressed displeasure with the script in that Native Americans addressed each other using proper names rather than the traditional [...] "my father" [...] or [...] "my friend". Indigenous Canadian First Nation actor Gordon Tootoosis was also cast as the tribal shaman Nekata.|$|E
60|$|Shaved off his {{moustache}} again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look younger. He {{does look}} balmy. <b>Younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, you {{say that}} {{because you are a}} child yet, and do not know. You are even <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> thought, perhaps. How old are you, dear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Diamine! That is just my own case, Signore. Were {{the letter}} for me, now the old should not know its <b>young</b> quicker <b>than</b> <b>I</b> would {{come at the}} truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, you {{are quite}} out of breath, miss; and your cheeks!... I hope you haven't been having words. A better-spoken <b>young</b> fellow <b>than</b> <b>I</b> had fancied; and I'm sure I ask his pardon for the 'gentleman.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Tears of mingled rage, grief, and {{helplessness}} {{came into}} my eyes as I spoke thus hotly, and I wheeled around quickly lest this stranger, seeing them, should set me down for a <b>younger</b> lad <b>than</b> <b>I</b> really was.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{how is it}} that you, who are {{at least}} eight years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, should argue as an old {{counsellor}} rather than a young ensign?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless my soul!" [...] {{said the}} baronet, who had now {{followed}} the ladies into the room. [...] "Dead! Why, Fred, {{he was five}} years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{or you may}} not," [...] the {{man said}} doggedly. [...] "You are <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, and maybe can run faster. I ain't agoing to chance it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of {{course you}} are. Arsenius spoke truth. I saw him buy you at Ravenna, just fifteen years ago. I bought your sister {{at the same}} time. She is two-and-twenty now. You were four years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> her, <b>I</b> should say.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you gave}} him his chance. We can't forget this. George was <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> me. <b>I</b> have no other brother, and was very fond of him. Indeed, I think we owe you much, and my mother is anxious to give you her thanks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, we {{all came}} out here to be great boys, didn't we? I am sure you look a dozen years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> when <b>I</b> last saw you, Mrs. Grandmother. By-the-by, it was a bold stroke to {{encumber}} yourself with that brat; what's become of him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet Edith, who is <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I,</b> {{seems to}} be too old for them: how do you arrange that? My mother's society will make me older," [...] Rose replied.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, you are <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am. I {{dare say}} {{you are one of}} the men who ran after Alcharisi. But she married off and left you all in the lurch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Andrew slowly; [...] "I {{never liked}} anybody quite as much. But that's {{all there is}} to it. She's much <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, and she'll {{probably}} marry Dick." ...|$|E
6000|$|That word [...] "Youth," [...] as {{the reader}} has perhaps already guessed, was my wife's pet name for me. It was gently satirical, but also affectionate. I had certain mental and {{material}} peculiarities and customs proper {{to a much}} <b>younger</b> person <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Passmore, I'll {{leave this}} matter to you," [...] {{answered}} the elderly gentleman. [...] "You know those <b>young</b> men better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> do." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked in}} 2007 how well Reality Bites had aged, Janeane Garofalo replied, [...] "I {{think it means}} a lot more to people <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> me. <b>I</b> was not the target audience. I was 29 playing a 21-year-old, so I don't think I {{understand}} why younger people like it." ...|$|R
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. At all events, madam, I may remind you, if {{you come}} to capping ages, that {{whatever}} your secondaries and tertiaries may be, you are <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am.|$|E
6000|$|... "Palliser {{was twenty}} years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> and {{of at least}} equal build and strength," [...] he said. [...] "It was not my fault that he seemed unable to defend himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her silence {{admitted}} it. [...] "But still," [...] {{she said}} after a long pause, [...] "there are other girls, <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, in these things. They talk about--oh, all sorts of things. Freely...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More bright <b>young</b> careers <b>than</b> <b>I</b> care {{to think}} of," [...] said Psmith, [...] "have been ruined by the fatal {{practice}} of talking shop at dinner. But {{now that we}} are through, Comrade Windsor, by all means let us have it. What's the name which Comrade Gooch so eagerly divulged?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{baby was}} so much <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> I!" [...] <b>I</b> cried, going back on my {{recollections}} once more. [...] "How could he ever manage to make the dates come right again?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Lady Wu {{agreed with}} Zhou Yu and she said, [...] "What Gongjin said is true. Gongjin {{was around the}} same age as Bofu as he was only a month <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> Bofu. <b>I</b> regard Gongjin as a son, so you should treat him like an elder brother." [...] Sun Quan heeded their advice and did not send a hostage to Cao Cao.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your reverence is right," [...] said Stephen, [...] "he is {{twelve years}} old. He is two years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, {{and my father}} gave him to me {{when he was a}} little whelp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “For two reasons,” she condescended graciously. “First of {{all because}} Mr. Mills {{told me that}} you were much more mature than one would expect. In fact you look much <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was {{prepared}} for.” ...|$|E
6000|$|He mused, [...] "You're <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am. Your {{lips are}} for songs about rivers {{in the morning}} and lakes at twilight. I don't see how anybody could ever hurt you. [...] . Yes. We better go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By George!' said Mr. Bounderby, 'when I {{was four}} or five years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> you, <b>I</b> had worse bruises upon me than ten oils, twenty oils, forty oils, would have rubbed off. I didn't get 'em by posture-making, but by being banged about. There was no rope- dancing for me; I danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Emily still {{took the}} lead. [...] "Why {{do you come}} here?" [...] she asked. [...] "Who {{ever heard of a}} girl joining a new school just before the holidays? You are {{nineteen}} years old, are you? I'm a year <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> you--and <b>I</b> have finished my education. The next big girl in the room is a year <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> me--and she has finished her education. What can you possibly have left to learn at your age?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> was <b>younger</b> even <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am now," [...] {{said the}} Minor Poet, [...] "I thought {{a good deal}} of marriage--very young men do. My wife, I told myself, must be a woman of mind. Yet, curiously, of all the women I have ever loved, no single one has been {{remarkable}} for intellect-- present company, as usual, of course excepted." ...|$|R
