5|$|From 1899 to 1901 Koht {{worked as}} a {{substitute}} at the University Library of Oslo, and part-time as a school teacher. He was also engaged by Gustav Storm {{to help him with}} publishing the source text Regesta Norvegica. In 1908, after eight <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> Koht completed the two last volumes of Norsk Forfatter-lexikon, a biographical dictionary of Norwegian writers. However, it was a posthumous work, the principal authorJens Braage Halvorsenhaving died in 1900.|$|E

5|$|The National Capital Development Commission (NCDC), {{formed in}} 1957 with {{executive}} powers, ended {{four decades of}} disputes over the shape and design of Lake Burley Griffin—the centrepiece of Griffin's design—and construction was completed in1964 after four <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The completion of the lake finally laid the platform {{for the development of}} Griffin's Parliamentary Triangle. Since the initial construction of the lake, various buildings of national importance have been constructed on its shores.|$|E

5|$|Ashmole {{embarked}} on further catalogues, {{including one of}} the Roman coin collection of the Bodleian Library, which he finally completed in 1666 after eight <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> It may have taken so long because Ashmole's progress was interrupted by the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, when Ashmole's loyalty was richly rewarded with political offices. He was appointed Secretary and Clerk of the Courts of Surinam and Comptroller of the White Office. While these two titles {{do not seem to}} have provided either an income or any specific duties, he also became Commissioner and then Comptroller for the Excise in London, and later was made the Accountant-General of the Excise, a position that made him responsible for {{a large portion of the}} King's revenue. These latter posts yielded him considerable income as well as considerable power of patronage.|$|E
5|$|At the 1932 occasion, Tesla {{claimed he}} had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays. In 1933, at age 77, Tesla told reporters that, after thirty-five <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> {{he was on the}} verge of {{producing}} proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was “violently opposed” to Einsteinian physics, and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.|$|E
5|$|Gossip {{was also}} a noted writer. His {{treatise}} The Chess-Player's Manual—A Complete Guide to Chess, a 900-page tome published in 1874 after several <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> was harshly received by the critics, largely because he had included a number of informal skittles games that he had (atypically) won against stronger players. As a result, Gossip developed a lifelong enmity toward chess critics, whom he often attacked ferociously in his books. However, his 1879 book Theory of the Chess Openings was well received. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Chess Champion, wrote that the 1888 edition of The Chess-Player's Manual {{was one of the}} best available books on the game. Thanks in part to a 122-page appendix by S. Lipschütz, it became one of the standard opening works of the time.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, for the country's centennial, {{the venue}} was inaugurated as the Jubilee Stadium with an {{unofficial}} match between Belgium and the Netherlands. At that time, the stadium had {{a capacity of}} 75,000. In 1946, it was renamed Heysel Stadium after its city quarter. This new name became associated with the tragedy preceding the 1985 European Cup final between Juventus and Liverpool; 39 spectators died after riots in the then antiquated building. Three years after the disaster, plans were unveiled for a renovation; in 1995, after two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> the modernised stadium was named after the late King Baudouin. In May 2013, the Brussels-Capital Region announced that the King Baudouin Stadium would be replaced by Eurostadium, elsewhere on the Heysel Plateau; two years later, a 2019 date was set for the stadium's completion.|$|E
5|$|In late 1992, the Dangerous Journeys RPG was {{released}} by Games Designer Workshop, but TSR immediately applied for an injunction against the entire Dangerous Journeys RPG and the Mythus setting, arguing that Dangerous Journeys was based on D and AD. Although the injunction failed, TSR moved forward with litigation. Gygax believed the legal action was without merit and fuelled by Lorraine Williams' personal enmity, but NEC and JVC both withdrew from the project, killing the Mythus computer game. By 1994, the legal costs associated with many months of pretrial discovery had drained all of Gygax's resources; believing that TSR was also suffering, Gygax offered to settle. In the end, TSR paid Gygax for the complete rights to Dangerous Journeys and Mythus. Although Gygax was well compensated for his <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on Dangerous Journeys and Mythus, neither was ever published—TSR immediately and permanently shelved them.|$|E

5|$|Stead {{began writing}} the novel in 2002, but her first draft was {{confusing}} and unorganized.

Reviewers praised the description of Gracehope and main characters, as well as the performances of Coleen Marlo and David Ackroyd who voiced Thea and Peter in a subsequent audiobook publication of First Light.|$|E
