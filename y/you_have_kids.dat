50|$|In 1996 Wolpert and The Family Channel {{teamed up}} for two series. One was Wait 'til <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Kids,</b> a series based on The Parent Game.

I just want the sense of 'we can't pretend they're not out there anymore... Embrace the autistic kids that you're going to find in your lives now because it's a growing population and we isolate them or we love them. It's a choice, and Days of Our Lives is choosing love.

5000|$|Following matter-of-fact {{comments}} made by judge Matt Preston about Marco's son's admitted $500,000 splurge of his father's money on drugs and prostitution, Marco joined the rival program Hell's Kitchen Australia in retaliation. In 2016, whilst on The Kyle and Jackie O Show Preston was asked about Marco Jr.’s time on Big Brother UK, which included his alleged on-air sex and the above admittance to purchasing illicit drugs and sex workers. Preston said [...] "I think it is that terrible thing when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>kids</b> that go off the rails... the drugs {{might be a little}} bit of a worry". This sparked a series profanity-filled social media attack by Marco Jr. which he has since apologised for whilst spruiking his new sex toy collection on the Kyle and Jackie O Show. Since quitting Masterchef, Marco Snr has said that “I will never forgive that man…with my hand on my mother’s grave I will get that man” and has joined Hell’s Kitchen Australia which is yet to air.|$|E
5000|$|By 1989, {{the channel}} {{was seen in}} 47.3 million households, with its {{distribution}} jumping to 54 million homes (or 92% of all U.S. households with a cable television subscription) by 1992. At that point, the 1950s sitcoms and westerns that had long been featured on its lineup were scaled back, {{in favor of more}} recent drama series as well as cartoons and later, game shows (with a mix of both original programs like Trivial Pursuit and Shop 'til You Drop, and reruns of older game shows such as the Jim Lange version of Name That Tune and Let's Make a Deal). In fact, the channel's weekday afternoon game show block consisted of the aforementioned programs along with the later episodes of Split Second and other shows specifically produced for the channel (such as Shopping Spree, Small Talk, Wait 'til <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Kids</b> and a revival of It Takes Two, hosted by Dick Clark). The Family Channel also began airing more recent scripted series - among them Big Brother Jake, The Adventures of the Black Stallion, Bordertown, Rin Tin Tin: K-9 Cop, Maniac Mansion and The New Zorro - many of which aired as part of [...] "The Positive Place", a weekly block on Sunday early-evenings that ran from 1991 to 1994.|$|E

[...] "If you give them broccoli, they may not like it, but they'll know it is out there and be open to it. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to expose <b>kids</b> to music - jazz, classical music, rock and roll - and they'll be open." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jay and Maia Jeffries {{arrived in}} June 2004 {{and it was}} soon clear the two {{traveling}} partners were in fact lesbian partners. The lovers were revealed when Shannon spotted the two kissing for the episodes cliffhanger. Producers were initially hesitant to introduce lesbian characters, with head writer Maxine Fleming stating; [...] "She's in relationships so it does come up but {{we have tried to}} avoid lesbian-based stories ... Of course when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>kids</b> and stuff, that's the thing they want to talk about. My daughter wants to know if they’re lesbians in real life and how do they feel about kissing. So obviously it is an issue but not for us so much." [...] Jay was at first shown to be the strong and confident one in the relationship whilst Maia was a lot more self-conscious. The two broke up following Jay's refusal to accept her father and the roles reversed dramatically with Maia's actor - Anna Jullienne stating; [...] "There was almost a role reversal for Jay and me, because I found it so easy to settle in and she didn't ... All of a sudden I'm the one telling guys to get lost when they're perving." [...] The two actresses were good friends in real life, making the kissing scenes fluent and natural.|$|E
5000|$|The {{movie has}} {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The Financial Times awarded the film 4 out of 5 stars (80%) {{and called it}} [...] "rip-roaring fun...Feature debutant Sid Bennett’s motion-capture movie also does emotion capture. You will jump, gasp, grimace, just like the characters. The creatures are often very creepy. The Cloverfield-style dependency on “found footage” means everyone on screen must have a camera, but even that is carried off with dash and nonchalance." [...] Digital Spy awarded the movie 3 stars out of 5 (60%) and labelled it [...] "Decent found-footage caper...The Dinosaur Project is good and undemanding fun. There are enough sharp claws to overcome the flaws and ensure this is never a dino-bore... The Guardian wrote 'The CGI monsters are surprisingly convincing and children will identify with the intrepid 15-year-old lad who stows away on his dad's helicopter and turns up trumps by using his computer wizardry." [...] Katie Fraser of Screenjabber.com awarded the film 3½ stars out of 5, writing [...] "If you don’t mind the shakiness of the found-footage genre (beware - a headache is likely), definitely go see this film {{if not for the}} computer-generated dinosaurs. It’s no Jurassic Park, but they did create some pretty cool-looking prehistoric monsters." [...] Total Film awarded it three stars out of five and said “Though it's desperate to be the next Jurassic Park, there’s little Spielbergian bite to this low-budget Brit flick. Instead we get wobbly cameras and equally wobbly acting from a cast of unknowns as a group of explorers hunt dinos in the Congo....Its money shots generally impress, and the breakneck pace bounds over a multitude of sins - including Park’s deadly dilophosaurus getting a makeover as a cute little critter that’ll have the nippers cooing.” IGN awarded the film 4 out of ten and said “Writer-director Sid Bennett does manage to eek moments of tension out of the premise, and the vast African vistas glimpsed throughout are a joy to behold...a found footage flick that disappoints at just about every turn, and makes you wish the tapes had remained lost.” The Independent awarded the film two stars out of five and said “The script stinks like dino-poo... but for all the silliness you may find yourself entertained.” SFX awarded the film two and a half out of five stars and said “...has just enough charm to be worth a look - particularly if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>kids</b> who like watching giant reptiles eating people...A few unexpected twists that mark it out as interesting (the running order of the deaths isn’t quite what you’d expect, for example) and the dinos are a cut above most films of this nature - particularly one little cutie who’s basically dino-Lassie. Admirably, {{the vast majority of the}} action is shot on location, with some white-water rafting to spice up the scenes with no reptiles in. Despite the plus points, though, it’s still a cheesy, childish adventure which tries very hard not to be the TV movie it actually is.” Empire Magazine awarded the film two stars out of five and said that the film was “More Terra Nova meets Sanctum 3D than Jurassic Park meets Cloverfield.” On its international cinema release, debuting in South East Asia, the movie was a commercial hit, entering the Malaysian box office charts in second position behind The Expendables 2. On its release in Thailand, The Dinosaur Project attained third spot. On its DVD rental release in the US, The Dinosaur Project reached number 14 in the American DVD Rental Charts ...|$|E

5000|$|Well, I think that's a very valid {{point and}} I think that it's a {{reflection}} of, not necessarily this programme but of television in general, {{that if you}} die and enough people are watching you become a martyr, you become a hero, you become well known. So when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> these things like Columbine, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> these <b>kids</b> who are angry and they {{have something to say}} and no one's listening, the media sends a message that says if you do something loud enough and it gets our attention then you will be famous for it. Those kids ended up on the cover of Time magazine twice, the media gave them exactly what they wanted. That's why I never did any interviews around that time when I was being blamed for it because I didn't want to contribute to something that I found to be reprehensible.|$|R

The website Need Coffee gave the film a very bad review, stating: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> very small <b>kids</b> who don't know what a good movie is, they might like this.

It needed to balance fantasy and reality better. And it needed more romance." [...] Riche hired Claire Labine as head writer in 1993. Both were said to bring General Hospital into an era of [...] "womansense".

She stated, [...] "That’s why we created the Karen/Jagger/Brenda triangle. To get some new young characters into the show who could relate to the adults, or who would be tied to the adults.
