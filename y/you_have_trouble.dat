6000|$|When London {{nights are}} intolerable, people think with longing of the cool, {{fragrant}} country, of the jasmine-muffled lattices, and the groups beneath the dreaming evening star. One dreams of coffee after {{dinner in the}} open air, as described in [...] "In Memoriam;" [...] one longs for the cool, the hush, the quiet. But try the country on a July night. First <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> with all the great, big, hairy, leathery moths and bats which fly in at the jasmine-muffled lattice, and endeavour to put out your candle. You blow the candle out, and then a bluebottle fly in good voice comes out too, and is accompanied by very fair imitations of mosquitoes. Probably they are only gnats, but in blowing their terrible little trumpets they are of the mosquito kind. Next the fact dawns on you that the church clock in the neighbouring spire strikes the quarters, {{and you know that}} you cannot fall asleep before the chime wakes you up again, with its warning, [...] "Another quarter gone." [...] The cocks come forth and crow about four; the hens proclaim to a drowsy world that they have fulfilled the duties of maternity. All through the ambrosial night three cows, in the meadow under your windows, have been lamenting the loss of their calves. Of all terrible notes, the [...] "routing" [...] of a bereaved, or amorous, or homesick cow is the most disturbing. It carries for miles, and keeps all who hear it--all town-bred folk, at least--far from the land of Nod. At dawn the song-birds begin, and hold you awake, as they disturbed Rufinus long ago; but the odds are that they do not inspire you, like Rufinus, with the desire to write poetry. The short and simple language of profanity is more likely to come unbidden to the wakeful lips. Thus, as John Leech found out, the country in July is almost as dreadful at night as the town. Nay, thanks to the cow, we think the country may bear away the prize for all that is uncomfortable, all that is hostile to sleep and the Muses. Yet rustics always sleep very well, and no more mind the noise of cocks, sparrows, cows, dogs, and ducks than the owner of a town-bred dog minds when his faithful hound drives a whole street beyond their patience. It is a matter of sound health and untaxed brains. If we always gave our minds a rest, none of us would dread the noises of the nights of summer.|$|E

It has generally been assumed that Aristotle {{was a member of the}} Cyrenaic school, but this assumption is somewhat doubtful. According to Diogenes Laërtius, he wrote a work on the art of poetry. The only aspect of his philosophical views which is known is a short piece of ethical advice preserved by Aelian:Aristoteles of Cyrene said that you should not accept a favor from anyone.

50|$|In Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, Bertie Wooster {{returns to}} Totleigh Towers, {{the site of}} an earlier ordeal that nearly landed him in prison and, worse still, in bonds of {{marriage}} to Madeline Bassett, the syrupy daughter of the house who believes the stars are God's daisy chain. Only Gussie Fink-Nottle, Bertie's childhood friend and Madeline's on-again off-again fiancé, stands between our hero and the dreaded state of matrimony. No surprise, then, that matrimonial disaster looms for our hero when Madeline, inspired by the life of Percy Bysshe Shelley, orders Gussie to abandon his beloved steak and kidney pie and take up a vegetarian diet. Add the intrigues of Miss Stiffy Byng to win her fiancé the Reverend Stinker Pinker a vicarage, the rivalry of collectors Sir Watkyn Bassett and Bertie's Uncle Tom over an objet d'art, and the irresistible culinary attractions of American Emerald Stoker, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> of the sort only Jeeves can mend.|$|E
5000|$|Visual acuity is the eye's {{ability to}} detect fine details and is the {{quantitative}} measure of the eye's ability to see an in-focus image at a certain distance.The standard definition of normal visual acuity (20/20 or 6/6 vision) {{is the ability to}} resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc. The terms 20/20 and 6/6 are derived from standardized sized objects that can be seen by a [...] "person of normal vision" [...] at the specified distance. For example, if one can see at a distance of 20 ft an object that normally can be seen at 20 ft, then one has 20/20 vision. If one can see at 20 ft what a normal person can see at 40 ft, then one has 20/40 vision. Put another way, suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> seeing objects at a distance and you can only see out to 20 ft what a person with normal vision can see out to 200 feet, then you have 20/200 vision. The 6/6 terminology is more commonly used in Europe and Australia, and represents the distance in metres.|$|E
