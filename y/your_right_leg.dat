40|$|The {{controllability}} {{of motor}} imagery (CMI) {{is defined as}} the ability to control or manipulate motor imagery mentally. In the present study, we investigated the correlations between CMI and the accuracy or repeatability of an action with the right and left foot. In the CMI test, {{the participants were asked to}} imagine their posture according to the instructions of six sequential movements (e. g., step 50 cm forward on <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>leg,</b> bring your left arm 90 °to the left side). They were then asked to replicate the final posture that they created in their mind. To evaluate the accuracy and repeatability of the movement, the participants were asked to visualize the target line that was located 50 cm in front of the participants and then to step and fit the heel of their right or left foot to the target line without looking at it. We found that the scores on the CMI test were significantly correlated with the repeatability of the step but not with the accuracy. This suggested that the ability to control or manipulate the imagery of body parts toward intended directions was associated with moving the body repeatedly...|$|E
