60|$|When {{he reached}} the cornfield, Blacky perched {{on top of a}} shock of corn, for it already had been cut and put in shocks in {{readiness}} to be carted up to Farmer Brown's barn.

60|$|The pistil {{occupies}} the position represented in Figure 4.10, with its extremity considerably upturned, {{but to a}} variable degree; the stigma is seated between the anthers of the longest and the shortest stamens. The six longest stamens correspond in length with the pistil of the long-styled form; their filaments are coloured bright pink; the anthers are dark-coloured, but from containing bright-green pollen and from their early dehiscence they appear emerald-green. Hence in general appearance these stamens are remarkably dissimilar from the mid-length stamens of the long-styled form. The six shortest stamens are enclosed within the calyx, and resemble in all respects the shortest stamens of the long-styled form; both these sets correspond in length with the short pistil of the short-styled form. The green pollen-grains of the longest stamens are 9 to 10 in diameter, whilst the <b>yellow</b> <b>grains</b> from the shortest stamens are only 6; or as 100 to 63. But the pollen-grains from different plants appeared to me, {{in this case and}} others, to be in some degree variable in size. The capsules contain on an average 130 seeds; but perhaps, as we shall see, this is rather too high an average. The seeds themselves, as before remarked, are smaller than those of the long-styled form.|$|E

50|$|Hand-pollination {{involves}} gathering pollen {{from plants}} living {{in places that}} even goats cannot reach, so scientists use climbing gear to lower themselves down rock faces to reach the flowering plants. There were additional complications: pollen from another silversword was required; this species cannot self-pollinate but requires a second individual for successful reproduction.

40|$|Although Brazil {{has reduced}} its {{importation}} of popcorn grain in recent years, {{the availability of}} improved varieties is still rare.

Except for the poorly husked ear, there was significance for families within sets for the other evaluated traits, showing that there was sufficient genetic variability for exploitation in future cycles.

40|$|The first yellow-grain fungal mycetoma, in a 60 -year-old {{man from}} Central Sudan, is reported. Morphological and phylogenetic {{analysis}} of the ribosomal small subunit (SSU), large subunit (LSU), internal transcribed spacer (ITS), beta-tubulin (BT 2), actin (ACT 1), and elongation factor (TEF 1) genes revealed that the isolate deviated from any known agent of mycetoma; it clustered in the genus Pleurostoma (anamorph genus, Pleurostomophora) in the order Calosphaeriales. The novel species, here named Pleurostomophora ochracea, is characterized by phenotypic features. The species proved to be highly susceptible to itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole, but not to fluconazole. The fungus was inhibited by caspofungin at 8 mu g/ml, while no inhibition was found with 5 -flucytosine (MIC > 64 mu g/ml). Compared to {{other members of the}} genus Pleurostomophora, P. ochracea is slow growing, with a relatively high optimum growth temperature (36 to 37 degrees C).

40|$|Introduction: Strategies for {{coloured}} food pellet selection (response sequences to one {{or another}} colour) were studied after training for a red (vs. yellow) preference on a board with/without distracting coloured pebbles. Various lesions in the dorsomedial hyperstriatum accessorium (DMHA) of chicks were investigated because a) a substrate with functions similar to the mammalian hippocampus has been proposed for this region (Oades 1976), b) perseveration of choice based on persistent stimulus representations is a feature of selective attention after hippocampal brain-damage, and c) treatment with testosterone, with uptake sites in the hippocampus (i. a) also induced persistence in this task Rogers, 1971; Andrew, 1972). Methods: Operation: Chicks were given aspiration lesions or bilateral scalpel cuts to disconnect the DMHA on day 10 of life (5 types of lesion) and along with sham-operates first exposed to the the training regime 24 h later. Training/testing: Birds were given red-dyed food for 10 days, (but would accept normal <b>yellow</b> <b>grains).</b> On test they were presented with 200 red, 200 <b>yellow</b> <b>grains</b> spread on either a plain perspex floor or one with pebbles coloured like the food glued to the floor, and {{the identity of the}} first 100 pecks scored. The influence of priming with 50 pecks on one or the other colour vs. overnight experience of the non-preferred colour of food was also tested over 2 days Results: 1 / Colour choice in terms of mean run length (MRL) or first 10 pecks was more stable in the lesioned birds and varied more with the test (and prior experience) in intact animals. 2 / On the plain floor - controls decreased their non-preferred food intake on day 1, but with overnight experience increased it markedly on day 2. 3 / On the pebble floor - controls were more distracted and pecked more pebbles. By comparison the DMHA group retained longer MRL for the trained colour preference. 4 / Chicks with lesions more lateral to the DMHA differed by showing a disruption of the trained preference 5 / Chicks with more ventral or more posterior brain-damage showed a food choice pattern that was indistinguishable from intact controls. Conclusions: The lack of lability of the trained feeding preferences of the DMHA animals (whether primed for short or long periods) and in the face of distracting stimuli is interpreted as consistent with the functions of the mammalian hippocampus in tests of selective attention. Different behaviour following damage to the DMHA periphery point to the specificity of the role attributed to the hyperstriatum accessoriu...|$|E
