5|$|Ireland has {{finished}} first seven times, {{more than any}} other country, Ireland also won the contest for three consecutive years (1992, 1993, 1994), more consecutive <b>years</b> <b>than</b> any other country. Three countries have won twice in a row, Spain (1968 and 1969), Luxembourg (1972 and 1973) and Israel (1978 and 1979). Along with Switzerland's win in the first contest, Serbia is the only other country to win with its debut entry (in 2007), though Serbia had competed prior as part of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro. Under the voting system used between 1975 and 2015, the winner of the contest was decided by the final voting nation on eleven occasions.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa is serotinous, that is, it has {{an aerial}} seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened by fire and release seed in large numbers, which {{germinate}} and grow after rain. Seed can last for many years; old spikes 11 to 12 years old have been found to have 50% viable seed. Flower spikes appear to have similar numbers of follicles regardless of the age of the parent plant. Young plants begin flowering three years after regenerating from bushfire and store progressively larger numbers of old flowerheads (and hence seed) in the canopy. In one study, decade-old plants averaged around 3.5 old cones, whereas 21-year-old plants had 105, and were calculated as having over 900 viable seeds per plant. Plants appear to have a life span of at least 40 years, as healthy and vigorous individuals of this age are known. An experimental burn and monitoring of resultant seedling germination and growth showed B.speciosa seeds, though numerous, had poor rates of establishment but that seedlings were able to access water more easily and had higher rates of survival after two <b>years</b> <b>than</b> co-occurring Banksia species. Though this suggested B.speciosa might outcompete its conspecifics, the authors of the study noted that there could be other factors not accounted for in its natural environment.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, economists {{surveyed}} by the University of Chicago rejected the viewpoint that the Laffer Curve's postulation of increased tax revenue through a rate cut applies to federal US income taxes {{of the time}} in the medium term.

25|$|In April 2008, the Union of Concerned Scientists {{said that}} more than half of the nearly 1,600 EPA staff {{scientists}} who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work.

About 40% of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five <b>years</b> <b>than</b> in previous years. The highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} crime {{is one of}} the main concerns in slums. Empirical data suggest crime rates are higher in some slums than in non-slums, with slum homicides alone reducing life expectancy of a resident in a Brazil slum by 7 <b>years</b> <b>than</b> for a resident in nearby non-slum. In some countries like Venezuela, officials have sent in the military to control slum criminal violence involved with drugs and weapons. Rape is another serious issue related to crime in slums.

25|$|It {{has been}} proved that climate change will affect Nicaragua {{sooner rather than later}} due to its {{geographic}} location in the traditional path of strong Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes. Planning efforts in Nicaragua are directed towards adapting to wider climate variability including stronger storms in some years and more severe droughts in others, and higher temperatures that will provoke increased evaporation. This will lead to even drier <b>years</b> <b>than</b> the Nicaraguan agriculture had already suffered in past decades. Moreover, there is a high deforestation rate in Nicaragua that makes the country even more vulnerable to climate change induced flooding and landslides.|$|E
25|$|The {{half-life}} of the radioisotopes {{produced by}} fusion {{tends to be}} less than those from fission, so that the inventory decreases more rapidly. Unlike fission reactors, whose waste remains radioactive for thousands of years, most of the radioactive material in a fusion reactor would be the reactor core itself, which would be dangerous for about 50 years, and low-level waste for another 100. Although this waste will be considerably more radioactive during those 50 <b>years</b> <b>than</b> fission waste, the very short half-life makes the process very attractive, as the waste management is fairly straightforward. By 500 years the material would have the same radiotoxicity as coal ash.|$|E

His Field Guide eventually made him {{be seen as a}} threat by the elves, who ordered him to destroy it and imprisoned him for 80 years when he refused.

25|$|Of 17 high-income {{countries}} {{studied by}} the National Institutes of Health in 2013, the United States ranked {{at or near}} the top in obesity rate, frequency of automobile use and accidents, homicides, infant mortality rate, incidence of heart and lung disease, sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancies, recreational drug or alcohol deaths, injuries, and rates of disability. Together, such lifestyle and societal factors place the U.S. at the bottom of that list for life expectancy. On average, a U.S. male can be expected to live almost four fewer <b>years</b> <b>than</b> those in the top-ranked country, though Americans who reach age 75 live longer than those who reach that age in peer nations.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the second}} championship-deciding {{collision}} in two years, Jackie Stewart interviewed Senna at the 1990 Australian Grand Prix (where Senna won pole and led for 61 laps before gearbox trouble {{forced him to}} slide off into a tyre barrier) and brought up a number of controversial collisions in which Senna had been involved {{over the last few}} years, stating that Senna had made more contact with other cars and drivers in the last four <b>years</b> <b>than</b> all the champions before him. An irritated Senna questioned how someone like Stewart, himself a triple world champion, could ask questions like he did, knowing the pressure under which drivers raced.|$|E

Since ACC Tournament play began in 1987, Virginia has played in 15 out of 19 ACC Tournament championship matches, winning ten ACC titles (including 2003, 2004, and 2009), to go with their seven NCAA Tournament championships (1989, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 2009, 2014).

25|$|Moreover, DNA {{tests have}} {{demonstrated}} substantially less inter-marriage {{in most of}} the various Jewish ethnic divisions over the last 3,000 <b>years</b> <b>than</b> in other populations. The findings lend support to traditional Jewish accounts accrediting their founding to exiled Israelite populations, and counters theories that many or most of the world's Jewish populations were founded by entirely gentile populations that adopted the Jewish faith, as in the notable case of the historic Khazars. Although groups such as the Khazars could have been absorbed into modern Jewish populations — in the Khazars' case, absorbed into the Ashkenazim — it is unlikely that they formed {{a large percentage of the}} ancestors of modern Ashkenazi Jews, and much less that they were the genesis of the Ashkenazim.|$|E
25|$|A {{large portion}} of maria erupted within, or flowed into, the low-lying impact basins on the lunar nearside. However, it is {{unlikely}} that a causal relationship exists between the impact event and mare volcanism because the impact basins are much older (by about 500 million <b>years)</b> <b>than</b> the mare fill. Furthermore, Oceanus Procellarum, which is the largest expanse of mare volcanism on the Moon, does not correspond to any known impact basin. It is commonly suggested that the reason the mare only erupted on the nearside is that the nearside crust is thinner than the farside. Although variations in the crustal thickness might act to modulate the amount of magma that ultimately reaches the surface, this hypothesis does not explain why the farside South Pole-Aitken basin, whose crust is thinner than Oceanus Procellarum, was only modestly filled by volcanic products.|$|E
