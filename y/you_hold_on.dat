500|$|In a press release, Lewis {{explained}} the meaning behind [...] "Trouble": [...] "it {{tells the story}} of love going bad and becoming destructive, aspects of which we can all relate to. It’s a deeply emotional and poignant song that I have a real connection to." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, [...] "Trouble" [...] was inspired by Lewis' break-up with her childhood sweetheart Lou Al-Chamaa. Lyrics which reference her relationship with Chamaa include the lines: [...] "I told you never to get used to me, I stay awake while you fall asleep. I'm a whole lot of trouble, we're in a whole lot of trouble. You shout louder than you used to, and <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> tighter in the bedroom." [...] During an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis further explained that she was inspired and influenced by British trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack. The Suns showbiz editor Gordan Smart also picked up on the similarities, noting that [...] "Trouble" [...] sounds similar to [...] "Unfinished Sympathy" [...] (1991) and [...] "Teardrop" [...] (1998) by Massive Attack. [...] "Trouble" [...] drew comparisons to Sandé's own singles; according to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, [...] "Trouble" [...] was much like [...] "Heaven" [...] (2011) while MSN's Danielle Cheeseman compared it to Sandé collaboration with Naughty Boy, [...] "Daddy" [...] (2011).|$|E
500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> a second?' Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E
500|$|... "Heaven" [...] lyrically {{talks about}} the protagonist saying a final goodbye to a {{deceased}} beloved person. It contains emotional lyrics which offer comfort to the protagonist. The ballad opens with the line [...] "I fought for you the hardest, it made me the strongest, So tell me your secrets — I just can't stand to see you leaving" [...] sang with emotional and touching vocals by the singer. The hook [...] "Heaven couldn't wait for you / No heaven couldn't wait for you / So go on, go home" [...] is continuously repeated. BET'a Latifah Muhammad described Beyoncé's vocal rendition as [...] "heartbreaking yet optimistic". [...] "Heaven" [...] closes with a spoken 20-second snippet outro of the Lord's Prayer (...) recited in Spanish by Melissa Vargas, the singer's brand manager. Many critics noted how the song may {{have been inspired by}} the singer's miscarriage. Clare Lobenfeld from Complex magazine concluded that the song featured Beyoncé's coping mechanisms for the loss of her child, which included using humor to hide pain. According to Spin writer Anupa Mistry, it is in line with one of the themes touched on in the parent album, motherhood. On the album, [...] "Heaven" [...] is placed before [...] "Blue", as the penultimate track. It was noted by critics that both songs were antidotes to each other– while the former discusses notions of death, the latter celebrates birth. Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle found the inclusion of those songs as the last on Beyoncé {{as a metaphor for the}} entire album [...] "Darkness always gives way to light, and heartbreak, if <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on,</b> is always followed by hope".|$|E

2500|$|The album {{opens and}} closes with two {{versions}} of the lead single, [...] "Trouble," [...] described by Sylvia Patterson of The Guardian as [...] "very London". Co-written with Sandé, it contains elements of trip hop and was inspired by Lewis' 2010 break-up with childhood sweetheart Lou Al-Chamaa. Lyrics co-written by Lewis include the lines [...] "I told you never to get used to me, I stay awake while you fall asleep. I'm a whole lot of trouble, we're in a whole lot of trouble. You shout louder than you used to and <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> tighter in the bedroom." [...] When Smith was brought on board, [...] "Trouble" [...] was one of the songs he worked on; a new rap verse by Childish Gambino was added along with some additional production. Early critics praised the song's emotive qualities and dark undertones.|$|E
