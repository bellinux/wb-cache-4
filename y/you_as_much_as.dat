Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave [...] "Deadalive" [...] a full five stars and called its humor and simplistic plot the [...] "icing on the cake." [...] They praised its stylistic difference from the preceding episode, [...] "This Is Not Happening", which they described as [...] "atmospheric and doom-laden". The two called [...] "Deadalive" [...] a [...] "slice of sci-fi hokum, with action scenes, bits of grisly horror [...] a reexamination of the show's mythology". Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A−" [...] and wrote, [...] "Never go away again, David! I take back everything bad I ever said about you! I love <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> ever!" ...|$|E
500|$|The Charter {{called for}} the {{introduction}} of a constitutional monarchy, an independent judiciary, and a bicameral legislature composed of a lower house of elected representatives and an upper house of appointed legislators. The Charter also granted equal rights between men and women, and recognised all Bahraini citizens as having equal political rights, including the entitlement to elections and political candidacy. In the 8 February meeting, the government promised that [...] "the new political arrangements will not invalidate the 1973 constitution and that the upper appointed house will be for consultation only." [...] The next day, after leading Friday prayer, al-Jamri delivered a famous speech, starting with [...] "Allah is my witness, I have missed <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Jacob missed Joseph", before Abdulwahab announced that the opposition had decided to accept the reform plan.

In November 2001, the Al Wefaq Shia political society was founded, with al-Jamri being seen as its mentor.|$|E
