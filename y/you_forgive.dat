500|$|Pitchfork Media {{added to}} the {{unfavourable}} reviews, stating of will.i.am, [...] "He takes Macca off 'The Girl Is Mine' but decides it can't work without someone sounding like an idiot and steps manfully in himself." [...] The Times stated that whoever {{thought it was a}} good idea for will.i.am to participate in the song ought to be [...] "locked in a windowless cell with nothing but those songs on a continuous loop". PopMatters, however, praised Thriller 25 and the remix of [...] "The Girl Is Mine". They wrote, [...] "Any album good enough to make <b>you</b> <b>forgive</b> (although maybe not forget) a song as bad as the Paul McCartney duet 'The Girl is Mine' has got to be damn good." [...] They added that will.i.am had put a [...] "breezy spin" [...] on the track and that the song's omission of McCartney did not suffer because of it.|$|E
500|$|... "Ghosttown" [...] {{had been}} {{initially}} {{absent from the}} 2015–2016 Rebel Heart Tour. However, on the September 19, 2015, stop at New York City's Barclays Center, Madonna announced that she would perform the song but it was unrehearsed. [...] "That is the truth. So, if I make mistakes, will <b>you</b> <b>forgive</b> me?", she added and sang an acoustic version. According to Robbie Daw from Idolator the performance received positive response frpm the audience. Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani {{described it as a}} [...] "stirring, if pitchy, rendition of [...] shoulda-been-a-sleeper-hit... which brought seemingly genuine tears to [...] eyes, a development that seemed to surprise even her". On July 27, 2017, Madonna made a special appearance at Leonardo DiCaprio's annual fundraising gala, which took place on Saint-Tropez, France, and performed [...] "Ghosttown", along with [...] "4 Minutes", [...] "Ray of Light", [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] and [...] "La Isla Bonita", dressed in a green suit with feathers.|$|E
500|$|The {{conclusion}} of the serial in March brought similar praise. [...] "Our Friends in the North confounded the gloomier predictions about its content and proved {{that there was an}} audience for political material, provided that it found its way to the screen through lives imagined in emotional detail... It will be remembered for an intimate sense of character, powerful enough to make <b>you</b> <b>forgive</b> its faults and stay loyal to the end," [...] was the verdict of The Independent on the final episode. Writing in the same newspaper the following day, Jeffrey Richards added that [...] "Monday night's final episode of Our Friends in the North has left many people bereft. The serial captivated much of the country, sketching a panoramic view of life in Britain from the sixties to the nineties... At once sweeping and intimate, both moving and angry, simultaneously historical and contemporary, it has followed in the distinguished footsteps of BBC series such as Boys from the Blackstuff." ...|$|E

500|$|Digby {{was tried}} {{on the same}} day as seven of his {{surviving}} co-conspirators, in Westminster Hall, on Monday 27 January 1606. [...] As the king and his family watched in secret, the charges against the plotters were read aloud. [...] Alone amongst them Digby pleaded [...] "Guilty", and was tried on a separate indictment. [...] Dressed in a black satin suit and [...] "tuff taffetie gown", he gave a short and moving speech, defending his actions by explaining his affection for Catesby, and the cause of his religion. [...] He accused King James of reneging on his promises of toleration for Catholics, and told of his fears of harsher laws against recusancy. [...] He also pleaded on behalf of his family, that they should not pay for his actions, before making a final request to be beheaded. [...] His words fell on mostly deaf ears. [...] The prosecution poured scorn on James's supposed perfidy, and ridiculed Digby for asking for leniency where he would have given none. [...] Along with the other plotters, he was found guilty. [...] As they were led from the hall, Digby exclaimed: [...] "If I may but hear any of your lordships say, <b>you</b> <b>forgive</b> me, I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows." [...] The reply came back, [...] "God forgive you, and we do." ...|$|E
500|$|Oliver {{initially}} had a [...] "friendly rivalry" [...] with sister Penny. Catherwood {{believes they}} always had [...] "a really good relationship". She characterised the siblings' relationship as [...] "one of constant rivalry but ultimately unconditional support", and noted, [...] "Everything always comes more easily to Oliver than Penny – she has spent her life playing catch up". When Penny considered giving her career up over a patient she was romantically involved with, {{in order to protect}} her, Oliver ruined the romance. Their relationship remained unaffected by this: Catherwood revealed, [...] "Well they are brother and sister, so <b>you</b> <b>forgive</b> your family for enormous amounts. So it doesn't affect their relationship, if anything he is there as soon as she breaks down he's there to catch her, full of apologies and support." [...] She said the situation would bring them closer together, because it is a typical scenario siblings go through. When Catherwood quit the series, Penny was killed whilst attempting to rescue a patient from a train crash. Her death was not shown on-screen: a conscious decision made by the production team to fully focus on Oliver's story. Series producer Myar Craig Brown revealed that the big focus would be on the effect it had on Oliver. Forced {{to come to terms with}} her death, he faced an [...] "emotional rollercoaster of feeling that he was second best to her".|$|E
500|$|Each of the condemned, said Coke, {{would be}} drawn {{backwards}} to his death, by a horse, his head near the ground. [...] He {{was to be}} [...] "put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both". [...] His genitals would be cut off and burnt before his eyes, and his bowels and heart then removed. [...] Then he would be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of his body displayed {{so that they might}} become [...] "prey for the fowls of the air". [...] Confessions and declarations from the prisoners were then read aloud, and finally the prisoners were allowed to speak. [...] Rookwood claimed that he had been drawn into the plot by Catesby, [...] "whom he loved above any worldy man". [...] Thomas Wintour begged to be hanged for himself and his brother, so that his brother might be spared. [...] Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment. [...] Keyes appeared to accept his fate, Bates and Robert Wintour begged for mercy, and Grant explained his involvement as [...] "a conspiracy intended but never effected". [...] Only Digby, tried on a separate indictment, pleaded guilty, insisting that the King had reneged upon promises of toleration for Catholics, and that affection for Catesby and love of the Catholic cause mitigated his actions. [...] He sought death by the axe and begged mercy from the King for his young family. [...] His defence was in vain; his arguments were rebuked by Coke and Northumberland, and along with his seven co-conspirators, he was found guilty by the jury of high treason. [...] Digby shouted [...] "If I may but hear any of your lordships say, <b>you</b> <b>forgive</b> me, I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows." [...] The response was short: [...] "God forgive you, and we do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The quote was {{subsequently}} sampled {{in the song}} [...] "Paninaro", and further established the band's early reputation of being anti-rock'n'roll and aligned with disco and dance music culture.

2500|$|Marr played guitar {{on several}} Pet Shop Boys songs; he {{continues}} to have guest appearances on their albums, with his most significant contribution on Release (2002). The only remix that Marr has ever done was for Pet Shop Boys—it was a mix of his favourite track from their 1987 album, Actually, called [...] "I Want to Wake Up", and was released as the b-side to 1993's [...] "Can <b>You</b> <b>Forgive</b> Her?"

2500|$|In {{more recent}} years, Richie Unterberger, {{writing for the}} AllMusic website, has {{described}} Fifth Dimension as [...] "wildly uneven", noting that the album's short-comings prevent it [...] "from attaining truly classic status". Despite its inconsistency, Fifth Dimension is today regarded as a highly influential, albeit transitional, album that is musically more experimental than the band's previous recorded output. A reviewer for Entertainment Weekly wrote in 1996 that [...] "time hasn't enhanced the group's forays into psychedelia", yet the album contains [...] "enough keepers to make <b>you</b> <b>forgive</b> their occasional tendency to fly into walls". That same year, the NME described it as [...] "faultless" [...] and a work that [...] "heralds a newly psychedelic Byrds hung up on the archetypal acid-fixation with the unknown".|$|E
2500|$|The {{different}} {{names of the}} game are more recent. The first print reference to [...] "noughts and crosses", the British name, appeared in 1864. In his novel Can <b>You</b> <b>Forgive</b> Her? (1864) Anthony Trollope refers to a clerk playing [...] "tit-tat-toe". The first print reference to a game called [...] "tick-tack-toe" [...] occurred in 1884, but referred to [...] "a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil {{down on one of}} the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored". [...] "Tic-tac-toe" [...] may also derive from [...] "tick-tack", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of [...] "noughts and crosses" [...] as [...] "tic-tac-toe" [...] occurred in the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1993, Pet Shop Boys re-invented {{their image}} {{and made a}} strong return to the UK Singles Chart with [...] "Can <b>You</b> <b>Forgive</b> Her?". Taking its title from the Anthony Trollope novel of the same name, the single reached number 7 on the UK Singles Chart, while its iconic music video {{featured}} the duo in orange body suits and tall dunce caps, {{in a world of}} computer-generated imagery. The theme was continued with the follow-up single, often considered as their signature song, a cover of the Village People single [...] "Go West", which reached number 2 in the UK, with another computer-generated music video, this time inspired by the Soviet Union. The tune was adopted into a football chant at Arsenal Football Club (which Chris Lowe supports) and is heard at grounds throughout Europe to this day.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the more}} {{positive}} side, Entertainment Weekly gave Lightning a B+ grade, saying that [...] "Songs with shotglass-half-full titles like [...] "It's Alright" [...] and [...] "Not That Bad" [...] build to fist-pump choruses, but there's just enough attitude to counter that rah-rah spirit." [...] Paste Magazine said the album, [...] "after a few listens, is actually pretty good if <b>you</b> <b>forgive</b> the total banality of its content. Which, by the way, {{is a good}} way to describe the album as a whole." [...] Both Consequence of Sound and Popmatters had opinions that the group's sound of their future albums could improve from Lightning. Allmusic said that the record was [...] "no kind of departure, but the slight variations in sound and the slightly expanded emotional palette mean that it's an improvement over the last record [...] or two [...]" [...] Magnet Magazine said the album had the [...] "tried-and-true formula that has worked so well for them." [...] Punknews found to album to be [...] "pop pleasure, with nothing to feel guilty about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pet Shop Boys began 2006 {{remixing}} Madonna's single [...] "Sorry", {{for release}} in February. The single reached {{number one in}} the UK and the Pet Shop Boys' remix included new backing vocals performed by Tennant. Madonna subsequently used the Pet Shop Boys' remix, including Tennant's vocals, on her 2006 Confessions Tour. In April, Pet Shop Boys released a new single that reached No.8 in the UK, [...] "I'm with Stupid", a commentary on the relationship between George W. Bush and Tony Blair. The promo video featured Matt Lucas and David Walliams, better known as the team behind Little Britain. Lucas and Walliams portray Tennant and Lowe, parodying two of the duo's previous videos, [...] "Go West", and [...] "Can <b>You</b> <b>Forgive</b> Her?". The ninth Pet Shop Boys studio album, Fundamental, followed in May, reaching a strong No.5 in their home country. The album was produced by Trevor Horn, who Pet Shop Boys had previously worked with on [...] "Left to My Own Devices", in 1988. The album was also released with a limited edition remix album called Fundamentalism, which included a version of [...] "In Private" [...] as a duet with Elton John and [...] "Fugitive", a new track produced by Richard X.|$|E
