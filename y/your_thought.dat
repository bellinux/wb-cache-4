I [...] then received [...] Divine Methods in Five Sections (Shenfang wupian 神方五篇) [...] It says: [...] "The ambushing corpses always ascend to Heaven to report on people's sins on the first, fifteenth, and last days of each month. The Director of Allotted Life Spans (Siming 司命) deducts from people's accounts and shortens their life spans accordingly. The gods within people's bodies want to make people live, but the corpses want to make them die. When people die, their gods disperse; the corpses, once in this bodiless state, become ghosts, and when people sacrifice to [...] these ghosts obtain the offering foods. This is why the corpses want people to die. When you dream of fighting with an evil person, this is [...] the corpses and the gods at war [...]" [...] So I followed his [...] instructions, synthesized [...] and ingested it, and thereby attained transcendence.

2500|$|In its Confirmation exegesis, the Minnehaha United Methodist Church of Minneapolis, Minnesota notes,Metanoia is used {{to refer}} to the change of mind which is brought about in repentance. Repentance is {{necessary}} and valuable because it brings about change of mind or metanoia. This change of mind will make the changed person hate sin and love God. The two terms (repentance and metanoia) are often used interchangeably. [...] "Meta-" [...] is additionally used to imply [...] "beyond" [...] and [...] "outside of." [...] E.g., ...metaphysics as outside the limits of physics. The word metanoia has taken on an in-vogue usage among interfaith dialogues as simply meaning [...] "a change of heart." [...] Though this is close to its Christian theological meaning, perhaps one may conclude that metanoia is [...] "taking one's mind/thoughts beyond and outside of one's habituations." [...] Yes, English translators of the Christian Scriptures fail to find a proper corresponding word for metanoia, so they fall back upon the comfort and ease of the word repent. Yet repent carries with it a negative tone, almost an inhibition caused by guilt; metanoia forces a positive, proactive life-affirming response. When Jesus calls people to [...] "repent," [...] to [...] "metanoia," [...] could it be that he means: [...] "Change <b>your</b> <b>thought</b> processes and go beyond your mind's present state of limitations"? Does this not mandate self-assessment and interpersonal acceptance? ...|$|E
