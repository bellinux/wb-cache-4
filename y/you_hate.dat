25|$|Collingwood is {{traditionally}} reviled by non-Collingwood supporters ("You either love 'em or <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> 'em"). The dislike {{of the club}} by outsiders {{is said to have}} originated during the 1920s and 1930s, a period of great success for the club which drew the envy and resentment of other clubs. In this period, Collingwood was also perceived as a Catholic and Irish club, at a time when these groups were looked down upon by the rest of Australian society and subjected to a considerable degree of social exclusion.|$|E

Darling" [...] by The Beatles (from their album Abbey Road) and to [...] "Scream it like <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> that bitch!"

500|$|While Yellowcard {{was working}} on their {{upcoming}} album, Lights and Sounds, they developed a character, Holly Wood, {{who served as a}} narrator and protagonist for the album's storyline. The character also came about when the band began writing about their hatred for life in Los Angeles. Vocalist Ryan Key, in discussion of the character, said, [...] "Holly became this person on the record who appears {{in a lot of the}} songs, and at times you love her and at times <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> her. At times she's good to you and sometimes she's bad." [...] Violinist Sean Mackin, also in discussion of the character, said: [...] "...Ryan didn’t have a romantic interest in his life and he didn’t want to write 'Only One' again, and he wanted to create something new. A lot of songwriters narrate and create fictional characters... and Holly was a character where sometimes you love her and sometimes <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> her, and she was someone he could get all his emotions out through." [...] Key revealed that the song [...] "Rough Landing, Holly", which features the Holly character, was his [...] "favorite song" [...] from Lights and Sounds.|$|E

500|$|The {{next morning}} in the East Room, Nixon gave a {{televised}} 20-minute farewell speech to the White House staff, during which time he read from Theodore Roosevelt's biography and praised his own parents. The First Lady could hardly contain her tears; she was most upset about the cameras, because they recorded her anguish, as they had during the 1960 election defeat. The Nixons walked onto the Executive Mansion's South Lawn with Vice President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford. The outgoing president would depart from the White House on Marine One. As the family walked towards the helicopter, Pat, with one arm around her husband's waist and one around Betty's, said to Betty, [...] "You'll see many of these red carpets, and you'll get so <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> 'em."

500|$|In retrospect, Swift {{has stated}} that the song was {{something}} typical of her to say in her teenage years and that it exemplified how she processed emotion at the time, adding [...] "I didn't know anything then." [...] She explained, [...] "I had this song called 'Picture to Burn,' that's talking about how 'I hate your truck,' and 'I hate that you ignored me,' 'I hate you.' Now, the way that I would say that {{and the way that}} I would feel that kind of pain is a lot different." [...] Despite her evolving on a personal level and as a songwriter, she claimed not to be regretful of [...] "Picture to Burn", rather happy she was able to demonstrate [...] "those emotions that when you're so angry, <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> everything. It's like recording your diary over the years, and that's a gift", she said.|$|E

It's the Hair Bear Bunch! {{was one of}} Hanna-Barbera's more {{successful}} shows. However, in The Encyclopedia of Guilty Pleasures: 1001 Things <b>You</b> <b>Hate</b> to Love, three different authors labeled the series as one of Hanna-Barbera's [...] "lesser-known efforts" [...] but ultimately called it a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] and enjoyed that it had its own score. In a retrospective view of older cartoons, the staff at MeTV included the show on their list of [...] "15 Forgotten Cartoons from the Early 1970s You Used to Love". Deirdre Sheppard from Common Sense Media rated it three out of five stars and noted that it has [...] "no educational content"; however, she also said that [...] "other than the mildest of mild violence, and the characters' tendency to poke fun at each other, the series is fun and inoffensive".|$|E

[...] He's always wanted me to play for the Packers." [...] Clancy was greeted as the first Green Bay native to play for the Packers since Wayland Becker in 1938.

500|$|Mirror's Edge has {{received}} mostly positive reviews, with score aggregator Metacritic reporting scores of 81/100 for the PC version and 79/100 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.

Computer and Video Games was also positive, calling it [...] "A brilliant and unique experience, {{even if the}} small shooting parts aren't quite up to scratch." [...] IGN awarded the game 8.3 out of 10, calling it a [...] "thrilling and stylish venture", but [...] "the first chapter of a franchise that's still finding its feet."

500|$|... "Black Widow" [...] {{is a song}} {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of three minutes and 29 seconds and {{has been described as}} a song that [...] "channels more trap music with its beat". The song combines a sparse snap and heavy trap beat with a refrain that follows a slow-building, clapping chorus formula which peaks but deliberately never capitalizes. Instrumentally, [...] "Black Widow" [...] is composed of an ominous steel drum rhythm, and heavy bass, while its dance breakdown is employed with minimalism. Azalea solicits the track's verses with a snarling, bitter technique, consisting of rhyming employed with a spitting delivery. While Ora uses a seething element to sing the track's hook, [...] "I'm gonna love ya, until <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> me / And I'm gonna show ya, what's really crazy / You should've known better, than to mess with me harder / I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you / Gonna love you, gonna love you / Like a black widow baby". Combined, Ora and Azalea's vocals are based on a call and response structure throughout the song.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Black Widow" [...] {{is a dark}} {{love song}} which deals with the {{subjects}} of revenge and feminism in a failed romantic relationship. According to Nedeska Alexis of MTV Buzzworthy, the song [...] "captures the fallout when love turns sour" [...] and is clarified in the lyric [...] "I'm gonna love ya until <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> me / And now I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy". Digital Spy's Emily Mackay denoted the lyrical content in [...] "Black Widow" [...] to contain a theme of [...] "dark, dangerous sexuality" [...] and felt it owned [...] "the bunnyboiler femme fatale stereotype". Nick Aveling of Time Out summarized the track's theme as [...] "boy-baiting drama". The song's beat, hook and production formula garnered many comparisons to Perry's single [...] "Dark Horse" [...] (2013). While Tshepo Mokoena of The Guardian felt [...] "Black Widow" [...] was sonically reminiscent of Azalea's previous collborations with American disc jockeys Diplo and Steve Aoki, and Craig Mathieson of The Sydney Morning Herald likened the song {{to the music of}} Beyoncé.|$|E
500|$|... "D'oh!" [...] {{was first}} added to The New Oxford Dictionary of English in 1998. It {{is defined as}} an interjection [...] "used to comment on an action {{perceived}} as foolish or stupid". In 2001, [...] "D'oh!" [...] {{was added to the}} Oxford English Dictionary, without the apostrophe ("Doh!"). The definition of the word is [...] "expressing frustration at the realization that things have turned out badly or not as planned, or that one has just said or done something foolish". In 2006, [...] "D'oh!" [...] was placed in sixth position on TV Land's list of the 100 greatest television catchphrases. [...] "D'oh!" [...] is also included in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. The book includes several other quotations from Homer, including [...] "Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably.

500|$|Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} when O'Malley told Torres about his affair with Stevens, the scene was too [...] "melodramatic". Laura Burrows, also of IGN, said that the fourth-season premiere [...] "introduced a new side of George". Armstrong said of O'Malley and Stevens' reconciliation: [...] "George and Izzie are finally on the old Grey's Anatomy road to ruin. And I admit {{this is a good}} lesson in Grey's viewing as well as life: Sit tight if <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> something, as nothing is permanent." [...] Armstrong also commented that the [...] "sparkling" [...] {{friendship}} development between Lexie and O'Malley [...] "won her over". The following year, Monfette observed of O'Malley's lack of screen time: [...] "His growing interest in trauma surgery at the side of Owen leads to an interesting development in the finale, but the character is virtually side-lined this season." [...] Carina MacKenzie of the Los Angeles Times said of the character's death: [...] "The time-lapse episode was an interesting choice, and though we sped through six weeks of mourning in two hours, it didn't feel rushed to me. I'm not sure the show could have held my attention for another season of crippling sadness." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Juxtapozed with U" [...] is 3 minutes 8 seconds {{long and}} is in the key of A major. The track begins with a drum fill, {{featuring}} flanging, before a harp, strings, acoustic guitar and bass join at 2 seconds. An electric guitar joins at 13 seconds playing a melody line. The song breaks down at 25 seconds for the first verse with just bass, drums, acoustic guitar and occasional synthesizer accompanying Gruff Rhys's vocals which are fed through a vocoder. The first chorus begins at 47 seconds with the strings and harp re-entering while Rhys sings the words [...] "You've got to tolerate all those people that <b>you</b> <b>hate,</b> I'm not in love with you but I won't hold that against you" [...] twice without the use of a vocoder. The song breaks down again for the second verse after which the second chorus enters at 1 minute 33 seconds. The outro begins at 1 minute 58 seconds with Rhys singing [...] "Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed, just suppose I'm juxtaposed with you" [...] supported by harmony backing vocals. The rest of the band continue singing these words while Rhys begins singing the chorus lyrics, starting at 2 minutes 43 seconds. The track ends with Rhys singing the words [...] "Let's get juxtaposed" [...] backed only by harmony vocals.|$|E
500|$|Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, {{spoke of}} the {{historical}} inaccuracies. [...] "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. Our story takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who know the story will {{find a lot of}} what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." [...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E
