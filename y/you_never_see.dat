500|$|Pelé {{is one of}} {{the most}} lauded players in history and is {{frequently}} ranked the best player ever. Among his contemporaries, Dutch star Johan Cruyff stated; [...] "Pelé was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries of logic." [...] Brazil's 1970 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto Torres opined; [...] "His great secret was improvisation. Those things he did were in one moment. He had an extraordinary perception of the game." [...] Tostão, his strike partner at the 1970 World Cup; [...] "Pelé was the greatest – he was simply flawless. And off the pitch he is always smiling and upbeat. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> him bad-tempered. He loves being Pelé." [...] His Brazilian teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed; [...] "In some countries they wanted to touch him, in some they wanted to kiss him. In others they even kissed the ground he walked on. I thought it was beautiful, just beautiful." [...] Former Real Madrid and Hungary star Ferenc Puskás stated; [...] "The greatest player in history was Di Stefano. I refuse to classify Pelé as a player. He was above that." ...|$|E
500|$|Romero and Hall {{designed}} the gameplay and aesthetics; Romero wanted the goal to be [...] "to mow down Nazis", with the suspense of storming a Nazi bunker full of SS soldiers and Hitler himself, {{as well as}} dogs, blood [...] "like <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> in games", and straightforward, lethal weapons. Hall {{designed the}} levels while also adding collectible objects {{in the form of}} treasure and food for health items. Carmack added a few features to the Wolfenstein 3D engine from Catacomb 3-D, including support for doors and decorative non-wall objects, but primarily focused on making the game run smoother and faster with higher-resolution graphics. Romero in turn worked on building a game with the engine, removing elements of the initial design, like looting enemy bodies, that he felt interrupted the flow of fast gameplay. The level design, by Romero and Hall, due to the grid-based level design, took some inspiration from Pac-Man, and paid homage with a hidden Pac-Man level. The team ensured that the presentation of the game created the atmosphere that they wanted, adding violent animations by Adrian Carmack for enemies being shot and music and sound effects by Keen composer Bobby Prince to make the guns sound exciting.|$|E
500|$|The rescuers {{concealed}} {{the fate}} of the snowshoe party, informing the rescued immigrants only that they did not return because they were frostbitten. Patty and Tommy Reed were soon too weak to cross the snowdrifts, and no one was strong enough to carry them. Margret Reed faced the agonizing predicament of accompanying her two older children to Bear Valley and watching her two frailest be taken back to Truckee Lake without a parent. She made rescuer Aquilla Glover swear on his honor as a Mason that he would return for her children. Patty Reed told her, [...] "Well, mother, if <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> me again, do the best you can." [...] Upon their return to the lake, the Breens flatly refused them entry to their cabin but, after Glover left more food, the children were grudgingly admitted. The rescue party was dismayed to find that the first cache station had been broken into by animals, leaving them without food for four days. After struggling on the walk over the pass, John Denton slipped into a coma and died. Ada Keseberg died soon afterwards; her mother was inconsolable, refusing to let the child's body go. After several days' more travel through difficult country, the rescuers grew very concerned that the children would not survive. Some of them ate the buckskin fringe from one of the rescuer's pants, and the shoelaces of another, to the relief party's surprise. On their way down from the mountains, they met the next rescue party, which included James Reed. Upon hearing his voice, Margret sank into the snow, overwhelmed.|$|E

500|$|Rivera is well {{respected}} throughout baseball for his professionalism. Fellow closer Joe Nathan said, [...] "I {{look up to}} how he's handled himself {{on and off the}} field... <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> him show up anyone and he respects the game. I've always looked up to him and it's always a compliment to be just mentioned in the same sentence as him." [...] Michael Young said of Rivera, [...] "I respect Mo more than anybody in the game. The guy goes out there, gets three outs and shakes [...] Posada's hand. You appreciate someone who respects the game like he does, respects the people he plays with and against, and obviously his results speak for themselves." [...] In a Sports Illustrated cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, [...] "Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers." [...] Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; {{at the time of his}} retirement, he was the only active player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson's retired number. Speaking about Rivera's connection to her husband, Robinson's widow Rachel said, [...] " [...] carried himself with dignity and grace, and that made carrying the number a tribute to Jack... I've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something special to it." [...] Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, Selig said: [...] "Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity. It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson's sacred number 42." ...|$|E

[...] Panahi has stated that [...] "in all of my films, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> an evil character, male or female. I believe everyone is a good person." ...|$|E
