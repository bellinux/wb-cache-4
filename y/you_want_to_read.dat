New owners Bradley Graham and Lissa Muscatine were ranked #50 on GQs [...] "The 50 Most Powerful People in Washington" [...] because of their purchase of Politics and Prose, describing the store as [...] "...liberal Washington's most sacred space." [...] The New Yorkers Hendrik Hertzberg commented on the unusually intelligent questions from the audience at readings, and Slates editor in 2007, said: [...] "If there's one bookstore in the city <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> in, it's obviously the place." ...|$|E

Wilkins had initially refused to announce the news because he despised Du Bois as a Communist—but then insisted on making the announcement when he realized that Randolph would make it if he didn't. Wilkins said: [...] "Regardless of the fact that in his later years Dr. Du Bois chose another path, it is incontrovertible that {{at the dawn of the}} twentieth century his was the voice that was calling you to gather here today in this cause. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> something that applies to 1963 go back and get a volume of The Souls of Black Folk by Du Bois, published in 1903." ...|$|E

500|$|The book is 15,000 words {{long and}} was first {{published}} in January 2011 as an electronic book only, priced at USD$4. The Economist noted that the [...] "publishing model is fascinating in its own right". A hardback version, which Cowen dubbed [...] "the retrogression", was published in June 2011. Yglesias described the publication as an innovation in [...] "current affairs publishing" [...] and [...] "much shorter and cheaper than a conventional book in a way that actually leaves <b>you</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> more once <b>you</b> finish it.

[...] The book has been compared to economic and political pamphlets of the 17th century, which were frequently used to quickly get ideas about current affairs into circulation.|$|R

60|$|The {{galleries}} are {{not only}} for the exhibition of pictures, but each has numbers of ateliers, where the artists work and teach. The libraries are the most wonderfully imagined things. You do not have to come and study in them, but if you are working up any particular subject, the books relating to it are sent to your dwelling every morning and brought away every noon, so that during the obligatory hours you have them completely at your disposition, and during the Voluntaries you can consult them {{with the rest of the}} public in the library; it is not thought best that study should be carried on throughout the day, and the results seem to justify this theory. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> a book merely for pleasure, you are allowed to take it out and live with it as long as you like; the copy you have is immediately replaced with another, so that you do not feel hurried and are not obliged to ramp through it in a week or a fortnight.|$|E
6000|$|That matter {{has been}} {{reported}} on, preached on, spoken on, till all other civilized countries reproach Britain with the unique contrast between the exceeding wealth of some classes and the exceeding poverty of others; till we, instead of being startled by the reproach, take {{the present state of}} things as a matter of course, a physical necessity, a law of nature and society, that there should be, in the back streets of every great city, hordes of, must I say, savages? neither decently civilized nor decently Christianized, uncertain, most of them, of regular livelihood, and therefore shiftless and reckless, extravagant in prosperity, and in adversity falling at once into want and pauperism. [...] You may ask any clergyman, any minister of religion of any denomination, whether the thing is not so. Or if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the latest news about the degradation of your fellow-subjects, read a little book called [...] "East and West," [...] and judge for yourselves, whether such a population, numbered by hundreds of thousands, are in a state pleasing to God, or safe for those classes of whom they only know that they pay them wages, and that these wages are as small as they can be forced to take. Read that book; and then ask yourselves, is it wonderful that, in one district, before the mission of the society for which I plead was established, the poor used seriously to believe that it was the wish and endeavour of the rich to grind them down, and keep them poor. We, of course, know that the poor folk were mistaken but do we not know, too-- some of us--that there are political economists in the world, who, though they would not willingly make the poor poorer than they are, are still of opinion that it is good for the nation, on the whole, that the present state of things should continue; that there should be always a reserve of labour, in plain English, a vast multitude who have not quite work enough to live on, ready to be called on in any emergency of business, and used, to beat down, by their competition, the wages of their fellow-workmen? [...] Is this theory altogether novel and unheard of? Or this theory also, that for this very reason, Emigration, which looks the very simplest remedy for most of this want,--while nine-tenths of the bounteous earth is waiting to be subdued and replenished by the poor wretches who cannot get at it--that Emigration, I say, is an unnecessary movement--that the people are all wanted at home--to be such as the parson and the mission women find them? ...|$|E
