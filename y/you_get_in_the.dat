500|$|Executives who {{eventually}} {{escaped from the}} Hole have said that its occupants were forced to practice group confessions {{in which they would}} confess supposed transgressions against Miscavige, bad thoughts that they had had about Scientology and disclose their sexual fantasies. Debbie Cook, who spent seven weeks in the Hole in 2007, said that [...] "most of the time the activities [...] were either you confessing your own sins or bad things that you'd done, or getting other people to confess theirs." [...] Mike Rinder commented on the bizarre personal dynamics of the Hole: [...] "These were your friends, people you had traveled with. But then, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hole? You can't trust anybody." ...|$|E
500|$|Produced by Cool & Dre, {{the song}} was {{recorded}} at Allido Sound Studios in New York, by Derek Pacuk, while the mixing was done by Serban Ghanea. Wale recalled in a 2011 interview with MTV News for Lady Gaga: Inside the Outside special, that the recording session did not go easy. He had traveled to the New York recording studio from Washington D.C. after a long night of partying. Gaga {{was already in the}} studio in her exuberant style with a big ribbon atop her head by which Wale was taken aback, and was a [...] "cultural difference" [...] for him. In an effort to warm up to each other they made small talk about their respective record deals with Interscope. By the end of the session, Gaga had created five different hooks for [...] "Chillin" [...] and added her vocals on the track. The rapper added, [...] "It took a while. Once we finally got the ball rolling, it was almost time to go. It was natural though. It's wack when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio with somebody and it's automatically music time— it feels fake. We were trying to feel each other out." [...] Wale later added {{that he would like to}} collaborate with Gaga again on a track but it was unknown to him if Gaga would be interested.|$|E

[...] Alleging that he copied the cover from Nas' {{landmark}} release Illmatic, as well as styles from other rap artists. This generated longstanding controversy over their differences with B.I.G., and in later interviews, both rappers would downplay the incident: [...] "It {{was one of them}} skits where we was looking at our competition. And when Ghost is saying whatever he was saying, we kinda knew who he was talking about, but it wasn't like we was trying to start a beef. It's just sometimes, when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> booth and you start saying what you wanna say, it just happened." ...|$|E

2500|$|A large Irish {{population}} in this cluster of Midwestern cities hosts an impressive St. Patrick's Day parade. [...] It is [...] "the only bi-state St. Patrick's Day Parade in the USA", {{according to the}} St. Patrick's Day Society of the Quad Cities (http://www.stpatsqc.com/GrandParade.htm), crossing the Centennial Bridge from Rock Island, Illinois into Davenport, Iowa. [...] Being so close to Chicago, this parade still gathers around 200,000 annually on its historical parade route.

[...] Much of this is due to the unique nature and small town hospitality <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Quad Cities. [...] The whole area combined is a population of around 350,000, with Davenport being the largest city at just under 100,000.|$|E
2500|$|ERICKSON: You know, I had {{one patient}} this last July who had {{four or five}} years of {{psychoanalysis}} and got nowhere with it. And someone who knows her said, [...] "How much attention did you give to the past?" [...] I said, [...] "You know, I completely forgot about that." [...] That patient is, I think, a reasonably cured person. It was a severe washing compulsion, as much as twenty hours a day. I didn't go in to the cause or the etiology; the only searching question I asked was [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shower to scrub yourself for hours, tell me, do you start {{at the top of your}} head, or the soles of your feet, or in the middle? Do you wash from the neck down, or do you start with your feet and wash up? Or do you start with your head and wash down?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Le Guin's {{feelings}} towards anarchism {{are closely}} tied to her Taoist beliefs and both ideas appear in her work. [...] "Taoism and Anarchism fit together in some very interesting ways and I've been a Taoist ever since I learned what it was." [...] She has participated in numerous peace marches and although she does not call herself an anarchist since she does not live the lifestyle, she does feel that [...] "Democracy is good but it isn't {{the only way to}} achieve justice and a fair share." [...] Le Guin has said: [...] "The Dispossessed is an Anarchist utopian novel. Its ideas come from the Pacifist Anarchist tradition – Kropotkin etc. So did some of the ideas of the so-called counterculture of the sixties and seventies." [...] She has also said that anarchism [...] "is a necessary ideal at the very least. It is an ideal without which we couldn't go on. If you are asking me is anarchism at this point a practical movement, well, then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> question of where you try to do it and who's living on your boundary?" ...|$|E
