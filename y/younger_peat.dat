40|$|The Rieseberger Moor is a fen, 145 {{hectares}} in size, situated about 20 km east of Brunswick (Braunschweig), Lower Saxony, Germany. Peat was dug in the fen - {{with changing}} intensity - since the mid- 18 th century until around AD 1955. According to Schneekloth & Schneider (1971) the remaining peat (fen and wood peat) is predominantly 1. 5 to 2 m thick (maximum 2. 7 m). Part of the fen - now a nature reserve (NSG BR 005) - is wooded (Betula, Salix, Alnus). For {{more information on}} the Rieseberger Moor see [URL] Willi Selle was the first to publish pollen diagrams from this site (Selle 1935, profiles Rieseberger Torfmoor I and II). This report deals with a 2. 2 m long profile from the wooded south-eastern part of the fen consisting of strongly decomposed fen peat taken A. D. 1965 and studied by pollen analysis in the same year. The peat below 1. 45 m contained silt and clay, samples 1. 48 and 1. 58 m even fine sand. These samples had to be treated with HF (hydrofluoric acid) in addition to the treatment with hot caustic potash solution. The coring ended in sandy material. The new pollen data reflect {{the early part of the}} known postglacial development of the vegetation of this area: the change from a birch dominated forest to a pine forest and the later spreading of Corylus and of the thermophilous deciduous tree genera Quercus, Ulmus, Tilia and Fraxinus followed by the expansion of Alnus. The new data are in agreement with Selle's results, except for Alnus, which in Selle's pollen diagram II shows high values (up to 42 % of the arboreal pollen sum) even in samples deposited before Corylus and Quercus started to spread. On contrary the new pollen diagram shows that alder pollen - although present in all samples - is frequent in the three youngest pollen spectra only. A period with dominating Alnus as seen in the uppermost part of Selle's pollen diagrams is missing. The latter is most likely the result of peat cutting at the later coring site, whereas the early, unusually high alder values of Selle's pollen study are probably caused by contamination of the pollen samples with <b>younger</b> <b>peat.</b> Selle took peat samples usually with a "Torfbohrer" (= Hiller sampler). This side-filling type of sampler with an inner chamber and an outer loose jacket offers - if not handled with appropriate care - ample opportunities to contaminate older peat with carried off younger material. Pollen grains of Fagus (2 % of the arboreal pollen sum) were found in two samples only, namely in the uppermost samples of the new profile (0. 18 m) and of Selle's profile I (0. 25 m). If this pollen is autochthonous, with other words: if this surface-near peat was not disturbed by human activities, the Fagus pollen indicates an Early Subboreal age of this part of the profile. The accumulation of the Rieseberg peat started during the Preboreal. Increased values of Corylus, Quercus and Ulmus indicate that sample 0. 78 m of the new profile is the oldest Boreal sample. The high Alnus values prove the Atlantic age of the <b>younger</b> <b>peat.</b> Whether Early Subboreal peat exists at the site is questionable, but evidently none of the three profiles reaches to Late Subboreal time, when Fagus spread in the region. Did peat-growth end during the Subboreal? Did <b>younger</b> <b>peat</b> exist, but got lost by peat cutting or has <b>younger</b> <b>peat</b> simply not yet been found in the Rieseberg fen? These questions cannot be answered with this study. The temporary decline of the curve of Pinus for the benefit of Betula during the Preboreal, unusual for this period, is contemporaneous with the deposition of sand (Rieseberger Moor II, 1. 33 - 1, 41 m; samples 1. 48 and 1. 58 m of the new profile) and must be considered a local phenomenon.

40|$|Organic soils in peatlands store a great {{proportion}} of the global soil carbon pool and can lose carbon via the atmosphere due to degradation. In Germany, most of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from organic soils are attributed to sites managed as grassland. Here, we investigated a land use gradient from near-natural wetland (NW) to an extensively managed (GE) to an intensively managed grassland site (GI), all formed in the same bog complex in northern Germany. Vertical depth profiles of δ 13 C, δ 15 N, ash content, C / N ratio and bulk density as well as radiocarbon ages were studied to identify peat degradation and to calculate carbon loss. At all sites, including the near-natural site, δ 13 C depth profiles indicate aerobic decomposition in the upper horizons. Depth profiles of δ 15 N differed significantly between sites with increasing δ 15 N values in the top soil layers paralleling an increase in land use intensity owing to differences in peat decomposition and fertilizer application. At both grassland sites, the ash content peaked within the first centimetres. In the near-natural site, ash contents were highest in 10 – 60 cm depth. The ash profiles, {{not only at the}} managed grassland sites, but also at the near-natural site indicate that all sites were influenced by anthropogenic activities either currently or in the past, most likely due to drainage. Based on the enrichment of ash content and changes in bulk density, we calculated the total carbon loss from the sites since the peatland was influenced by anthropogenic activities. Carbon loss at the sites increased in the following order: NW < GE < GI. Radiocarbon ages of peat in the topsoil of GE and GI were hundreds of years, indicating the loss of <b>younger</b> <b>peat</b> material. In contrast, peat in the first centimetres of the NW was only a few decades old, indicating recent peat growth. It is likely that the NW site accumulates carbon today but was perturbed by anthropogenic activities in the past. Together, all biogeochemical parameters indicate a degradation of peat due to (i) conversion to grassland with historical drainage and (ii) land use intensification...|$|E

2500|$|The lake may be {{infilled}} with deposited sediment {{and gradually}} become a wetland {{such as a}} swamp or marsh. [...] Large water plants, typically reeds, accelerate this closing process significantly because they partially decompose to form peat soils that fill the shallows. Conversely, peat soils in a marsh can naturally burn and reverse this process to recreate a shallow lake resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between marsh and lake. This is significant since wildfire has been largely suppressed {{in the developed world}} over the past century. This has artificially converted many shallow lakes into emergent marshes. Turbid lakes and lakes with many plant-eating fish tend to disappear more slowly. A [...] "disappearing" [...] lake (barely noticeable on a human timescale) typically has extensive plant mats at the water's edge. These become a new habitat for other plants, like peat moss when conditions are right, and animals, many of which are very rare. Gradually the lake closes and <b>young</b> <b>peat</b> may form, forming a fen. In lowland river valleys where a river can meander, the presence of peat is explained by the infilling of historical oxbow lakes. In the very last stages of succession, trees can grow in, eventually turning the wetland into a forest.|$|R

40|$|Irish peat, used as {{a growing}} medium in horticulture, tends {{to have a higher}} state of {{decomposition}} and a higher potential buffering capacity than some of the <b>younger</b> <b>peats</b> from Scandinavian or Baltic countries. Particularly where hard water, with high bicarbonate content, is used for irrigation this could be an important property in giving the peat greater stability with respect to pH levels throughout the cropping period. It may also influence the optimum rate of lime to be applied to adjust the pH prior to cropping. The effect of peat type on the performance of nursery stock plants, Azalea and Hebe in 2 -litre containers, was studied when irrigated with both soft and hard water and with different rates of lime in the peat growing medium. When irrigated with hard water, the rate of pH increase was less with relatively decomposed Irish <b>peat</b> than with <b>younger</b> Baltic <b>peats.</b> Using Irish peat, a rate of dolomitic lime addition to the peat of 4 kg/m 3 was best for Hebe when irrigated with soft water. Irrigating with hard water the lime rate could vary between 2 and 4 kg/m 3 without affecting plant performance. With the Baltic peats, increasing the rate of lime addition above 2 kg/m 3 tended to reduce growth of Hebe. Azalea gave better results when irrigated with soft water. In hard water areas therefore it is advisable, if possible, to collect rain water from a greenhouse roof for irrigation purposes. A zero rate of lime gave inferior results with Azalea. With hard water a rate of 1 kg/m 3 was optimum. With soft water this could be increased to 2 kg/m 3 without damage. New formulations of the controlled release fertiliser (CRF) have been introduced recently. An experiment was carried out to evaluate the CRFs available in Ireland for the production of containerised nursery stock over a 12 month period. The effect of rate of CRF was also studied. Experiments were also located in the Colleges of Horticulture in Warrenstown and Kildalton. All the CRFs in these experiments produced acceptable results in terms of plant performance. There were differences between the CRFs but these were not consistent between the experiments. The vigorous species Lonicera pileata and Escallonia macrantha responed positively to rates of CRF up to 8 kg/m 3. The conifer, Thuja plicata gave no response to rates above 6 kg/m 3. In an experiment over two seasons using 20 nursery stock species, a liquid feeding system resulted in heavier plants of most species than did one based on a controlled release fertiliser.

The radiocarbon analyses revealed a remarkable fractionation for identical vascular plant markers (∼ 420 ‰ or ∼ 6000 14 C years) upon settling from surface water to the underlying sediments. From this, we infer fluvial export of two SOC pools; a <b>young</b> surface <b>peat</b> component, and an old deep mineral soil component. The young pool exists as an easily degradable humic suspension, while the old pool is matrix protected from degradation and ballasted for preferential settling.

40|$|A {{pilot study}} at the Aleza Lake Research Forest (ALRF) in east-central {{interior}} British Columbia (BC) examined the timing of peatland initiation using accelerator radiocarbon dating of peat deposits. At the ALRF, Sphagnum bogs occupy numerous closed depressions in an undulating plain underlain by impervious, fine-textured glacial lake sediments. Four adjacent Sphagnum bogs differed greatly in depth, with maximum peat thicknesses ranging from 70 to > 550 cm. The oldest peat (9, 177 ± 55 ¹⁴C yr BP) occurred in a deposit less than 2 m thick, while a basal peat sample {{could not be obtained}} from the deepest basin examined.

Plant macrofossils and charcoal preserved in peat deposits could provide additional evidence for Holocene paleoenvironments in this region. "Not peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Extraction of {{drinking}} water from the dunes in North Kennemerland had caused a permanent fall in watertable in the dune area, impairing the suitability of originally valuable soils for horticulture. At {{the request of the}} provincial government of North Holland, this area and adjoining polders were investigated. The study of profiles and fossil gley horizons allowed assessment of former water tables and provided data for the plan to replenish the reserve of fresh water by surface water from the rivers in the central parts of the coastal dune area of the Netherlands. North Kennemerland consists of old dunes (beach barriers or ridges), <b>young</b> dunes, <b>peat</b> and marine deposits. After the formation of the old marine sand and beach ridges (4000 - 2000 B. C.) the sea broke in and deposited sandy inland deltas (300 B. C.)

40|$|In 65 samples, we got values (unusually replicable and {{consistent}} {{for this type}} of work) of concentration, 14 C/ 13 C (AMS) age, and δ 13 C for: peat, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), peat fractions, and dissolved CO 2 and CH 4 at 50 -cm intervals down to 700 cm in Ellergower Moss, a rainwater-dependent raised (domed) bog in southwest Scotland. (1) We attribute the consistency of the results to Ellergower Moss being unusually homogeneous, with unusually low hydraulic conductivity, and containing only a few gas spaces; and to the sampling methods including 18 -month equilibration of in situ samplers. (2) The dissolved gas concentration depth profiles are convex and very similar to each other, though CO 2 is 5 – 10 times more concentrated than CH 4, while the profile of DOC is concave. (3) The age profile of peat is near linearly proportional to depth; that for DOC is about 500 – 1000 yr <b>younger</b> than the <b>peat</b> at the same depth; the dissolved gases are 500 – 4300 years <b>younger</b> than the <b>peat.</b> The age of the operational peat fractions humic acid and humin {{is similar to that of}} whole peat.

Nearer the surface both dissolved gases become steadily more depleted, δ 13 C is about 20 ‰ less at the surface.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this study are soil samples taken in the “Makkumer Waard”, a wide expanse of low-lying land, which follows the Frisian coast. Stratigraphical and palynological {{investigations}} showed that {{in the beginning of the}} Atlanticum the area lay below the level of the sea, but that gradually the influence of the sea decreased and peat formation became possible. From the transition from marine deposits to Sphagnum peat (— 4, 55 m to — 3, 50 m) we must conclude that there has been a temporary standstill in the transgression, or even a regression, in the middle of the Atlanticum. Towards the end of the Atlantic period a sudden marine transgression followed, which deposited a layer of sand and clay on the Sphagnum peat (— 3, 50 m to — 3, 30 m). Shortly before the beginning of the Subboreal (which probably sets in at — 3, 10 m) an important regression began and an Eriophorum peat was formed directly on the clay (— 3, 30 m to — 3. 00 m).

The origin of long-travelled dust is established using a provenance model to fingerprint the source regions from where dust was entrained [1, 2]. This is achieved by matching the chemistry of dust with that from a database of samples collected from the major dust source regions in Australia (n = 220).

40|$|Previous {{attempts}} to radiocarbon date sediments > 10 kyr {{from the high}} rainfall region of Westland, New Zealand, a critical location for investigation of interhemispheric patterns of climate change, have been problematic. This study, building on recent work by Vandergoes and Prior (2003), shows that AMS 14 C dating of pollen concentrates has potential to provide more reliable ages than other sediment constituents, including plant macrofossils. The method was applied to sediments from three sites containing the 22. 6 k 14 C yr Kawakawa Tephra, which provided an independent test of the 14 C ages. Although some minor laboratory contamination was detected in tests on background standards, the modelled relationship between sample mass and measured 14 C content permitted an appropriate correction to be determined. Improved pollen concentrations derived by density separation between 1. 4 and 1. 2 specific gravity and sieving in the range 10 - 50 m provided either older ages than other fractions of the same sample or, where in situ contamination was not evident, equivalent ages. Differences in degree of in situ contamination between depositional environments indicated that, in Westland, lake sites may be less susceptible to contamination by <b>younger</b> carbon than <b>peat</b> sites, where this process may be facilitated by root penetration into underlying sediments...|$|R
40|$|Two new Standard pollen {{diagrams}} {{from the}} raised bog Ageröds mosse in central Scania are presented and discussed. They {{have been made}} giving extensive consideration to the NAP and spores also. The new diagrams comprise in the main only the Post-glacial and can easily {{be compared with the}} earlier published Standard diagram from the bog (T. NILSSON 1935). The development of the Post-glacial Vegetation in the surroundings is also discussed and compared with the conditions in the southernmost part of the province (Bjärsjöholmssjön, T. Nilsson 1961). One of the new diagrams has been prepared in connection with the study of a core brought up by means of a special borer in order to bring about C 14 datings. The core was almost ömlong and had a diameter of 6 cm. It was divided into pieces of 2 - 6 cm, which were preserved. After the preparation of the pollen diagram, suitable samples were selected for C 14 dating. In all 33 samples, comprising the whole Post-glacial inclusive of the youngest part of the Late-glacial, were C 14 -dated. With the aid of the C 14 dates the growth conditions of the bog are discussed. After very slow Sedimentation of predominantly minerogenous deposits in {{the last part of the}} Late-glacial, and still slow Sedimentation of gyttjas in the oldest part of the Post-glacial, the rate of growth (primarily of the gyttja) distinctly increased in the first part of the Late Boreal. A temporary retardation of the growth of the sphagnum peat at the end of the Sub-boreal is probably entirely local. The average rate of growth of the really highly humified parts of the old sphagnum peat amounts to 42 mm per Century, that of the slightly humified <b>young</b> sphagnum <b>peat</b> 81 mm per Century or somewhat more.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{provided}} fundamental {{information on the}} fate of urine nitrogen (N) when applied to pasture soils. In this work the three pasture soils used were a Bruntwood silt loam (BW), an old well-developed (lime and fertilizer incorporated and farmed for more than 20 years) peat soil (OP) and a <b>young</b> <b>peat</b> (YP) which was less developed (farmed for about 10 years). Initial soil chemical and physical measurements revealed that the peat soils were acidic, had higher cation exchange capacities, had greater carbon:nitrogen ratios and were better buffered against changes in soil pH than the BW soil. However, the BW soil was more fertile with a higher pH. The peat soils had lower bulk densities and higher porosities. Four experiments were performed. In the first experiment ¹⁵N-labelled urine was applied at 500 kg N ha⁻¹ to intact soil cores of the three soils. Treatments imposed were the presence and absence of a water table at two temperatures, 8 °C or 23 ° C, over 11 - 14 weeks. ¹⁵N budgets were determined. This first experiment showed that the nitrification rate was faster in the BW soil and was retarded with a water table present. Significant leaching of nitrate occurred at 8 °C in the BW soil without a water table. This was reduced when a water table was present. Leaching losses of urine-N were lower in the peat soils than in the BW soil. Apparent denitrification losses (i. e. calculated on a total-N recovery basis) ranged from 18 to 48 % of the ¹⁵N-applied with the greatest losses occurring in the peat soils. The second experiment examined denitrification losses, over 30 days, following the application of synthetic urine-N at 420 kg N ha⁻¹ to small soil cores situated in growth cabinets. The effects of temperature (8 °C or 18 °C) and synthetic urine (presence or absence) were measured on the BW and OP soils. Nitrous oxide (N₂ 0) measurements were taken from all soil cores and a sub-set of soil cores, at 18 °C, had ¹⁵N-labelled synthetic urine-N applied so that ¹⁵N-labelled nitrogen gases could be monitored. This experiment showed that the application of synthetic urine and increased soil temperature enhanced denitrification losses from both soils. Denitrification losses, at 18 °C, as ¹⁵N-labelled nitrogen gases accounted for 24 to 39 % of the nitrogen applied. Nitrous oxide comprised less than half of this denitrification loss. Losses of N₂ 0 in leachate samples from the soil cores accounted for less than 0. 1 % of the nitrogen applied. A third experiment, using Iysimeters, was performed over a 150 day period in the field. The six treatments consisted of the 3 soils with applied synthetic urine, with or without a simulated water table; each replicated three times. Lysimeters were installed in the field at ground level and ¹⁵N-labelled synthetic urine-N was applied (500 kg N ha⁻¹) on June 4 1992 (day 1). Nitrification rates differed between the soils following the trend noticed in the first experiment. As in the first experiment, nitrate was only detected in the leachate from the BW soil and the inclusion of a water table reduced the concentration of nitrate. In the BW soil, the leachate nitrate concentrations exceeded the World Health Organisation's recommended limit (< 10 mg N L- 1) regardless of water table treatment. No nitrate was detected in the leachates from the peat soils but there was some leaching of organic-N (< 5 % of N added) in all the peat soil treatments. Denitrification losses were monitored for the first 100 days of the experiment. In the BW soil without a water table, N₂ 0 production peaked at approximately day 20 and accounted for 3 % of the nitrogen applied. In the peat soils the measured denitrification losses accounted for less than 1 % of the nitrogen applied. Apparent denitrification losses in the peats were, however, calculated to be approximately 50 % of the ¹⁵N-labelled synthetic urine-N applied. It is postulated that the difference between apparent denitrification losses and those measured could have been due to; loss of dinitrogen in leachate, protracted production of dinitrogen below detectable limits, production of denitrification gases after measurements ceased (i. e. days 100 to 150) and entrapment of dinitrogen in soil cores. Due to the apparent denitrification losses being so high, further research into this nitrogen loss pathway was performed. The fourth and final experiment measured denitrification directly using highly enriched (50 atom %) ¹⁵N-labelled synthetic urine-N. It was performed in a growth cabinet held initially at 8 °C. The ¹⁵N-labelled synthetic urine was applied at 500 kg N ha⁻¹ to small soil cores of each soil type. Fluxes of N₂ 0 and ¹⁵N-labelled gases were measured daily for 59 days. On day 42 the temperature of the growth cabinet was increased to 12 °C in an attempt to simulate the mean soil temperature {{at the end of the}} field experiment. Up to this time, production of nitrogenous gases from the YP soil had been very low. Interpretation of gaseous nitrogen loss in the YP soil was difficult due to the possibility of chemodenitrification occurring. However, in the OP and BW soils, gaseous losses of nitrogen (determined as ¹⁵N-labelled gas) represented 16 and 7 % of the nitrogen applied respectively. Nitrous oxide comprised approximately half of this gaseous nitrogen loss, in both the OP and BW soils. This work implies that urine-N applied to the mineral soil (BW) could potentially threaten the quality of ground water due to nitrate contamination through leaching. In contrast, denitrification appears to be the major loss mechanism from the peat soils, with the production of nitrous oxide being the primary focus for any environmental concern. Future work should examine the fate of the nitrate leached from the BW soil and the potential for dilution, plant uptake or denitrification below a 30 cm soil depth. A better understanding of the denitrification mechanisms could help reduce denitrification and thereby improve the efficiency of nitrogen use and reduce the output of nitrous oxide...|$|R
