[...] "I give you {{the benefit of the}} doubt so long as you act the gentleman, but <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>respect</b> the {{presence}} of my sister, or I'll gag you."

5000|$|In the {{documentary}} Jodorowsky's Dune, Jodorowsky states:"It’s different. It was my Dune. When {{you make a}} picture, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> not <b>respect</b> the novel. It’s like you get married, no? You go with the wife, white, the woman is white. You take the woman, if you respect the woman, you will never have child. You need to open the costume and to… to rape the bride. And then you will have your picture. I was raping Frank Herbert, raping, like this! But with love, with love." ...|$|R

'Had it been wrung from you by compulsion, moral or physical, {{it would have}} been open to you to break it. But as you proposed a vow when your husband only required a good intention, I think you ought to adhere to it; or what is the pride worth that led you to offer it?' ...|$|E

"The same {{as those}} in all other forests. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>respect</b> the nests and the {{property}} of all other birds, and not interfere with them when they're hunting for food. And you must warn your fellow-birds whenever there is danger, and assist them to protect their young from prowling beasts. If you obey these laws, and do not steal from or interfere with your neighbors, {{you have a right}} to a nest in our forest." ...|$|E

(Lord! what {{a book that}} French Revolution of his is!) See what the world pays {{teachers}} and discoverers and what it pays business men! That shows the ones it really wants. There's a justice in these big things, George, {{over and above the}} apparent injustice. I tell you it wants trade. It's Trade that makes the world go round! Argosies! Venice! Empire!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Want! You don't {{suppose we}} want anything. If {{you think that}} the columns of the People's Banner are to be bought, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> have {{opinions}} <b>respecting</b> the press of the day which make me pity you as one grovelling in the very dust. The daily press of London is pure and immaculate. That is, the morning papers are. Want, indeed! What do you think I want?" ...|$|R
50|$|The year is 435 Tz, {{and every}} faction {{in the land}} is at war. If it {{continues}} there won't be much land left to fight over. The strain on the world's magical energy is literally tearing the land apart. The land's fate lies in your hands. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> earn the <b>respect</b> of all the races of the land, and together <b>you</b> <b>must</b> fight to keep the land alive. Travel the land earning respect and engage in battles along your journey leading up to an all out war.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not make}} {{yourself}} uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known <b>you</b> <b>must</b> be <b>respected</b> and valued; {{and you will}} not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up {{for the rest of}} her life." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{boy would}} have liked to do all that too, just to be with the crowd, but at home he had been taught to believe that Catholics were as good as anybody, and that <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>respect</b> everybody's religion. His father and the priest were {{friendly}} acquaintances, and in a dim way he knew that his father had sometimes taken the Catholics' part in his paper when the prejudice against foreigners ran high. He liked to go to the Catholic church, though he was afraid of the painted figure that hung full length on the wooden crucifix, with the blood-drops under the thorns on its forehead, and the red wound in its side. He was afraid of it as something both dead and alive; he could not keep his eyes away from the awful, beautiful, suffering face, and the body that seemed to twist in agony, and the hands and feet so cruelly nailed to the cross.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{have never}} tried it as I shall now. At first, I {{did not know}} the truth, then I was afraid to believe, and {{struggled}} blindly to forget. Now I see clearly, I confess it, I resolve to conquer it, and I will not yield until I have done my best. You say <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>respect</b> me. Could you do so if I no longer respected myself? I should not, if I forgot all Geoffrey had borne and done for me, and could not bear and do this thing for him. I must make the effort, and make it silently; for he is very proud with all his gentleness, and would reject the seeming sacrifice though he would make one doubly hard for love of me. If I am to stay with him, it spares him the bitterest pain he could suffer; if I am to go, it gives him a few more months of happiness, and I may so prepare him that the parting will be less hard. How others would act I cannot tell, I only know that this seems right to me; and I must fight my fight alone, even if I die in doing it." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>respect</b> {{others as}} well as yourself. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>respect</b> not only human life but also that of other beings. Ideally we should refrain from killing any form of life. Conflicts can be avoided through mutual respect and discussions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church is}} non-creedal, having, {{in the words}} of its web site, [...] "No single {{religious}} text. No ten commandments. No creed to which <b>you</b> <b>must</b> agree ... This <b>respect</b> for individual particularity and openness to diverse sources of wisdom means our community is packed with a wide array of perspectives and beliefs." [...] The church's mission statement is: [...] "Creating connection by listening to our deepest selves, opening to life's gifts and serving needs greater than our own - every day!" [...] The church school has a stated goal of encouraging children [...] "to seek their own truths, to clarify their values, and to live lives of meaning inspired by those values." ...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we have {{discussed}} {{the notion of a}} belief manipulation problem, specifically in the context of cryptographic protocol verification. Formally, a belief manipulation attack can occur in any environment where intelligent agents have fallible, dynamic beliefs. In order to manipulate the beliefs of an agent, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>respect</b> certain constraints and you must understand the way that your opponent’s beliefs change. In this paper, we have represented the constraints as sets of propositional formulas and we have represented the belief change process in terms of AGM belief revision operators. The result is a simple, concrete formulation of a belief manipulation problem that can be applied accross a wide range of applications.|$|E

To ensure successful migration and subsequent functioning of the virtual machine, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>respect</b> certain compatibility constraints. This information guide describes CPU compatibility issues and outlines some CPU compatibility checks that VMware VirtualCenter performs before allowing migration with VMotion. It describes why some CPU compatibility constraints make VMotion possible only between certain revisions of CPUs. The appendices detail some differences in features and extensions in current CPUs and describe procedures {{you can use to}} relax some CPU compatibility constraints to facilitate VMotion. This guide is primarily intended for: Purchasing managers and system administrators who configure and purchase new servers for a data center upgrade System administrators who want to perform migrations with VMotion or want to relax CPU compatibility constraints in order to circumvent VMotion checks High level IT staff who make decisions on potential data center upgrades Anyone who wants to understand how CPU compatibility constraints can affect live migration of virtua...|$|E

6000|$|There was a wise old heathen once, who said, [...] "Maxima debetur pueris reverentia"--The {{greatest}} reverence {{is due to}} children; that is, that grown {{people should}} never say or do anything wrong before children, lest they should set them a bad example.--Cousin Cramchild says it means, [...] "The greatest respectfulness is expected from little boys." [...] But {{he was raised in}} a country where little boys are not expected to be respectful, because all of them are as good as the President:- Well, every one knows his own concerns best; so perhaps they are. But poor Cousin Cramchild, to do him justice, not being of that opinion, and having a moral mission, and being no scholar to speak of, and hard up for an authority--why, it was a very great temptation for him. But some people, and I am afraid the professor was one of them, interpret that in a more strange, curious, one-sided, left-handed, topsy-turvy, inside-out, behind-before fashion than even Cousin Cramchild; for they make it mean, that <b>you</b> <b>must</b> show your <b>respect</b> for children, by never confessing yourself in the wrong to them, even if you know that you are so, lest they should lose confidence in their elders.|$|R
