500|$|Madonna's backup singers Donna De Lory and Niki Haris {{were called}} in to provide harmonies on [...] "Survival". She commented, [...] "The minute <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> in , she was giving you the lyric sheet. That was the atmosphere—we're not here to just hang out. It's fun, but we're here to work and get this done". De Lory recalls the {{sessions}} for [...] "Survival" [...] took a [...] "couple of hours" [...] {{and there were no}} retakes. During recording sessions, Madonna was interested in working with Austin after he produced Joi's debut album The Pendulum Vibe (1994). According to the singer, [...] "She wanted to know, 'Who is this? Who produced it? How did this happen?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Miranda Sawyer, who {{attended}} the presentation, found special interest in a subsidiary incident during {{the evening of the}} prize ceremonies: the theft of money by several of the other invited witnesses: [...] "All the feelings of power and powerlessness that money can bring were fairly summarised with these thefts - it must have turned out better than the K Foundation could have hoped if the examination of cash, art and associated feelings was their point." [...] Sawyer named [...] "Britart" [...] figure Carl Freedman as one of those who had taken the money, and reported that [...] "He found the event funny, not offensive (you would too if <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> off with £1,600!), but thought the point had been made before." ...|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia. The opening sequence was filmed outside at night, though the subsequent sceneLucy's interrogation and executionoccurred in a motel set constructed on a sound stage. Atypical to the series, the motel room {{did not have a}} noticeable theme. Production designer John Marcynuk commented, [...] "That motel room was essentially a killing floor for the boys...and {{it was kind of a}} cold interrogation scene, so we tried to keep it not so friendly. When <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> through it, it definitely felt like a place [...] a murder had been committed. It wouldn't have been the first time a murder had been committed in that room, either. It was the type of place where bad things happen." [...] Marcynuk took a different approach for Gordon's death scene, utilizing green tones and a cool color palette to create a greater visual contrast with the blood.|$|E
500|$|As {{was common}} in the late 19th century South, Florida had imposed legal racial {{segregation}} under Jim Crow laws requiring separate black and white public facilities and transportation. Black and white residents created their own community centers: by 1920, the residents of Rosewood were mostly self-sufficient. [...] They had three churches, a school, a large Masonic Hall, a turpentine mill, a sugarcane mill, a baseball team named the Rosewood Stars, and two general stores, {{one of which was}} white-owned. [...] The village had about a dozen two-story wooden plank homes, other small two-room houses, and several small unoccupied plank farm and storage structures. Some families owned pianos, organs, and other symbols of middle-class prosperity. Survivors of Rosewood remember it as a happy place. [...] In 1995, survivor Robie Mortin recalled at age 79 that {{when she was a child}} there, that [...] "Rosewood was a town where everyone's house was painted. There were roses everywhere <b>you</b> <b>walked.</b> Lovely." ...|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh. OK, well, check this out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Yu Fan {{was from}} Yuyao County (餘姚縣), Kuaiji Commandery, {{which is in}} present-day Yuyao, Zhejiang. At a young age, he was already known for being studious and extraordinary. When he was 11, a guest who came to visit his elder brother ignored the young Yu Fan when he walked past him. Yu Fan later wrote to the guest, [...] "I heard that amber does not contain rotten plant {{material}} and that magnets do not attract bent needles. Is it not appropriate for you to ignore me when <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> past me?" [...] The guest was very surprised after reading Yu Fan's letter. Yu Fan attracted greater attention after this incident.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{during the}} 1980s, Rather gained further renown for his {{forceful}} and skeptical {{reporting on the}} Iran-Contra affair, which eventually led to an on-air confrontation with then Vice President George H. W. Bush: Bush referred to Rather's [...] "dead air incident" [...] saying, [...] "I {{want to talk about}} why I want to be President, why those 41 percent of the people are supporting me. And I don't think it's fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> off the set in New York?"

He said, [...] "That's my favorite spot on Central Avenue, that spot in the front of the Dunbar Hotel, because that to me was the hippest, most intimate, key spot of all the activity. [...] That's where all the night people hung out: the sportsmen, the businessmen, the dancers, everybody in show business, people who were somebody stayed at the hotel. … y far that block, that Dunbar Hotel, for me was it.

2500|$|On September 11, 1987, Rather {{walked off}} the set in anger just before a remote Evening News {{broadcast}} from Miami, where Pope John Paul II had begun a rare U.S. tour, when a U.S. Open tennis match was being broadcast into the time scheduled for the newscast. He was upset that the news was being cut into {{to make room for}} sports and discussed it with the sports department. The Steffi Graf–Lori McNeil tennis match coverage then ended sooner than expected at 6:32p.m., but Rather had disappeared. (CBS Sports had finally agreed to break away immediately after the match without commentary.) [...] Thus, over 100 affiliates were forced to broadcast six minutes of dead air. The next day, Rather apologized for leaving the anchor desk. The following year, when Rather asked then Vice President Bush about his role in the Iran–Contra affair during a live interview, Bush responded by saying, [...] "Dan, how would you like it if I judged your entire career by those seven minutes when <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> off the set in New York?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{subsequent}} legal hearings, residents testified how: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> {{right behind}} the factory it was like cotton. It was in {{the cracks in the}} pavement behind the factory;" [...] and: [...] "It used to be blue-white. We used to sweep this blue dust up. It was blue fluffy stuff... I used {{to get up in the}} morning and the other side of the street always had a layer of fine dust with footmarks on it from the early morning workers." [...] Of the conditions in the nearby school one said: [...] "The dust was always there while I was at school, lying on walls or window ledges if it had been damp. It was like snow fall." [...] Describing the loading bay, to which local children had easy access, one witness recalled: [...] "Sometimes sacks were left out overnight. They were hessian sacks and they were full of a sort of fluffy dust. We could jump on the sacks when they were left out... I remember seeing grey-blue coloured dust come out of them. If we jumped hard enough the sacks burst open. After sitting or bouncing on the sacks I remember being covered in dust." [...] During the summer doors and windows of both the factory and the houses were left open for cooling, and during the winter children often congregated around the factory's street-level ventilation outlets for warmth.|$|E

2500|$|Chase {{was born}} into a working-class Italian American family in Mount Vernon, New York. An only child, Chase grew up in a small garden {{apartment}} in Clifton, New Jersey and in North Caldwell. Chase has stated that as a child he had many problems with his parents, who he feels were overbearing. He grew up watching matinée crime films and was well known as a creative storyteller during his childhood. Chase claims his father was an angry man who belittled him constantly as a child and his mother was a [...] "passive-aggressive drama queen" [...] and a [...] "nervous woman who dominated any situation she was in by being so needy and always on the verge of hysteria. <b>You</b> <b>walked</b> on eggshells." [...] One of his characters on the HBO original series The Sopranos, Livia Soprano, is based on his mother. Chase struggled with panic attacks and severe depression as a teenager, something he still deals with today. He {{graduated from high school in}} 1964 and attended Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where his depression worsened. [...] "I slept 18 hours a day," [...] Chase later stated. He described his problems as [...] "what's come to be known as normal, nagging, clinical depression. It was awful." [...] He also worked as a drummer during this period, and held aspirations of being a professional musician. After two years, he transferred to New York University, where he chose to pursue a career in film, a decision that was not well received by his parents. He went on to attend Stanford University's School of Film.|$|E
