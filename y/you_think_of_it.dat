In high school, {{he was a}} running back and has said he enjoyed {{football}} [...] more than baseball at the time. [...] On the matter between the two he reflects, [...] "...in football I was a running back, so in the NFL my career would have probably lasted {{six or seven years}} and in baseball I ended up playing 23 years. In baseball you can play a long time so I think it's better when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May, Simon Schama, earlier mooted as a {{supporter}} of Gove's reforms of the history curriculum, delivered an excoriating speech in which he characterised the finalised proposals as [...] "insulting and offensive" [...] and [...] "pedantic and utopian", accusing Gove of constructing a [...] "ridiculous shopping list" [...] of subjects. He urged the audience at the Hay Festival: [...] "Tell Michael Gove what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Let him know." [...] In June, leaked documents revealed that {{a member of the}} government's curriculum advisory group had described the reform process as having had [...] "a very chaotic feel. It's typical of government policy at the moment: they don't think things through very carefully, they don't listen to anyone and then just go ahead and rush into major changes." [...] In September, Robin Alexander said that the proposed reforms to the primary-level national curriculum were [...] "neo Victorian", [...] "educationally inappropriate and pedagogically counter-productive". In October almost 200 people, including Carol Ann Duffy, Melvin Burgess and Michael Rosen, as well as academics from Oxford, Bristol and Newcastle signed a letter to The Times condemning Gove's reforms, warning of the [...] "enormous" [...] and negative risks they posed to children and their education.|$|E
