500|$|The show's writers {{reject the}} idea that The Daily Show has {{become a source of}} news for young people. Stewart argues that Americans are living in an [...] "age of {{information}} osmosis" [...] in which it is close to impossible to gain one's news from any single source, and says that his show succeeds comedically because the viewers already have some knowledge about current events. [...] "Our show would not be valuable to people who didn't understand the news because it wouldn't make sense," [...] he argues. [...] "We make assumptions about your level of knowledge that... if we were your only source of news, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> watch our show and think, 'I don't know what's happening.'" ...|$|E
500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> lie there and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E
500|$|After retiring, Friday {{moved back}} to London and {{returned}} to work as an asphalter and decorator. Soon after Friday left Cardiff, Reading manager Maurice Evans was presented with a petition, signed by 3,000 supporters, requesting that he attempt to re-sign Friday. Evans contacted Friday and told him: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> settle down {{for three or four}} years, you could play for England". Friday replied with the question [...] "How old are you?", and after Evans answered, continued: [...] "I'm half your age and I've lived twice your life". Evans reflected, [...] "You may well be right". Friday trained with Brentford during the 1978–79 pre-season, but after regaining his fitness suddenly changed his mind and stopped coming to training. He married for a third time in 1980, but was divorced again within three years. After a short time living back with his parents in Acton, Friday's family secured him a housing association flat in the area. He served a prison sentence during the 1980s for impersonating a police officer and confiscating people's drugs, and was found dead in his Acton flat on 22 December 1990 at the age of 38, having suffered a fatal heart attack. Biographer Paolo Hewitt claimed the incident {{to be the result of}} [...] "a suspected heroin overdose".|$|E

6000|$|... "And I suppose," [...] I said, [...] "that you {{are still}} as `enthusiastic' as ever. Eh? If I were <b>you</b> I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> mention my enthusiasm to Mrs Anthony. Why not?" ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{choosing}} {{to write the}} character and develop the series initially, Goddard said, [...] "With Matt Murdock I just had such a personal connection to that character it was just like, 'I have to do this.' I don't want to ... be a guy that just takes the comics and then shoots them onscreen. I think it's our job to treat it as if it's our run. If I'm the writer of a comic book, you wouldn't just retell someone else's story, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> take that ball and move it forward." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Good," [...] {{said the}} man; [...] "but I {{wish it was}} ready now. And now, sir, if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> glance over this book, while {{we are waiting for}} supper--" ...|$|E
5000|$|Mr. Heart & Soul, a mime {{that was}} criticized for talking and singing {{throughout}} his performance. Morgan reacted: [...] "You have an appalling singing voice, so if I were <b>you,</b> I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> keep quiet." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh! I am sure <b>you</b> <b>would.</b> <b>You</b> are <b>just</b> {{the same}} sort of fellow I was when at your age, and I was much happier after I was married, so I know it. Now, you see, your cousin has a hundred {{thousand}} pounds; in fact something more than that." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Unless," [...] {{said his}} father, [...] "you had {{something}} above you, to push against, {{so as to}} push yourselves down. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> like a boy in a boat, off from the shore, and without any paddle or pole. He could not get back again." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We do. Where's Hell now? Eighty {{years ago}} it warmed the whole Church. It was--as some atheist or other put it the other day--the central heating of the soul. But never mind that point now. Consider the {{essential}} question, the question of breaking with the church. Ask yourself, whither would you go? To become an oddity! A Dissenter. A Negative. Self emasculated. The spirit that denies. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> go out. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> cease to serve Religion. That would be all. You wouldn't do anything. The Church would go on; everything else would go on. Only you would {{be lost in the}} outer wilderness.|$|E
