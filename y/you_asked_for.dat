5|$|Little {{was seen}} of Katsura {{for the next}} few years. She made 30 {{exhibition}} appearances in 1958, and went on a one-week exhibition engagement the following year with Harold Worst, but did not compete in any professional tournaments. In 1959, she made two television appearances on ABC's <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> <b>for</b> It, and one on the CBS primetime television hit What's My Line?. Katsura returned to competition in 1961, playing a challenge match for the World Three-Cushion title against Worst, then reigning world champion, and was defeated by him. Katsura disappeared from the sport thereafter, only making a brief impromptu appearance in 1976. She moved back to Japan in about 1990 and died in 1995.|$|E
25|$|In addition, she {{was given}} overdue tribute in 1958, on This is Your Life with Ralph Edwards. It brought a tearful reunion with Helen's old friend, actress Fifi D'Orsay, and a lifelong fan who once sent her money when she was down on her luck. Renewed {{interest}} in Helen brought her a one-record contract with MGM Records and appearances on I've Got a Secret and <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> <b>for</b> It. She sang {{on all of these}} TV shows.|$|E
500|$|On March 1, 1959, Katsura {{appeared}} on CBS' popular primetime television show, What's My Line? The show {{was in the}} format of a guessing game, in which a panel attempted to determine the line (occupation), {{or in the case}} of a famous [...] "mystery guest", the identity of the contestant. After she signed in using Japanese characters on a chalk board, show officials listed Katsura's occupation for the audience as [...] "Professional Billiard Player (World's Women's Champion)". Panelist Arlene Francis was successful in guessing Katsura's occupation, though she admitted that she had read about her but said she had never seen her picture. Later that month Katsura made a guest appearance on ABC's <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> <b>For</b> It, going behind the scenes of westerns to show how television productions set up and filmed a covered wagon rolling over and crashing on cue. She appeared again on <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> <b>For</b> It in a November 25, 1960 broadcast, this time operating in her bailiwick, demonstrating trick shots for the camera.|$|E

They appeared on well known television shows such as The Today Show, The Tonight Show, Wild Kingdom, and <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> <b>For</b> It. Publications including Colliers, Life, Popular Mechanics, Reader's Digest, Saturday Evening Post, Time, and even The Wall Street Journal featured them and their work. Although Keller was often {{the public face of}} ABE with some ads referring to [...] "Keller Breland's I.Q. Zoo," [...] the Brelands collaborated equally in ABE's endeavors.|$|E
500|$|In the US three {{publishers}} {{turned the}} book down before Macmillan Publishing Co offered Fleming a deal. Casino Royale was published on 23 March 1954 in the US, but sales were poor, totalling only 4,000 copies {{across the entire}} US {{during the course of}} the year. When the novel was released as a US paperback in 1955, it was re-titled by publisher American Popular Library; Fleming's suggestions for a new title, The Double-O Agent and The Deadly Gamble, were disregarded in favour of <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> <b>for</b> It, but this marketing ploy failed to raise the interest. The Popular Library version also changed Bond's name, calling him [...] "Jimmy Bond".|$|E
500|$|Ramirez {{talked about}} how the second season would be {{different}} from the first, saying that the writers had spent the first season wondering [...] "if there was a place for dark and gritty content in superheroes" [...] and because of the positive fan reaction to that ("we got a loud answer of 'yes'"), approached the second season with the mindset, [...] "you wanted grounded and wanted dark, here’s Elektra and Punisher. <b>You</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> it." [...] Petrie, talking about the potential use of flashbacks in the season, said that sometimes it is best to [...] "peel back the layer of the onion through flashback, or two people in a room talking can have all the power in the world. That’s something we get to pick and choose." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{etymology}} {{states that}} michelada is a portmanteau of mi chela helada. The word chela {{is a popular}} term for a beer in Mexico. When <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> a chela, <b>you</b> are <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> a cold beer; therefore the phrase mi chela helada means [...] "my ice cold beer".|$|R
