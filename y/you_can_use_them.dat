40|$|ABSTRACT: A poster {{developed}} by the students of Mr. Neal’s 5 th grade class was specifically designed to educate their fellow schoolmates regarding snow and avalanche safety. The following is {{an overview of the}} poster, which was primarily written by the students. For an avalanche to occur {{there needs to be a}} bed surface, a weak-layer, and a slab. The slab must be a solid piece of snow and rest on top of a weak-layer. Humans are usually the trigger that causes the slab to break away and slide down the hill. Before traveling in an avalanche area you need to consider the snowpack, weather, and terrain. The snowpack is made of layers of different snow types, like facets or rounds, and the correct layering can cause an avalanche. Avalanches usually occur on 30 to 45 degree slopes, and other factors such as trees and rocks could make them more deadly. The weather is also important because wind and heavy snow can lead to unsafe conditions. When traveling in avalanche terrain be sure to travel one-at-a-time so that many people do not become buried. But, if someone does get buried <b>you</b> <b>can</b> rescue <b>them</b> <b>using</b> an avalanche beacon, shovel, and probe—which you should always carry with you...|$|R
40|$|Imagine {{that you}} are a courier service, and you want to deliver some cargo from one city to another. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> deliver <b>them</b> <b>using</b> various flights from cities to cities, but each flight has a limited amount of space that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use.</b> An {{important}} question is, how much of our cargo can be shipped to the destination using the different flights available? To answer this question, we explore what is called a network flow graph, and show how we can model different problems using such a graph. A network flow graph G=(V,E) is a directed graph with two special vertices: the source vertex s, and the sink (destination) vertex t. Each vertex represents a city where we can send or receive cargo. An edge (u,v) in the graph means that there is a flight that flies directly from u to v. Each edge has an associated capacity, always finite, representing the amount of space available on this flight. For simplicity, we assume there can only be one edge (u,v) for vertices u and v, but we do allow reverse edges (v,u). With this graph, we now want to know how much cargo we can ship from s to t. Since the cargo &quot;flows &quot; through the graph from s to t, we call this the maximum flow problem. A straightforward solution is to do the following: keep finding paths from s to t where we can send flow along, send as much flow as possible along each path, and update the flow graph afterwards to account for the used space. The following shows an arbitrary selection of a path on the above graph...|$|R

40|$|Silicon is used {{in making}} {{transistors}} conventionally but scaling of silicon if getting difficult with time. Scaling of silicon has become difficult lately. Without scaling we won?t have more transistors on chip every year for same area. Recently a trend of GPGPUs (multicores) has emerged [1] but works only for parallel applications and most applications are not parallel. Considering this researchers are looking for alternate technology which can help us get speed benefits of scaling. There are number of such alternate technologies like quantum computation in which rules of quantum mechanics will be exploited to build a fast computer,but {{it is very difficult}} to construct and there is no definite estimate when we will be able to make one. Other is carbon nanotube field effect transistor [2]. The benefits of using carbon nanotube instead of silicon is it?s high conductivity and low power consumption. It is estimated and transistor can be 5 times faster and 4 times less power consuming as compared to silicon transistor of same technology. A 20 times power delay benefit is a huge benefit but it has its problem. Carbon Nanotubes are not necessarily semiconducting like silicon. They can be metallic as well as semiconducting depending on the geometry. If a Carbon Nanotubes are manufactured without any outside interference you get around 66 % semiconducting and 33 % metallic,but using various manufacturing methods <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have up to 95 % metallic CNTs.
