6000|$|You {{are now in}} need of some ready money; {{and what}} I propose is, that you shall go to work, [...] "tooth and nail," [...] for {{somebody}} who will give you money for it. Let father and your boys take charge of things at home--prepare for a crop, and make the crop; {{and you go to}} work for the best money wages, or in discharge of any debt you owe, that you can get. And to secure you a fair reward for your labor, I now promise you that for every dollar you will, between this and the first of next May, get for your own labor either in money or in your own indebtedness, I will then give you one other dollar. By this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from me you will get ten more, making twenty dollars a month for your work. In this, I do not mean you shall go off to St. Louis, or the lead mines, or the gold mines, in California, but I mean for you to go at it for the best wages you can get close to home, in Coles County. Now if you will do this, you will soon be out of debt, and what is better, you will have a habit that will keep <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> in debt again. But if I should now clear you out, next year you will be just as deep in as ever. You say you would almost give your place in Heaven for $70 or $80. Then you value your place in Heaven very cheaply, for I am sure you can with the offer I make you get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months' work. You say if I furnish you the money you will deed me the land, and if you don't pay the money back, you will deliver possession--Nonsense! If you can't now live with the land, how will you then live without it? You have always been kind to me, and I do not now mean to be unkind to you. On the contrary, if you will but follow my advice, you will find it worth more than eight times eighty dollars to you.|$|E

50|$|The full-twisting layout is {{a complex}} skill and {{requires}} professional coaching. The standing twist is a drill to aid with body awareness. Practicing this skill requires a perfect alignment of the body along the long axis. The long axis is an imaginary line running {{through the center of}} the body from head to toe. The purpose of the skill is to practice landing exactly how you started; arms over your head, feet together, and your body tightened and straight. Practicing the standing twist helps you gain awareness in the air. This awareness prevents <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> directionally lost in the air. It is recommended to start with a half twist, and then progress to a full twist.|$|E
