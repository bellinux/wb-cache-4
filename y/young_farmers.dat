5|$|In 1866, Fred {{encountered}} two <b>young</b> <b>farmers</b> in Connecticut who {{had spent}} time on duty as Union soldiers in Florida during the war. He learned from them that land there was plentiful and cheap, and many recently emancipated blacks were available at low wages to work it. When he shared this information with his mother, Stowe and her husband Calvin Ellis Stowe considered it a prime opportunity to hasten their son's rehabilitation. For $10,000 ($ in 2009) she purchased a cotton plantation near Orange Park, south of Jacksonville, named Laurel Grove, that was originally established by slave trader Zephaniah Kingsley in 1803 and managed in part by his African wife, Anna Madgigine Jai, until 1811.|$|E

5|$|The Trait du Nord is an {{endangered}} breed; the Haras de Compiègne (Compiegne Stud), a national stud in France, {{had a major}} influence in saving the breed, until it was closed in October 2009. The national breed registry for the Trait du Nord is supported by other local initiatives. However, breed numbers were already low when these initiatives began to be implemented, and media attention on the Trait du Nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest. The breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms, but even the number of farms has been decreasing as many <b>young</b> <b>farmers</b> prefer more to breed cattle, which are more lucrative.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the characteristics of adult and <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> educational programs in Iowa. The research procedure was survey, with data collected by means of mailed questionnaire that was sent to selected educators in Iowa. The dependent variables were demographic data and respondents 2 ̆ 7 importance scores for 55 adult and <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> activities. The independent variable was the respondent group with four levels: (1) superintendents, (2) principals, (3) adult farmer instructors, and (4) <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> instructors. Respondents were from schools identified as having high quality adult or <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> educational programs;Major findings of the study were (1) administrators were in almost total agreement with their importance ratings of the 55 program activities. Likewise, instructor groups differed significantly on only one activity. (2) Administrator and instructor groups viewed the vocational agriculture instructor as a coordinator rather than a teacher for all class sessions. (3) Administrator and instructor groups differed significantly in their importance mean scores for having time during the regular school day for adult or <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> preparation and visitation. (4) Administrator and instructor groups indicated that adult and <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> programs should meet the needs of on-farm and off-farm agribusiness males and females. (5) All respondent groups indicated that program enrollees should assist in the planning of adult and <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> class sessions. (6) Activities in the area of teacher preparation were indicated to be very important in the adult and <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> educational program;Findings suggested that additional efforts need to be made to promote adult and <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> educational programs. This promotion needs to be during the teacher preparation program, during inservice activities, and within the local school district;The findings of this study resulted in the development of a model for adult farmer educational programs. Five areas of importance were identified as: (1) teacher preparation, (2) promotion, (3) planning, (4) instruction, and (5) evaluation...|$|R

25|$|To assist <b>young</b> <b>farmers,</b> {{the role}} of the SAFER (Societe d'Amenagemcnt Foncier et d'Etablissement Rural) was {{extended}} in 1982 to give preferential aid to this group to enlarge their holdings. Various measures were also introduced that helped to boost farmers’ incomes. A partial price freeze instituted in June 1982 helped to limit the increase in production costs, while an income assistance programme (introduced in 1982 to compensate for a decline in farmers’ incomes in 1981) contributed to a reduction in sectoral inequalities. In addition, an EEC price hike which the government negotiated in May 1982 represented an improvement over that of the previous year (11.2% compared with 10.3%). Consultative channels between farmers and government were also widened beyond the Federation Nationale des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles (or FNSEA, the chief farming syndicat). In addition, the Mauroy Government had helped in the establishment of 12,000 farms with <b>young</b> <b>farmers</b> by mid-1983.|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, {{seagoing}} pilots became retrospectively insurable, {{and gained}} full social security {{as members of}} the Non-Manual Workers Insurance Institute. That same year, a special regulation came into force for District Master Chimney Sweeps, making them fully insurable under the Craftsman's Insurance Scheme. An increase was made in tax-free allowances for children, which enabled 1,000,000 families to claim an allowance for the second child, compared to 300,000 families previously. The Second Modification and Supplementation Law (1970) increased the allowance for the third child from DM 50 to DM 60, raised the income-limit for the second child allowance from DM 7,800 to DM 13,200; subsequently increased to DM 15,000 by the third modification law (December 1971), DM 16,800 by the fourth modification law (November 1973), and to DM 18,360 by the fifth modification law (December 1973). A flexible retirement age after 62 years was introduced (1972) for invalids and handicapped persons, and social assistance was extended to those who previously had to be helped by their relatives.
