40|$|Mycobacterium avium {{subspecies}} paratuberculosis (MAP) is {{the causal}} agent of Johne’s disease. Most on farm control measurements against {{the spread of}} MAP aim to reduce the transmission between cow and calf. This research focusses on the spreading of MAP between <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> on infected farms. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the proportion of <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> <b>shedding</b> viable MAP bacteria on infected farms and to determine the agreement between the two PCR methods used. 13 known infected farms were included in the research. Fecal samples were taken from the rectum of all <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> before first calving. Bull calves present on the farm were included. 2122 samples were analyzed by qPCR, using primers targeting the MAP specific IS 900 and F 57 sequences in two different runs. 147 (6, 9 %) samples were positive on IS 900 PCR and 31 (1, 5 %) samples were positive on F 57 PCR. 11 samples (0, 5 %) were positive on both target genes. The agreement beyond chance between IS 900 and F 57 was poor (κ= 0. 102) ...|$|R
40|$|Age {{at which}} cattle become faecal culture {{positive}} for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) {{can be used}} as a proxy parameter for age at onset of faecal shedding, which is an important parameter in the control of Map in cattle herds. To investigate the age at becoming faecal culture positive, survival analysis methods were applied. The analyses were carried out on asynchronous interval censored data of faecal culture results of samples collected from 18, 979 female Holstein-Frisian cattle in 353 Dutch herds between 1996 and 2002. The data were analysed with a Weibull proportional hazards model. The results indicate that the distribution of age at onset of faecal shedding in Holstein-Frisian dairy cattle in infected herds is associated with the within-herd prevalence. In higher classes of apparent prevalence, cattle started to shed Map at younger age on average. In herds with an apparent prevalence = 0. 2, the proportion (95 % CI) of cattle with onset of faecal shedding before 2 years of age was estimated at 1 % (0. 5 %; 2 %), 4 % (3 %; 5 %), 8 % (5 %; 10 %) and 20 % (11 %; 32 %), respectively. This study indicates that a considerable proportion of <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> is <b>shedding</b> Map, especially in high prevalence herds. Therefore, infectious <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> should be a major concern in the control of paratuberculosi...|$|R

40|$|<b>Young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing is an {{important}} factor on dairy farms. However, the costs of <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing are often unknown while most costs are contributed to the dairy cows. In addition to that, most farmers have great difficulties in estimating the costs of <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing. Previous research shows that the costs of <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing can be up to € 1540 per successfully bred heifer or 13 % of the cost price of milk (Mohd Nor et al., 2012). In order to calculate the <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing costs on Dutch dairy farms, 43 farms were visited and a calculation of their <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing costs was made using JonKos, a module designed by WUR Livestock Research, DLV and WUR Business economics (WUR Livestock Research et al., 2011). The average costs of <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing on dairy farms according to this research project were € 1559 per successfully reared heifer. <b>Young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing farms had lower average rearing costs than dairy farms (€ 1273 versus € 1606 resp.), although this proved not to be significant (p= 0. 056; B=- 0. 294). The total hours spent on <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing had a significant effect on the total <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing costs per heifer on dairy farms (p= 0, 049; B= 0. 326). In addition, a rise in the average age at first calving did lead to a significant rise the costs of <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing per 100 kg milk (p= 0, 01; B= 0, 426). The farmers that participated in this research project estimated their rearing costs to be € 994 per successfully reared heifer, thereby underestimating the <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing costs by € 312 per heifer. There was no significant relation between the calculated <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing costs on a farm and the estimation by the farmer, which leads {{to the conclusion that the}} farmers that participated in this project were not able to make an educated guess of their <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing costs.

40|$|International audienceMycobacterium avium {{subspecies}} paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johne’s disease, {{a chronic}} progressive enteritis. It is generally assumed that calves rarely shed MAP bacteria and that calf-to-calf transmission is of minor importance. The objectives were 1) {{to estimate the}} prevalence of MAP-shedding <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> in MAP-infected dairy herds, and identify predictors for test-positive young stock; and 2) to estimate proportions of MAP-contaminated <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> group housing pens and air spaces, and furthermore, identify predictors for test-positive pens. Fecal samples were collected from 2606 <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> on 18 MAP-infected dairy farms. Environmental fecal samples were collected from all group-housing pens and dust samples were collected from all barns. All individual samples were analysed using IS 900 and F 57 qPCR; fecal samples positive by either PCR and all environmental and dust samples were cultured. Overall, 8. 1, 1. 2 and 2. 0 % of cattle were positive on IS 900 qPCR, F 57 qPCR and bacterial culture, respectively. <b>Young</b> <b>stock</b> housed on farms with culture-positive environmental samples collected from adult cow housing and manure storage had higher odds of testing IS 900 qPCR-positive than <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> housed on farms with only negative environmental samples.

40|$|Background: As farmers do {{not often}} keep {{a record of}} the {{expenditures}} for rearing, an economic tool that provides insight into the cost of rearing is useful. In the Netherlands, an economic tool (Jonkos) has been developed that can be used by farmers to obtain insight into the cost of rearing on their farm. The first objective {{of this study is to}} calculate the total cost of rearing <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> in Dutch dairy herds using Jonkos. The second objective is to compare the calculated total cost of rearing with the farmers' own estimation of the cost of rearing (the perceived cost). Findings: Information was available for 75 herds that reared their own <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> and who had used the Jonkos tool. The perceived cost of rearing <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> was only available for 36 herds. In the 75 herds, the average herd size was 100 dairy cows. The average calculated total cost of rearing a heifer was € 1, 790. The average perceived total cost of rearing a heifer (including labour and housing costs) was € 1, 030. Conclusion: Most Dutch farmers in the study underestimated the total cost of rearing. The Jonkos economic tool has the advantage that herd-specific information can be entered as input values. The output of the tool can improve the awareness of farmers about the total costs of rearing. This awareness can lead to a higher priority of <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing and consequently to an improved quality of <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} part of a dairy farm is the rearing of <b>young</b> <b>stock.</b> This {{has to be done}} accurately, not only because the new dairy cows will replace the old ones, but also as a lot of money is involved. This has become clear in previous research, which has shown that the successful rearing of one heifer costs € 1. 540. This is 13 % of the cost price of milk. 9 To gain more understanding in <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing costs, 40 farms from the Veterinary Centre Zuid-Oost Drenthe were visited. During this visit, calculations of <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing costs were made with the spreadsheet Jonkos from, among others, WUR Livestock Research. In this study, the average of the <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing costs on the visited farms was € 1. 967 per heifer, with costs ranging from € 919 to € 3. 307. It was also shown that increased scaling is beneficial for costs. An increase in scaling factors researched led to a lower total <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> rearing cost per heifer. An increase in milk production (β=- 0, 337; P= 0, 028), the number of dairy cows (β=- 0, 360; P= 0, 037) or the number of <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> (β=- 0, 435; P= 0. 009) were all significant factors leading to reduction of costs. The age at first calving (AFC) was vice versa: a increase in AFC lead to a significant rise in the rearing costs per heifer (β= 0, 551; P= 0, 001). Comparing the net returns from the heifers with the AFC (P= 0, 109) also showed a remarkable result, namely that there was no significant link between the two. This is surprising, as a lot of farmers claim to experience otherwise. The net returns of the heifers compared with the score of the veterinarian was shown to be almost significant (P= 0, 054), suggesting that a higher level of management skills may lead to an increase in the net returns...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the influence of risk factors related to management on the prevalence of infectious claw disorders (ICD) on 40 dairy herds in the Netherlands. The dairy herds were located 70 kilometers around Deventer (NL) and the average herd size was 76 producing dairy cows. Two professional hoof trimmers collected information about the presence of ICD from 2, 701 lactating dairy cows. Additionally, management risk factors associated with ICD were investigated by students through a survey and observational study. The risk factors could be divided into two groups: risk factors related to introduction ICD into and spread within the herd and risk factors related to standing time. The cow level prevalence of digital dermatitis (DD) was 28. 98 %, the cow level prevalence of interdigital dermatitis (ID) was 13. 74 % and the cow level prevalence of interdigital phlegmon (IP) was 0. 47 %. The herd level prevalence of DD, ID and IP varied from 3 - 61 %, from 0 - 46 %, and from 0 - 3 %, respectively. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to investigate the association between ICD and management related risk factors. In the final model (multivariable analysis), none of the risk factors were associated with ID and IP, but DD was mainly associated with several factors related to introduction into and spread within the herd: rearing <b>young</b> <b>stock,</b> frequency of manure scraper and access to pasture. The risk factor relative number of cubicles was found to be a confounder for the prevalence of DD. Rearing <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> at another farm together with <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> of another herd resulted in a higher prevalence of DD (odds ratio (OR) : 6, 239, 627) compared to rearing <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> at the same farm and in the same stable as the producing dairy herd. Rearing <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> at another stable (OR: 0) or at another farm (OR: 0. 11) was negatively associated with the prevalence of DD. Zero grazing was associated with a higher prevalence of DD compared to limited grazing (OR: 132, 257). Unlimited grazing also resulted in a higher prevalence of DD, compared to dairy herds with limited grazing (OR: 548). A frequency of floor scraping of > twice a day showed a higher prevalence of DD compared to ≤ twice a day (OR: 72, 983) ...|$|R

Daily data about milk intake, milk feeder visits, water intake and body weight were used to build detection models that generate alerts when measured values deviate and indicate a possible health problem. Body weight measurements were also used to determine the growth rate of a calf and to produce an alert if this deviated too much from a desired growth rate. All alerts were translated into messages with work instructions for the farmer. Weekly feedback from the farmer indicated that almost 60 % of the messages were correct.
