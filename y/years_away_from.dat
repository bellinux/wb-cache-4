5|$|GJ 3634 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.95. Thus, despite its proximity at 19.8 parsecs (64.6 light <b>years)</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Earth, it cannot {{be seen with}} the unaided eye. The star is of a similar distance from Earth as planet-bearing 51 Pegasi, which lies {{at a distance of}} 14.7 parsecs (47.95 light years).|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 {{is located}} 65.8 parsecs (214.6 light <b>years)</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Earth. It has an {{apparent}} magnitude (V) of 8.22, making the star too dim {{to see from}} Earth with the naked eye. The star is slightly dimmer than planet Neptune as perceived with the naked eye, which has an apparent magnitude of 7.78 at its brightest. The star's actual brightness is measured with an absolute magnitude of 4.12, {{similar to that of}} the Sun.|$|E
5|$|HD 2039 is {{a yellow}} dwarf or yellow subgiant {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Phoenix.

HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an exoplanet at least three times the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet to be discovered.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-40 {{hosts the}} sixth {{planetary}} {{system to be}} discovered in the orbit of a star with a mass of over 1.8 solar masses. It lies 2700 parsecs (8806.4 light <b>years)</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Earth, making it more distant than any previously verified planet discovered by Kepler, and has an apparent magnitude of 14.58. Thus, it is invisible to the unaided eye.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40 lies 2700 parsecs (8,806.4 light <b>years)</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Earth, {{further than}} any star (with a known distance) with an {{exoplanet}} previously discovered by Kepler. With an apparent magnitude of 14.58, {{it was also}} dimmer than any star previously recognized by Kepler. Because of its low apparent magnitude, Kepler-40 cannot be seen with the naked eye.|$|E

5|$|After the 1990–91 Gulf War, UNSCOM {{determined}} that Iraq had been pursuing a calutron program to enrich uranium. Iraq chose {{to develop the}} electromagnetic process over more modern, economic, and efficient methods of enrichment because calutrons were easier to build, with fewer technical challenges, and the components required to build them were not subject to export controls. At the time the program was discovered, Iraq {{was estimated to be}} two or three <b>years</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> producing enough material for nuclear weapons. The program was destroyed in the Gulf War. Consequently, the Nuclear Suppliers Group added the electromagnetic separation equipment to its guidelines for transfers of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, material and technology.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Orr turned 16 in 1964, {{he was still}} two <b>years</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> playing in the NHL and his father Doug was {{dissatisfied}} with the Bruins' treatment of the prospect. Doug had asked the Bruins' Blair for more money for Bobby and was turned down. Doug Orr met Toronto lawyer Alan Eagleson at a juvenile fastball tournament dinner in Parry Sound and asked Eagleson to help out with the situation. Eagleson agreed {{to work with the}} family for free and continued to do so for the next two years. Bobby and Eagleson developed a relationship Orr would later describe as being like brothers. The two soon became a team, discussing Bobby's future plans without his father Doug.|$|E

5|$|Even though peasant {{households}} {{were significantly}} smaller than aristocratic ones, the wealthiest of these would also employ servants. Service {{was a natural}} part of the cycle of life, and it was common for young people to spend some <b>years</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home in the service of another household. This way they would learn the skills needed later in life, {{and at the same time}} earn a wage. This was particularly useful for girls, who could put the earnings towards their dowry.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b is {{a planet}} in the orbit of HAT-P-33, which lies 1,367 light <b>years</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Earth. Its {{discovery}} was reported in June 2011, although it was suspected to be a planet as early as 2004. The planet is about three-fourths the mass of Jupiter, but is almost eighty percent larger than Jupiter is; this inflation has, as {{with the discovery of}} similar planets WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b, raised the question of what (other than temperature) causes these planets to become so large.|$|E
5|$|The {{sources of}} most GRBs are billions of light <b>years</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Earth, {{implying}} that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy {{in a few seconds}} as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime) and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years). All observed GRBs have originated from outside the Milky Way galaxy, although a related class of phenomena, soft gamma repeater flares, are associated with magnetars within the Milky Way. It has been hypothesized that a gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way, pointing directly towards the Earth, could cause a mass extinction event.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 3634 is a M-class dwarf star, {{meaning that}} it is small, emits reddish light, and has a {{relatively}} low temperature for a star. The star is 0.45 times the mass of and 0.43 times the radius of the Sun. Gliese 3634 is 0.020 times as luminous as the Sun, {{meaning that it}} radiates about 2% {{of the amount of}} energy that the Sun does. It was described as an intermediately active star in its discovery paper. Gliese 3634 lies 19.8 parsecs (approximately 64.6 light <b>years)</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Earth, a relatively close star. Gliese 3634 b is the only planet to have been confirmed in the star's orbit, although initial analysis of the data suggests that a secondary body of an unknown nature also exists, with an orbit of more than 200 days and a mass approximately twice that of Neptune's.|$|E
5|$|In AD 26, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is {{a wealthy}} prince and {{merchant}} in Jerusalem, {{who lives with}} his mother, Miriam (Martha Scott); his sister, Tirzah (Cathy O'Donnell); their loyal slave, Simonides (Sam Jaffe); and Simonides' daughter, Esther (Haya Harareet). Esther loves Judah, but is committed to another. Judah's childhood friend, the Roman citizen Messala (Stephen Boyd), is now a tribune. After several <b>years</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Jerusalem, Messala returns as the new commander of the Roman garrison. Messala believes in the glory of Rome and its imperial power, while Judah is devoted to his faith and {{the freedom of the}} Jewish people. This difference causes tension between the friends, and results in their split after Messala issues an ultimatum demanding that Judah delivers potential rebels amongst the populace to the Roman authorities.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{near the}} constellation's {{northern}} border with Telescopium is Alpha Pavonis, {{the brightest star}} in Pavo. Its proper name — Peacock — is an English translation of the constellation's name. It was assigned by the British Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office in the late 1930s; the Royal Air Force insisted that all bright stars must have names, the star hitherto having lacked a proper name. Alpha has an apparent (or visual) magnitude of 1.91 and spectral type B2IV. It is a spectroscopic binary system, one estimate placing the distance between the pair of stars as 0.21 astronomical units (AU), or half the distance between Mercury and the Sun. The two stars rotate around each other in a mere 11 days and 18 hours. The star system is located around 180 light <b>years</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Earth.|$|E
