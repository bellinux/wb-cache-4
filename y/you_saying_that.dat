2500|$|When the {{president}} says that Senator Kerry is emboldening enemies {{and you say that}} we could get hit again if voters make the wrong choice in November, are <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> it would be a dangerous thing to have John Kerry as president? ...|$|E
2500|$|My {{response}} {{is that when}} Creationists talk about God creating every individual species as a separate act, they always instance hummingbirds, or orchids, sunflowers and beautiful things. But I tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through {{the eye of a}} boy sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, [...] that's going to make him blind. And , 'Are you telling me that the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, are <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child's eyeball? Because that doesn't seem to me to coincide with a God who's full of mercy'.|$|E
2500|$|The fifth Republican {{debate was}} held at Florida State Fair Grounds in Tampa, Florida, {{sponsored}} by CNN and Tea Party Express. It was moderated by Wolf Blitzer, and was notable for being the first Tea Party debate in history. Rick Perry was booed by the audience for defending his use of an executive order to mandate young girls have the HPV vaccine, which he defended by saying, [...] "I will always {{err on the side}} of life". The debate also engendered controversy when Blitzer asked Ron Paul a hypothetical question about a young man who could afford health insurance but refused to purchase any and went into a coma. When Blitzer asked Paul [...] "Congressman, are <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> society should just let him die?", a few audience members shouted [...] "Yeah!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Corrigan's [...] "error" [...] {{caught the}} {{imagination}} of the depressed American public and inspired many jokes. The nickname [...] "'Wrong Way' Corrigan" [...] passed into common use (sometimes confused with the memory of 1929's [...] "Wrong Way" [...] Riegels football incident) and is still mentioned (or used as satire) when someone has the reputation for taking the wrong direction. For example: Corrigan was directly referenced in the 1938 Three Stooges short Flat Foot Stooges. Curly states, [...] "Hey, we're doing a Corrigan!" [...] after realizing they are heading in the wrong direction to get to the fire they need to extinguish. A character named [...] "Wrong Way Feldman" [...] was portrayed by Hans Conreid in two episodes of Gilligan's Island in the 1960s. Also, in the short 'Birds on a Wire', part of the last episode (1998) of Animaniacs, Pesto the Goodfeather pigeon expresses outrage by exclaiming [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> I don't know my directions? That I'm some sort of 'Wrong Way' Corrigan?" [...] when he is pointed out {{the fact that he is}} confusing north with west.|$|E
2500|$|Giving {{the release}} a 3½ star rating, Matt Bjorke of Roughstock, saying [...] "All The Woman I Am had the {{potential}} to be a missed-opportunity after the first two tracks on the record but the album is saved by a meaty collection of songs that hopefully will find Reba retaining her current resurgence at radio". Allison Stewart with the Washington Post compared the album to its predecessor, Keep On Loving <b>You,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the album [...] "tries harder, with worse results; McEntire and her collaborators aim for Carrie Underwood and too often wind up with warmed-over Shania Twain". On a positive note, she called her version of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] "fantastic". Thom Jurek with Allmusic gave the release a 2½ rating, saying [...] "Everything, from songs and arrangements to production tries hard to sound on the contemporary edge, but comes off as underscoring that Underwood has the corner on this sound [...] ultimately, All the Women I Am falls flat; it feels awkward in its stylistic mimicry, and has no center".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Michael, airily. [...] "It is {{a parable}}. It is a parable {{of you and}} all your rationalists. You begin by {{breaking}} up the Cross; but you end by breaking up the habitable world. We leave <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> nobody ought to join the Church against his will. When we meet you again {{you are saying that}} no one has any will to join it with. We leave <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> there is no such place as Eden.

60|$|Or will <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a navy {{officer is}} a man, but that an American-born citizen, whose {{grandsire}} may have ennobled him by pouring out his blood at Bunker Hill--will <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> by entering {{the service of}} his country as a common seaman, and standing ready to fight her foes, he thereby loses his manhood {{at the very time}} he most asserts it? Will <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> by so doing, he degrades himself to the liability of the scourge, but if he tarries ashore in time of danger, he is safe from that indignity?

"By the way, nobody {{thinks there}} will be much fighting, so don't let my mother worry herself about me; but, at any rate, a march through the great forests of this country, with a chance of a brush with the redskins, will be great fun.
