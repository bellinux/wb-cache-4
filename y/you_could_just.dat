[...] Sondheim {{acknowledged}} that, in adapting a musical to film, the plot {{has to be kept}} moving, and was sent MP3 files of his shortened songs by Mike Higham, the film's music producer, for approval. Several other songs were also cut, and Sondheim noted that there were [...] "many changes, additions and deletions..... if you just go along with it, I think you'll have a spectacular time." [...] To create a larger, more cinematic feel, the score was re-orchestrated by the stage musical's original orchestrator, Jonathan Tunick, who increased the orchestra from 27 musicians to 78.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} features {{introduced to}} the game received a mixed response. IGN noted that the Special Games varied in quality between different games, with Casamassina commenting that [...] "they certainly don't make or break the experience." [...] The game's [...] "Power Shots" [...] was also met with an ambivalent reaction—the shot themselves were praised for adding strategy and character, although GameSpot's Ryan Davis commented that [...] "it {{would have been nice}} if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> skip past the animations and keep the wild moves." [...] In general, the game's multiplayer modes were more popular than single-player, with the [...] "predictable and basic" [...] artificial intelligence contributing to a low difficulty level at times. GameSpy noted how the number of options and variables enhanced the multiplayer experience, and commented that [...] "The game is very good on its own, but it excels when you bring friends into the mix." [...] The mechanics of the tennis gameplay were also popular, with reviewers lauding the game's accessibility as well as its depth relating to the variety of shots available and how the position of the character affects the contact with the ball.|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album were written by A.C. Newman and Destroyer {{frontman}} Dan Bejar. Newman recalled that he thought [...] "'How could we lose?' <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> take some interesting elements and put them together. Even taking myself out of the picture, when I looked at the band I just thought, 'This band's got to be great.' I thought, 'Okay, everyone can hate my songs, they can dismiss them.' But I have the most confidence in Dan's songs because I'm totally outside of him, looking in. I'm just a fan of him." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} of The Album Network, Jared Leto {{explained that the}} song is [...] "less about reinventing yourself and more about finding out who you really are, your true self. That's a pretty important thing. That feeling of if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> go back, knowing what you know now." [...] Leto said: [...] "In a general sense, it is about a desire for renewal. But I'd rather let people take their own understanding and meaning from the song.

[...] The book inspired Australian entrepreneurs to create a real estate company and name their venture after {{the title of the}} work. Casey Bond wrote for GOBankingRates, [...] "Theoretically, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> read the list {{at the end of every}} chapter and get the gist of the book, but I find the value of Midas Touch to be in the storytelling of real-life experiences." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the film, Emin {{describes}} leaving {{school at}} age 13 and spending her time on Margate's Golden Mile, dreaming and having sex.

But it wasn’t always like that; sometimes they’d just cum, and then they’d leave me there, wherever I was, half naked.” In the final scenes, the artist performs at a local dance competition and people begin to clap.

2500|$|After {{the conference}} Chauvel ordered the Australian Mounted Division to {{ride back to}} Karm in the {{afternoon}} to ease the water at Beersheba. The division's horses had had their last proper drink at Khalasa on 30 October, as the water supply at Asluj and Beersheba had been restricted. As all the tents had been pulled down the previous day {{in preparation for a}} move, the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance did dressings outside during the morning.

Squire recalled the album's period as not a happy one, and deemed the album [...] "a difficult one". He commented on Anderson's attitude then: [...] "Jon had this visionary idea that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> walk into a studio, and if the vibes were right ... the music would be great {{at the end of}} the day ... It isn't reality". Wakeman continues to hold a critical view. In 2006, he clarified that his total dislike of the album is [...] "not entirely true" [...] and thinks there are some [...] "very nice musical moments in Topographic Oceans, but because of the format of how records used to be we had too much for a single album but not enough for a double, so we padded it out and the padding is awful ... but there are some beautiful solos like [...] "Nous sommes du soleil" ... one of the most beautiful melodies ... and deserved to be developed even more perhaps." ...|$|E
