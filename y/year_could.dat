5|$|Grant was now {{riding a}} rising tide of popularity, and there was talk that a Union victory early in the <b>year</b> <b>could</b> lead to his {{candidacy}} for the presidency. He was aware of the rumors, but had ruled out a political candidacy; the possibility would soon vanish with delays on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Iceland is {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to create an economy {{generated}} through industries fueled by renewable energy, and there is still a large amount of untapped hydroelectric energy in Iceland. In 2002 it was estimated that Iceland only generated 17% of the total harnessable hydroelectric energy in the country. Iceland’s government believes another 30 TWh of hydropower every <b>year</b> <b>could</b> be produced, whilst taking into account the sources that must remain untapped for environmental reasons.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interests}} of keeping the strip exciting, it seemed that no season for Melchester Rovers could ever consist of mid-table obscurity. Almost every year, the club was either competing for the major honours {{at the top of}} the domestic and European game, or struggling against relegation to lower divisions. Often, such spells of good and bad fortune and form would directly succeed one another—a Rovers team that won the European Cup one <b>year</b> <b>could</b> find itself struggling to stay in Division One the next.|$|E
50|$|At {{common law}} a boy {{under the age}} of {{fourteen}} <b>years</b> <b>could</b> not commit rape as a principal offender as he was irrebutably presumed to be incapable of sexual intercourse. This rule was abolished by section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1993. A boy {{under the age of}} fourteen <b>years</b> <b>could</b> commit rape as an accomplice.|$|R

5|$|Several factors {{affect the}} cost to move a bulk cargo by ship. The bulk freight market is very volatile, and it fluctuates, along {{with the type of}} cargo, the ship's size, and the route {{traveled}} all affect the final price. Moving a capesize load of coal from South America to Europe cost anywhere from $15 to $25 per ton in 2005. Hauling a panamax-sized load of aggregate materials from the Gulf of Mexico to Japan that <b>year</b> <b>could</b> cost as little as $40 per ton to as much as $70 per ton.|$|E
5|$|According to the thirteenth-century Historia Gruffud vab Kenan, {{the mother}} of Cynan's son was Ragnailt ingen Amlaíb, a {{paternal}} granddaughter of Sitriuc. Further revealed by this source {{is the fact that}} this woman's father, Amlaíb mac Sitriuc, built and commanded a Welsh fortress called Castell Avloed. Although it is unknown how long the Dubliners possessed the fortress, in 1036 another son of Sitriuc was slain in Wales by an apparent kinsman, an event which could be evidence of a struggle for control of the site. Echmarcach's aforesaid expulsion of Sitriuc from Dublin in the same <b>year</b> <b>could</b> in turn indicate that this exiled monarch sought refuge in Wales.|$|E

25|$|Maitland was {{responsible}} for the settlement reached for Pictou Academy. In dealing with immigration and settlement, he had lands laid out in Cape Breton at crown expense so that the 4,000 immigrants expected that <b>year</b> <b>could</b> be legally placed and systematically settled.|$|E
25|$|Newfield is a non-operating school district. In June 2009, the New Jersey Department of Education {{ruled that}} Newfield could end its {{relationship}} with the Buena Regional School District and as of the 2011-12 school <b>year</b> <b>could</b> start sending incoming high school students in grades 7-9 to Delsea Regional High School.|$|E

A more powerful Ku-band transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, Canal France International, accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.|$|E
25|$|Five ARJ21s will {{be handed}} over in 2017 while in September two have entered service since its first {{delivery}} in November 2015 but production should reach 15 in 2018, then 20 in 2019 and 25 in 2020; the full rate of 30-50 aircraft a <b>year</b> <b>could</b> be reached with a second, 30 per year production line being set up at Shanghai Pudong International Airport.|$|E
25|$|Anti-nuclear {{activists are}} accused of {{encouraging}} radiophobic emotions among the public. The War Against the Atom (Basic Books, 1982) Samuel MacCracken of Boston University argued that in 1982, 50,000 deaths per <b>year</b> <b>could</b> be attributed directly to non-nuclear power plants, if fuel production and transportation, as well as pollution, were taken into account. He argued that if non-nuclear plants were judged by the same standards as nuclear ones, each US non-nuclear power plant could {{be held responsible for}} about 100 deaths per year.|$|E

25|$|Merezhkovsky's major {{literary}} debut {{came with}} the publication of Poems (1883–1888). It brought the author into the focus of the most favourable critical attention, but – even coupled with Protopop Avvacum, a poetry epic released the same <b>year,</b> <b>could</b> not solve young family's financial problems. Helpfully, Gippius unexpectedly reinvented herself as a prolific fiction writer, starting to churn out novels and novelettes she couldn't later even remember the titles of. Sergey Merezhkovsky's occasional hand-outs also helped the husband and wife to keep their meagre budget afloat.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Green Party {{candidate}} for the London mayoral election, Siân Berry, proposed the closure and redevelopment of London City airport, citing a number of reasons, including relatively low profit from such {{a large amount of}} land, high demand for housing in Greater London and the high levels of pollution generated. Berry also argued that despite more air capacity being needed in the South East of England, the relatively low 4 million passengers that use London City Airport every <b>year</b> <b>could</b> be absorbed by other airports which are currently under capacity.|$|E
25|$|Global warming {{could lead}} to an {{increase}} in pest insect populations, harming yields of staple crops like wheat, soybeans, and corn. While warmer temperatures create longer growing seasons, and faster growth rates for plants, it also increases the metabolic rate and number of breeding cycles of insect populations. Insects that previously had only two breeding cycles per <b>year</b> <b>could</b> gain an additional cycle if warm growing seasons extend, causing a population boom. Temperate places and higher latitudes are more likely to experience a dramatic change in insect populations.|$|E

25|$|In May 2010, Dornier Seaplane {{announced}} that it would build the Seastar in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, about half an hour away from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The site was picked due to the strength of the local supply chain and presence of skilled aerospace workers, as well as its proximity to Lake Champlain for flight operations. At this point, the company aimed to deliver their first production aircraft in 2012; production was projected to rise from a single aircraft in 2012, to six in 2013 and to 12 in 2014; dependent on demand, as many as 50 Seastars per <b>year</b> <b>could</b> eventually be built.|$|E
25|$|In New York, {{the first}} case to adopt Wood's rule was Martin v New York Life Ins Co in 1895. Bartlett J {{asserted}} that New York law now followed Wood's treatise, which meant that an employee who received $10,000, paid in a salary over a <b>year,</b> <b>could</b> be dismissed immediately. The case did not make reference to the previous authority. Four years earlier, in 1891, Adams v Fitzpatrick had held that New York law followed the general practice of requiring notice similar to pay periods. However, subsequent New York cases continued to follow the at-will rule into the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{large and}} quickly-generated funds voted by Parliament and {{guaranteed}} {{over a five-year}} period offered immediate economic incentives as well. Previous shipbuilding efforts had been halted due to an insufficient annual allowance. Without the funds to complete the warships, production took longer and cost more. By financing the expansion {{over a five-year period}}, residual balances from one <b>year</b> <b>could</b> be transferred over to the next, allowing production to continue uninterrupted, at greatly reduced costs. That also aimed for the British completion of her warships more quickly than its rival powers. In theory, the scope and the speed of production would not only cut costs but also deter other powers from hoping to match British production.|$|E
