25|$|In general, the Many-minds theory {{holds that}} a {{conscious}} being who observes {{the outcome of}} a random zero-sum experiment will evolve into two successors in different observer states, each of whom observes one of the possible outcomes. Moreover, the theory advises you to favour choices in such situations in proportion to the probability that they will bring good results to your various successors. But in a life-or-death case like getting into the box with Schrödinger's cat, you will only have one successor, since one of the outcomes will ensure your death. So it seems that the Many-minds Interpretation advises you to get in the box with the cat, since it is certain that <b>your</b> <b>only</b> successor will emerge unharmed.

Stewart argues that Americans are living in an [...] "age of {{information}} osmosis" [...] in which it is close to impossible to gain one's news from any single source, and says that his show succeeds comedically because the viewers already have some knowledge about current events. [...] "Our show would not be valuable to people who didn't understand the news because it wouldn't make sense," [...] he argues. [...] "We make assumptions about your level of knowledge that... if we were <b>your</b> <b>only</b> source of news, you would just watch our show and think, 'I don't know what's happening.'" ...|$|E

On hearing of his {{nomination}} as vice president, he announced that he was not surprised, as [...] "Indiana is the mother of Vice Presidents; home of more second-class men than any other state". One of his favorite jokes, which he delivered in a speech {{on the eve of his}} departure for Washington D.C. to become vice president, recounted a story of a man with two sons.

500|$|Lucie Delarue-Mardrus wrote love poems to Barney in {{the early}} years of the century, and in 1930 {{depicted}} her in a novel, L'Ange et les Pervers (The Angel and the Perverts), in which she said she [...] "analyzed and described Natalie at length as well as the life into which she initiated me". [...] The protagonist of the novel is a hermaphrodite named Marion who lives a double life, frequenting literary salons in female dress, then changing from skirt to trousers to attend gay soirées. Barney is Laurette Wells, a salon hostess who spends much of the novel trying to win back an ex-lover loosely based on Renée Vivien. The book's portrayal of her is, at times, harshly critical, but she is the only person whose company Marion enjoys. [...] Marion tells Wells that she is [...] "perverse... dissolute, self-centered, unfair, stubborn, sometimes miserly... a genuine rebel, ever ready to incite others to rebellion.... ou are capable of loving someone just as they are, even a thief—in that lies <b>your</b> <b>only</b> fidelity. [...] And so you have my respect." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Applebaum. The video was first shown on Disney Channel on August 25, 2006, following the premiere of The Cheetah Girls 2. Hudgens walks onto the set of a music video, applies her makeup and changes her shoes. She then performs while dancing against a brightly lit backdrop. Next, she is shown performing and dancing in a black room with numerous chandeliers flickering on and off. She later appears on a red stage with circles flickering in various colors. Afterwards, more shots of the black room is shown, including one in which she is swinging on a chandelier. In the last scene, she sings and dances {{in front of a}} colorful background. Black-and-white shots of her and her friends are interspersed throughout the video, and Hudgens' friend, actress Alexa Nikolas, makes an appearance. The Arizona Republic writer Bill Goodykoontz wrote that Hudgens shows a somewhat mature side in the video: [...] "hen <b>your</b> <b>only</b> context for ever having seen Hudgens is starring as Gabriella, the sweet little brainiac in High School Musical, it's certainly different to see her flouncing around in spaghetti-strap tops, rolling her shoulders and whatnot." [...] A director's cut version of the video appears on the physical release of the single.|$|E

500|$|Following {{its home}} video release, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict praised the episode's premise, writing that it [...] "brim with potential" [...] {{even though it}} is [...] "fairly simple". She also praised the episode's setpiece, which she described as [...] "particularly good", even though she found it to be [...] "super-random". She gave the episode an A- rating and added that it has [...] "lots of great gags". Writing for WhatCulture!, Adam Rayner described [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] as [...] "utterly hilarious" [...] and [...] "superbly executed".

[...] He continued that it can be compared to the series' best episodes, writing that it [...] "resemble The Simpsons in its glory years". Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com considers it {{to be one of the}} season's best episodes, and so did High-Def Digest's Aaron Peck, who described it as one of his personal favorites. James Plath, a reviewer for DVD Town, wrote that the episode is a [...] "classic". On the other hand, giving the episode a mixed review, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] "falls into the abyss as a distinctly ordinary episode." [...] He continued, [...] "Like many other S13 shows, this one feels recycled, as it lacks much to make it stand out as creative or memorable."
