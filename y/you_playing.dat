5|$|In 2006 Shearer {{appeared}} with Brian Hayes in four episodes of the BBC Radio 4 sitcom Not Today, Thank <b>You,</b> <b>playing</b> Nostrils, {{a man so}} ugly he cannot stand {{to be in his}} own presence. He was originally scheduled to appear in all six episodes but had to withdraw from recording two due to a problem with his work permit. On June 19, 2008, it was announced that Shearer would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the radio category. The date of the ceremony where his star will be put in place has yet to be announced.|$|E
500|$|Super Mario Strikers {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, with reviewers lauding the game's characterisation and visual style, being reminiscent {{to that of}} Kazuto Nakazawa. GameSpot's Brian Ekberg praised the game's accessibility, stating that [...] "Strikers' pick-up-and-play design will have <b>you</b> <b>playing</b> like a cartoon Pele in no time". Similarly, critics welcomed the developers' choice to forgo traditional football rules in the favour of a more arcade-like style of gameplay. Despite this, IGN complained of a [...] "disappointingly slim" [...] variety of modes, {{as well as the}} perceived small roster of characters and inflexibility when choosing teams. On a similar note, Eurogamer criticised the vague presentation of characters attributes, making it difficult to determine what their respective strengths and weaknesses are. Despite enjoying the variety and appearance of Strikers stadia, GameSpot noted only cosmetic differences among them, and criticised a lack of physical features to make them more interesting.|$|E
500|$|GameFans Levi Buchanan praised Destruction Derby 64 as [...] "the best racer for the Nintendo 64 this year", and he lauded its [...] "simplistic control" [...] as {{a remedy}} for the complex {{controls}} that he believed had [...] "ruined the PlayStation versions". He liked its graphics but wrote that its music [...] "isn’t too hot". Buchanan enjoyed its multiplayer component and wrote that [...] "the slowdown when all four join in is minima—nice programming {{on the part of}} Looking Glass". Although he complained that the game's vehicle damage is not [...] "segmented throughout your car", he concluded by calling the game [...] "pure, unadulterated fun [...] has enough tracks and hidden vehicles to keep <b>you</b> <b>playing</b> for a very long time". Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote, [...] "Graphically, Destruction Derby 64 surpasses the old PlayStation games by quite a bit - not that that is a particularly hard thing to do". He found that its framerate was adequate even in split-screen mode, and concluded that it was [...] "a better game than its PlayStation counterparts". He finished, [...] "Give it a rent next time you're rounding up the posse for a day of gaming." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eurogamer's Ronan Jennings {{also scored}} the game 9 out of 10, writing [...] "it {{deserves credit for}} making us focus on {{actually}} doing things. Its qualities aren't designed to bring quick gasps from casual gamers - {{they are designed to}} keep people like <b>you</b> <b>playing</b> for hours on end. Add great graphics, decent music and quality voice acting to the mix and there's not much to say against it." ...|$|E
2500|$|VideoGamer gave it 6 out of 10, saying [...] "The Run {{certainly}} isn't terrible, {{and a big}} {{improvement on}} Black Box's previous effort, Undercover, but it needed more moments like the avalanche and less monotonous freeways. With the campaign over in an afternoon {{and the rest of}} the package failing to offer anything to keep <b>you</b> <b>playing,</b> The Run is some decent throwaway fun that will be forgotten as soon as you move on to something else." ...|$|E

2500|$|Subsequent [...] to {{his alleged}} killing of leader Billy Hanna outside {{his home in}} Lurgan {{in the early hours}} of 27 July 1975, Jackson assumed command of the Mid-Ulster Brigade. Hanna and his wife Ann had just {{returned}} from a function at the local British Legion Club. When he stepped out of the car, two men approached him. After asking them [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>playing</b> at?" [...] one of them produced a pistol, walked over and shot him twice in the head; once in the temple and afterwards in the back of the head, execution style as he lay on the ground. His wife witnessed the killing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability to}} create custom minigolf courses was widely praised among reviewers. [...] GameSpot's Justin Calvert felt that the course {{creation}} tools were {{easy to use and}} stated the game [...] "has the potential to keep <b>you</b> <b>playing</b> for weeks and months as more player-created and downloadable content is added." [...] The reviewer from Game Revolution noted that he preferred looking for difficult courses created by players in order to maintain a challenge. [...] He stated players will [...] "have access to literally thousands of different holes to shoot in hundreds of custom courses." [...] The multiplayer component also received generally positive remarks. [...] "Multiplayer modes, community features, and the course editor give you plenty to do" [...] stated IGN's Daemon Hatfield. [...] Justin Calvert of GameSpot also praised the game's ability to upload replays to YouTube.|$|E
2500|$|Hanna {{was shot}} dead after driving home to Lurgan from a {{function}} at the British Legion Club in Lurgan {{in the early hours}} of 27 July 1975. According to Martin Dillon, two men approached him as he got out of his car. Hanna reportedly asked them, [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>playing</b> at?", and one of the men produced a pistol, placed it to his temple and shot him. The gunman then fired a second shot into the back of Hanna's head as he lay on the ground. A neighbour who was also in the car was shot in the head and seriously injured. His wife, Ann witnessed the killing; however she was too distressed at the time to identify the killer. Dillon claims that prior to his death Hanna had been under surveillance by the RUC Special Branch.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's William Cassidy {{scored the}} Game Boy Advance version 4.5 out of 5, praising the graphics, sound, combat {{system and the}} {{differentiation}} between the controllable characters. His only complaint was that [...] "the amount of sometimes pointless wandering." [...] He called the game [...] "an engaging, action-packed adventure that admirably re-creates the captivating atmosphere of the films. The characters, the locales, and even the music draw you in and create an exciting experience that will have <b>you</b> <b>playing</b> through the entire quest several times." [...] IGN's Craig Harris scored it 8 out of 10, comparing it to Diablo and Gaunlet, and praising the co-op mode. He concluded [...] "even though The Two Towers is far from [...] "boring," [...] it does get a little repetitive in its hack-and-slash design." [...] GameSpot's Frank Provo scored it 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "it's mainly a Diablo or Gaunlet clone with story elements from the movie sprinkled throughout. With that in mind, it's surprisingly fun to roam throughout the lands of Middle-earth, slaying orcs and goblins." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "This Little Light" [...] {{is based}} around [...] "This Little Light of Mine", a gospel song written by American {{composer}} Harry Loes {{in the early}} 20th century. It first appeared on LZ7's EP Gasoline, which was released in the UK in August 2008. It was then remixed in 2010 for inclusion as track one on the band's second studio album, Light, and {{was used as a}} theme song for both The Message Trust's charitable initiative Shine Your Light and the UK government's Shine Week 2010. LZ7 launched the 2010 remix at a gig at the Manchester Apollo, before promoting the track at summer festivals and an eight-date schools tour around Manchester. The band encouraged people to make a note of the release date and to download the single, with Lindz West, LZ7's frontman, remarking: [...] "What we don't want is anyone phoning up stations and saying 'Why aren't <b>you</b> <b>playing</b> this song?', because that just creates a bad name for us in the first place. What we do want is people buying it and getting it to the position where it has to go on the radio airplay lists and the stations have to play it." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Juan Castro {{scored the}} game 8.5 out of 10. He too praised the graphics, writing [...] "EA did a {{magnificent}} job {{of bringing the}} grandeur of Middle-earth into The Third Age." [...] However, he was critical of the difficulty, claiming [...] "from the moment they brandish a weapon in-game, RPG veterans will most likely tell that EA {{went to great lengths}} to make The Third Age as accessible as possible." [...] He also criticized the story, writing [...] "gamers will be hard pressed to find an ounce of character development throughout the entire adventure," [...] and calling the characters [...] "soulless archetypes." [...] However, he concluded [...] "For the most part, The Third Age rips gamers from their living rooms and dumps them in a detailed rendition of Middle-earth. EA Redwood Shores has faithfully recreated everything from the glowing majesty of Rivendell to the murky depths of Helm's Deep. Suffice to say, this is one of the best looking games based on Tolkien's classic trilogy. But, as gamers everywhere know, looks aren't everything. It's one thing to have video games look as good as the movies they're based on, but what good is any of it if the actual gameplay isn't enough to keep <b>you</b> <b>playing.</b> Thankfully, this combat heavy RPG delivers the goods, although some die hard RPG fans may be put off by its overly streamlined approach." ...|$|E
