500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} intended for a rock opera Townshend {{had been working}} on, Lifehouse, which was a multi-media exercise based on his followings of the Indian religious avatar Meher Baba, showing how spiritual enlightenment could be obtained via a combination of band and audience. The song was written {{for the end of}} the opera, after the main character, Bobby, is killed and the [...] "universal chord" [...] is sounded. The main characters disappear, leaving behind the government and army, who are left to bully each other. Townshend described the song as one [...] "that screams defiance at those who feel any cause is better than no cause". He later said that the song was not strictly anti-revolution despite the lyric [...] "We'll be fighting in the streets", but stressed that revolution could be unpredictable, adding, [...] "Don't expect to see what <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Expect nothing and you might gain everything." [...] Bassist John Entwistle later said that the song showed Townshend [...] "saying things that really mattered to him, and saying them for the first time." ...|$|E

6000|$|Wordsworth and his {{exquisite}} sister {{are with}} me. She {{is a woman}} indeed! in mind I mean, and heart; for her person is such, that if <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a pretty woman, you would think her rather ordinary; if <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an ordinary woman, you would think her pretty! but her manners are simple, ardent, impressive.

60|$|The fair apparition, thus adjured, obeyed; and, looking up, {{revealed}} {{just such}} eyes as <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> beneath such lids--eyes deep, pathetic, and rich as {{a strain of}} sad music.|$|R
6000|$|She {{bent forward}} {{out of her}} corner, and {{suddenly}} drew up her veil. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Mr. Alban Morris, when we get back?" [...] she asked.|$|E

6000|$|... "On {{what point}} do you wish my advice?" [...] said Mrs. Wilson, kindly, after she had {{finished}} reading the letter, [...] "and when do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> your uncle?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "To {{judge by}} {{the way you were}} walking," [...] I replied, [...] "one would imagine the Strand the last place in which <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any human being. Do you ever walk into a short-tempered, muscular man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Keith {{glanced at}} Millicent. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I think so, {{and she is}} really a very nice girl." [...] Then her eyes twinkled with dry amusement. [...] "I'm not sure that <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{should never}} have done that, Ralph," [...] cried his sister. [...] "There might have been snakes in that place, or precipices, or nobody knows what. What could <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in the dark?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Crescit amor diamonds!" [...] {{said the}} parson. [...] "I can easily {{understand}} that. And then, when a fellow goes back again, {{he is so}} apt to lose it all. Don't <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> your diamonds turn into slate-stones?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, I don't {{believe you}} would. That restless little {{conscience}} of yours {{would be up}} on end. After all, I don't {{know that you are}} the worse for it, when it looks so prettily out of your brown eyes.

6000|$|... "Oh! {{it is very}} grand," [...] said Lady Marney; [...] "but {{like all}} places in the {{manufacturing}} districts, very disagreeable. You never have a clear sky.

60|$|That {{is what a}} lot {{of people}} say about Blacky the Crow. Of course it is true that Blacky does get into a lot of mischief, but if people really knew him they would find that he isn't as black as he looks. In fact, Blacky the Crow does a whole lot of good in his own {{peculiar}} way, but people are always looking for him to do bad things, and you know you most always see what <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Thus the good Blacky does isn't seen, while the bad is, and so he has grown to have a reputation blacker than the coat he wears.|$|E

Ah! I don't know! It may not be there at all. It may be a dusty image, thrust aside into a corner, and by and by to be flung out of doors, where any foot may trample upon it. If not to-day, then to-morrow! And so, Priscilla, I do not see much wisdom in being so very merry {{in this kind of}} a world." ...|$|E

"My men," [...] he cried, in a stalwart voice {{which no}} one there had ever heard him use before, [...] "my men, look upon me and you will not see what <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see!</b> Here is no planter, no dealer in horses and fat cattle, no grower of sugar-cane! Instead of that," [...] he yelled, drawing his sword and flourishing it above his head, [...] "instead of that I am pirate Bonnet, the new terror of the sea! You, my men, my brave men, {{you are not the}} crew of the good merchantman, the Sarah Williams, you are pirates all. You are the pirate crew of the pirate ship Revenge.

From that summit {{you would}} see nothing but a vast dim desert, {{mountain}} and forest, mountain and forest, where you might wander for years, or until you perished of hunger or fever, or were slain by some beast of prey or by savage men; but oh, Rima, never, never, never would you find your people, for they exist not. You have seen the false water of the mirage on the savannah, when the sun shines bright and hot; and {{if one were to}} follow it one would at last fall down and perish, with never a cool drop to moisten one's parched lips. And your hope, Rima--this hope to find your people which has brought you all the way to Riolama--is a mirage, a delusion, which will lead to destruction if you will not abandon it." ...|$|E

6000|$|It was {{six years}} after his return from France before Wordsworth finally settled down in the scenes with which his name {{and the power of}} his genius were to be for ever associated. During this {{interval}} it was that two great sources of personal influence were opened to him. He entered upon that close and beloved companionship with his sister, which remained unbroken to the end of their days; and he first made the acquaintance of Coleridge. The character of Dorothy Wordsworth has long taken its place in the gallery of admirable and devoted women who have inspired the work and the thoughts of great men. [...] "She is a woman, indeed," [...] said Coleridge, [...] "in mind I mean, and heart; for her person is such that if <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a pretty woman, you would think her rather ordinary; if <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an ordinary woman, you would think her pretty." [...] To the solidity, sense, and strong intelligence of the Wordsworth stock she added a grace, a warmth, a liveliness peculiarly her own. Her nature shines transparent in her letters, in her truly admirable journal, and in every report that we have of her. Wordsworth's own feelings for her, and his sense of the debt that he owed to her faithful affection and eager mind, he has placed on lasting record.|$|R
