50|$|Between {{the years}} 1998 and 2002, {{construction}} accidents accounted for 18% of youth worker fatalities, making construction {{the second most}} deadly industry for a <b>young</b> <b>worker</b> to be employed in during that time period. A significant number of <b>young</b> <b>worker</b> fatalities in this sector resulted from work that the <b>young</b> <b>worker</b> was not legally authorized to do.

Additionally, Hispanic and Latino <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> made up 35% of the <b>young</b> <b>worker</b> fatalities in the construction sector.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{participation of}} <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> {{in the construction}} industry is matched by a growing realization of the vulnerability of these workers in terms of occupational injury and disease. The impact of organizational issues on injury rates for <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> is examined. This is an under-researched area where physical and psychological development influences have traditionally dominated. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on labour force participation and work hours and data from the Queensland Injury Surveillance Unit on patients presenting at hospital emergency departments were used to examine incidence and severity of injuries sustained by <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in construction on different shifts. Analyses indicated a different pattern of injury for <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and workers outside this age category. <b>Young</b> <b>workers</b> were consistently more likely to be injured than all other workers, and this injury rate ratio increased significantly on night shift, suggesting that injury prevention strategies should consider the temporal pattern of work for <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in construction.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a model of abusive {{leadership}} as experienced by <b>young</b> <b>workers.</b> Abusive leadership is understood to be subjective and as such this research seeks to explore the experience of abusive leadership through a qualitative approach. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on interviews with 30 <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> who identified themselves as having a “bad” boss, this study employs a constructivist grounded theory approach in order to identify behaviours, moderators and outcomes of abusive leadership. Findings – A definition and model of abusive leadership as experienced by <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> is proposed. The model details 11 behaviours, five moderators and six individual and two organizational outcomes of abusive leadership. Originality/value – The adoption of a constructivist grounded theory approach reveals several unique factors that moderate the relationship between behaviors and outcomes of abusive leadership in <b>young</b> <b>workers.</b> By grounding the model in the actual experiences of <b>young</b> <b>workers,</b> the paper offers possibilities for future research on abusive leadership and <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and across demographic groups...|$|R

40|$|In the 1980 s, {{the falling}} incomes and {{climbing}} poverty rates characterizing <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in rural America were {{closely linked to}} rapidly changing national and international economic systems. Findings of a recent Senate Budget Committee study indicate that between 1979 and 1987 the share of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> (ages 16 - 34) with low-wage jobs increased nationally by 4. 7 %. Further analysis of the committee data reported in this document shows that the share of <b>young</b> rural <b>workers</b> having low-wage jobs increased by 11 % in those years compared to 4 % for <b>young</b> urban <b>workers.</b> The mean earnings of <b>young</b> rural <b>workers</b> fell by 13 % compared to an increase of 1 % for <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in urban areas.

40|$|Excerpt] This year, {{nearly one}} in three <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> will be laboring on Labor Day; they are {{significantly}} more likely to be at work on this holiday than workers older than 35. Even fewer low-income <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> have the day off. This one small fact is a hint at the economic landscape today’s <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> confront as they enter the workforce. A nationwide survey of 1, 156 people conducted in July 2009 by Peter D. Hart Research Associates for the AFL-CIO and the AFL-CIO community affiliate Working America tells the fuller story, particularly compared with the results of a similar survey we commissioned 10 years ago: Employment, income and benefits have fallen sharply for <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> over the past decade. And these trends are even worse for the growing share of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> with incomes of less than $ 30, 000 a year...|$|R

40|$|The IMF crisis {{which started}} late in 1997 caused massive {{unemployment}} in Korea. The crisis placed a high toll on <b>young</b> <b>workers,</b> especially on those at age between 25 and 29. However, {{even after the}} crisis, the high unemployment rate of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> persisted. This study addresses the issue of high unemployment of younf workers in Kora. It argues that the Human capital theory(Becker, 1975) and Institutional Theory(Coase, 1965 North, 1996) based on the Neo-classical economic perspective can offer only limited explanations on the unemployment of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in Korea. But, the New institutionalism Analysis(Granovetter, 1985 Kim Hae-dong, 1995) perpective which focuses on the socio-cultural and institutional aspects provides a better explanation for high unemployment of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in Korea. The recently observed high unemployment of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> is not a cyclical unemployment, which should wither away if the economy picks up. But, it is a long-trem phenomenon, which should be systematically dealt with. As a solution {{to deal with the}} current high unemployment of <b>young</b> <b>workers,</b> the study suggests improvement of the current vocational education and training system. Improving the current vocational education and training system for the <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> is very important in this knowledge based-economy. In particular, we need to improve the according to their skill levels and updated education and training according to the technological changesso that <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> can choose education and training programs according to their skill levels, starting from education and training programs for low-level skilled workers and moving to those for highly skilled workers...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, governments across Canada {{have responded to}} the {{specific}} problem of workplace injuries among <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> through an increased emphasis on consciousness raising media programs, education and training. This shift in attention was motivated by research evidence on the higher rates of injuries among <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> (Breslin and Smith 2005; Breslin et al, 2007; Wegman and Davis, 1999; Salminen, 2004), the higher costs associated with compensating disabled <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and the efforts of unions and other activists (often the parents of children killed on the job) to bring more attention to the issue. While compensation statistics in Ontario and elsewhere suggest a general decline in injury rates, including a decline among <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> (WSIB, 2007), the evidence also indicates that the drop has been slower among <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and that they continue to have higher rates of injuries than older workers (Breslin et al., 2006 b). Although some of the existing literature indicates that <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> are more reluctant to report injuries and unsafe working conditions, relatively little research has been conducted on the reasons for under-reporting. Interestingly enough, while anecdotal evidence suggests that <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> are also subject to higher rates of Employment Standards violations, there is very little research to date on age related ESA violations in Ontario and on whether there is under-reporting here as well...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Young</b> <b>workers</b> (aged 12 - 25) {{represent}} 40 % of Australia’s casual {{workforce and}} 92 % of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> are also students. Work and study, combined with multiple other time pressures, contribute to negative {{health and safety}} outcomes for <b>young</b> <b>workers.</b> <b>Young</b> <b>workers</b> {{are more likely to}} be precariously employed, less likely to report incidents, accidents and injuries and may have poorly developed self-advocacy skills. These features make <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> a vulnerable part of the workforce. Aim: This research aimed to include the voice of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and other stakeholders in the development of a strategy for action for South Australia. Methods: engagement: hearing the voice of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in the development of the youth work health and safety strategy. We used a mixed methods approach that included a combination of quantitative methods (online survey of young workers’ WHS knowledge) and qualitative methods (interviews, focus groups, online survey of young workers’ stories, program analysis, future inquiry workshop). We relied on snowballing and a strong social media presence to reach <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> so that we could include their voice in the research. We also heard from key stakeholders, the social partners, to canvass their opinions and ideas. We used statistics and thematic analysis to determine our findings. Results: We identified eight areas for action: the psychosocial working environment; the physical working environment; precarious work and work/life balance; fatigue; training and education of young workers; training and education of employers; the need to hear the voice of young workers; and the obstacles faced by employers. We organized these into four key strategic actions: health and well-being; education, training and skill development; engagement and participation; and better connections. Conclusion: The Strategy for Youth Work Health and Safety for South Australia was adopted by the regulator and State government and launched in November 2013. It provides a road map for collaborative change in South Australia that will potentially lead to significant improvements in youth WHS and will help achieve the goal of healthy, safe, fair and productive lives for <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in South Australia...|$|R
