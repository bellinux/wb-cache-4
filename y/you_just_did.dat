After introductions, Groucho repeated the show's famous catch-phrase, [...] "Say the secret word, win a hundred dollars." [...] Each episode of the show had a secret, common word (i.e. home, head, door) and if the contestant said the word during his/her often hilarious interview, then the partnered contestants would each get $50. In this particular case, Armour caught the host in a semantic trap, by immediately stating, [...] "The secret word." [...] He then demanded his $100. After a very brief moment of confusion the band broke out with a short medley indicating that the secret word had been said.

[...] And Fenneman left the frame and responded, [...] "You're welcome," [...] quickly caught himself, and almost cut himself off stating, [...] "I {{had nothing to do with}} it." [...] Normally when the secret word is said, Groucho immediately hands over cash. He did not hand over the cash and it's unclear if they paid Armour the bonus even after Armour and his partner won the game. He also composed the following poem that he read to Groucho.|$|E
