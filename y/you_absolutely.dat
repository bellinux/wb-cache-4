The last thing on my mind was working with artists who I've held in high esteem for years. [...] I worked with Jay on his solo album before I did the Watch the Throne sessions. The second time I went it was Barry Weiss, Jay, Beyoncé, Kanye, couple other people, it was a pretty heavy room." ...|$|E
500|$|I'm {{so excited}} about the 'Alejandro' video, [...] Actually, we're {{shooting}} it very soon and I don't want to say who the director is yet because it's {{going to give a}} lot away.

But I will tell you it's not the sequel to the 'Telephone' video.|$|E

500|$|The {{race was}} {{originally}} sponsored by Donald Trump and {{known as the}} [...] "Tour de Trump" [...] in 1989 and 1990. The idea for the race was conceived by CBS Sports reporter John Tesh, who had covered the 1987 Tour de France and on his return suggested holding a race in the United States to the basketball commentator and entrepreneur Billy Packer. Packer originally planned to call the race the Tour de Jersey. He approached representatives of casinos in Atlantic City for sponsorship, and Trump offered to be the race's primary sponsor and Packer's business partner in the venture. It was Packer who suggested the Tour de Trump name. Speaking {{at the time of}} the start of the first Tour de Trump in May 1989, Trump himself stated that [...] "When [...] was initially stated, I practically fell out of my seat. I said, 'Are you kidding? I will get killed in the media if I use that name. <b>You</b> <b>absolutely</b> have to be kidding'". However, Trump reportedly changed his mind within 20 seconds, and was convinced by the commercial value of the name.|$|E
500|$|The GameCube release {{received}} generally favorable reviews {{by western}} critics. The graphics, art design, and sound were universally praised and some criticism was directed towards the game's short length. Critics agreed that Ikarugas game design was [...] "innovative", [...] "clever", and [...] "unique". The difficulty was both highlighted for being inviting to old-school shooter fans, {{but was also}} criticized for building a barrier to genre new-comers. Tyrone Rodriguez of IGN called it [...] "a shooter-fan's shooter," [...] and Corbie Dillard of Nintendo Life stated [...] "if you're a shooter fan, <b>you</b> <b>absolutely</b> must own at least one version of this masterpiece." [...] IGN listed Ikaruga as their Game of the Month for April 2003. Reception of the Xbox 360 and Windows ports {{was similar to the}} GameCube version. Topher Cantler of Destructoid gave Ikaruga a perfect score and dubbed it a [...] "work of art". Although most critics still agreed that Ikarugas unique game design was a positive characteristic, Simon Parkin of Eurogamer offered a counterpoint that its fresh design is also its weakness, in that it stifles many of the other elements that define shoot 'em ups and morph it into something different and [...] "inscrutable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{the death}} of his {{stepfather}} in 1857, Baudelaire received no mention in the will but he was heartened nonetheless that the division with his mother might now be mended. At 36 he wrote her: [...] "believe that I belong to <b>you</b> <b>absolutely,</b> and that I belong only to you".|$|E
2500|$|However, on February 26, 2006, combine {{officials}} said the reported score of 6 was incorrect. According to NFL Spokesman Steve Alic, [...] "I can tell <b>you</b> <b>absolutely</b> that the score that has been reported on the Internet is inaccurate. I spoke {{to the person who}} graded the test, and he assured me that that number was not correct." [...] The next day, the test was readministered and Young allegedly scored a 16.|$|E
2500|$|IGN's David Zdyrko said of {{the same}} console version that [...] "the {{gameplay}} just isn't deep or compelling enough to warrant picking this title up unless <b>you</b> <b>absolutely</b> MUST have every single product with The Simpsons plastered on it." [...] Zdyrko also criticized the graphics, stating that the [...] "framerate chugs {{in some of the}} levels when {{there are a lot of}} cars on screen and the textures are generally low resolution and completely bland." [...] Zdyrko also said the [...] "hilarious voice samples" [...] were the [...] "lone bright spot" [...] of the game, although he admitted that some of them can get a bit repetitive.|$|E

2500|$|... "Linden Arden Stole the Highlights" [...] segues into [...] "Who Was That Masked Man" [...] (sung in falsetto) {{which has}} a similar melody. The story line {{pertains}} to a mythological Irish expatriate living in San Francisco who, when cornered, turns violent and then goes into hiding, [...] "living with a gun", and [...] references a childhood interest in The Lone Ranger. [...] Morrison described the anti-hero Linden Arden as being [...] "about an image of an Irish American living in San Francisco - it's really a hard man type of thing, whilst the latter was a song about what it's like when <b>you</b> <b>absolutely</b> cannot trust anybody. Not as in some paranoia, but in reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|A snow {{emergency}} {{was declared}} for Washington, D.C., meaning that residents {{would not be}} allowed to park on snow emergency routes after 9:30p.m. local time on January22. Mayor Bowser urged people to remain home during the storm, [...] "nless <b>you</b> <b>absolutely</b> have to be out tomorrow afternoon , residents should get home as soon as possible". Across Maryland, 2,700pieces of snow equipment were mobilized and crews planned to distribute 365,000tons of road salt. In Virginia, 500vehicles were deployed to treat roads and 500members of the Virginia National Guard were placed on standby. Schools across the D.C. area were scheduled to end classes early on January22, before the storm's arrival. Stores across Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. reported a substantial uptick in sales, with groceries, heaters, shovels, and similar items sold out in numerous locations. West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin mobilized the state's National Guard on January21.|$|E
2500|$|ToeJam & Earl was re-released on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console in 2006. Official Nintendo Magazine {{scored the}} game 85%, and praised its humor, {{originality}} and two-player mode. However, the reviewer {{believed that the}} game's enjoyability had diminished with time. GameSpot felt that the game's 1990s idioms were dated, but that the gameplay—particularly the two-player mode—was still enjoyable by modern standards. Jeremy Parish of 1UP found the game's two-player co-operative mode more enjoyable than its single-player, and described the graphics and sound as [...] "oddly primitive". Parish considered it [...] "one of the best games to hit VC to date". Eurogamer's reviewer negatively received the game, and believed its gameplay to be unsatisfying and overly slow. IGN called the game's visuals a [...] "mixed bag" [...] and derided the slow pace, but praised its unpredictability and believed that its sound design was [...] "one thing <b>you</b> <b>absolutely</b> can't fault".|$|E

2500|$|In {{her first}} {{performance}} in Edinburgh in 1973, Abramović explored elements of ritual and gesture. Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the Russian game, in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she {{would pick up}} a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body – {{the pain and the}} sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramović began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. [...] "Once you enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things <b>you</b> <b>absolutely</b> could never normally do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who seek}} immorality must not {{associate}} with women. On the ninth {{day of the}} third month, {{the second day of}} the sixth month, the sixth day of the ninth month, and the third day of the twelfth month, [...] should remain in their rooms and make sure not to look at women. If the Six Corpses (the Three Corpses of the adept himself and of the woman that he looks at?) cause chaos, the blood in your viscera will be disturbed and aroused, your three hun souls will be unguarded. Your spirit will weaken and your qi will leave. All of these [...] will accumulate, and bring about death. As for why you avoid [...] on these days, it is not only to block off lasciviousness. It is [...] to pacify the female palaces. The female palaces are in the shen and the male palaces are in the yin. Yin and shen punish each other. Both execute each other. On these days the Three Corpses of men and women come out from the pupils of the eyes. Female Corpses beckon the male, and male Corpses beckon the female. Misfortune and harm pass back and forth, making the spirit perish and thus blemishing your rectitude. Even if a person does not notice it, his body is exposed and has already been harmed because the Three Corpses fight within the eyes, while blood is shed within the Niwan (a compartment in the brain). On these days, even if it is a girl who you are extremely fond of, or a wife of a close friend, <b>you</b> <b>absolutely</b> must not look them face to face. My predecessor and teacher became an Immortal by simply practicing this method. The [...] does not apply to [...] closest of relatives to whom you have no thoughts [...] (tr.
