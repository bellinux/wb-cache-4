There was no further correspondence between the two, beyond a short conciliatory note from Markham, in February 1901, which read [...] "I can now see things from <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and wish you success"—a sentiment apparently not reflected in Markham's subsequent attitude towards the Scottish expedition.|$|E
500|$|Edge {{compared}} the game favorably to System Shock {{due to its}} balanced combination of action and strategy, stating that {{in just two years}} Looking Glass [...] "has metamorphosed from one of the industry's secret technology powerhouses to a hugely respected developer in its own right." [...] John Payne of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Depending on <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> Terra Nova is either a stripped-down Mechwarrior or a souped-up Doom." [...] However, he stated that it was enjoyable regardless of which perspective was taken. While he described the game's animation as [...] "fluid", he found its graphics in general to be [...] "fairly blocky, even at a distance". He finished his review by stating that the game [...] "requires more practice than action fans are used to" [...] but provides [...] "a nice payoff". Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "Looking Glass has always been known for breaking the barriers of conventional gameplay, and it has done it again with Terra Nova". The magazine considered the game to be [...] "an all around stunning effort".|$|E

2500|$|Miyamoto's {{best known}} and most {{influential}} title, Super Mario Bros., [...] "depending on <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> created an industry or resuscitated a comatose one." [...] The Daily Telegraph called it [...] "a title {{that set the}} standard for all future videogames." [...] G4 noted its revolutionary gameplay as well as its role in [...] "almost single-handedly" [...] rescuing the video game industry. The title also popularized the side-scrolling genre of video games. The New Yorker described Mario as the first folk hero of video games, with as much influence as Mickey Mouse.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the fighting, the division was used as political bargaining chip (among other arguments) during a series of back and forth telegrams between Churchill and Prime Minister of Australia John Curtin, discussing the possibility of diverting Australian troops to Burma rather than being allowed to return home. On 20 February, Churchill sent a telegram in which, he stated [...] "...your message of January 23, in which you said that the evacuation of Singapore would be 'an inexcusable betrayal'. Agreeably with <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> we therefore put the 18th Division ... into Singapore instead of diverting them to Burma, and ordered them to fight it out to the end. They were lost at Singapore and did not save it, whereas they could almost certainly have saved Rangoon. I take full responsibility with my colleagues on the Defence Committe for this decision; but you also bear a heavy share on account of your telegram." [...] Two days later, Curtin retorted [...] "In regard to your statement that the 18th Division was diverted from Burma to Singapore because of our message, it is pointed out that the date of the latter was January 23, whereas in your telegram of January 14 you informed me that one brigade of this division was due on January 13 and the remainder on January 27." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, Cruyff {{announced}} his irreversible decision {{to retire from}} international football {{at the age of}} 30, despite still lean and wiry, after helping the country qualify for the 1978 World Cup. A move which was shrouded in mystery and met with disbelief back in late 1977, was only finally stripped of its mystique in 2008, when Cruyff lifted the lid on his decision in an interview with Catalunya Radio. It was while still living in Barcelona as a player in late 1977, Cruyff and his family became the victims of an armed attacker who forced his way into his flat in Barcelona. And the man who was then the ultimate football superstar was confronted with the choice between family values and a highly promising World Cup glory {{at the end of his}} international career. But for Cruyff, family comes first. In the interview with Catalunya Radio, he said that the attempted kidnap was the reason he decided not to go to the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. As he recalled, “You should know that I had problems at the end of my career as a player here and I don't know if you know that someone [...] a rifle at my head and tied me up and tied up my wife in front of the children at our flat in Barcelona. The children were going to school accompanied by the police. The police slept in our house for three or four months. I was going to matches with a bodyguard. All these things change <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> towards many things. There are moments in life in which there are other values. We wanted to stop this and be a little more sensible. It was the moment to leave football and I couldn't play in the World Cup after this.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] Prescott confessed, [...] "when I explained, I {{was more}} afraid of you than of Jernyngham.

5000|$|When {{asked about}} {{the reason for the}} character's homophobia, show runner Ilene Chaiken said, [...] "The why isn't {{something}} we've asked because I don't think there is a why." [...] It just is. It could be [...] "generational" [...] and [...] "cultural" [...] or it could just be his personal beliefs, [...] "but it's not surprising that it would be his <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view," [...] Chaiken responded. [...] "We don’t talk about there being a specific incident in his life that made him homophobic," [...] because usually there isn't one. According to Chaiken, creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong viewed Lucious' homophobia as [...] "The most important storyline." [...] They went on to state: [...] "It’s central. We want to continue to play it, and play it with authenticity and roughness. We don’t want to soften it in any way." [...] By the end of Season one, Lucious is able to put his homophobia aside for the greater good of Empire. Jussie Smollett said of Lucious' evolution and eventual acceptance of Jamal's sexuality, [...] "Where you meet Jamal and Lucious in the pilot is not where Jamal and Lucious end up. There's a journey, a certain level of growth, and that's the truth of humanity." [...] Smollett clarified that Lucious' evolution was not a complete reversal of his beliefs, but rather, {{a step in the right}} direction: [...] "It's not to say that Lucious is going to be this incredible parent that supports his kid and goes and stands on the sidelines of gay marches, but it does mean that we're holding up a mirror and being like, [...] "Lucious, if those are <b>your</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> as odd and jaded and bullshit as they are, if those are <b>your</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> the least you can do — the least you can do — is respect your child." [...] Co-creator Danny Strong said of the character's growth, [...] "Lucious has had the most profound arc of the season when it comes to his understanding and acceptance of his son’s sexuality, and it was sort of one of the driving ideas of the season thematically with addressing homophobia in a way that was honest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am simply {{obeying the}} law," [...] he answered. [...] "After all, even from <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> I {{do not think}} that it is so bad.

See how the smoke from those factory chimneys is sending its smuts across these fields. They are no longer country; they are better gathered in." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I trust, Sir Henry," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you will}} not think me in any way presumptuous if I speak to you intimately.

6000|$|... "I can't work any more," [...] said Roderick. [...] "You have upset me! I 'll go and {{stroll on}} the Pincian." [...] And he tossed aside his working-jacket and {{prepared}} {{himself for the}} street. As he was arranging his cravat before the glass, something occurred to him which made him thoughtful. He stopped a few moments afterward, as they were going out, {{with his hand on}} the door-knob. [...] "You did, from <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> an indiscreet thing," [...] he said, [...] "to tell Miss Light of my engagement." ...|$|R

2500|$|Sofia Milos, {{who plays}} Bianca LaGarda, {{had said that}} The Border {{demonstrates}} how people should be fighting against crime and terrorism of all types.

25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that, depending on <b>your</b> political <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> such government payments for offsetting the housing charge could be considered a subsidy of the low-income members, or a contractual business arrangement {{between the government and the}} co-op, which helps to stabilize revenue to the co-op in exchange for accomplishing a social goal for the government for a specific period. This dichotomy is typical of the fact that a housing co-op is somewhere between a private business corporation and a social agency, and where one places it depends on one's viewpoint—and the collective viewpoint of each housing co-op. Some observers would now simply categorize these co-op as a form of social enterprise.|$|R
