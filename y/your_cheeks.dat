No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on <b>your</b> <b>cheeks</b> as he talks.|$|E
2500|$|Independent prostitutes {{who worked}} the street were on the next higher level. Besides {{directly}} displaying their charms to potential clients they had recourse to publicity; sandals with marked soles have been found which left an imprint that stated [...] AKOLOUTHEI ("Follow me") on the ground. They also used makeup, apparently quite outrageously. Eubulus, a comic author, offers these courtesans derision: [...] "plastered over with layers of white lead, … jowls smeared with mulberry juice. And {{if you go out}} on a summer's day, two rills of inky water flow from your eyes, and the sweat rolling from <b>your</b> <b>cheeks</b> upon your throat makes a vermilion furrow, while the hairs blown about on your faces look grey, they are so full of white lead".|$|E
2500|$|In the Baroque and Classical eras quintuple meter is, if anything, {{even less}} {{frequently}} encountered {{than in the}} Renaissance. Johann Heinrich Schmelzer included a [...] section of 27 measures in his Harmonia à 5, composed by at least 1668. Two brief passages of [...] occur in the [...] "mad scene" [...] (act 2, scene 11) from Handel's opera Orlando (1732), first at the words [...] "Già solco l’onde" [...] ("Already I am cleaving the waves") when the demented hero believes he has embarked on Charon’s boat on the Styx, and then again two bars later. Charles Burney found this whole scene admirable, as a portrait of Orlando's madness, but observed that [...] "Handel has endeavoured to describe the hero's perturbation of intellect by fragments of symphony in , a division of time {{which can only be}} borne in such a situation". Burney's German contemporary, Johann Kirnberger, also felt that [...] "No one can repeat groups of five and even less of seven equal pulses in succession without wearisome strain". Another exceptional 18th-century example is an entire aria composed in [...] time, [...] "Se la sorte mi condanna" [...] found in Andrea Adolfati's opera Arianna (1750), but the English theater composer William Reeve, with the last movement of his Gypsy's Glee (1796), to the words [...] "Come, stain <b>your</b> <b>cheeks</b> with nut or berry" [...] (in [...] time) is credited with having composed an example in true quintuple time, [...] "for instead of the usual division of the bar into two parts, such as might be expressed by alternate bars of [...] and , or [...] and , there are five distinct beats in every bar, each consisting of an accent and a non-accent. This freedom from the ordinary alternation of two and three is well expressed by the grouping of the accompaniment, which varies throughout the movement…" ...|$|E
