500|$|In a rare comedy turn, she {{starred in}} The Baxter {{alongside}} writer/director Michael Showalter. The film received mostly negative reviews, but critics praised Williams. [...] "Only when Williams is around does the movie seem human, true, and funny: Even in her slapstick there's pain," [...] wrote The Boston Globe reporter Wesley Morris. [...] "She's almost too good: It's not until she's left {{a scene that}} <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> movie isn't working." [...] Released on August 26, 2005, Showalter's movie made $37,000 opening weekend before going on to gross over $180,000 domestically.|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E
2500|$|The role {{reversal}} between Travolta and Cage was {{a subject of}} praise, as were the stylized, violent action sequences. Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film {{three out of four}} and remarked that, [...] "Here, using big movie stars and asking them to play each other, Woo and his writers find a terrific counterpoint to the action scenes: All through the movie, you find yourself reinterpreting every scene as <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> [...] "other" [...] character is [...] "really" [...] playing it." [...] Rolling Stones Peter Travers said of the film, [...] "You may not buy the premise or the windup, but with Travolta and Cage taking comic and psychic measures of their characters and their own careers, there is no resisting Face/Off. This you gotta see." [...] Richard Corliss of Time said that the film [...] "isn't just a thrill ride, it's a rocket into the thrilling past, when directors could scare you with how much emotion they packed into a movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Colbert {{encouraged}} fans to {{vote for}} his name {{to be the new}} name of a bridge in Hungary, which was being decided via an online poll; he beat the runner-up by more than 14 million votes. He was, however, disqualified, as the name of the bridge was intended to be a memoriam. Later that year, he began a mock feud with indie rock group the Decemberists over the subject of who was the first to challenge fans to create a green screen video; the fake conflict culminated in a guitar solo competition on the show's final episode of the year, featuring guest appearances from guitarist Peter Frampton and Dr. Henry Kissinger. Colbert later recalled it as the show's [...] "craziest" [...] moment, changing the way the staff viewed the program: [...] "Because <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> character believes anything he thinks, says, [...] cares about is important, anything fits on the show. [...] That is the show where we said, oh, there is unlimited open field running." ...|$|E
