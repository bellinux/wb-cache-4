500|$|The Green Book's motto, {{displayed}} on the front cover, urged black travelers to [...] "Carry your Green Book with you – You may need it". The 1949 edition included a quote from Mark Twain: [...] "Travel is fatal to prejudice", inverting Twain's original meaning; as Cotton Seiler puts it, [...] "here it was the visited, rather than the visitors, who would find themselves enriched by the encounter." [...] Green commented in 1940 that the Green Book had given black Americans [...] "something authentic to travel by and to make traveling better for the Negro." [...] Its principal goal was to provide accurate information on black-friendly accommodations to answer the constant question that faced black drivers: [...] "Where will <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> night?" [...] As well as essential information on lodgings, service stations and garages, it provided details of leisure facilities open to African Americans, including beauty salons, restaurants, nightclubs and country clubs. The listings focused on four main categories– hotels, motels, tourist homes (private residences, usually owned by African Americans, which provided accommodation to travelers), and restaurants. They were arranged by state and subdivided by city, giving {{the name and address}} of each business. For an extra payment, businesses could have their listing displayed in bold type or have a star next to it to denote that they were [...] "recommended".|$|E
