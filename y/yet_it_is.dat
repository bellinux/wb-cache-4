5|$|Perhaps one of Zobel's most {{fascinating}} inventions is the lattice filter section. This section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> constructed out of inductors and capacitors. The only signal parameter it modifies is {{the phase of}} the signal at different frequencies.|$|E
5|$|Corrupt {{politicians}} are {{already beginning to}} speculate on them as possible capital for their schemes and to fill their poor heads {{with all sorts of}} vagaries. Florida is the State into which they have, more than anywhere else, been pouring. Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; but as <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> mere worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, nothing more.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{social work}} has been {{historically}} defined by these institutionalized and deinstitutionalized periods, informal community design programs have always existed. In fact, informal community-based programs predate human service applications of this approach. In 1990, Bernice Harper illustrated {{this point in the}} book Social Work Practice with Black Families: A Culturally Specific Perspective in regards to African American communities, by writing that: Blacks have always cared for the sick at home, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> never labeled 'home care.' Blacks have been dying at home and receiving care in the process, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> never called 'hospice care.' Blacks have relieved each other from the caring and curing processes, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> never seen as 'respite care.' Blacks have cared for each other in their homes, in their neighborhoods, and throughout their communities, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> never referred to as 'volunteerism.' ...|$|R

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Death Valley Pupfish swam to the area from the Colorado River via a long-since dried-up system of rivers and lakes (see Lake Manly). They now live in two separate populations: one in Salt Creek and another in Cottonball Marsh. Death Valley {{is one of the}} hottest and driest places in North America, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> home to over 1,000 species of plants; 23 of which, including the very rare Rock Lady (Holmgrenanthe petrophila), are not found anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|Assuming for the {{purposes}} of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. <b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the Establishment Clause, Epperson v. Arkansas, supra, Willoughby v. Stever, No. 15574-75 (D.D.C. May 18, 1973); aff'd. 504 F.2d 271 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. denied , 420 U.S. 924 (1975); Wright v. Houston Indep. School Dist., 366 F.

5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} world than he has {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. <b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E

5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. <b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> one thing to employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E

25|$|It {{was widely}} {{used for the}} {{treatment}} of multiple sclerosis until {{the first half of the}} 1990s. Concerns about increased risk of malignancy has led to a decreased use, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still used in maintenance treatment for patients who frequently relapse.|$|E
25|$|Some {{think that}} if a small child dies this must be borne with equanimity; if it {{is still in its}} cradle there should not even be a lament. And <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> from the latter that nature has more cruelly demanded back the gift she had given.|$|E
25|$|It {{recommends}} safety standards, but {{member states}} {{are not required to}} comply; it promotes nuclear energy, but it also monitors nuclear use; it is the sole global organization overseeing the nuclear energy industry, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also weighed down by checking compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).|$|E

25|$|The longest text {{found in}} Shuanggudui is an {{incomplete}} {{version of the}} Yijing, or Classic of Changes, in 752 fragments containing 3,119 characters. The hexagram and line statements of the Shuanggudui text closely resemble the received version, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> too fragmentary to reconstruct the complete text of any single hexagram or even the sequence {{in which they were}} presented.|$|E
25|$|New postconstuctivist {{or early}} stalinka {{buildings}} are rare. Preobrazhenskaya Zastava (Преображенская Застава) mixed-use project (two blocks, 308 apartments and retail stores) {{was completed in}} 2002–2005. Unusually for present-day Moscow, it actually looks like a period piece, not a cheap modern replica. There are no trademark square columns or slim porticos, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the best attempt to recreate a style of the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Mind proper is the {{conceptual}} and cognitive mind. Mind is a subordinate {{process of the}} Supermind. It is the intermediary stage between the Divine and the mundane life. It works by measuring and dividing reality, and has {{lost sight of the}} Divine. It is the seat of ignorance, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still capable of an upward ascent toward the Divine.|$|E

25|$|Transaxillary: an {{incision}} {{made to the}} axilla (armpit), {{from which}} the dissection tunnels medially, to emplace the implants, either bluntly or with an endoscope (illuminated video microcamera), without producing visible scars on the breast proper; <b>yet,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likelier to produce inferior asymmetry of the implant-device position. Therefore, surgical revision of transaxillary emplaced breast implants usually requires either an IMF incision or a periareolar incision.|$|E
25|$|A large {{molecule}} with an ionized {{group is}} technically an ion, but its {{behavior may be}} largely the result of non-ionic interactions. For example, sodium stearate (the main constituent of traditional soaps) consists entirely of ions, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a soft material quite unlike a typical ionic solid. There is a continuum between ionic solids and molecular solids with little ionic character in their bonding.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} state drink of Rhode Island is coffee milk, a beverage created by mixing milk with coffee syrup. This unique syrup {{was invented in}} the state and is sold in almost all Rhode Island supermarkets, as well as border states. Coffee milk contains some caffeine, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sold in school cafeterias throughout the state. Strawberry milk is also as popular as chocolate milk.|$|E
