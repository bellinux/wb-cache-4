He believed all legal proceedings should be held in public, quoting Jeremy Bentham when he said that [...] "in the darkness of secrecy all sorts of things can go wrong. If things are really done in public <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> judge does behave himself, the newspapers can comment on it if he misbehavesâ€” it keeps everyone in order".|$|E

"Bad news, I suppose, down there," [...] said Mr. Dumphy, briskly; [...] "and I reckon the widow, {{though she}} has been luckier than her neighbours, don't feel {{particularly}} lively, eh? I'm devilish sorry for you, Poinsett, though, as a man, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> investment was a good one. But you can't make a woman understand business. Eh? Well, the Rancho's worth double the mortgage, I reckon. Eh? Ugly, ain't she--of course! Said she'd been swindled? That's like a woman! You and me know 'em! eh, Poinsett?" [...] Mr. Dumphy emitted his characteristic bark, and winked at his visitor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Men when so {{attacked}} {{have been}} known frequently to escape by thrusting their thumbs or fingers into the creature's eyes. If {{it can be done}} the alligator is sure to lose his hold, but it demands quickness and great presence of mind. When a reptile is tearing at one's leg, and hurrying one along under water, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nerve required to keep perfectly cool, to feel for the creature's eyes, and to thrust your finger into them is very great. The best plan, Frank, distinctly is to keep out of their reach altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We might deduce it {{from the}} mere {{character}} of the one hand {{as compared with the}} other. But we have more assured reasons than that for supposing it. If you examine this scrap with attention you will {{come to the conclusion that}} the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first, leaving blanks for the other to fill up. These blanks were not always sufficient, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> second man had a squeeze to fit his 'quarter' in between the 'at' and the 'to,' showing that the latter were already written. The man who wrote all his words first is undoubtedly the man who planned the affair." ...|$|E

Why had the plague not broken {{out at the}} blacksmith's shop in Munday's Lane? Because, as I've shown you, forges and smithies belong {{naturally}} to Mars, and, for his honour's sake, Mars 'ud keep 'em clean from the creatures of the Moon. But was it like, think you, that he'd come down and rat-catch in general for lazy, ungrateful mankind? That were working a willing horse to death. So, then, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> meaning of the blazing star above him when he set was simply this: [...] "Destroy and burn the creatures Of the moon, for they are the root of your trouble. And thus, having shown you a taste of my power, good people, adieu."' ...|$|E
60|$|And now, here is {{a simple}} but most useful test of your {{capacity}} for understanding Florentine sculpture or painting. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lines of that cap are both right, and lovely; that {{the choice of the}} folds is exquisite in its ornamental relations of line; and that the softness and ease of them is complete,--though only sketched with a few dark touches,--then you can understand Giotto's drawing, and Botticelli's;--Donatello's carving and Luca's. But if you see nothing in this sculpture, you will see nothing in theirs, of theirs. Where they choose to imitate flesh, or silk, or to play any vulgar modern trick with marble--(and they often do)--whatever, in a word, is French, or American, or Cockney, in their work, you can see; but what is Florentine, and for ever great--unless you can see also the beauty of this old man in his citizen's cap,--you will see never.|$|E
60|$|The first fact {{of course}} was a fact of contrast. When I said that the city struck me in its {{historic}} aspect as being {{at least as much}} a memory of the Crusaders as of the Saracens, I did not of course mean to deny the incidental contrasts between this Southern civilisation and the civilisation of Europe, especially northern Europe. The immediate difference was obvious enough when the gold and the gaudy vegetation of so comparatively Asiatic a city were struck by this strange blast out of the North. It was a queer spectacle to see a great green palm bowed down under a white load of snow; and it was a stranger and sadder spectacle to see the people accustomed to live under such palm-trees bowed down under such unearthly storms. Yet the very manner in which they bore it is perhaps the first fact to be noted among all the facts that make up the puzzling problem of Jerusalem. Odd as it may sound <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> true Orientals are not familiar with snow by the very fact that they accept it. They accept it as we should accept being swallowed by an earthquake; because we do not know the answer to an earthquake. The men from the desert do not know the answer to the snow, it seems to them unanswerable. But Christians fight with snow in a double sense; they fight with snow as they fight with snowballs. A Moslem left to himself would no more play with a snowball than make a toy of a thunderbolt. And this is really a type of the true problem that was raised by the very presence of the English soldier in the street, even if he was only shovelling away the snow.|$|E
