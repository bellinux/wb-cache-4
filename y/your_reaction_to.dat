5000|$|Some reviewers {{have been}} {{critical}} of what they perceive as Humble's depiction of stereotypical or simplistic gender roles. Stephen Totilo said he was [...] "left assuming that Humble thought it was husbands who benefited from engaging in stuff (and people?) besides a wife, whereas the wife only benefited from contact with the husband". According to Humble, though he intended to allow for a great deal of interpretation, this was not a message he intended. Rather, [...] "the central point is that if both needs were not satisfied, the Marriage dies. In other words, love is satisfying different needs. For myself, I do need 'alone time' as well as 'together time,' but not one exclusively, and the games rules were a way of exploring that." [...] Edward Picot called the game [...] "poetic" [...] but also expressed concern about the game's [...] "stereotypical view of the sexes" [...] which he notes are particularly apparent through the use of blue and pink for the squares. Others criticized the premise, arguing against reducing the complexities and ambiguities of human experience in order to correspond to simplified representation and a fixed model of interaction. From these criticisms and other interpretations, Humble said he learned an important lesson: [...] "that the first mechanics you show define everything that follows, the power of that initial impact between the two squares and <b>your</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> it defines how you look at the rest of the game.

5000|$|A modern {{variation}} of the teleological argument is built upon {{the concept of the}} fine-tuned Universe: According to the website Biologos: [...] "Fine-tuning refers to the surprising precision of nature’s physical constants, and the beginning state of the Universe. To explain the present state of the universe, even the best scientific theories require that the physical constants of nature and the beginning state of the Universe have extremely precise values." [...] Also, the fine-tuning of the Universe is the apparent delicate balance of conditions necessary for human life. In this view, speculation about a vast range of possible conditions in which life cannot exist is used to explore the probability of conditions in which life can and does exist. For example, {{it can be argued that}} if the force of the Big Bang explosion had been different by 1/1060 or the strong interaction force was only 5% different, life would be impossible. In terms of a teleological argument, the intuition in relation to a fine-tuned universe would be that God must have been responsible, if achieving such perfect conditions is so improbable. However, in regard to fine-tuning, Kenneth Einar Himma writes: [...] "The mere fact that it is enormously improbable that an event occurred... by itself, gives us no reason to think that it occurred by design… As intuitively tempting as it may be...” Himma attributes the “Argument from Suspicious Improbabilities”, a formalization of “the fine-tuning intuition” to George N. Schlesinger: To understand Schlesinger’s argument, consider <b>your</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> two different events. If John wins a 1-in-1,000,000,000 lottery game, you would not immediately be tempted to think that John (or someone acting on his behalf) cheated. If, however, John won three consecutive 1-in-1,000 lotteries, you would immediately be tempted to think that John (or someone acting on his behalf) cheated. Schlesinger believes that the intuitive reaction to these two scenarios is epistemically justified. The structure of the latter event is such that it… justifies a belief that intelligent design is the cause… Despite the fact that the probability of winning three consecutive 1-in-1,000 games is exactly the same as the probability of winning one 1-in-1,000,000,000 game, the former event… warrants an inference of intelligent design.|$|E
5000|$|Sociologist Chris Lucerne {{states in}} her article titled “Emotions! Good or Bad”, that there are neither good nor bad {{emotions}}. However, you can judge emotions as such. According to Lucerne's theory emotion is believed to help humans express their feelings. Therefore, emotions {{are a part of}} human nature to help us communicate. In addition to Chris Lucerne’s theory, when humans experience a situation good or bad an emotion is triggered. As a result of emotion an action is followed. For example, here are a few emotions listed in Lucerne’s article in which people experience daily. The first is the emotion of happiness, which can ignite the sensation to dance. A second emotion is anger, in which the person begins to feel hot causing him or her to perspire. Finally is the emotion of sadness, which creates a sensation of feeling closed in. As a consequence of feeling closed in the person may react irrationally to make them comfortable. Chris Lucerne also states {{in her article}} [...] "that no matter what, you cannot control <b>your</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> emotion."

3000|$|Stimuli were 173 {{full-body}} {{photographs of}} unique undergraduate females integrated into real-world scenes. The women’s photos {{were selected from}} a set of 3129 photos of women that were taken by the research team (see also Treat et al., under review). The models wore warm-weather clothing that varied in sexual provocativeness and {{they were asked to}} display a wide variety of affective cues across photographs, including rejection, friendliness, neutrality, sexual interest, and sadness. Thus, the women in the stimululs set varied along three psychological dimensions: sexual interest (extremely rejecting to extremely sexually interested), provocativeness of dress (conservative to provocative), and normative attractiveness. Nine undergraduate women provided normative ratings of the models’ sexual interest and provocativeness-of-dress. When judging sexual interest, raters were instructed “to focus only on {{the degree to which the}} woman is expressing sexual interest, and to ignore her clothing style, her attractiveness, <b>your</b> personal <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> the woman or her clothing, etc.” When judging provocativeness of dress, raters were instructed to 'focus only on the sexual provocativeness of the clothing and to ignore characteristics of the model completely, including her affect, her attractiveness, how she looks in the clothing, <b>your</b> personal <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> the woman or her clothing, etc.’ Thus provocativeness of dress throughout this manuscript refers to a subjective judgment about the woman's clothing by relevant raters, rather than to an inherent property of the woman or her clothing. Inter-rater reliability among the coders was high (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)[*]=[*] 0.97, 0.95). [...] Members of our larger research team with expertise in sexual perception also coded sexual interest and provocativeness of dress.

Many of these are so deeply a part of your everyday life that you don’t even realize how those feelings affect your money decisions or <b>your</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> money decisions of other family members. Everyone experiences changes in life. Sometimes you plan for it and sometimes things happen over which you have little control. When the lat ter happens, you are facing an unplanned change. Unplanned income changes can result from unex pected job loss or loss to your home or business by forces of nature such as tornadoes, floods, and drought. Market changes in commodities or stocks, or major expenses resulting from an illness, equipment break down, burglary, or accident can also cause such changes. Unlike a planned change, it is much more difficult to make adjustments for unplanned income changes because the choice to change has been taken away from you. This publication will help you understand what happens in the first few months after an unplanned income loss as you deal with the overlapping emotional, economic, and social effects (Figure 1). A major decrease in income requires that all family members recognize the grief they feel over the loss (emotional effect), reassess how money will be used within the family (economic effect), and make a conscious effort to manage the inevitable disagree ment and potential conflict that might arise (social effect). Doing so will help you live with the conse quences of the unplanned income change, develop new options, and move on...|$|R
