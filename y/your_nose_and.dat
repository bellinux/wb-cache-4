6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} man, [...] "you {{are not to}} snatch. Come here. Come here. Vieni qua!" [...] And {{he held up the}} piece of bread. The animal came near. [...] "Now," [...] said the man, [...] "I put this bread on <b>your</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> you don't move, un--Ha!!" ...|$|E

6000|$|That, old mare, {{at sight}} whereof your wise eyes widen till {{they are ready}} to burst, and your ears are first shot forward towards <b>your</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> then laid back with vicious intent. Stand still, old woman! Do you think still, after fifteen winters, that you can catch a fox? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hooray!" [...] Sophy exclaimed. [...] "Off {{with your}} smart gown, Louise! We'll be splendidly Bohemian. You shall {{put on your}} black frock and a black hat, and powder <b>your</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> we'll all go to Guido's first and drink vermuth. I can't look the part, but I can act it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{you are not}} beautiful; {{but your}} eyes are bright, and you look pleasant, so I don't mind the {{freckles}} on <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> the whiteness of your face. I think you are good. I am sorry for you, and I shall lend you a book to read when the pain comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lift up {{your head}} and look {{straight}} along the bridge of <b>your</b> <b>nose,</b> lad, <b>and</b> you'll see them. They're an interesting group, are the Keelin' Islands. Volcanic, they are, with a coral top-dressin', so to speak. Sit down here an' I'll tell 'ee about 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are true}} savages. Already has begun {{the custom of}} wearing human teeth. In another {{generation}} you will be perforating <b>your</b> <b>noses</b> <b>and</b> ears and wearing ornaments of bone and shell. I know. The human race is doomed to sink back farther and farther into the primitive night ere again it begins its bloody climb upward to civilization. When we increase and feel the lack of room, we will proceed to kill one another. And then I suppose you will wear human scalp-locks at your waist, as well--as you, Edwin, who are the gentlest of my grandsons, have already begun with that vile pigtail. Throw it away, Edwin, boy; throw it away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do know," [...] Briggs answered, savagely. [...] "He {{left because}} {{he was tired of}} eating sole-leather for steak, and fire-salt pork, and tar for molasses, and butter strong enough to make <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> curl, <b>and</b> {{drinking}} burnt-rye slops for coffee and tea-grounds for tea. And so am I, and so are all of us, and--and-- Will you let me go up-stairs now, Mrs. Betterson?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{got to be}} done, Hugh. Tie {{that bit}} of sacking, quick, over <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> mouth, while I do the same. Now lower {{yourself}} by your arms, and drop; it won't be above fifteen feet. Hold your breath, and rush straight to the window. I heard them open it. Now, both together now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Hans," [...] I said to him, [...] "what {{is the use}} of you? You are {{no better}} than a fraud. You pretend to be the best {{watchdog}} in Africa, and yet a woman comes into this house under <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> in the grey of the morning, and you do not see her. Where is your reputation, Hans?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can I help it if {{something}} pulled <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> snatched off your eyeglasses, which anyhow are quite useless {{to you when}} there is no light? Again, is it possible for me, sitting {{on the other side of}} that table, to have placed the concertina on your head and made it play the National Anthem, a thing that I have not the slightest idea how to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You want to {{look nice}} about the place, don't you? Well, then! there's no sense in going around looking like that if you don't have to, is there? I heard Mary talking about <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> to Biggs <b>and</b> Celestine. She {{said she had to}} laugh every time she saw it." ...|$|R

5000|$|Nolan Finley, {{editor of}} The Detroit News, which has {{endorsed}} the proposal, wrote {{in support of}} the proposal, noting that [...] "There is no Plan B". Finley argued that the option of cutting spending from other areas of the budget will not work, because"Republicans aren't going to make substantial cuts to prison spending, Democrats aren't going to hack welfare spending, and neither party is going to touch school spending." [...] Finley noted that, in his opinion, the best course of action would be to raise the money through an increased fuel tax; however, the legislature had been unable to pass such a bill last session and would likely be unable to do so now. Finley concluded by saying that if the proposal fails, revenue increases will be off the table, making Proposal 1 the only option. [...] "So the real message to voters should be this: Hold <b>your</b> <b>noses</b> <b>and</b> vote for Prop 1, or keep driving on what may be the deadliest roads in America. Guaranteed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What how, Nigel!" [...] he cried. [...] "Mary {{has told}} me that you make a start this morning, and we have waited here this hour and more on the chance of seeing you pass. Come, lad, and have a last stoup of English ale, for many a time amid the sour French wines you will long for the white foam under <b>your</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> the good homely twang of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The very thing. You've heard him. And saying our {{fortunes}} were made. Took {{me out to}} the Ho'burm Restaurant, George,--dinner, and we had champagne, {{stuff that}} blows up the back of <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> makes you go SO, and he said at last he'd got things worthy of me--and we moved here next day. It's a swell house, George. Three pounds a week for the rooms. And he says the Business'll stand it." ...|$|E
60|$|Do {{what you}} will, however, {{one of them}} always escapes the murder; {{and as soon as}} the candle is out the miscreant begins his infernal droning and trumpeting; descends playfully upon <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> face, and so lightly that you don't know that he touches you. But that for a week {{afterwards}} you bear about marks of his ferocity, you might take the invisible little being to be a creature of fancy--a mere singing in your ears.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, my dears, I do. But then, I protest, I'm not fairly treated. I think, {{for a young}} American girl, {{who looks}} as most of my fair friends do look, to come down with her bright eyes and all her little panoply of graces upon an old fellow like me, and expect him to like a fashion merely because she looks well in it, is all sheer nonsense. Why, girls, if you wore rings in <b>your</b> <b>noses,</b> <b>and</b> bangles on <b>your</b> arms up to your elbows, if you tied your hair in a war-knot {{on the top of}} your heads like the Sioux Indians, you would still look pretty. The {{question}} isn't, as I view it, whether you look pretty,--for that you do, and that you will, do what you please and dress how you will. The question is whether you might not look prettier, whether another style of dress, and another mode of getting up, would not be far more becoming. I am one who thinks that it would." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bootsy's {{second album}} is widely {{considered}} his best: the Motherpage gives it five-star ratings. Similar to most of Bootsy's other work, it is divided between dance tracks and slow jams. The song [...] "The Pinocchio Theory" [...] inspired the George Clinton creation Sir Nose D'voidoffunk (see P-Funk mythology: the song says if you fake the funk, <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> will grow, <b>and</b> Sir <b>Nose</b> fakes the funk).|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{much money}} has he promised you, Briggs?" [...] the old {{spinster}} cried out, working {{herself into a}} nervous rage--"there now, of course you begin to cry. I hate scenes. Why am I always to be worried? Go and cry up in your own room, and send Firkin to me--no, stop, sit down and blow <b>your</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> leave off crying, and {{write a letter to}} Captain Crawley." [...] Poor Briggs went and placed herself obediently at the writing-book. Its leaves were blotted all over with relics of the firm, strong, rapid handwriting of the spinster's late amanuensis, Mrs. Bute Crawley.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{epidemics}} of the cholera you {{are carried}} to be burned almost before you are dead. When {{you come to}} the riverside the cold air, perhaps, makes you alive, and then, if you are only little alive, mud is put on <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> mouth and you die conclusively. If you are rather more alive, more mud is put; but if you are too lively they let you go and take you away. I was too lively, and made protestation with anger against the indignities that they endeavored to press upon me. In those days I was Brahmin and proud man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} hear {{anything}} like that? And he was so patient about it. It made me quite sorry for him. But he is exasperating, too, sometimes. Of course one would not do anything to vex him {{even if it were}} worth while. But it isn't. He's so jolly innocent that if you were to put your thumb to <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> wave your fingers at him he would only wonder gravely to himself what got into you. He told me once quite simply that he found it very difficult to make out what made people always act so queerly. He's too dense to trouble about, and that's the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{composition}} {{has three}} morals, my friends." [...] Somebody groaned, but no notice was {{taken of the}} insult. [...] "First, is keep your faces clean second, get up early third, when the ether sponge is put over <b>your</b> <b>nose,</b> breathe hard <b>and</b> don't kick, and your teeth will come out easy. I have no more to say." [...] And Miss Nan sat down amid tumultuous applause.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was thinkin'," [...] said Uncle Beamish, [...] "that {{it might}} be a good idee, when we get to Crocker's place, to stop a little, and let you warm <b>your</b> fingers <b>and</b> <b>nose.</b> Crocker's is ruther more than half-way to the pike." ...|$|R

But personally I have every proof, for it is all written down in the Bible at which you turn tip <b>your</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> I am very glad that I have been lucky enough to come across this unexpected confirmation of the story.

I've no intention of being homesick, I can tell you. Town's too jolly after that poky old Avonlea. I wonder how I ever existed there so long. You shouldn't cry, Anne; it isn't becoming, for <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> eyes get red, and then you seem ALL red. I'd a perfectly scrumptious time in the Academy today. Our French professor is simply a duck. His moustache would give you kerwollowps of the heart. Have you anything eatable around, Anne? I'm literally starving. Ah, I guessed likely Marilla'd load you up with cake. That's why I called round. Otherwise I'd {{have gone to the}} park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley. He boards same place as I do, and he's a sport. He noticed you in class today, and asked me who the red-headed girl was. I told him you were an orphan that the Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what you'd been before that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your literature," [...] {{continued}} Zenobia, apparently {{delighted with}} her description, [...] "will be the 'Farmer's Almanac;' for I observe our friend Foster never gets {{so far as}} the newspaper. When you happen to sit down, at odd moments, you will fall asleep, and make nasal proclamation of the fact, as he does; and invariably you must be jogged out of a nap, after supper, by the future Mrs. Coverdale, and persuaded to go regularly to bed. And on Sundays, when you put on a blue coat with brass buttons, you will think of nothing else to do but to go and lounge over the stone walls and rail fences, and stare at the corn growing. And you will look with a knowing eye at oxen, and will have a tendency to clamber over into pigsties, and feel of the hogs, and give a guess how much they will weigh after you shall have stuck and dressed them. Already I have noticed you begin to speak through <b>your</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> with a drawl. Pray, if you really did make any poetry to-day, let us hear it in that kind of utterance!" ...|$|E
