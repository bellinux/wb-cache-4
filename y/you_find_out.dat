500|$|The {{music video}} {{was greeted with}} {{widespread}} critical acclaim. Music journalist Mark Pytlik wrote the visual [...] "marked an unquestionable creative apex for Björk's visual work, a perfect synthesis of form and content". IGN gave the video a score of 9/10, writing it is an [...] "utterly gorgeous sight to behold" [...] and [...] "just about perfect". Times Craig Duff called it a milestone in computer animation and stated that [...] "no robot had expressed the sensuality that director Chris Cunningham imbues in a Björk-bot in the video". MusicRadar considered the music video to be [...] "one of the most visually striking promos of Björk's career." [...] NME also praised the [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] clip as one of Björk's best, and particularly commended the wide angle shot of the cyborgs kissing as the chorus kicks in. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine dubbed it [...] "the perfect pre-millennial precursor to our current gadget-assisted culture of self-love" [...] and also wrote, [...] "When it was released, I thought it looked cool and {{stressed the importance of}} loving yourself. Now I think it's a terrifying and sealed-off nightmare wherein <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that you are the only person who will ever love you."

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "White Horse" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because she understood the direction Swift wanted to take {{and how to make}} the video different than the prior ones they filmed. The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for [...] "Picture to Burn", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was not the person who someone was unfaithful to, but rather the one who someone was unfaithful with: [...] "This girl falls in love with this guy and he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] <b>You</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without even knowing it." [...] Swift chose actor Stephen Colletti to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series , where she acknowledged him to be [...] "cute", and later on One Tree Hill, where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character. Swift chose Colletti primarily because of his sweet and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. [...] "That's always the hardest thing, when someone has you fooled so much that you think they're never gonna hurt you. And then they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.|$|E

2500|$|Due to Forester's {{investing}} {{style of}} buying low P/E stocks with good earnings prospects, he {{is compared to}} Warren Buffett. Forester loosely quotes Buffett at times such as in Barron's Magazine when he said: [...] "It's When The Tide Goes out that <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> who's swimming without a bathing suit. I have mine on." [...] Although he is now likened to Buffett, Forester maintains Templeton as his role model. [...] He invests by the philosophy credo that [...] "I buy undervalued stocks, {{and if there are}} none, I go to cash." ...|$|E

Everybody knew there would be no pretty passes at the ball and deft deflections from Eric. They knew that if he could only survive two balls they would see something in batting unknown to any textbook.” Bateman added, “when it was time to get his pads on, Eric would prop his bat up in the Edgbaston dressing room window and say to it: ‘Now while I’m getting ready, <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> what the ball’s doing’”.|$|E
