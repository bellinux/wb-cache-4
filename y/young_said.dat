25|$|The M7B was a one-off {{conversion}} of an M7A chassis with the fuel stored low and centrally in integral tanks {{at the sides}} of the cockpit. This was another result of Bruce McLaren's theory about improving the car's handling by altering the fuel weight distribution. Author and former McLaren secretary Eoin <b>Young</b> <b>said</b> that another purpose of the outboard tanks was to make room for a four-wheel-drive system.|$|E
500|$|The week {{following}} the Texas Tech game Vince <b>Young</b> <b>said</b> he still planned {{to return for}} his senior season in 2006. Young, {{a candidate for the}} Heisman trophy, also apologized for striking the [...] "Heisman pose" [...] during the win over Texas Tech; this had been viewed as an immodest indiscretion.|$|E
500|$|Some Hammond organs have {{an audible}} pop or click when a key is pressed. Originally, key click was {{considered}} a design defect and Hammond worked to eliminate or at least reduce it with equalization filters. However, many performers liked the percussive effect, {{and it has been}} accepted as part of the classic sound. Hammond research and development engineer Alan <b>Young</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "the professionals who were playing popular music [...] that the attack was so prominent. And they objected when it was eliminated." ...|$|E

500|$|The team {{reported}} that [...] "the highest levels" [...] of Nintendo of America knew about their project, {{though they did}} not intervene. <b>Young</b> <b>said</b> that their localization team transparently stated that they would curb the project if the company were to make an announcement {{about the future of}} the game. Though the team acknowledged that the legality of the localization was unclear, <b>Young</b> <b>said</b> that it would not be reasonable to call the fan translation [...] "impetuous or unfair". The team added that they were against software piracy. They directed others to import the game from Japan (or otherwise purchase official merchandise when the game began to go out-of-print), with the ultimate aim to help the franchise. Tomato received encouragement from a Square Enix employee who anticipated the translation. At the end of the project, the team felt that the fan translation would lead to more protection against fan translations rather than more encouragement, so as to maximize the underserved audience. Tomato said that he was unable to appreciate his work since it was so familiar to him, with every original and translated line memorized. He expected that would change in five years. The project left Tomato with a greater respect for the craft of writing.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, St. George Illawarra Dragons coach Nathan Brown {{spoke about}} Hunt and a {{discussion}} {{he had with}} recruitment officer Craig Young a year earlier, when Hunt was still under contract with the Broncos. [...] "He's a terrific player. Craig Young who scouts for us watched him play last year and said give him $80,000 (to lure him to Sydney). I said 'where would we play him?' And he (<b>Young)</b> <b>said</b> 'wing, fullback, centre, five eighth, lock – doesn't matter because he'll play first grade and play for Australia for the next 12 years'." ...|$|E
500|$|Young {{primarily}} plays as a left-footed centre {{back and}} is also able to play at left back. While at Altrincham, he was also deployed as an auxiliary striker. While being a [...] "classy centre-half", he is an [...] "aggressive player who likes to win the ball" [...] and his play {{has been described as}} [...] "shackling". On his goalscoring record, <b>Young</b> <b>said</b> [...] "It's something I have worked on in my own game during the last couple of years. I made a point of improving my scoring record and I've done that slightly" [...] in 2010.|$|E

500|$|Guy Hamilton {{was invited}} to direct, but {{considered}} himself worn out and [...] "creatively drained" [...] after the production of Goldfinger. Terence Young, director {{of the first two}} Bond films, returned to the series. Coincidentally, when Saltzman invited him to direct Dr. No, Young expressed interest in directing adaptations of Dr. No, From Russia with Love and Thunderball. Years later, <b>Young</b> <b>said</b> Thunderball was filmed [...] "at the right time", considering that if it was the first film in the series, the low budget (Dr. No cost only $1 million) would not have yielded good results. Thunderball was the final James Bond film directed by Young.|$|E
500|$|Hodgson's lawyer, Julian <b>Young,</b> <b>said</b> {{the confessions}} had been vital {{information}} {{which could have}} freed his client much earlier, and he was shocked police had not acted on it or passed it on. [...] "If it is true these confessions were not followed up by police or passed on to Mr Hodgson's legal team then, or to me {{as part of the}} appeal, it is surprising and very disappointing. This may raise serious questions about {{the way in which the}} police operated and their failure or unwillingness to disclose evidence. I did not know seven people made admissions. It would have been highly relevant evidence." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1872 with a {{group of}} other Chronicle {{newspaper}} staffers, O'Connell helped form the Bohemian Club. At first, the group rented a modest room as their clubhouse, and spent many evenings enjoying food, drink, music and the literary arts. Chronicle publisher M. H. de Young later wrote that the Bohemian membership of some of his employees was [...] "not an unmixed blessing" [...] because the [...] "boys would go there sometimes when they should have reported at the office." [...] De <b>Young</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "very often" [...] when O'Connell sat down to a good dinner, [...] "he would forget that he had a pocketful of notes for an important story." ...|$|E

500|$|Producer Glen Schofield {{stated the}} biggest {{challenge}} the developers were facing was [...] "just trying to match the breathtaking {{look and feel of}} the movies". Similarly, Neil <b>Young</b> <b>said</b> [...] "We wanted to make something that's authentic and true to the movie. The people on our team really care about making a game that aspires to more than just a sequel, they want to make this equivalent to the movie experience itself." [...] EA Redwood Shores worked closely with New Line Cinema to make the games as authentic as possible, using the actual reference photos, drawings, models, props, lighting studies and motion capture data. EA's partner relations director, Nina Dobner said ...|$|E
500|$|William {{has been}} {{described}} as having a [...] "special responsibility for ports, customs, and the navy" [...] by the historian Robert Bartlett. He is usually given the title of [...] "keeper of ports" [...] or [...] "keeper of galleys", which Ralph Turner equates with being First Lord of the Admiralty in later history. Sometimes this would be given as [...] "custos portum maris" [...] in Latin, or [...] "keeper of the seaports". At other times he was titled [...] "keeper of the king's ships". Bartlett also called William [...] "one of the king's most important administrators". Charles <b>Young</b> <b>said</b> that William's service to King John was a [...] "distinguished administrative career", and J. E. A. Joliffe called William one of the [...] "greatest of the king's clerks".|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{had five}} {{selections}} {{in the first}} two rounds of the 1986 NFL Draft, as opposed to the normal two, and 14 selections in the 12-round draft overall. Of the draft Giants' General Manager George <b>Young</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "This is not a blue-chip draft, but a strong blue-collar draft. A lot of people think there's better quantity than quality." [...] With their first selection they chose defensive end Eric Dorsey #19 overall from the University of Notre Dame. With their four second-round selections they chose Mark Collins, cornerback out of Cal State-Fullerton, Erik Howard, nose tackle out of Washington State University, Pepper Johnson, linebacker out of Ohio State University, and Greg Lasker, defensive back out of the University of Arkansas.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Time, {{columnist}} Cathy <b>Young</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} unraveling of Erdely's article [...] "exposed the troubling zealotry of advocates for whom believing rape claims is somewhat akin to a matter of religious faith". [...] Christina Hoff Sommers, being interviewed by John Stossel for Reason, commented that the story [...] "proved to {{be a sort of}} gothic fantasy, a male-demonizing fantasy. [...] It was absurd." [...] The Daily Caller published an article with the title of [...] "Here Are EIGHT Campus Rape Hoaxes Eerily Like The UVA Rape Story" [...] with examples that took place at several other schools, such as Princeton University, Oberlin College, and George Washington University. [...] Eric Owens wrote: [...] "In each case, the cruel hoaxes were initially accepted as true. In some cases, real lives were ruined." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Young's {{streak of}} 25 {{consecutive}} road starts without a loss was broken that {{day by the}} Dodgers win. The only other pitcher in major league baseball history had gone as many as 25 straight road starts without losing — Allie Reynolds had a 25-game streak in –. [...] "I was terrible," [...] <b>Young</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I just never found my rhythm and never found my groove. I put the guys in a hole {{early in the game}} and it was just too much to overcome. I can’t imagine, having to go through that, the courage it took, the discipline, and just how successful he was. I mean, he wasn’t just successful integrating the game. He was a great baseball player. He's a Hall of Fame baseball player. He wouldn’t allow himself to fail, and that's tremendous." ...|$|E
500|$|The Latter Day Saints {{were first}} {{organized}} in 1830. [...] Early {{members of the}} Church often encountered hostility, primarily due to their practice of withdrawing from secular society and gathering in locales to practice their distinct religious beliefs. Their neighbors felt threatened by the Church's rapid growth in numbers, its tendency to vote as a bloc and acquire political power, its claims of divine favor, and, later, the practice of polygamy. Violence directed against the Church and its members caused {{the body of the}} Church to move from Ohio to Missouri, then to Illinois. Despite the frequent moves, Church members were unable to escape opposition, which culminated in the extermination order against all Mormons living in the state by Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs in 1838 and the death of their leader Joseph Smith in 1844. Brigham <b>Young</b> <b>said</b> that he had received divine direction to organize the church members and head beyond the western frontier of the United States.|$|E
