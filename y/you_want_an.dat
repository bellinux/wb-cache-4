500|$|In {{selecting}} which {{single to}} release first, Usher and the label considered various marketing strategies. With many potential lead singles that could fare well in music markets, they were choosing between [...] "Yeah!" [...] and [...] "Burn". Even though [...] "Burn" [...] {{was just what}} the label was looking for, they believed that [...] "Yeah!" [...] would be a blockbuster. Meanwhile, they felt [...] "Burn" [...] also failed to meet their expectations: [...] "'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of them things where people said, 'It's strong, but can we make history with that?' At {{the end of the}} day, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>an</b> event." ...|$|E

If you want overall continuity, you got it. If you want people with super powers going crazy, it's there. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>an</b> ensemble cast that brings the broadcast television corner of the MCU to life, then look no further. The point is, with the new season of S.H.I.E.L.D., it's everything one could ask from the show." [...] Vulture's Scott Meslow stated that the premiere was [...] "riddled with [...] visual signifiers, highlighting the ways Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has gradually become sharper, sleeker, and more reliant on the bones of its comic-book source material." ...|$|E

She wore a red catsuit and long black trenchcoat for the performance. The Sun said [...] "Scherzinger stole the show last night" [...] with her display of [...] "live vocals". The judges gave the performance a standing ovation. On The Xtra Factor following the live performances, Louis Walsh and Simon Cowell praised Scherzinger's performance, respectively calling it [...] "one of the best live guest performances we've ever had" [...] and [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>an</b> example of {{how you do it}} right... its Nicole. It was focus, performance, vocals...". The Daily Mail followed suit, saying [...] "Scherzinger put on a spectacle for her first live performance, complete with pyrotechnic lighting, full-size cage and a stage full of scantily-clad dancers... The former guest judge brought the house down with her energetic routine". Elena Gorgan of Softpedia agreed to say that Scherzinger wowed the [...] "explosive" [...] performance, earning her a standing ovation from the judges and audience. The following day, she reprised the performance on ITV's breakfast show, Daybreak before heading to London's Westfield Shopping Centre where she appeared on live screens to promote sports brand Reebok. She stayed in the UK until December 5, 2010, promoting the single.|$|E

500|$|Though [...] "Yeah!" [...] was now completed, {{the label}} still had [...] "Burn" [...] on queue {{for the lead}} single. Usher's friend and former A rep Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather commented: [...] "'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of them things where people said, 'It's strong, but can we make history with that?' At {{the end of the}} day, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>an</b> event." [...] Usher was unsure if [...] "Yeah!" [...] was the right choice. After Lil Jon leaked [...] "Yeah!" [...] to street DJs across the United States, Usher opted [...] "Burn" [...] as the lead single of the album and was already {{planning}} for its music video. The song was not intended to be a proper single and only a teaser for Usher's fans after waiting for years. However, the responses of [...] "Yeah!" [...] were overwhelmingly favorable, and [...] "Yeah!" [...] was released as the first single instead of [...] "Burn", which became the second single from the album. The single was released in the United States on January 27, 2004 as a CD single and 12" [...] single. LaFace Records sent [...] "Yeah!" [...] to US contemporary hit radio on February 7, 2004. In the United Kingdom, it was released as a CD single, containing the album and instrumental version of the song, and two unreleased tracks from the album, [...] "Red Light" [...] and [...] "Sweet Lies".|$|E
500|$|The company {{contemplated}} {{purchasing the}} Argonauts of the CFL at least twice, with minority partner Tanenbaum keen {{to add the}} team to his list of franchises, but concluded that the cost and effort {{that would be required}} to make the team profitable was not worth the minimal financial upside. [...] In 2013, it was reported that the company was again considering purchasing the team and having them play at a renovated BMO Field, with the asking price reportedly $20 million, but later coming down to $10 million. [...] A vote by MLSE's board on purchasing the team was called in December 2013, but they were unable to come to an agreement on the issue. [...] On May 20, 2015 it was announced that two of the three ownership partners of MLSE, Bell Canada and Tanenbaum's Kilmer Group, had acquired ownership of the Argos, with the deal to close {{at the end of the}} year, and would move the team to BMO Field for the 2016 season. It has been speculated that Rogers was not interested in investing in the team since Bell has exclusive rights to broadcast all CFL games. It is thought that control of the Argos by MLSE will enhance Toronto's chances of acquiring an NFL franchise, with Peddie saying [...] "the NFL is telling them that if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>an</b> NFL team, you better make sure the Argos are okay." [...] Leiweke has said that moving into a renovated BMO field [...] "will help turn [...] around" [...] and that [...] "there's no way the NFL comes here without the CFL being unbelievably successful first." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rogers was {{personally}} {{criticized for being}} overly aggressive by Commander David Carlson, commanding officer of the USS Sides, a second ship that was under the tactical control of Rogers {{at the time of}} the incident. Carlson claimed that the downing of Iran Air 655 marked the [...] "horrifying climax to Capt. Rogers' aggressiveness, first seen four weeks ago". He was referring to incidents on June 2, 1988, when he claimed that Rogers brought the Vincennes too close to an Iranian frigate that was searching a bulk carrier, that he launched a helicopter too close to Iranian small boats, and that he fired upon a number of small Iranian military boats instead of directing another, smaller warship to do so. In disagreeing with Rogers' decision – citing the high cost of the cruiser relative to that of the frigates attached to the group – Carlson posited, [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>an</b> AEGIS cruiser out there shooting up boats?

His comment referred to incidents on 2 June, when Rogers had sailed Vincennes too close to an Iranian frigate undertaking a lawful search of a bulk carrier, launched a helicopter within [...] of an Iranian small craft despite rules of engagement requiring a four-mile (6.4km) separation, and opened fire on small Iranian military boats. Of those incidents, Carlson commented, [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>an</b> Aegis cruiser out there shooting up boats? It wasn't a smart thing to do." [...] He also said that Iranian forces he had encountered in the area a month prior to the incident were [...] "pointedly non-threatening" [...] and professional.

I went through the drill again. F-14. He's climbing. By now this damn thing is at 7,000 feet." [...] Carlson thought Vincennes might have more information, and was unaware that Rogers had been wrongly informed that the plane was diving. Carlson is also reported to have written in the U.S. Naval Proceedings that he had [...] "wondered aloud in disbelief" [...] on hearing of Vincenness intentions, speculating that the ship, known as [...] "Robo Cruiser" [...] for its aggressiveness, [...] "felt a need to prove the viability of Aegis in the Persian Gulf, and that they hankered for the opportunity to show their stuff." ...|$|E
2500|$|... ll New-York {{moves on}} the first of May; not only moves about, as usual, in the {{everlasting}} hurry-scurry of business, but one house empties itself into another, all over the city. The streets are full of loaded drays, on which tables are dancing, and carpets rolling to and fro. Small chairs, which bring up such pretty, cozy images of rolly-pooly mannikens and maidens, eating supper from tilted porringers, and spilling the milk on their night-gowns – these go ricketting along on the tops of beds and bureaus, and not unfrequently pitch into the street, and so fall asunder. Children are driving hither and yon, one with a flower-pot in his hand, another with work-box, band-box, or oil-canakin; each so intent upon his important mission, that all the world seems to him (as it does to many a theologican,) safely locked up within the little walls he carries. Luckily, both boy and bigot are mistaken, or mankind would be in a bad box, sure enough. The dogs seem bewildered with this universal transmigration of bodies; and as for the cats, they sit on the door-steps, mewing piteously, that they were not born in the middle ages, or at least in the quiet old portion of the world. And I, who have almost as strong a love of localities as poor puss, turn away from the windows, with a suppressed anathema on the nineteenth century, with its perpetual changes. Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>an</b> appropriate emblem of this country, and this age? Then stand on the side-walks of New-York, and watch the universal transit {{on the first}} of May ... However, human being are such creatures of habit and imitation, that what is necessity soon becomes fashion, and each one wishes to do what everyone else is doing. A lady in the neighbourhood closed all her binds and shutters, on May-day; being asked by her acquaintance whether she had been in the country, she answered, [...] "I was ashamed not to be moving {{on the first of}} May; and so I shut up the house that the neighbours might not know it." [...] One could not well imagine a fact more characteristic of the despotic sway of custom and public opinion, in the United States, and the nineteenth century.|$|E
