25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E
500|$|After a year, {{the coach}} was so {{impressed}} with Nowitzki's progress that he advised him: [...] "You must now decide whether <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> against {{the best in the world}} or just stay a local hero in Germany. If you choose the latter, we will stop training immediately, because nobody can prevent that anymore. But if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> against the best, we have to train on a daily basis." [...] After pondering this lifetime decision for two days, Nowitzki agreed to enter the full-time training schedule, choosing the path to his eventual international career. Geschwindner let him train seven days a week with DJK Würzburg players and future German internationals Robert Garrett, Marvin Willoughby, and Demond Greene, and in the summer of 1994, then 16-year-old Nowitzki made the DJK squad.|$|E

500|$|Based on six reviews,Truth Serum {{received}} an average score of 3.2/5.0 on website Kritiker, which assigns a normalised rating out of 5.0 to reviews from mainstream critics across Sweden. Camila Astorga Díaz of the Swedish edition of Gaffa wrote that Truth Serum [...] "fulfils {{its role as}} background music while traveling", but considered that it lacks [...] "that one thing that makes <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> repeat". Peter Carlsson of Allehanda called it a strong debut but stated {{that it did not}} help Lo to stand out from other pop artists. Svenska Dagbladets Sara-Märta Höglund compared the EP to Katy Perry's Prism (2013) and stated that, [...] "though Lo knows how to make a hit, I have wished she had ventured out on a more stripped-down production and dropped the tiresome drug romanticism".|$|E
500|$|U2 {{found that}} they were neither {{prepared}} nor well-rehearsed, and that their ideas were not evolving into completed songs. The group were unable to reach consensus during their disagreements and {{felt that they were}} not making progress. Bono and Lanois, in particular, had an argument that almost came to blows during the writing of [...] "Mysterious Ways". During one tense session, Clayton removed his bass guitar and held it out to Bono, saying, [...] "You tell me what to play and I'll play it. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it yourself? Go ahead." [...] With a sense of going nowhere, the band considered breaking up. Eno visited for a few days, and understanding their attempts to deconstruct the band, he assured them that their progress was better than they thought. By adding unusual effects and sounds, he showed that the Edge's pursuit for new sonic territory was not incompatible with Mullen's and Lanois' [...] "desire to hold on to solid song structures". Ultimately, a breakthrough was achieved with the writing of the song [...] "One". While working on [...] "Sick Puppy"—an early version of [...] "Mysterious Ways"—The Edge played two separate chord progressions sequentially on guitar at Lanois' encouragement, and finding inspiration, the group quickly improvised a new song that became [...] "One". It provided reassurance and validated their long-standing [...] "blank page approach" [...] to writing and recording together.|$|E
500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> comedy {{then you have to}} be very intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Game Informer {{also found}} the game's visuals to be [...] "sharp and colorful", the {{magazine}} also felt that Empire of Dreams didn't take enough advantage of the system by providing [...] "pseudo-3D" [...] background graphics that had become the series hallmark, summarizing that [...] "The end result is a fun game, but doesn't hit the mark as well as previous efforts." [...] GamePro {{called attention to the}} [...] "Bright, kaleidoscopic levels", declaring that the [...] "graphics and sounds are as sharp as those of any other GBA game", ultimately calling Empire of Dreams [...] "a straightforward platformer with enough gameplay variety that will make <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> to the very end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like {{his brother}} had done when his playing days {{had come to a}} {{premature}} close, Alick took to coaching and umpiring, at which Charles was definitely more controversial and erratic. Alick, meanwhile, was a big traditionalist throughout his days when it came to etiquette and the like, and he took his cricket very seriously. On one occasion, a colleague of his was belting out a catchy number on the field. Alick, unable to endure it any longer, went over to him and read the riot act: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> cricket, play it; if you want to sing, go and sing; but, for Heaven's sake, don't sing comic songs in the slips!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{addition}} of Aukerman and {{the consumption of}} large amounts of coffee led the band to write shorter, faster and more aggressive songs in a hardcore punk style. Stevenson attributed the change partly to the band's invention of the [...] "Bonus Cup": [...] "We took ⅓ of a cup of instant coffee grounds, added some hot water, threw in about 5 spoonfuls of sugar, and proceeded to play 10 second songs. The Bonus Cup {{became a part of}} everyday Descendents life". [...] "Caffeine makes you hyper", said Lombardo, [...] "In general, it makes <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> faster." [...] Aukerman later recalled: [...] "We started drinking too much coffee; 'cause of that and the {{addition of}} me, the music became very quick and all about bursts of energy. It's interesting: we started very melodic, then moved to hardcore, but melded the two at a certain point and became melodic hardcore".|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked on}} Good Game: Spawn Point about their {{credibility}} in reviewing games when they're [...] "both {{too old to}} understand games from a spawnlings perspective", Bajo and Hex responded: [...] "We may not be quite as young as some of you spawnlings [...] but all those years have been spent playing games, giving {{us a lot of}} the experience and expertise required for the kind of thorough games criticism we provide." [...] When asked if they are pro gamers, Bajo and Hex explained that in truth they aren't, as [...] "a pro gamer is someone who plays games professionally at the highest competitive levels in tournaments... so we don't really fit that description, and pro gamers around the world would scoff if we ever said we were [...] "pro"." [...] They added that their job as game critics is not to be {{the best of the best}} at any one particular game, but to [...] "be ok at all types of games so we can review and compare them to help you decide if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> them." [...] They said they review bad games along with good games as they can't know what quality the game will be until they've actually played it, and also if all the reviewed games were given highly positive reviews, they reviews would be redundant and their rating system meaningless. Also, as games are expensive, the team want to warn viewers about what games they should avoid. They have also stated they make an effort to review games on all consoles.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{sessions}} the band explored new and alternative arrangements to a number of their songs, both old and new, with some involving full band arrangements and others solely focusing on frontman Jesse Lacey. The band had not entered the studio with the intention to record alternate versions, but after setting up in the fairly confined studio, [...] "there wasn’t really a feeling in the room that <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> loudly," [...] Accardi commented in an interview. Kevin Devine joined the band {{on the second day of}} recording for an alternate rendition of [...] "Jesus", which Devine had previously covered at his solo shows and with Lacey. The recording would later be included as a b-side to the [...] "At the Bottom" [...] single, released on August 11, 2009.|$|R

5000|$|In the game, four-inch-diameter hollow {{spheres of}} ice were fired toward the shooter {{from one of}} five ports (arranged as #5 is on dice) from a {{distance}} of 75 feet. There was an electronic control panel on each shooting lane. It was a black box with multiple colored buttons. The opposing team or person would select which of the five ports that the ice targets would launch from, a time delay, the ice targets trajectory and the speed up to 30 miles per hour. If <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> alone <b>you</b> could set the control panel to [...] "automatic random" [...] launch. The control panel also gave the players automatic scoring based upon a combination of target breaks and elapsed time between launch and hit. When the player fired the gun a number from 1 to 10 was presented by the scoring machine. The number depended on how quickly the player fired, higher numbers for quicker reactions. If the player hit the sphere, he/she scored the number presented by the scoring machine. Wingo gave out award pins for high game and other achievements.|$|R
