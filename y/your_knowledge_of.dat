25|$|Through Cambridge and Bloomsbury, Young had {{a longstanding}} {{friendship}} with E.M. Forster. Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} A Passage to India, the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s before me now, and sometimes I work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have done more than any individual I know to help me by direct remarks. <b>Your</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the business of creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{researchers}} believe the hippocampus is only involved in episodic memory and spatial cognition. This then {{raises the question}} where semantic memory may be located. Some believe semantic memory lives in temporal neocortex. Others believe that semantic knowledge is widely distributed across all brain areas. To illustrate this latter view, consider <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> dogs. Researchers holding the 'distributed semantic knowledge' view believe that <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the sound a dog makes exists in your auditory cortex, whilst your ability to recognize and imagine the visual features of a dog resides in your visual cortex. Recent evidence supports {{the idea that the}} temporal pole bilaterally is the convergence zone for unimodal semantic representations into a multimodal representation. [...] These regions are particularly vulnerable to damage in semantic dementia, which is characterised by a global semantic deficit.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "This Is It" [...] song's fame is {{such that}} it has been used {{elsewhere}} such as in the Canadian province of Ontario where it was used in a TV commercial promoting the various performing arts tourist attractions where artists of various disciplines sing separate lines of the song. [...] In [...] "The Opera," [...] an episode from the fourth season of the US sitcom Seinfeld, Jerry sings [...] "This Is It" [...] to Elaine while both characters are waiting outside the theater, causing Elaine to exclaim, [...] "You know it is so sad, all <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> high culture comes from Bugs Bunny cartoons." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just as Tyler is {{difficult}} to categorize as a novelist, it is also challenging to label her style. Novelist Cathleen Schine describes how her “style without a style” manages to pull the reader into the story: “So rigorous and artful is the style without a style, so measured and delicate is each observation, so complex is the structure and so astute and open the language, that the reader can relax, feel secure in the narrative and experience the work as something real and natural -- even inevitable.” [...] The San Francisco Chronicle made a similar point: “One does not so much read a Tyler novel as visit it. Her ability to conduct several conversations at once while getting the food to the table turns the act of reading {{into a kind of}} transport.” [...] Reviewer Tom Shone put it this way: “You’re involved before you ever notice you were paying attention.” Joyce Carol Oates, in her review of The Amateur Marriage, perhaps described the phenomenon best: “When the realistic novel works its magic, you won’t simply have read about the experiences of ﬁctitious characters, you will have seemed to have lived them; <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> their lives transcends their own, for they can only live in chronological time. The experience of reading such ﬁction when it’s carefully composed can be breathtaking, like being given the magical power of reliving passages of our own lives, indecipherable at the time of being lived.” ...|$|E
