500|$|Inspired by {{material}} {{the group}} composed while performing around Europe, Wish You Were Here was recorded during numerous recording sessions at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Two of the album's four songs criticise the music business, another expresses alienation and the multi-part track [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond" [...] {{is a tribute}} to Syd Barrett. Barrett's mental breakdown had forced him to leave the group seven years earlier, prior to the release of the group's second studio album A Saucerful of Secrets (on which he only appeared on three tracks). It was lead writer Roger Waters' idea to split [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond" [...] into two parts that would bookend the album around three new compositions and to introduce a concept linking them all. As with their previous album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), the band used studio effects and synthesizers, and brought in guest singers to supply vocals on some tracks of the album. These singers were Roy Harper, who provided the lead vocals on [...] "Have a Cigar", and the Blackberries, who added backing vocals to [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond".|$|E

[...] "Venters, I could hev dropped when I seen them hosses. But thet sight ain't a marker to the looks of you. What's wrong? Hev <b>you</b> gone <b>crazy?</b> <b>You</b> must be <b>crazy</b> to ride in here this way--with them hosses--talkie' thet way about Tull en' Jerry Card." ...|$|R
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{had twice}} been interrupted by US tours (one in April {{and the other}} in June 1975), and the final sessions, which occurred after the band's performance at Knebworth, proved particularly troublesome for Waters. [...] He struggled to record the vocals for [...] "Have a Cigar", requiring several takes to perform an acceptable version. [...] His problems stemmed in part from the stresses placed upon his voice while recording the lead vocals of [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond". [...] Gilmour was asked to sing in his place, but declined, and eventually colleague and friend Roy Harper was asked to stand in. [...] Harper was recording his own album in another of Abbey Road's studios, and Gilmour had already performed some guitar licks for him. [...] Waters later regretted the decision, believing he should have performed the song. The Blackberries recorded backing vocals for [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond".|$|E
500|$|Barrett's {{innovative}} guitar {{work and}} exploration of experimental {{techniques such as}} dissonance, distortion and feedback influenced many musicians. His recordings are also noted for their strongly English-accented vocal delivery. After leaving the music industry, Barrett continued with painting and dedicated himself to gardening. Pink Floyd wrote and recorded several tributes to him, most notably the 1975 album Wish You Were Here, which included [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond", as homage to Barrett.|$|E
500|$|After several weeks, Waters {{began to}} visualise another concept. [...] The three new {{compositions}} from 1974's tour {{were at least}} {{a starting point for}} a new album, and [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond" [...] seemed a reasonable choice as a centrepiece for the new work. [...] Mostly an instrumental twenty-minute-plus piece similar to [...] "Echoes", the opening four-note guitar phrase reminded Waters of the lingering ghost of former band-member Syd Barrett. [...] Gilmour had composed the phrase entirely by accident, but was encouraged by Waters' positive response. [...] Waters wanted to split [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond", and sandwich two new songs between its two halves. [...] Gilmour disagreed, but was outvoted three to one. [...] "Welcome to the Machine" [...] and [...] "Have a Cigar" [...] were barely veiled attacks on the music business, their lyrics working neatly with [...] "Shine On" [...] to provide an apt summary of {{the rise and fall of}} Barrett; [...] "Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt... that sort of indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd." [...] "Raving and Drooling" [...] and [...] "You Gotta Be Crazy" [...] had no place in the new concept, and were set aside until the following album, 1977's Animals.|$|E

500|$|Barrett's decline had a {{profound}} effect on Roger Waters' songwriting, and the theme of mental illness permeated Pink Floyd's later albums, particularly 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon and 1975's Wish You Were Here which was a deliberate and affectionate tribute to Barrett, the song, [...] "Shine on <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond", and also 1979's The Wall. [...] "Wish You Were Here", partly about Barrett, borrows imagery of a [...] "steel rail" [...] from Barrett's solo song, [...] "If It's in You," [...] from The Madcap Laughs album.|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} [...] "Octavarium" [...] {{is the longest}} track on the album, at 24:00. Petrucci stated that the band wanted to write an epic song that thematically {{developed}} and would use an orchestra. The band was heavily influenced by the progressive rock sound of Genesis, Yes and Pink Floyd. The instrumental introduction, heavily influenced by Pink Floyd's [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond", was performed by Rudess using a lap steel guitar and Continuum. Additionally, there are many references to other progressive rock songs in the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, Wright {{began using}} synthesizers {{such as the}} VCS 3, ARP String Ensemble and Minimoog, which were {{featured}} on [...] "Shine on <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond". Wright wrote the closing part of the track alone, and included a brief extract of the band's early single [...] "See Emily Play" [...] on the Minimoog towards the end. He used a number of electric pianos during the 1970s, including a Wurlitzer fed through a wah-wah pedal on [...] "Money" [...] and an unaccompanied Rhodes introduction for [...] "Sheep" [...] on Animals.|$|E

500|$|Wish You Were Here is Floyd's {{second album}} with a {{conceptual}} theme written entirely by Roger Waters. [...] It reflects his {{feeling that the}} camaraderie that had served the band was, by then, largely absent. [...] The album begins with a long instrumental preamble and segues into the lyrics for [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond", a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental breakdown had forced {{him to leave the}} group seven years earlier. [...] Barrett is fondly recalled with lines such as [...] "Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun" [...] and [...] "You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon".|$|E
500|$|During 1974, Pink Floyd {{sketched out}} three new compositions, [...] "Raving and Drooling", [...] "You Gotta Be Crazy" [...] and [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond". These songs were {{performed}} during {{a series of}} concerts in France and England, the band's first tour since 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon. As Pink Floyd had never employed a publicist and kept themselves distant from the press, {{their relationship with the}} media began to sour. [...] Following the publication by NME of a negative critique of the band's new material, written by Nick Kent (a devotee of Syd Barrett) and Pete Erskine, the band returned to the studio {{in the first week of}} 1975.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the other}} Romanov children, Tatiana was raised with some austerity.

Their work was given as gifts or sold at charity bazaars. According to one story, Tatiana, accustomed to being addressed only by her name and patronymic, was so disconcerted when she was addressed as [...] "Your Imperial Highness" [...] by lady-in-waiting Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden when she was heading a committee meeting that she kicked the woman under the table and hissed [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>crazy</b> to speak to me like that?" ...|$|E

500|$|Barrett came up {{with the}} album title The Piper at the Gates of Dawn; the album was {{originally}} titled Projection up to as late as July 1967. The title was taken from that of chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows which contains a visionary encounter with the god Pan, who plays his pan pipe at dawn. It was one of Barrett's favourite books, and he often gave friends the impression that he was the embodiment of Pan. The moniker was later used in the song [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond", in which Barrett is called [...] "you Piper". The cover for the album was one of several Pink Floyd album covers used on a series of Royal Mail stamps issued in May 2016 to commemorate 50 years of Pink Floyd.|$|E
500|$|Barrett had one noted {{reunion with}} the members of Pink Floyd, in 1975 during the {{recording}} sessions for Wish You Were Here. He attended the Abbey Road session unannounced, and watched the band working on the final mix of [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond" [...] — a song that happened to be about him. By that time, the 29-year-old Barrett had become quite overweight, had shaved off all of his hair (including his eyebrows), and his former bandmates did not initially recognise him. Barrett's behaviour at the session was erratic; he spent part of the session brushing his teeth. Roger Waters finally managed to ask him what he thought of the song and he simply said that it [...] "sounds a bit old". He briefly attended the reception for Gilmour's wedding to Ginger that immediately followed the recording sessions; however, he left early without exchanging goodbyes with the newlyweds.|$|E
500|$|The idea of reuniting with Nolan and Cooper {{was first}} {{proposed}} in January 2010, when Mark O'Connell suggested Lazzara talk with Nolan on the phone. Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] {{called me and}} was like, 'Hey, man, {{what do you think}} about us going back to our original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are <b>you</b> <b>crazy?</b> I haven't talked to John [...] in, like, seven years. I don't know if he'd want to do it.'" [...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and then I got a call from John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like we had just talked a few days ago". The pair did not discuss creating music initially, instead [...] " [...] reacquainted with what had been going on in our lives. Because for me, I genuinely missed his friendship, and same with Shaun [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli and {{classical}} violinist Yehudi Menuhin were performing in another {{studio in the}} building, and were invited to record a piece for the new album. Menuhin watched as Grappelli played on the song [...] "Wish You Were Here"; however, the band later decided his contribution was unsuitable and, until 2011, {{it was believed that}} the piece had been wiped. It turns out his playing was included on the album, but so low in the final mix that the band presumed it would be insulting to credit him. He was paid £300 for his contribution (equivalent to £ in [...] ). Dick Parry again played saxophone, on [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond". The opening bars of [...] "Wish You Were Here" [...] were recorded from Gilmour's car radio, with somebody turning the dial (the classical music heard is the finale of Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony).|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} scenes from Fit the Third were cut from commercially {{released}} {{recordings of the}} radio series because they featured copyrighted music. For example, in one scene Marvin [...] "hums" [...] like Pink Floyd, using the opening to [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond", then [...] "sings" [...] "Rock and Roll Music" [...] by The Beatles, and finally the theme music from , the opening [...] "Sunrise" [...] movement from Richard Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra. It {{would have been very}} cost prohibitive in the 1980s to get clearances to release a recording of Fit the Third with this music, though agreements were reached on {{most of the rest of}} the copyrighted music used during the first series. As a result, all commercial recordings of Fit the Third are about two minutes shorter than other episodes. Recordings of the original radio broadcasts still contain it.|$|E
500|$|Following Barrett's {{departure}} {{and replacement}} by David Gilmour, Wright took over writing duties with Waters but gradually became less involved {{as a singer}} and songwriter as the band's career progressed. His organ playing remained {{an important part of}} the band's live set, including [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" [...] and [...] "Careful with That Axe, Eugene" [...] and he contributed musical themes for film scores (More, Zabriskie Point and Obscured by Clouds). He made significant contributions to Pink Floyd's long, epic compositions such as [...] "Atom Heart Mother", [...] "Echoes" [...] (on which he harmonised with Gilmour for the lead vocals) and [...] "Shine On <b>You</b> <b>Crazy</b> Diamond". On 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon he composed the music for [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky" [...] and [...] "Us and Them". He also contributed to other album tracks such as [...] "Breathe" [...] and [...] "Time", singing the lead vocals on the latter's chorus.|$|E
