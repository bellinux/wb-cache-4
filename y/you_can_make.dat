The entire band subsequently announced a split but rescinded this decision two months later. Their second album <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Make</b> Sound was released on 9 October 2009 and led to two more Meteor nominations for Delorentos in 2010. In 2012, third album Little Sparks was released with much fanfare and an innovative release and went on to win Ireland's Choice Music Prize. Acoustic album Unbroken Untied, a mix of acoustic versions of tracks across their career and new songs, was released in 2013. The band announced on 31 July 2014 that they had signed a deal with Universal Music to release their new album Night Becomes Light.|$|E

500|$|Several {{songs on}} the album are about the themes of love & relationships. These tracks are based on reality, but {{according}} to Martin, they were written with a fictional twist: [...] "Songs are like fairy tales: they have a beginning and an end and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it all work perfectly.

500|$|Delorentos {{spent much}} of 2008 working on their second album, playing few live shows. By early 2009, they were {{reported}} to be performing with Director as both bands showcased material from their second albums. After the brief split, the second album by Delorentos, <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Make</b> Sound, was released on DeloRecords on Friday 9 October 2009 in Ireland, [...] Reaching number 2 in the Irish Charts. The band released the title track as a free download and the single [...] "Secret" [...] was released on 16 October. They co-presented an edition of The Last Splash with Alison Curtis on Today FM on 20 December. In 2010, they appeared on TG4 music series Ceol Ar An Imeall. They represented Ireland in the Eurosonic Festival in Groningen, Netherlands in January 2010. <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Make</b> Sound was released in the Netherlands in March 2010, and Spain in April 2010.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Hewson, Bono and {{designer}} Rogan Gregory co-founded the EDUN fashion label. It {{was intended to}} help bring about positive change in Africa through a fair trade-based relationship rather than by direct aid. Another aim of the label was to set an ethical example in an industry they felt had long exploited child labour. She said they wanted [...] "to show that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a for-profit business where everybody in the chain is treated well." [...] Hewson had not been particularly interested in fashion prior to this undertaking.|$|E

There's been some lunar transient events reported in the vicinity of Aristarchus." [...] Astronomers in Bochum, West Germany, had observed a bright glow on the lunar surface—the same sort of eerie luminescence that has intrigued Moon watchers for centuries. The report was passed on to Houston and thence to the astronauts. Almost immediately, Michael Collins reported back: [...] "Hey, Houston, I'm looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and there's an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence." ...|$|E
500|$|Launched in {{the wave}} of a western trend in American comic books, [...] the series debuted with an October 1950 cover date as a 52-page, {{bimonthly}} series. [...] It lasted six issues (Oct. 1950 – Aug. 1951). The original cover title was The Kid Cowboys of Boys' Ranch, shortened to Boys' Ranch after two issues; the subhead [...] "Featuring Clay Duncan" [...] remained throughout. [...] Each issue featured a single page pinup {{at the beginning of}} the book along with a two-page centerspread. Each issue rounded off with various text and Western and Native American information pages such as [...] "Boys' Ranch Club News", [...] "How Cowboys Say It", [...] "How To Ride a Horse", and [...] "Now <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Make</b> Your Pair of Western Moccasins".|$|E
500|$|Before {{production}} began, however, Spielberg grew {{reluctant to}} continue with Jaws, in fear of becoming typecast as the [...] "truck and shark director". He wanted to move over to 20th Century Fox's Lucky Lady instead, but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure. Brown helped convince Spielberg {{to stick with the}} project, saying that [...] "after , <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> all the films you want". The film was given an estimated budget of $3.5million and a shooting schedule of 55days. Principal photography was set to begin in May 1974. Universal wanted the shoot to finish by the end of June, when the major studios' contract with the Screen Actors Guild was due to expire, to avoid any disruptions due to a potential strike.|$|E

500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] {{begins with a}} four-chord {{arpeggio}} sequence. It has [...] "catchy" [...] melody phrases during the verses and a synth trumpet {{at the end of}} the first chorus, as well as Armstrong's strings present in the background. It also contains sustained notes on the instrumental sections, a characteristic for the songs on Ray of Light. Doubled acoustic guitar chords give an organic vibe during the beginning of the second verse, following a brief coda. The song also infuses computer blips and techno effect sounds, which Orbit achieved by using a Korg MS-20 analog synthesizer. The producer explained that [...] "here's something about [...] transient peaks that are very spiky. And <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> that machine scream. Its two filters are very severe".|$|E
500|$|The subplot of Homer {{entering}} the childproofing business {{was inspired by}} an instance when a salesman visited Payne and his pregnant wife to see if their home was safe for children. In an interview with Star-News, Payne commented: [...] "You hire this person to come into your home to look for changes <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make.</b> They {{make you feel like}} the most horrible person in the world and that your house is the temple of doom." [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] features a scene based specifically on this instance in which a saleswoman (voiced by cast member Tress MacNeille) selling childproofing items visits Homer and Marge and exaggerates the dangers in their home. NRBQ's song [...] "Always Safety First" [...] is played during a montage in the episode in which Homer is seen improving the safety of the infants of Springfield.|$|E

[...] Unsure of their target, they were {{directed}} to a holding pattern in military-controlled airspace Whiskey 105 off of Long Island to avoid New York area air traffic. At 9:03am, United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower as the fighters were progressing to their holding position. The Northeast Air Defense Sector was not advised of this hijacked aircraft until 9:03.|$|E
