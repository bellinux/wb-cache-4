Shortly thereafter, the girl's siblings heard her scream, [...] "No, don't!" [...] Later, Fred returned downstairs. The girl was found by her siblings writhing in pain, sobbing that her father had raped and sodomised her, at one stage partially strangling her. When Rose returned home, the girl confided in her mother that she had been raped by Fred, although Rose simply replied, [...] "Oh well. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> for it." [...] Over the following weeks, the girl was raped on three further occasions, with Rose personally witnessing one of these rapes before following her distressed and bleeding daughter into the bathroom and asking the child, [...] "Well, what did you expect?" [...] Fred also filmed one of these rapes. Several weeks later, the girl garnered the courage to confide in a close friend what her father had done; this friend would divulge what had happened to her own mother on 4 August. In response, the friend's mother anonymously informed the police.|$|E

6000|$|... "And, John;--I can {{understand}} her feeling now; and, indeed, I thought all through that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> her too soon; {{but the time}} may yet come when she will think better of your wishes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'A great God, Andrew Arnold, and a pure, though His {{followers}} are few in {{the world}} as yet. But do you think that He can save you from Me, as <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> Him to do?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Because <b>you</b> have <b>been</b> so busy {{down there}} at the Yard, I thought that, as <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> so many questions, <b>you</b> <b>was,</b> perhaps, {{interested}} in the matter." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{you ask me}} now. I {{thought when}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> your pupils, 'Will he ask Teigue the Fool? Yes, he will, he will; no, he will not--yes, he will.' But Teigue will say nothing. Teigue will say nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lass, if it {{were for}} me <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> my life I'd swear it yours for always, and I'd be a man," [...] he replied with bitterness; [...] "but not to save my soul would I ask {{anything}} of him." ...|$|E

60|$|FOOL. So {{you ask me}} now. I {{thought when}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> your pupils, I said to myself, if he would ask Teigue the Fool, Teigue could tell him all about it, for Teigue has learned all about it when he has been cutting the nets.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not, Mrs. Hopkins. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> {{me into a}} {{house of}} your own, I would go in and see all the rooms and chat with you for an hour; but I don't suppose I shall ever go into this house again unless things change very much indeed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I won't gainsay it," [...] replied Mr Donnithorne, [...] "now that Rose {{has left}} the room, for I don't much care to bespatter folk with too much praise to their faces.

6000|$|... 'Now don't, Neigh--you are {{too hard}} upon me.

60|$|VALENTINE (politely). Some warm water, please. (She retires: and Valentine {{comes back}} to the cabinet, not at all put out by Crampton's rudeness, and carries on the {{conversation}} whilst he selects a forceps and places it ready to his hand with a gag and a drinking glass.) <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> me what the devil that was to me.
