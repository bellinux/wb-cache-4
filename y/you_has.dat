5|$|I Want You {{consisted}} of Gaye's first recorded studio material since his highly successful and well-received album Let's Get It On (1973). While it marked {{a change in}} musical direction for Gaye, departing from his trademark Motown and doo-wop-influenced sound for funky, light-disco soul, the album maintained and expanded on his previous work's sexual themes. Following a mixed response from critics {{at the time of}} its release, I Want <b>You</b> <b>has</b> earned retrospective recognition from writers and music critics as one of Gaye's most controversial works and influential to such musical styles as disco, quiet storm, R, and neo soul.|$|E

500|$|After {{critical}} re-examination of the album, I Want <b>You</b> <b>has</b> {{been recognized}} by writers and music writers as one of Marvin Gaye's most controversial and influential works and, much like its predecessor Let's Get It On, {{has served as a}} major influence on the quiet storm and contemporary R genres. Its standing has also improved among critics following an expanded edition release of the album on July 29, 2003, which featured extensive liner notes and photography by Ryan Null. Following that release, Allmusic praised Gaye's different direction in music and the eroticism portrayed in Leon Ware's smooth-tempo production and Gaye's intimate lyricism.

[...] Berkeley political scientist David Terr found that moderator George Stephanopoulos directed roughly five percent of his questions to Gravel; in a poll asking who did the best in the debate, Gravel placed seventh among the eight candidates. National opinion polls of contenders for the Democratic nomination continued to show Gravel with one percent or zero percent numbers. By the end of the third-quarter 2007, Gravel had about $17,500 in cash on hand, had collected a total of about $380,000 so far during the 2008 election cycle, and was continuing to run a threadbare campaign with minimal staff.|$|E
500|$|The Drug in Me Is <b>You</b> <b>has</b> been {{described}} as post-hardcore and pop punk. The songs also included synths, pop-choruses, and other sounds. Radke commented on the inclusion of different genres in songs, comparing {{different parts of the}} same song to the sounds of Norma Jean, Underoath, and Katy Perry. Lyrically, according to Radke, some of the songs on the album had tones of being arrogant, comparing the attitude to that commonly found in rap music. This is because Radke has cited Eminem as one of his major influences, so much so that he even included a beat made by Eminem and Dr. Dre during a breakdown on the track [...] "Sink or Swim". In an interview, Radke's experiences were compared to Eminem's, noting that, [...] " [...] is someone who has been knocked down and knocked down, and he’s gotten back up again. Time and time again. And he’s triumphed." [...] While the album itself was written during Radke's time in prison, he does not consider it a [...] "Jailhouse record", though some songs that did not make the album do address a prison theme.|$|E

[...] This was echoed by word for word from author Deborah Paredez on her book on Selena's fandom. Patoski further wrote that the remix version [...] "may have been laced with such exotica as a reggae toastmaster talking over a teeth-rattling bass line", and called it a [...] "electronic mishmash", and a [...] "pan-Caribbean attack that included soca and Hi Life from the Trinidad". Written in the key of G minor, the beat is set in common time and moves at a moderate 91 beats per minute. The remix version on Dreaming of <b>You</b> <b>has</b> a key signature set in C minor and moves at a moderate 90 bpms. The remix employs a piano, güira, tambourine, French horn and drums.
