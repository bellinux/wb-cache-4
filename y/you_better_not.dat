Kennedy on November 22, 1963. In 1991, Stone showed JFK to Congress on Capitol Hill, which helped lead to passage of the Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of 1992. The Assassination Records Review Board (created by Congress to lessen, but not end the secrecy surrounding Kennedy's assassination) discussed the film, including Stone's observation {{at the end of the}} film, about the dangers inherent in government secrecy. Stone published an annotated version of the screenplay, in which he cites references for his claims, shortly after the film's release.I make my films like you're going to die if you miss the next minute. <b>You</b> <b>better</b> <b>not</b> go get popcorn.1994 saw the release of Stone's satire of the modern media, Natural Born Killers.
