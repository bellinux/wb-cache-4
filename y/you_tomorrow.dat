500|$|O'Ree's {{breakthrough}} came {{several years}} after another black player, Herb Carnegie was denied the same opportunity. [...] In 1938–39, playing junior hockey with the Ontario Hockey Association's Toronto Rangers, during a practice Carnegie was pulled aside by his coach and told [...] "See that man sitting in the blues? [...] That's Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. [...] He says he'd take <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow</b> if he could turn you white." [...] Stung by the comments, Carnegie resolved to excel at the game. He was offered a tryout with the Rangers in 1950, then a spot on their lowest minor league team. [...] "They {{told me that if}} I signed with the Rangers and went to New Haven, I would make international headlines. [...] I told them my family couldn't eat headlines. [...] That was probably when the Rangers decided to forget about me." ...|$|E
500|$|The TV {{documentary}} [...] explored {{gay rights}} and homophobia in numerous {{countries in the}} world, including Russia. [...] In it, Fry interviews a lesbian couple who discuss their fears that simply being out to their 16-year-old daughter and her friends could be taken as breaking this law, due to the law's prohibition [...] "on anyone disseminating information about homosexuality to under 18s". [...] The LGBT news magazine The Advocate described the law as criminalising [...] "any positive discussion of LGBT people, identities, or issues in forums that might be accessible to minors. In practice, the law has given police broad license to interpret almost any mention of being LGBT [...] whether uttered, printed, or signified by waving a rainbow flag [...] as just cause to arrest LGBT people." [...] The US State Department in its 2013 report on human rights in Russia noted the clarification from Roskomnadzor (the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications) that the [...] "gay propaganda" [...] prohibited under the law includes materials which [...] "directly or indirectly approve {{of people who are}} in nontraditional sexual relationships." [...] One couple interviewed by Fry said: [...] "Of course we are afraid because we really don't know what's going to happen next in the country. ... You just don't know if they can incarcerate <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow</b> for something or not." [...] Fry also interviewed politician Vitaly Milonov, the original proponent of the law, whose attempts to defend it have been strongly criticised; Milonov responded branding Fry as [...] "sick" [...] for making a suicide attempt while filming the documentary in an interview in which he also compared homosexuality with bestiality.|$|E

[...] When the Cardinals won the 2006 World Series, Joe quoted his father again saying, [...] "For {{the first time since}} , St. Louis has a World Series winner!", {{referencing}} Jack's line when the Cards won in 1982, [...] "And that's a winner! That's a winner! A World Series winner for the Cardinals!". During the 2011 Series, Joe punctuated David Freese's 11th inning walk-off homer for the Cardinals in Game 6 with [...] "We will see you...tomorrow night!", near similar to the 1991 Puckett home run description, a call he said he did to celebrate Jack, but would never repeat the same situation. When the Cardinals won Game 7, he did not quote his father.|$|E
2500|$|The men had {{difficulty}} {{in getting the}} boats ready, so the lieutenant left without them in a small boat, merely taking with him Ensign Waldo Evans, four sailors, and two newspaper reporters, Douglas White and Sol Sheridan. He landed at the harbor of Piti under a flag of truce {{and there he was}} met by Governor Marina and his staff. After formal introduction, Braunersreuther handed the governor this ultimatum from Captain Glass: [...] "Sir: In reply to your communication of this date I have now, in compliance with the orders of my government, to demand the immediate surrender of the defenses of the Island of Guam, with arms of all kinds, all officials and persons in the military service of Spain now in this island. This communication will be handed <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow</b> morning by an officer who is ordered to wait not over one half hour for your reply." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{hamburger}} {{was very}} popular among Americans during {{the postwar period}} following World War I, even in popular culture. An example of this was the prominent appearance of hamburgers in E. C. Segar's Thimble Theatre comic strip, which prominently featured a cartoon character named Popeye the Sailor who ate spinach to sustain his superhuman strength. Popeye's first appearance was as a supporting character on January 17, 1929 alongside many other characters. One of these characters was J. Wellington Wimpy (often shortened to just [...] "Wimpy"), a lover of hamburgers who was both polite and gluttonous. His signature phrase, [...] "I'll gladly pay <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow</b> for a hamburger today", became popular and widely known. During {{the height of his}} popularity in the 1930s, Wimpy introduced the hamburger to the youth of the time as a healthy food. It also resulted {{in the creation of a}} chain of fast food restaurants called Wimpy's in his honor, which sold hamburgers for ten cents. In a similar fashion, the fictional character Jughead Jones, who first appeared in Archie Comics in 1941, was passionate about food generally, and hamburgers specifically.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Unesco Courier, anthropologist and social theorist Mark Anspach (editor of the René Girard issue of Les Cahiers de l'Herne) explains that Aglietta and Orléan (who were very critical of economic rationality) see the classical theory of economics as a myth. According to Anspach, the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the gift economy, as a means to overcome it and achieve a peaceful reciprocity: [...] "Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come steal your yams, you offer them to him today, and it is up to him {{to do the same for}} <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow.</b> Once you have made a gift, he is obliged to make a return gift. Now you have set in motion a positive circularity." [...] Since the gift may be so large as to be humiliating, a second stage of development—"economic rationality"—is required: this liberates the seller and the buyer of any other obligations than to give money. Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice, obligations of vengeance by the gift, and finally the possibly dangerous gift by [...] "economic rationality." [...] This rationality, however, creates new victims, as globalization is increasingly revealing.|$|E
2500|$|Going into Game 6, the Twins trailed {{three games}} to two with each team winning their {{respective}} home games. Puckett gave the Twins an early lead by driving in Chuck Knoblauch with a triple {{in the first}} inning. Puckett then made a leaping catch {{in front of the}} Plexiglass wall in left field to rob Ron Gant of an extra-base hit in the third. The game went into extra innings, and in the first at-bat of the bottom of the 11th, Puckett hit a dramatic game-winning home run on a 2–1 count off of Charlie Leibrandt to send the Series to Game 7. This dramatic game has been widely remembered as the high point in Puckett's career. The images of Puckett rounding the bases, arms raised in triumph (often punctuated by CBS television broadcaster Jack Buck saying [...] "And we'll see <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow</b> night!"), are always included in video highlights of his career. [...] After Game 6, the Twins replaced the blue seat back and bottom where the walk off home run ball was caught with a gold colored set. [...] Both of these sets remain in the Twins' archives. The original home run seat armrests and hardware, as well as the replacement blue seat back and bottom, are now in a private collection of Puckett memorabilia in Minnesota after the Metrodome was torn down. [...] The Twins then went on to win Game 7 1-0, with Jack Morris throwing a 10-inning complete game, and claimed their second World Series crown in five years.|$|E
