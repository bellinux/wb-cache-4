In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night {{is an indication of}} exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's dècor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what you pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula—and yet, you're starved for a good meal.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{reviews of}} the time made much of {{the manner in which}} each {{production}} approached the appearance of Lavinia after the rape; [...] "At Shakespeare's Globe, the groundlings are fainting at the mutilations in Lucy Bailey's coarse but convincing production. To Stratford-upon-Avon, Yukio Ninagawa brings a Japanese staging so stylised that it keeps turning the horror into visual poetry." [...] Speaking of Bailey's production, Eleanor Collins of Cahiers Élisabéthains, said of the scene, [...] "audience members turned their heads away in real distress." [...] Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph called Lavinia [...] "almost too ghastly to behold." [...] Michael Billington of The Guardian said her slow shuffle onto the stage [...] "chills the blood." [...] Sam Marlowe of The Times saw Bailey's use of realism as extremely important for the moral of the production as a whole; [...] "violated, her hands and her tongue cruelly cut away, she stumbles into view drenched in blood, flesh dangling from her hacked wrists, moaning and keening, almost animalistic. It's the production's most powerful symbolic image, redolent of the dehumanising effects of war." [...] Of Ninagawa's production, some critics felt the use of stylisation damaged the impact of the scene. Benedict Nightingale of The Times, for example, asked [...] "is it enough to suggest bloodletting by having red ribbons flow from wrists and throats?" [...] Similarly, The Guardians Michael Billington, who had praised Bailey's use of realistic effects, wrote [...] "At times I felt that Ninagawa, through stylised images and Handelian music, unduly aestheticised violence." [...] Some critics, however, felt the stylisation was more powerful than Bailey's realism; Neil Allan and Scott Revers of Cahiers Élisabéthains, for example, wrote [...] "Blood itself was denoted by spools of red thread spilling from garments, limbs and Lavinia's mouth. Cruelty was stylised; the visceral became the aesthetic." [...] Similarly, Paul Taylor, writing for The Independent, wrote [...] "Gore is represented by swatches of red cords that tumble and trail from wounded wrists and mouths. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this method had a cushioning effect. In fact it concentrates and heightens the horror." [...] Ninagawa himself said [...] ""The violence is all there. I am just trying to express these things in a different way from any previous production." [...] In her 2013 essay, [...] "Mythological Reconfigurations on the Contemporary Stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in Titus Andronicus", which directly compares the depictions of the two Lavinias, Agnès Lafont writes of Ninagawa's production that Lavinia's appearance functions as a [...] "visual emblem"; [...] "Bloodshed and beauty create a stark dissonance [...] Distancing itself from the violence it stages thanks to [...] "dissonance," [...] the production presents Lavinia onstage {{as if she were a}} painting [...] Ninagawa's work distances itself from cruelty, as the spectacle of suffering is stylised. Ribbons that represent blood [...] are symbolic means of filtering the aching spectacle of an abused daughter, and yet the spectacle retains its shocking potential and its power of empathy all the while intellectualizing it." ...|$|E
