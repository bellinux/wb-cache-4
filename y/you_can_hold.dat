[...] Gerald S. Lesser, the first chair of the advisory board of the Children's Television Workshop (the CTW, or [...] "the Workshop"), the organization that oversaw the show's production, stated that to be effective as an educational tool, television needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention.

500|$|As author Malcolm Gladwell has stated, [...] "Sesame Street {{was built}} around a single, {{breakthrough}} insight: that if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> the attention of children, you can educate them". Gerald S. Lesser, the CTW's first advisory board chair, went even further, saying that the effective use of television as an educational tool needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention. Sesame Street was the first children's show to structure each episode, and the segments within them, to capture children's attention, and to make, as Gladwell put it, [...] "small but critical adjustments" [...] to keep it. According to CTW researchers Rosemarie Truglio and Shalom Fisch, Sesame Street {{was one of the}} few children's television programs to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, garnered from formative and summative research.|$|E

500|$|The {{sky hook}} used to rescue Bond {{at the end}} of the film was a rescue system used by the United States {{military}} at the time. At Thunderballs release, there was confusion as to whether a rebreather such as the one that appears in the film existed; most Bond gadgets, while implausible, often are based upon real technology. In the real world, a rebreather could not be so small, as it has no room for the breathing bag, while the alternative open-circuit scuba releases exhalation bubbles, which the film device does not. It was made with two CO2 bottles glued together and painted, with a small mouthpiece attached. For this reason, when the Royal Corps of Engineers asked Peter Lamont how long a man could use the device underwater, the answer was [...] "As long as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> your breath." ...|$|E
500|$|Peggy and Frank {{were married}} {{on-screen}} on 1 April 1999. A [...] "hen night" [...] was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a [...] "massive" [...] {{party in the}} show's Albert Square to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Windsor admitted {{she had been so}} nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, [...] "I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous – we were both very nervous. The day you stop getting nervous <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> your hands up. It shows you care." [...] The soap wedding was filmed in Harrow, North West London in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: [...] "It {{is one of the best}} weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot of people who do not want to see Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, there are certainly shocking revelations back at the Vic." [...] In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.|$|E

2500|$|The band's sixth album, Icky Thump, was {{released}} in 2007, and unlike their previous lo-fi albums, it was recorded in Nashville at Blackbird Studio. The album {{was regarded as a}} return to the band's earlier blues and garage-rock sound. It debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, and entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, selling over 300,000 vinyl copies in England alone. Of his excitement for vinyl, White explained, [...] "We can't afford to lose the feeling of cracking open a new record and looking at large artwork and having something <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> in your hands." [...] In support of the album, they launched a Canadian tour, in which they played a gig in every one of the country's provinces and territories. However, later that year, the band announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg's struggle with acute anxiety. A few days later, the duo cancelled the remainder of their 2007 UK tour dates as well.|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "I'll be amazed if Bayonetta doesn't end up being one of the best action games this year." [...] Staff at GameSpot UK were also generally impressed with the PS3 port, which they played on June 3. [...] They called the [...] "Witch Time" [...] mechanic a [...] "cool move" [...] and one of the two boss battles they fought were [...] "pretty intense", and said [...] "it's easy to see the similarities between the two over-the-top action games [...] ". [...] They added, [...] "Rampant violence and sexism is par for the course" [...] in the game. [...] 1UP's staff again played a PS3 version for 15 minutes on the weekend of August 31 that year, at PlatinumGames's [...] "Feel Bayonetta" [...] event in Tokyo's Roppongi district. [...] They said that it [...] "was very blurry" [...] compared to a 360 version displayed there, and that its frame rate [...] "was all over the place.... it was often hard to keep track of the action [...] because of the graphical issues on PS3." ...|$|E
2500|$|While on his 2003 tour {{to promote}} his novel, Diary, Palahniuk read to his audiences a short story entitled, [...] "Guts," [...] a sensational tale of {{accidents}} involving masturbation, which appears in his book, Haunted. The story begins with the author telling his listeners to inhale deeply and that [...] "this story should last {{about as long as}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> your breath." [...] It was reported that forty people had fainted listening to the readings while holding their breath. Playboy magazine later published the story in their March 2004 issue and Palahniuk offered to let them publish another story along with it, but the publishers found the second work too disturbing to publish. On his tour to promote [...] during the summer of 2004, he read [...] "Guts" [...] to audiences again, bringing the total number of fainters up to 53 (and later up to 60 while on tour to promote the softcover edition of Diary). In the fall of that year, he began promoting Haunted, and continued to read [...] "Guts." [...] In June 2005, Palahniuk noted that his number of fainters was up to 67. The last fainting occurred on May 28, 2007, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, where 5 people fainted, one of whom fell and hit his head on the door while trying to leave the auditorium. Since then audio recordings of his readings of the story have been circulated on the Internet. In the afterword of the latest edition of [...] "Haunted," [...] Palahniuk reported that [...] "Guts" [...] had been responsible for 73 fainting events.|$|E

2500|$|At that time, the {{imperial}} administration was selecting many officials to fill its posts, {{and there were}} many officials who received positions after lying about their lineages or past experiences. [...] Emperor Taizong issued an edict ordering the officials to admit to their falsehoods, promising to spare them if they did so before a deadline, but stating that they would be executed if their falsehoods were discovered after the deadline. [...] When some officials were indeed discovered after the deadline to have falsified their lineages or past experiences, Emperor Taizong ordered that they be executed, but Dai rejected the order and instead sentenced them to exile. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "I issued an edict that those who did not admit would be executed, but you, lord, sentenced them only to exile. [...] This made my words not stand up to the people. [...] Are you betraying justice, lord?" [...] Dai responded, [...] "If Your Imperial Majesty had killed them on the spot, there would be nothing I could do. [...] Now that you have sent them to the supreme court, I have to follow the law." [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "You, lord, are following the law, but you are making me lose credibility." [...] Dai responded, [...] "The law is how the empire can keep its credibility. [...] Your Imperial Majesty made your words based on your feelings at that time, and you declared executions based on your anger. [...] By repudiating your action and putting them {{in the hands of the}} law, you are showing that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> back your anger and respect the state's credibility.

[...] Emperor Taizong was pleased and responded, [...] "I now know that if there is a problem with the law, you, Duke, will correct it. [...] I do not worry any more." [...] It was said that Dai often spoke against Emperor Taizong's wishes in this way, and that as a result, people were not falsely convicted or punished while he was serving.|$|E
