500|$|John Calvert of The Quietus called [...] "Pyramids" [...] {{a little}} [...] "structurally {{ramshackle}} though never erratic, it's {{the type of}} massive album centrepiece that was inconceivable before The-Dream's stadium-R reinvented the genre as a mythological epic." [...] Paley Martin of Most Blunted stated that the track [...] "is {{so much more than}} a song; it is an audible baptism, a narrative delicacy, a self-indulgent experience! And <b>you</b> <b>best</b> believe once you press play, this ride will take you to the destination of your choice." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that the real triumph was Ocean's song structure: [...] "verses and hooks collapse onto each other, rhymes pop up out of nowhere, and the singer acts like minutely balancing a 10-minute concept piece is no big deal." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post Company described the track as a [...] "righteous funk opus that spans nearly 10 minutes", commented that it [...] "is loaded with metaphorical riddles, drawing parallels between Cleopatra and a 21st-century prostitute. Puzzle over it. Dance to it. All of the above." ...|$|E

The song was known as [...] "The Best Day of Your Life" [...] and [...] "Where Are <b>You</b> (<b>Best</b> Day)" [...] on advance copies of Healthy. [...] "Apology" [...] also morphed throughout recording. [...] "The song 'Apology' for example was from the first demo sessions. We tried that song a year later completely differently ... way more up-tempo and it just didn't feel right. It didn't serve the song and what Raine was saying {{and how he was}} singing dictated how we were playing. I love all the songs on the record, but that was a very magical, musical moment because it was so organic the way that happened." ...|$|E
