500|$|The ways {{in which}} St Vincent chose to {{communicate}} the rejections often depended {{on the number of}} letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. To the Earl of Portsmouth he wrote: [...] "I cannot possibly agree in opinion with your Lordship, that a person sitting quietly by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war as we have been engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with the man who has exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime." [...] A harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. Yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: [...] "Although I cannot admit the force of <b>your</b> <b>argument</b> in favour of Captain (name unknown) , there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for your letter of the 24th, which I lose no time in acknowledging;" ...|$|E

5000|$|You {{are going}} to see how my seventy-two kilos and my {{parachute}} will give <b>your</b> <b>arguments</b> the most decisive of denials. (...) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{not your}} eloquence," [...] he said, [...] "or <b>your</b> <b>arguments,</b> which brought failure upon me. It was partly your lies and partly your tactics." ...|$|R
25|$|Others, like Mark Bauerlein, {{argue that}} professors in the {{humanities}} have increasingly abandoned proven methods of epistemology (I care only {{about the quality of}} <b>your</b> <b>arguments,</b> not <b>your</b> conclusions.) in favor of indoctrination (I care only about your conclusions, not the quality of <b>your</b> <b>arguments.).</b> The result is that professors and their students adhere rigidly to a limited set of viewpoints, and have little interest in, or understanding of, opposing viewpoints. Once they obtain this intellectual self-satisfaction, persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation are common.|$|R
6000|$|... "Doesn't that weaken <b>your</b> <b>argument</b> of {{the power}} of mind over matter?" [...] asked Serviss, profoundly {{interested}} in this assertion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Still," [...] said Lewis, {{a little}} puzzled, [...] "there is fallacy somewhere in <b>your</b> <b>argument.</b> I cannot see that {{gambling}} is wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Austin smiled. [...] "I don't think <b>your</b> <b>argument</b> is {{altogether}} sound. Cayman {{belongs to}} my husband and Jefferson and they are away." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{the only}} guide I recognize. If {{you are going to}} argue the question, and <b>your</b> <b>arguments</b> are to prevail, they must be {{addressed}} to my self-interest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I said, [...] "I {{can follow}} each of <b>your</b> <b>arguments.</b> I confess, however, that I {{am unable to}} {{understand}} how you arrive at the double visit to the optician." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, they are. But I can't see <b>your</b> <b>argument.</b> You're beyond me, Wade. You're holdin' back, {{like you}} did with your hell-bent story." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know how}} that may have been,' {{returned}} Mrs Nickleby: 'but I know {{she had a very}} red face, so <b>your</b> <b>argument</b> goes for nothing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You do not {{understand}} me, sir. I refer to a particular point. I confess there is much force in <b>your</b> <b>argument</b> from the doctrine of possibilities.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{seem to have}} {{hindered}} your nourishment this morning, Carsen. I'll go {{into the}} politics of it later. Sit down by the door and think over <b>your</b> <b>arguments</b> till I come back." ...|$|R
60|$|Cand. To answer generously, as {{you have}} done, I should not by <b>your</b> <b>arguments</b> be won: I know, I urge your ruin by consent; Yet love too well, that ruin to prevent.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have got}} up all <b>your</b> <b>arguments</b> in {{excellent}} order," [...] I replied; [...] "and, if Adrian consent, they are unanswerable. One only condition I would make, --that you do nothing without his concurrence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{agree with}} you," [...] replied the Minor Poet, [...] "if we were simply automata, as <b>your</b> <b>argument</b> would suggest, {{what was the}} purpose of {{creating}} us?" ...|$|E
60|$|Object. But I {{had also}} such wickedness {{as those in}} my heart at my first awakening, and therefore, by <b>your</b> <b>argument,</b> neither should that be but from the devil.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{following}} your speeches, after a fashion,--I wish I {{might have been}} able to read more of them. <b>Your</b> <b>argument</b> interested me. It's new, unlike the ordinary propaganda of--" ...|$|E
30|$|An essay… {{must have}} 5 to 6 {{quotations}} {{to support the}} arguments… Well, if the student is… able to convince without quotations I give him credit… But how this can happen? You see references are life line of <b>your</b> <b>arguments.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Suppose, {{the fair}} apostate said, I grant, [...] The {{faithful}} flock some living guide should want, [...] 390 [...] <b>Your</b> <b>arguments</b> an endless chase pursue; [...] Produce this vaunted leader to our view, [...] This mighty Moses of the chosen crew.|$|R

6000|$|... "Your {{reasons are}} very just, Captain Carstairs. Though {{certainly}} my opinion was {{in accordance with}} that given by your fellow officers, I am bound to say that <b>your</b> <b>argument</b> seems unanswerable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Titmarsh," [...] {{says the}} Captain, [...] "you are an honest fellow; and I confess <b>your</b> <b>argument</b> sounds well. Now tell me, {{do you know}} {{anything}} about Miss Brough and her fortune?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{require any}} of <b>your</b> <b>argument,</b> you flop-eared {{son of a}} tramp with half a tail," [...] replied The O'Shannon. [...] "You come and take it, {{if you think you}} are dog enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{give you}} free leave {{to pick and}} choose <b>your</b> <b>arguments</b> in the royal woods and coppices,' said the king; 'if you cannot get {{together}} some cutting observations and stinging retorts suitable to the occasion you are a person of very poor resource.' ...|$|R
60|$|Dor. 'Tis {{the very}} thing that I designed; I have forestalled all <b>your</b> <b>arguments,</b> and left you without a word more, to plead for mercy. If you have any thing farther to offer, ere {{sentence}} pass--Poor animal, I brought you hither only for my diversion.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{very well}} put, Frank; {{and if you}} and I stood upon equal ground, with an arbiter between us by whose {{decision}} we were bound to abide, and to whom the settlement of the question was entrusted, <b>your</b> <b>arguments</b> would, no doubt, be successful, but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Kenwardine smiled. [...] "Doesn't it {{strike you}} that you're urging {{conflicting}} reasons? First you declare that Fuller was drunk, {{and then that}} he was able to detect clever players at cheating. <b>Your</b> <b>argument</b> contradicts itself and is plainly absurd." ...|$|E
60|$|I quite {{understand}} your not caring {{to refer to}} things of private knowledge. What still puzzles me is how you ("in the witness box"--ha! I like the phrase) should have made <b>your</b> <b>argument</b> actually hinge on a contention which the facts answered.|$|E
60|$|HAROLD. [Pacing up {{and down}} in his turn] Rat in a cage is a fool to him. This is the sort of thing you read of in books, John! What price <b>your</b> <b>argument</b> with Runny now? Well, it's not too late for you luckily.|$|E
60|$|You {{always are}} making a god of your spouse; But this neither Reason nor Conscience allows; Perhaps you will say, 'tis in {{gratitude}} due, And you adore him, because he adores you. <b>Your</b> <b>argument's</b> weak, and so you will find; For you, by this rule, must adore all mankind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he replied. [...] "None of <b>your</b> <b>arguments</b> {{would have}} brought me here. If I have desired to {{understand}} this world at all, it is because it is your world. It is you I want--don't you understand that? I thought you would know it from the first moment you saw me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah!" [...] {{broke in}} Madame impatiently.
