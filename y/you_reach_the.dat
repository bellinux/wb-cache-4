5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} action {{game where}} players must navigate {{a creature of}} their own design across a number of environments resembling Earth's past. The game is divided into five distinct geological periods: the Cambrian Period and the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era ("The World Before Land") from 500 million years ago to 450 million years ago, then the Carboniferous period ("Early Creatures of Land"), the Mesozoic Era ("Age of Dinosaurs"), the late Neogene period ("Ice Age"), and finally the early Quaternary period ("Early Man"). Each period has its own map screen, which is divided into various levels. While each era takes historical liberties with both its inhabitants and time frames, the player's choices for evolution are dependent on the current era of play, ranging from aquatic bodies during the Age of Fish to mammalian physiology during the Age of Man. During the first two eras you are forced to gain a new body to progress, but once <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> Age of Dinosaurs, a side quest {{will give you the}} option to remain as a reptile, or become a bird, gaining the ability of flight. As you enter the Ice Age as a bird or reptile, you are immediately given the option to become a mammal. You can finish the game as a reptile, bird, or mammal and the outcome is still the same, only the interaction dialogue is affected by your choices.|$|E

Just past Dina you will drive over a railway overpass, stay {{to the right of the}} road and take the first U-turn to drive back towards Dina. After about 100 meters to your left you will find a signpost, which {{indicates}} the way towards the road leading to Rohtas Fort which is 8km away, past the small holy village of Muftian home to the Mufti Tribe. Drive on the road to enter into the fort and keep driving till <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> parking area.|$|E

25|$|Nevada and Arizona {{are both}} {{generally}} arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive {{large amounts of}} snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive {{the same amount of}} snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills, and there are significant mountains as well once <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> Trans-Pecos area.|$|E
25|$|To access this region, two provincial roads: Provincial Route No. 28 (gravel), {{linking the}} towns of Tanti with Taninga (near the town of Salsacate). After {{traveling}} nearly 40km from Tanti, and climb over 1,700 meters <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> far north of the region, more precisely {{at the foot of}} the massif 'Los Gigantes'. From there you can follow the same route to the town of Taninga. The second option is the provincial route RP 34 (tarmac), located about 30km south of the former. It crosses the city of Villa Carlos Paz, crossing {{the towns of}} San Antonio de Arredondo, Villa Icho Cruz, Mayu Sumaj, Cuesta Blanca, and deposited us in the Pampa de Achala. This road is also known as Camino de las Altas Cumbres or route Jorge Raúl Recalde, in tribute to this rally racer. Continuing along the same route, it accesses the Traslasierra Valley. While these are the two most relevant options, there are regional roads and tourist access to reach specific sectors within the region. As mentioned above, except for these two alternatives, the other, in most cases are suitable only for special vehicles, and yet they can not access certain areas.|$|E
25|$|A {{good example}} that {{highlights}} {{the pros and}} cons of using dynamic arrays vs. linked lists is by implementing a program that resolves the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is an election method that works by having a group of people stand in a circle. Starting at a predetermined person, you count around the circle n times. Once <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> nth person, take them out of the circle and have the members close the circle. Then count around the circle the same n times and repeat the process, until only one person is left. That person wins the election. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of a linked list vs. a dynamic array, because if you view the people as connected nodes in a circular linked list then it shows how easily the linked list is able to delete nodes (as it only has to rearrange the links to the different nodes). However, the linked list will be poor at finding the next person to remove and will need to search through the list until it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the nth person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array.|$|E

500|$|Allmusic's Clayton Bolger {{described}} Young Modern as {{an improvement}} by the band, praising [...] "catchy melodic hooks, inspired lyrical themes, and stunning string arrangements". He claimed {{the album was}} the pinnacle of the band's development. PopMatters' Nick Pearson saw the opposite, claiming that [...] "nce <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> level of intellectual maturity where {{you can tell the}} difference between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap, you have outgrown Silverchair". Pearson called the album an attempt to secure a safer territory and assure sales, after the success of past works, calling it more boring than its predecessors. Other reviewers noted influences from cult British band XTC.|$|E
500|$|Nick Pearson of PopMatters, meanwhile, was {{critical}} of the album. He began his review with the statement [...] "Once <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> level of intellectual maturity where {{you can tell the}} difference between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap, you have outgrown Silverchair", and continued in the same fashion throughout. Pearson likened Johns to Kurt Cobain, saying they share a common inability; [...] "his inability to write lyrics". His only praise was for the third single released from the album, [...] "If You Keep Losing Sleep", stating [...] "'If You Keep Losing Sleep' is proof that Silverchair are capable of recording interesting music".|$|E

[...] However, several critics noted that the game's {{challenge}} is made less frustrating due to its numerous checkpoints, {{as well as the}} player's ability to retry after dying as many times as needed. [...] These additions made VVVVVV [...] "not unforgiving", according to IGN staff writer Samuel Claiborn, while still being [...] "old-school in its demands of player dedication". Independent reviewer Declan Tyson said that he feels [...] "victimised by the game's criminally unforgiving collision detection and over-enthusiastically sensitive controls" [...] but that [...] "it's all worth it for when <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> next checkpoint and feel that split second of relief".|$|E

500|$|The form of {{linguistic}} expression often does {{not correspond to}} the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> salt?", that is, in fact, not {{a question about the}} length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called conversational implicatures. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring communicative competence in a language.|$|E
500|$|Novelist Brian Lynch, {{writing for}} the Irish Independent found [...] "The story in Pure is simple, almost dreamlike, a {{realistic}} fantasy, a violent fairy tale for adults", stating [...] "At its best Pure shimmers". The novel received two reviews from The Daily Telegraph. Freya Johnston found that [...] "Miller lingers up close on details: sour breath, decaying objects, pretty clothes, flames, smells, eyelashes. He is a close observer of cats" [...] and stated, of Baratte's project as a whole, [...] "Miller intimately imagines how it might have felt to witness it." [...] Holly Kyte found Pure to be [...] "irresistibly compelling" [...] and [...] "Exquisite inside and out". She stated that [...] "Every so often a historical novel comes along that is so natural, so far from pastiche, so modern, that it thrills and expands the mind" [...] and that she found that [...] "Pure is a near-faultless thing: detailed, symbolic and richly evocative of a time, place and man in dangerous flux. It is brilliance distilled, with very few impurities." [...] Suzi Feay, for the Financial Times, stated [...] "Quietly powerful, consistently surprising, Pure is a fine addition to a substantial body of work" [...] and also noted that [...] "Miller's portraits {{of women and the}} poor are thoughtful and subtle." [...] Writing for the Daily Express Vanessa Berridge found the novel to be [...] "very atmospheric, if not to say positively creepy at times" [...] and stated that [...] "Miller's eloquent novel overflows with vitality and colour. It is packed with personal and physical details that evoke 18th-century Paris with startling immediacy." [...] Reviewing for the Daily Mail Clare Colvin stated that the novel [...] "draws you in with hallucinatory power" [...] and that she found that [...] "Miller evokes the underside of Parisian society with assured, vivid detail so that images remain in your mind long after <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> last page. This is historical fiction with imaginative style." ...|$|E

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of forensic entomological casework consists of establishing a very concrete timeline of the events involved in the crime scene. The new set of data provided by forensic entomological casework undoubtedly provides a solid case for either the defense or the prosecution. [...] But as seen in {{a new series of}} experiments, the evidence may not be as firm as previously suspected. [...] The use of DNA in forensic entomology is a growing area of research which will become more prevalent in cases as more research is done. [...] In the first experiment, DNA was extracted from a series of immature blue-bodied blowflies.(blow-fly) [...] The age range of the blowflies varied from first instar larvae up to the third day pupal stage. Extracting the target or victim’s DNA from the gut of the larvae and pupae becomes inconclusive as <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> third pupal stage. Therefore, as most samples collected from the crime scene can properly denote time scene death, there is a chance that the results may be skewed due to improper specimens.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the north}} end of the Palace rises the most famous of the towers, Elizabeth Tower, {{commonly}} known as Big Ben. At 96metres (316ft), it is only slightly shorter than Victoria Tower but much slimmer. Originally known simply as the Clock Tower (the name Elizabeth Tower was conferred on it in 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II), it houses the Great Clock of Westminster, built by Edward John Dent on designs by amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Denison. Striking the hour to within a second of the time, the Great Clock achieved standards of accuracy considered impossible by 19th-century clockmakers, and it has remained consistently reliable since it entered service in 1859. The time is shown on four dials [...] in diameter, which are made of milk glass and are lit from behind at night; the hour hand is [...] long and the minute hand [...] The Clock Tower was designed by Augustus Pugin and built after his death. Charles Barry asked Pugin to design the clock tower because Pugin had previously helped Barry design the Palace. In the 2012 BBC Four documentary, Richard Taylor gives a description of Pugin's Clock Tower: [...] "It rises up from the ground in this stately rhythm, higher and higher, before <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> clock face, picked out as a giant rose, its petals fringed with gold. Medieval windows above that and then it hits the grey slate roof, its greyness relieved by those delicate little windows again picked out in gold leaf. And then rises up again in a great jet of gold to the higher roof that curves gracefully upwards to a spire with a crown and flowers and a cross. It's elegant and grand and has fairy tale qualities." ...|$|E
