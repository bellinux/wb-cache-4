[...] Christian historian Ruth Tucker said: [...] "In simple language indemnity is salvation by works." [...] Donald Tingle and Richard Fordyce, ministers with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) who debated two Unification Church theologians in 1977, wrote: [...] "In short, indemnity is anything <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it,</b> since you establish the conditions. The zeal and enthusiasm of the Unification Church members {{is not so much}} based on love for God as it is compulsion to indemnify one's own sins." [...] The Unification Church has also been criticized for saying that World War I, World War II, the Holocaust, and the Cold War served as indemnity conditions to prepare the world for the establishment of the Kingdom of God.|$|E
