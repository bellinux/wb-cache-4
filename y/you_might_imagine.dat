500|$|A genetically {{enhanced}} superhuman {{who used}} {{his strength and}} intellect to briefly rule much of Earth in the 1990s. Montalbán said that he believed all good villains do villainous things, but {{think that they are}} acting for the [...] "right" [...] reasons; in this way, Khan uses his anger at the death of his wife to justify his pursuit of Kirk. The film was close to production approval when it occurred to the producers that no one had asked Montalbán whether he was interested in appearing in the film despite his character having been in the scripts for more than a year. Montalbán was unsure whether he could plausibly play Khan again after many years, especially given his current role of Mr. Roarke on Fantasy Island. Contrary to speculation that Montalbán used a prosthetic chest, no artificial devices were added to emphasize Montalbán's muscular physique, since even in his 60s and despite an increasingly painful back injury, stemming from being thrown off a horse in the 1950s, Montalbán had a vigorous workout routine. Montalbán enjoyed making the film, and counted the role as a career highlight. His major complaint was that he was never face-to-face with Shatner for a scene. [...] "I had to do my lines with the script girl, who, as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine,</b> sounded nothing like Bill ," [...] he explained.|$|E
500|$|The Spectator, however, {{criticized the}} {{relationship}} of Presley's character with his love interests: [...] "The girls in his (Michael Curtiz's) latest film, King Creole, are both played by good, serious actresses: Carolyn Jones [...]. and Dolores Hart, ... both are shown to be hungrily, desperately, unpridefully {{in love with him}} (Presley's character). They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but a little rough affection ... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with the air of a small, fastidious boy being press to eat marshmallow and, though he feels a bit sick not quite knowing {{how to get out of}} it ... (it) really seems to suggest this is a god come down among us for a spell; and when tender and infinitely patient in spite of the long past of infidelity, nonchalance, and what looks to an observer like plain indifference from him, her lips poised for the kiss that doesn't come ... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, though you may be put off at first by his pale, puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine</b> in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is pretty low on his list), are well worth taking a look at." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Point of Departure {{review by}} Brian Morton says [...] "Lieder tend to deliver {{some kind of}} {{cyclical}} narrative, some sense of journey or soul’s progress, {{and that is exactly}} what these two remarkable musicians have created here: a sequence of out-of-body journeyings that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> reasonably <b>imagine</b> Sun Ra and John Gilmore making, significant as much in their silences and elisions as in anything actually said, full of dark matter and tonal dust, interrupted by violent outbursts, punctuated by calms that seem prepared to run on forever." ...|$|R
5000|$|The A.V. Club proved {{critical}} of [...] "Everlasting Dollars" [...] stating [...] "In an unflinchingly honest appraisal, Taco Bell caps a 'lifetime' of eating its food at just 46 years. And in that time, you’ll be awarded only $10,000 in gift cards—and this doled out at just $216 per year. While obviously the most humane solution, giving contestants just over $4 {{to spend on}} Taco Bell per week is hardly the 'lifetime' of eating Taco Bell <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>imagined.</b> It is as though Taco Bell has promised you a delicious, fulfilling prize, only to totally cheap out on what’s inside." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film stars Denzel Washington in one {{of those}} roles that creates a movie star overnight. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> have <b>imagined</b> that would have {{happened}} to Washington after he starred in [...] "Cry Freedom" [...] as the South African hero Steven Biko. He got an Oscar nomination for that performance, but it didn't even begin to hint at his reserves of charm, sexiness and offbeat humor. In an effortless way that reminds me of Robert Mitchum, Michael Caine or Sean Connery in the best of the Bond pictures, he is able to be tough and gentle at the same time, able to play a hero and yet not take himself too seriously.|$|R
60|$|So, too, an {{exceptionally}} stout and short-winded old gentleman, who {{looks as if}} he had been living too well and taking too little exercise for the last forty-five years, is not the heavy father, as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine</b> if you judged from mere external evidence, but a wild, reckless boy.|$|E

60|$|He {{was shown}} {{into the same}} room as before; but it was much darkened with blinds and curtains. The Princess was not there, but she {{presently}} entered, dressed in a loose wrap of some soft silk, in color a dusky orange, her head again with black lace floating about it, her arms showing themselves bare from under her wide sleeves. Her face seemed even more impressive in the sombre light, the eyes larger, the lines more vigorous. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> have <b>imagined</b> her a sorceress who would stretch forth her wonderful hand and arm to mix youth-potions for others, but scorned to mix them for herself, having had enough of youth.|$|R
60|$|Grandcourt, {{who drank}} little wine, {{had left the}} table and was lounging, while he smoked, in an easy chair near the hearth, where a fire of oak boughs was gaping to its glowing depths, and edging them with a {{delicate}} tint of ashes delightful to behold. The chair of red-brown velvet brocade was a becoming back-ground for his pale-tinted, well-cut features and exquisite long hands. Omitting the cigar, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>imagined</b> him a portrait by Moroni, who would have rendered wonderfully the impenetrable gaze and air of distinction; and a portrait by that great master would have been quite as lively a companion as Grandcourt was disposed to be. But he answered without unusual delay.|$|R

Again; in the Lionardo sketches, {{many parts}} are lost in obscurity, or are left {{intentionally}} uncertain and mysterious, {{even in the}} light, and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> at first <b>imagine</b> some permission of escape had been here given you from the terrible law of delineation. But the slightest attempts to copy them will show you that the terminal lines are inimitably subtle, unaccusably true, and filled by gradations of shade so determined and measured that {{the addition of a}} grain of the lead or chalk as large as the filament of a moth's wing, would make an appreciable difference in them.|$|R
60|$|Perry had perfected {{gunpowder}} {{and built}} cannon! It was marvelous! Dian and Juag, as much surprised as Hooja, turned wondering eyes toward me. Again the cannon spoke. I suppose that {{by comparison with}} the great guns of modern naval vessels of the outer world it was a pitifully small and inadequate thing; but here in Pellucidar, where {{it was the first}} of its kind, it was about as awe-inspiring as anything <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine.</b>|$|E
60|$|The other sat more carelessly--though in no {{way more}} loosely--in his saddle: he gave his horse more freedom, with a chain-snaffle and reins hanging lightly between his fingers. He was {{obviously}} taller and probably older than his companion, broader of shoulder and fairer of skin; <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine</b> him riding this same powerful mount across a sweep of open country, but his friend you would naturally picture to yourself in uniform on the parade ground.|$|E

There is more in this thing than <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine,</b> gentlemen.

"I have heard," [...] said Alice, with a smile, [...] "that your countrywomen are a {{far more}} {{delicate}} and fragile race than Englishwomen; pale, feeble hot-house plants, unfit for {{the wear and tear}} of life, without energy of character, or any slightest degree of physical strength to base it upon. If, now, you had these large-framed Englishwomen, <b>you</b> <b>might,</b> I should <b>imagine,</b> with better hopes, set about changing the system of society, so as to allow them to struggle in the strife of politics, or any other strife, hand to hand, or side by side with men." ...|$|R

[...] —Daniel Bettridge of The Guardian describing Bouncers duration. (2011) Bouncers dream sequence was named as one of Neighbours most memorable moments by The Times. The newspaper also added the storyline in which Bouncer saves Madge from a chip pan fire to their list of memorable moments. They said [...] "One of those scenes <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>imagined,</b> but no, Bouncer tenaciously calls the emergency services as an inferno engulfs the Mangels". Vicky Frost of The Guardian named Bouncer {{as one of the best}} TV dogs and pet insurance company Petplan named him the tenth [...] "Top TV Pet" [...] and the ninth best [...] "Male TV Pet". The BBC said Bouncers most notable moment was [...] "Being nominated for a special bravery award by Toby Mangel." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rounds 7 and 8 saw {{a change}} with Morales finally {{connecting}} with his chopping {{right hand and}} for the first time Barrera felt that extra 11 lbs of power. You began to wonder wouldthis be the turning point? But Barrera rallied strongly in 9 and 10 to reassert his commanding lead. Rounds 11 and 12 were incredible. Morales knew he had to go for a knockout while Barrera’s corner were telling him he had to keep letting rip. Neither fighter disappointed with blistering toe-to-toe exchanges throughout the final rounds.Usually whenever these two get into a brawl Barrera gets the better of it but Morales was finally showing what a great fighter he is, raining down shots on the exhausted Barrera who responded ferociously with left hooks to the ribs and face. The scoring was closer than <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>imagined,</b> one judge scoring the fight even, the other two giving one-round and two-round victories to Barrera. As the announcement came the hostilities between the fighters continued with a shouting match between the two. As Barrera was announced victor he held up two fingers to Morales and shouted [...] "dos!" [...] (two) to indicate his two victories over him.|$|R

40|$|How are you {{related to}} Malawi? Do recent {{events on the}} Comoros effect you in any subtle way? Who in your {{extended}} social network is in Croatia? We seldom ask ourselves these questions, yet a "long tail" of content beyond our everyday knowledge is waiting to be explored. In this work we propose a recommendation task of creating interest in little-known content by building personalized "bridges" to users. We consider an example task of interesting users in little-known countries, and propose a system which aggregates a user's Twitter profile, network, and tweets to create an interest model, which is then matched to a library {{of knowledge about the}} countries. We perform a user study of 69 participants and conduct 11 in-depth interviews in order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach and gather qualitative insight into the effect of multi-faceted use of Twitter on the perception of the bridges. We find the increase in interest concerning little-known content to greatly depend on the pre-existing disposition to it. Additionally, we discover a set of vital properties good bridges must possess, including recency, novelty, emotiveness, and a proper selection of language. Using the proposed approach we aim to harvest the "invisible connections" to make explicit the idea of a "small world" where even a faraway country is more closely connected to <b>you</b> than <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>imagined...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The LOADER loads the camera, oddly enough, with film made {{by either}} Kodak or Fuji. Loading {{may not sound}} like much of a job, but in {{actuality}} it is very important. If the wrong film is in the camera, or if it gets loaded twice, or lost, or put in the wrong can, then the scene which corresponded to: Scene 56 - The Army advanced over the hill, the jets dropped their bombs, and the volcano erupted... could be lost. When this happens the Loader can become deeply unpopular very quickly. Kubrick fired one loader I know on his first day of work for walking across the set holding a magazine upside down. Not Kubrick’s first day of work - the Loader's. This was a trifle harsh, but there is a right way to do the job, and the rules are there for a very good reason.

Further, you {{remember}} that {{on the edges of}} the broad side of feathers you find always a series of undulations, irregularly sequent, and lapping over each other like waves on sand. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> at first <b>imagine</b> that this appearance was owing to a slight ruffling or disorder of the filaments; but it is entirely normal, and, I doubt not, so constructed, in order to insure a redundance of material in the plume, so that no accident or pressure from wind may leave a gap anywhere. How this redundance is obtained you will see in a moment by bending any feather the wrong way. Bend, for instance, this plume, B, Fig. 2, into the reversed curve, A, Fig. 2; then all the filaments of the plume become perfectly even, and there are no waves at the edge. But let the plume return into its proper form, B, and the tissue being now contracted into a smaller space, the edge waves are formed in it instantly.|$|R

We were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course, that another moment would plunge us into the abyss--down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we wore borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge.

You, perhaps, find it hard to conceive of people absolutely devoid of curiosity, to whom the book, the daily paper, and the printed speech are unknown, and you would describe their life as blank. That's a profound mistake. You are in another land, another century, down on the bed-rock of society, where the family merely, and not the community, is all-important.

40|$|Good morning, everyone. It's {{a delight}} to be here, to see you all flourishing, {{and to get a}} sense of this society of evaluators contin-uing to grow in size and in accomplishments despite the inhospitable terrain in govern-ment today. I see us as being a little bit like {{suburban}} dandelions: you know [...] . people spend their whole weekend trying to get rid of them but when Monday afternoon rolls around, there they are back again in full and glorious bloom: bright, stronger than ever, and not just unabashed, but thriving. This meeting, I know, marks the point at which, as a society, we've begun to think about our past, about the paths we've trav-elled and our reasons for choosing them, and about the progress we've made, all along the line. I've been asked, in particular, to say what I think we've learned about the politics of evaluation. To do that, as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> well <b>imagine,</b> I went back in time—oh, say 10 years—to remember what we used to say or write about the issue of politics in evaluation and then contrasted that with our approaches today. Here, of course, you should note that I'm speaking from my own personal per-Plenary Address to the American Evaluation Association, October 30, 1986 in Kansas City, MO.

Tulpian is appealed to on innumerable subjects, {{and if he is}} unwilling to express himself on any one of them, says so with instructive copiousness: he is much listened to, and his utterances are registered and reported with more or less exactitude. But I think he has no other listener who comports himself as Hinze does--who, figuratively speaking, carries about a small spoon ready to pick up any dusty crumb of opinion that the eloquent man may have let drop. Tulpian, with reverence be it said, has some rather absurd notions, such as a mind of large discourse often finds room for: they slip about among his higher conceptions and multitudinous acquirements like disreputable characters at a national celebration in some vast cathedral, where to the ardent soul all is glorified by rainbow light and grand associations: any vulgar detective knows them for what they are. But Hinze is especially fervid in his desire to hear Tulpian dilate on his crotchets, and is rather troublesome to bystanders in asking them whether they have read the various fugitive writings in which these crotchets have been published. If an expert is explaining some matter on which you desire to know the evidence, Hinze teases you with Tulpian's guesses, and asks the expert what he thinks of them.|$|R
