25|$|Duel Live {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the 2008 Scarefest event. Throughout this period, the park's haunted house dark ride, Duel, became host to this attraction, which included live actors situated around the ride circuit. Duel was available to ride normally until 12pm, when the laser guns and LED targets were switched and the actors took their positions. This was changed in 2009, when Duel Live took place throughout the whole day and many more actors than the previous year were present. Duel Live was aimed at the family audience, and included such features as new music playing throughout the ride (instead of the usual Duel theme music), {{as well as a}} butler or maid who would welcome <b>you</b> <b>inside</b> the house. The attraction was changed slightly for the 2010 season and featured the park's Scarefest mascots.|$|E

Lincoln was laughing at this line when he was shot.|$|E
500|$|... "Make Me Over" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's love of British rock, while strains of [...] "Learn <b>You</b> <b>Inside</b> Out" [...] were inspired by the Plastic Ono Band. When asked about the song [...] "Learn <b>You</b> <b>Inside</b> Out", Wade said, [...] "I wrote it really quick. We decided just to freestyle. It was one of those moments when we really grew as a band, being able to reach each other and know where we're going." [...] The song [...] "Disarray" [...] {{was inspired}} by Wade's strict and religious family. When asked about the song, he said, [...] "Angels, demons. We all fight them both, and anyone who pretends they don’t is not someone I want to hang out with." [...] "Storm" [...] was originally written by Wade at the age of sixteen, when he was going through difficult times. When asked about the song in an interview, Wade said, [...] "That was fun to record because of its starkness. We love the idea of the title, surrounded by negative space, like the a cappella beginning. Because when you’re lost in confusion, no matter how much is going on around you, you’re still alone." ...|$|E

500|$|The Wachowskis {{describe}} several themes {{present in}} Bound. They {{say that the}} film is about [...] "the boxes people make of their lives", {{that it is not}} only gay people who [...] "live in closets". They wanted to define all of Bounds characters by the [...] "sort of trap that they were making out of their lives". Violet is trapped in her life with Caesar, and in the first scene, Corky is literally inside Violet's closet, bound and gagged by Caesar. This scene is echoed later in the film when Violet says [...] "I had this image of <b>you</b> <b>inside</b> of me..." [...] This theme of being trapped is exacerbated by the claustrophobic feeling created by {{the fact that most of}} the film takes place in Corky's apartment, Violet and Casear's apartment, or the apartment next door where Corky is working.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} planned as {{a documentary about}} Thirty Seconds to Mars' creative process while recording their next album, but upon {{the advent of the}} lawsuit, was retooled as a documentary about making that album {{in the face of a}} legal battle that might prevent it from being released. Leto described the film as [...] "a really special, DIY project." [...] He explained, [...] "We all shared a part of our lives that we've never shared on-screen before, a very intimate and personal part of our lives. We take <b>you</b> ... <b>inside</b> the studio, and in our hearts, and in our minds, to share how difficult this point is in our lives—just battling this massive corporation, and fighting for what we believe in." [...] Upon the film's release, Leto told Rolling Stone that [...] "I hope that artists and audiences watch this film and get a greater understanding of how things work , because understanding is the beginning of change." ...|$|E
500|$|Hayward {{categorized}} {{the writing}} team involved in Todd's redemption as [...] "an usually {{high number of}} male writers", and as an unusual situation because, historically, most soap opera writers have been women. In a June 1994 interview with TV Guide, in {{an article about the}} trend during the early 1990s of redeemed rapists on soap operas, head writer Malone commented that [...] "he bond between the woman and the violator is a great historical tradition in fiction and films," [...] and said that Rudolph Valentino, Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas, and Clark Gable [...] "all began as totally irredeemable villains." [...] Although he did not think that most women want to be raped or are drawn to violence, he said that viewers [...] "are responding to the intensity of passion and an actor who lets <b>you</b> <b>inside</b> the torment. Some [...] believe they can be swept up in that passion and still turn it good. They think, 'With me, he'd be different. [...] The author of the article, Michael Logan, supported Malone's statements, and commented, [...] "Let's call a spade a spade. There is a large contingent of American female soap viewers who find something very attractive about rapists". [...] Hayward reported that many female viewers were furious that Logan had described them this way, and stated that their attraction to Todd was due to the skill of the actor portraying him.|$|E

500|$|Christman {{worked with}} the Office of Special Affairs (OSA) in her efforts to curtail or remove {{material}} critical of Scientology from the press, media, and the Internet. She spent a total of 20 years working for the OSA agency while {{a member of the}} Scientology organization. OSA agents serve as the [...] "internal security force and intelligence unit" [...] within Scientology. Christman assisted OSA agents in 1979, when a politician in Clearwater, Florida was attempting to hinder the Scientology organization's efforts to establish a presence in the city. She was ordered to participate in public meetings, and divert the focus of these events to questioning of the politician, Richard Tenning. He was defeated in a subsequent election, and the Scientology organization proceeded to increase its activities in Clearwater. In 1985, Christman helped OSA agents during a lawsuit from a former Scientology member. She attended the court proceedings and wrote reports about members of the jury, and assisted Scientology lawyers in compiling profiles of the jurors. At the time, Christman was an ardent believer in the Scientology organization and did not question the activities of the OSA agents. Reflecting back on her experiences assisting OSA agents, she commented, [...] "I was in a cult. Scientology promotes not watching the news. It keeps <b>you</b> <b>inside</b> a Truman Show where you're totally unaware of things. It's like your own thinking gets shut down and you get used to not considering anything that might be critical of Scientology." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} some {{months in the}} United States, Stan began working on the track in October 2013 at the two-weeks inaugural international songwriting FonoCamp in 2013, held in Azuga, Romania, where she met various Romanian and international artists. [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] was written by Lee Anna James, Naz Tokio, Sebastian Jacome and Alexandru Cotoi, while being solely produced by Jacome and Cotoi. When interviewed by Direct Lyrics, she stated that, [...] "This might sound like a cliché, but I expressed myself best through my work. 'Thanks For Leaving' is a song that I had to do and had to sing, it carries such a strong emotional message for me. It talks about {{how important it is}} sometimes to just let go of things and move on. I feel like I've done that. I know others relate to the song's message too, so I do hope it has helped them do the same." [...] The single portrays a [...] "modern" [...] electropop song and a pop ballad, which acts as a departure from her previous dance styles. It also serves as the first ballad released in her career. Lyrically, the recording delves on themes of new beginnings, choices that can be made in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. In interviews, Stan expressed that the content of [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] is personal and refers to her recovery following her alleged violent incident previously mentioned with Prodan. Florin Grozea of newspaper Adevărul felt the line [...] "I won't spend another day with <b>you</b> <b>inside</b> my head... How could you be so cruel? Turned me into a liar." [...] was directly addressed to Prodan.|$|E
2500|$|The Bee Gees' {{follow-up}} to Saturday Night Fever was the Spirits Having Flown album.

This gave the act six consecutive No. 1 singles in the US {{within a year}} and a half, equalling the Beatles and surpassed only by Whitney Houston.|$|E

2500|$|On July 2014 {{there were}} two antisemitic attacks in Malmö: A Jewish man was beaten with iron pipes for hanging the Israeli flag from his window, and some windows in the synagogue of Malmo were broken by stones. Towards the end of 2014 the Rabbi of the Jewish {{community}} in Gothenburg [...] got deaths threats through his e-mail. The letter read: [...] "...But soon will come {{the time when the}} Gothenburg synagogue will be destroyed to the ground with <b>you</b> <b>inside,</b> and then you too, you pig, will be killed in the eternal fire". This is the sixth threatening e-mail the rabbi got that year, all from the same anonymous writer.|$|E
2500|$|The ads {{featuring}} barely clad or naked {{women have}} been criticized by some feminist animal rights advocates. When Ronald Reagan's daughter Patti Davis posed naked for Playboy, donating half her $100,000 fee to PETA, the group issued a press release saying Davis [...] "turns the other cheek in an eye-opening spread," [...] then announced she had been photographed naked with Hugh Hefner's dog for an anti-fur ad. In 1995, PETA formed a partnership with Playboy to promote human organ donation, with the caption [...] "Some People Need <b>You</b> <b>Inside</b> Them" [...] on a photograph of Hefner's wife. The long-standing campaign, [...] "I'd rather go naked than wear fur," [...] in which celebrities and supermodels strip for the camera, generated particular concern.|$|E

2500|$|The Bee Gees used Barry Gibb's falsetto {{to garner}} hits such as [...] "You Should Be Dancing", [...] "Stayin' Alive", [...] "Night Fever", [...] "More Than A Woman" [...] and [...] "Love <b>You</b> <b>Inside</b> Out". Andy Gibb, {{a younger brother}} to the Bee Gees, {{followed}} with similarly-styled solo hits such as [...] "I Just Want to Be Your Everything", [...] "(Love Is) Thicker Than Water" [...] and [...] "Shadow Dancing". In 1975, hits such as Van McCoy's [...] "The Hustle" [...] and Summer's version of [...] "Could It Be Magic" [...] brought disco further into the mainstream. Other notable early disco hits include the Jackson 5's [...] "Dancing Machine" [...] (1974), Barry White's [...] "You're the First, the Last, My Everything" [...] (1974), Labelle's [...] "Lady Marmalade" [...] (1975) and Silver Convention's [...] "Fly Robin Fly" [...] (1975).|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot {{described}} {{the game as}} [...] "a multiplayer shooter that cobbles together elements of massively multiplayer games but overlooks the lessons developers of such games learned many years ago"; however, the game's competitive multiplayer modes were praised for carrying on Bungie's expertise from the Halo franchise with well-designed maps. Danny O'Dwyer stated Destiny's development surfaces some troubling ethical questions {{about the role of}} game design in keeping players addicted, and compared it to slot machines and lab-pigeons in variable reward experiments. [...] "I'm not saying it's a bad game... I'm saying it's a manipulative one. I mean it's 'Farmville' for shooter fans; instead of farming for land, you're farming for XP, loot, and whatever fake new currency the game creates to keep <b>you</b> <b>inside</b> another masterfully crafted ratio-scheduling system." [...] The Verge criticized the game's reliance on collaboration with other players that demands at least a few hours each week in order to keep up with character power levels with a player's friends or being forced to play with strangers to complete the story content.|$|E
