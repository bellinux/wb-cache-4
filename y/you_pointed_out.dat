6000|$|... 'Oh! You are here, sir!' he said, {{springing}} on the step, {{and holding}} the window-frame by his elbow, as the carriage moved. 'That person <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to me is in a fit.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} the day you came, when we were walking here, <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that rock on the mountain where the poor animals had taken refuge from the snow?" [...] said Kate suddenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "They haven't as much {{at stake}} as I have," [...] was Vane's reply. [...] "I'm a {{director}} of the company as <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out.</b> Give me two sticks of giant-powder, some fuse, and detonators." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should have}} left me alone," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't want to come here, but when you insisted I did it to oblige you. As <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> {{considering}} what I took out of some of you on another occasion, it seemed the fair thing. Now I hope you're satisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to my knowledge," [...] {{rejoined the}} courier; [...] "my message is to your colonel, from a dying man. Will <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> his station?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is she sane?' asked Mrs. Linton, {{appealing}} to me. 'I'll repeat our conversation, word for word, Isabella; and <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> any charm {{it could have}} had for you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{the labor}} that would stop us," [...] Pierre said hotly. [...] "It is needed only that <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> how we can be of service, and nothing else is of importance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{congratulate you}} most heartily upon {{the innocence of}} your brother having been, to our minds, so {{conclusively}} proved, and, as Mr. Henderson tells us, chiefly owing to your shrewdness in the matter. Before you begin, you can repeat your opinion about the bullet that <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to the chief constable last night, in order that the point may be included in your statement. After that {{you can tell us}} the story of your search in the wood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} the {{investment}} is all that could be desired, Mr. Simpson. I merely wished you to know, as soon as possible, that I {{did not intend to}} put my money into it. There are one or two other little matters which you have mentioned during the week. <b>You</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that it would be an advantage to Grenoble to revive the county fair, and you asked me to subscribe five thousand dollars to the Fair Association." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't {{the least}} doubt, sir, {{that there may}} have been such monsters as you have spoken of still {{existing}} at a much later period than is generally accepted," [...] replied Adam. [...] "Also, if there were such things, that this was the very place for them. I have tried to think over the matter since <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the configuration of the ground. But it seems to me that there is a hiatus somewhere. Are there not mechanical difficulties?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} your advice certainly," [...] Godfrey said, [...] "and even putting aside the danger <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> I should not be anxious to tell people that I {{suffered}} myself to be entrapped so foolishly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better rest {{on some of these}} pine boughs while some of us try to locate the Bill Hobson you mentioned," [...] said Jack. [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the general {{direction}} of his place?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Debt: You owe me {{compliance}} {{because of}} past favors. For example, <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that <b>you</b> have sacrificed and saved {{to pay for}} Dick's education and that he owes it to you to get good enough grades {{to get into a}} good college.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Ridgeway has an illustrative {{argument}} with some one, who says: [...] "The dress and weapons of the Saxons {{given in the}} lay of Beowulf fitted exactly the bronze weapons in England, for they had shields, and spears, and battle-axes, and swords." [...] If <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{to him that the}} Saxon poem spoke of these weapons as made of iron, he would say, [...] "I admit that it is a difficulty, but the resemblances are so many that the discrepancies may be jettisoned." [...] [Footnote: Ridgeway, i. 83, 84.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{always had}} these fits of passion. As {{far back as}} I can remember. I was a kicking, {{screaming}} child. I threw things. I once threw a fork at my elder brother and it stuck in his forehead, doing no serious damage--happily. There were whole days of wrath--days, as I remember them. Perhaps they were only hours.... I've never thought before what a peculiar thing all this raging is in the world. WHY do we rage? They used {{to say it was}} the devil. If it isn't the devil, then what the devil is it? After all," [...] he went on as the doctor was about to answer his question; [...] "as <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> it isn't the lowlier things that rage. It's the HIGHER things and US." ...|$|E
60|$|Fires {{interested}} me considerably, because I {{was getting a}} good deal of an insurance business started, and was also training some horses and building some steam fire-engines, with an eye to a paid fire department by and by. The priests opposed both my fire and life insurance, on the ground that it was an insolent attempt to hinder the decrees of God; and if <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that they did not hinder the decrees in the least, but only modified the hard consequences of them if you took out policies and had luck, they retorted that that was gambling against the decrees of God, and was just as bad. So they managed to damage those industries more or less, but I got even on my Accident business. As a rule, a knight is a lummox, and some times even a labrick, and hence open to pretty poor arguments when they come glibly from a superstition-monger, but even he could see the practical side of a thing once in a while; and so of late you couldn't clean up a tournament and pile the result without finding one of my accident-tickets in every helmet.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does look}} foolish, that's a fact," [...] said he. [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{to him the}} mistake he is making, Jerry? You have built such a splendid house {{yourself}} {{that you ought to}} be able to help Paddy and show him his mistakes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Theophilus," [...] I said, [...] "I'm much {{obliged to}} <b>you.</b> What <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{is by far}} the most {{important}} piece of evidence I've yet had to offer. Mr. Harbourne, have you kept the gold clippings that were found that morning on the cocoa-nut matting?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he said. [...] "Now {{let me look}} at--This, you say, is the--Just so; just so! Just--My dear Baxter, {{it may be that}} I {{have not}} {{examined}} this shoe with sufficient care, but--Can <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> to me exactly where this paint is that you speak of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is not all, Kate," [...] {{continued}} the Mayor, folding {{his arms and}} looking down upon her. [...] "Have you thought what this means? It is the complete renunciation not only of any claim but any interest in your child. That {{is what you have}} just signed, and what it will be our duty now to keep you to. From this moment we stand between you and her, as we stand between her and the world. Are you ready to see her grow up away from you, losing even the little recollection she has had of your kindness--passing you in the street without knowing you, perhaps even having <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to her as a person she should avoid? Are you prepared to shut your eyes and ears henceforth to all that you may hear of her new life, when she is happy, rich, respectable, a courted heiress--perhaps the wife of some great man? Are you ready to accept that she will never know--that no one will ever know--that you had any share in making her so, and that if you should ever breathe it abroad we shall hold it our duty to deny it, and brand the man who takes it up for you as a liar and the slanderer of an honest girl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A man who {{has this}} mark, branded in this place," [...] he said, {{covering}} his arm again, [...] "is {{a member of the}} Brotherhood. A {{man who has}} been false to the Brotherhood is discovered sooner or later by the chiefs who know him--presidents or secretaries, as the case may be. And a man discovered by the chiefs is dead. NO HUMAN LAWS CAN PROTECT HIM. Remember what you have seen and heard--draw what conclusions YOU like--act as you please. But, in the name of God, whatever you discover, whatever you do, tell me nothing! Let me remain free from a responsibility which it horrifies me to think of--which I know, in my conscience, is not my responsibility now. For the last time I say it--on my honour as a gentleman, on my oath as a Christian, if the man <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> at the Opera knows ME, he is so altered, or so disguised, that I do not know him. I am ignorant of his proceedings or his purposes in England. I never saw him, I never heard the name he goes by, to my knowledge, before to-night. I say no more. Leave me a little, Walter. I am overpowered by what has happened--I am shaken by what I have said. Let me try to be like myself again when we meet next." ...|$|E
6000|$|My dear Haydon--I {{read your}} {{letter to the}} young Man, whose Name is Cripps. He seemed more than ever anxious to avail himself of your offer. I think I told you {{we asked him to}} {{ascertain}} his Means. He does not possess the Philosopher's stone--nor Fortunatus's purse, nor Gyges's ring--but at Bailey's suggestion, whom I assure you is a very capital fellow, we have stummed up a kind of contrivance whereby he will be enabled to do himself the benefits you will lay in his Path. I have a great Idea that he will be a tolerable neat brush. 'Tis perhaps the finest thing that will befal him this many a year: for he is just of an age to get grounded in bad habits from which you will pluck him. He brought a copy of Mary Queen of Scots: it appears to me that he has copied the bad style of the painting, as well as coloured the eyeballs yellow like the original. He has also the fault that <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to me in Hazlitt on the constringing and diffusing of substance. However I really believe that he will take fire at the sight of your Picture--and set about things. If he can get ready in time to return to town with me, which will be in a few days--I will bring him to you. You will be glad to hear that within these last three weeks I have written 1000 lines--which are the third Book of my Poem. My Ideas with respect to it I assure you are very low--and I would write the subject thoroughly again--but I am tired of it and think the time would be better spent in writing a new Romance which I have in my eye for next summer--Rome was not built in a Day--and all the good I expect from my employment this summer is the fruit of Experience which I hope to gather in my next Poem. Bailey's kindest wishes, and my vow of being ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{that year}} one may say, with some justice, {{that the age}} of Turgenev {{had come to an}} end too; yet work so simple and human, so {{independent}} of the transitory formulas and theories of art, belongs as <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> in the Preface to Smoke [...] "to all time." ...|$|R

6000|$|Of the {{observation}} excited by Daisy's [...] "intrigue," [...] Winterbourne gathered {{that day at}} St. Peter's sufficient evidence. A dozen of the American colonists in Rome came to talk with Mrs. Costello, who sat on a little portable stool {{at the base of}} one of the great pilasters. The vesper service was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the adjacent choir, and meanwhile, between Mrs. Costello and her friends, {{there was a great deal}} said about poor little Miss Miller's going really [...] "too far." [...] Winterbourne was not pleased with what he heard, but when, coming out upon the great steps of the church, he saw Daisy, who had emerged before him, get into an open cab with her accomplice and roll away through the cynical streets of Rome, he could not deny to himself that she was going very far indeed. He felt very sorry for her--not exactly that he believed that she had completely lost her head, but because it was painful to hear so much that was pretty, and undefended, and natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder. He made an attempt after this to give a hint to Mrs. Miller. He met one day in the Corso a friend, a tourist like himself, who had just come out of the Doria Palace, where he had been walking through the beautiful gallery. His friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait of Innocent X by Velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the palace, and then said, [...] "And in the same cabinet, by the way, I had the pleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kind--that pretty American girl whom <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to me last week." [...] In answer to Winterbourne's inquiries, his friend narrated that the pretty American girl--prettier than ever--was seated with a companion in the secluded nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined.|$|E
6000|$|... 12. Now, {{the precise}} {{counterpart}} {{of such a}} household would {{be seen in a}} nation in which political economy was rightly understood. You complain of the difficulty of finding work for your men. Depend upon it, the real difficulty rather is to find men for your work. The serious question for you is not how many you have to feed, but how much you have to do; it is our inactivity, not our hunger, that ruins us: let us never fear that our servants should have a good appetite--our wealth is in their strength, not in their starvation. Look around this island of yours, and see {{what you have to do}} in it. The sea roars against your harbourless cliffs--you have to build the breakwater, and dig the port of refuge; the unclean pestilence ravins in your streets--you have to bring the full stream from the hills, and to send the free winds through the thoroughfare; the famine blanches your lips and eats away your flesh--you have to dig the moor and dry the marsh, to bid the morass give forth instead of engulfing, and to wring the honey and oil out of the rock. These things, and thousands such, we have to do, and shall have to do constantly, on this great farm of ours; for do not suppose that it is anything else than that. Precisely the same laws of economy which apply to the cultivation of a farm or an estate, apply to the cultivation of a province or of an island. Whatever rebuke you would address to the improvident master of an ill-managed patrimony, precisely that rebuke we should address to ourselves, so far as we leave our population in idleness and our country in disorder. What would you say to the lord of an estate who complained to you of his poverty and disabilities, and when <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to him that his land was half of it overrun with weeds, and that his fences were all in ruin, and that his cattle-sheds were roofless, and his labourers lying under the hedges faint for want of food, he answered to you that it would ruin him to weed his land or to roof his sheds--that those were too costly operations for him to undertake, and that he knew not how to feed his labourers nor pay them? Would you not instantly answer, that instead of ruining him to weed his fields, it would save him; that his inactivity was his destruction, and that to set his labourers to work was to feed them? Now, you may add acre to acre, and estate to estate, as far as you like, but you will never reach a compass of ground which shall escape from the authority of these simple laws. The principles which are right in the administration of a few fields, are right also in the administration of a great country from horizon to horizon: idleness does not cease to be ruinous because it is extensive, nor labour to be productive because it is universal.|$|E
