25|$|The {{strength}} of a submarine hull is not merely that of absolute strength, but rather yield strength. As well as the obvious need for a hull strong enough not to be crushed at depth, the hundreds of dives over a submarine's lifetime mean that the fatigue life {{is also an important}} issue. To provide resistance to fatigue, the hull must be designed so that the steel always operates below its elastic limit; that is the stress applied by pressure is less than its <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> The HY- series steels were developed to provide a high <b>yield</b> <b>stress,</b> so allowing this.|$|E
25|$|A yield {{strength}} or <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> is the material property {{defined as the}} stress at which a material begins to deform plastically whereas yield point is the point where nonlinear (elastic + plastic) deformation begins. Prior to the yield point the material will deform elastically and will return to its original shape when the applied stress is removed. Once the yield point is passed, some fraction of the deformation will be permanent and non-reversible.|$|E
25|$|Yielded {{structures}} {{have a lower}} stiffness, {{leading to}} increased deflections and decreased buckling strength. The structure will be permanently deformed when the load is removed, and may have residual stresses. Engineering metals display strain hardening, which implies that the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> is increased after unloading from a yield state. Highly optimized structures, such as airplane beams and components, rely on yielding as a fail-safe failure mode. No safety factor is therefore needed when comparing limit loads (the highest loads expected during normal operation) to yield criteria.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} ways in which {{crystalline}} and amorphous materials can be engineered to increase their yield strength. By altering dislocation density, impurity levels, grain size (in crystalline materials), the yield strength of the material can be fine tuned. This occurs typically by introducing defects such as impurities dislocations in the material. To move this defect (plastically deforming or yielding the material), a larger stress must be applied. This thus causes a higher <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> in the material. While many material properties depend only on {{the composition of the}} bulk material, yield strength is extremely sensitive to the materials processing as well.|$|E
25|$|The density {{decreases}} up to a comonomer {{share of}} 10% {{because of the}} disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of polyvinyl acetate (1.17 g/cm3). Due to decreasing crystallinity ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are getting softer with increasing comonomer content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene): weather resistance, adhesiveness and weldability rise with comonomer content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) rubbery thermoplastics are produced (thermoplastic elastomers).|$|E
25|$|Because {{the actual}} bond stress varies {{along the length}} of a bar {{anchored}} in a zone of tension, current international codes of specifications use the concept of development length rather than bond stress. The main requirement for safety against bond failure is to provide a sufficient extension of the length of the bar beyond the point where the steel is required to develop its <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and this length must be at least equal to its development length. However, if the actual available length is inadequate for full development, special anchorages must be provided, such as cogs or hooks or mechanical end plates. The same concept applies to lap splice length mentioned in the codes where splices (overlapping) provided between two adjacent bars {{in order to maintain the}} required continuity of stress in the splice zone.|$|E

2500|$|As a semi-solid, {{mayonnaise}} has {{an extremely}} high viscosity {{and because of}} this, its flow properties have been studied extensively. Shear stress is an important term when discussing liquids and solids at any viscosity and {{is defined as the}} force per unit area that is required to drag one layer of substance past another layer. Rheology is the study of science that deals with the flow and deformation of matter and is an umbrella for a few of mayonnaise's properties.

40|$|Abstract. The {{anisotropic}} plastic {{behavior of}} metallic sheet {{has a significant}} influence on spring-back, and is usually modeled by anisotropic yield function in numerical simulation. Material parameters of anisotropic yield function are generally identified either by <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> or by r-values, or both of them. For Hill 1948 and Yld 89 anisotropic yield functions, r-values are still widely used to calibrate their material parameters in spring-back prediction. Here, <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> and r-values were respectively used to calibrate them, and the differences of the spring-back simulated by these two identification methods were discussed. To evaluate their accuracy, the simulation results were compared with the spring-back calculated by Yld 2000 - 2 d anisotropic yield function. The result shows that when <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> were used to identify the material parameters of Hill 1948 and Yld 89 yield functions, the simulated spring-back was closer to that of Yld 2000 - 2 d yield function...|$|R

40|$|Horizontal pipe flow of coarse {{particle}} slurries with carrier fluids which exhibited <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> were examined. Experimental measurements {{were made to}} investigate the effect the fluid <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> had on the transport of the {{coarse particle}}s (1. 7 mm and 4. 4 mm) in a 52 mm diameter pipeloop. These results were used to evaluate two numerical models intended to describe these flows. Experimental tests used clay suspensions which were found to follow the Bingham fluid model. The suspensions had large <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> (3 to 25 Pa) which were capable of supporting the particles when the fluid was stationary. These particles were relatively large {{in relation to the}} pipe size. Slurry flows were mostly laminar but turbulent flows were also observed. The first numerical model considered the laminar flow of slurries by representing them as continua with a viscosity which varied with position in the pipe. A finite element method was used to predict the velocity distribution in the pipe from a specified pressure gradient and coarse particle concentration profile. This velocity distribution was then used to predict the concentration distribution based on a dispersive mechanism in laminar flow. The second numerical model was also mechanistically based and represented the slurries as two stratified layers with different coarse particle concentrations. This model was used for both laminar and turbulent flow. The effects of the fluid <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> on model predictions were considered...|$|R
