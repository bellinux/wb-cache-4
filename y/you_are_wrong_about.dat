He studies the public opinion of the country. He dissects our weaknesses. He is there to point out the best methods and the opportune time for the inevitable struggle. He is the worst enemy to-day England has. You think that he is here in Monte Carlo on a visit of pleasure--for the sake of his wife, perhaps. Nothing of the sort! He is here at this moment associated with an iniquitous scheme, the particulars of which I can tell you nothing of.

6000|$|... "Depend upon it <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> Beckendorff. That he is a humorist {{there is}} no doubt; but {{it appears to me}} to be equally clear that his queer habits and {{singular}} mode of life are not of late adoption. What, he is now he must have been these ten, perhaps these twenty years, perhaps more; of this there are a thousand proofs about us. As to the overpowering cause which has made him the character he appears at present, it is needless for us to inquire; probably some incident in his private life in all likelihood connected with the mysterious picture. Let us be satisfied with the effect. If the case be as I state it in his private life and habits, Beckendorff must have been equally incomprehensible and equally singular at the very time that, in his public capacity, he was producing such brilliant results as at the present moment. Now then, can we believe him to be insane? I anticipate your objections. I know you will enlarge upon the evident absurdity of his inviting his political opponent to his house for a grave consultation on the most important affairs, and then treating him as he has done you, when it must be clear to him that you cannot be again duped, and when he must feel that, were he to amuse you for as many weeks as he has days, your plans and your position would not be injuriously affected. Be it so; probably a humorist like Beckendorff cannot, even in the most critical moment, altogether restrain the bent of his capricious inclinations. However, my dear Prince, I will lay no stress upon this point. My opinion, indeed my conviction, is that Beckendorff acts from design. I have considered his conduct well, and I have observed all that you have seen, and more than you have seen, and keenly; depend upon it that since you assented to the interview Beckendorff has been obliged to shift his intended position for negotiation; some of the machinery has gone wrong. Fearful, if he had postponed your visit, you should imagine that he was only again amusing you, and consequently would listen to no future overtures, he has allowed you to attend a conference for which he is not prepared. That he is making desperate exertions to bring the business to a point is my firm opinion; and you would perhaps agree with me were you as convinced as I am that, since we parted last night, our host has been to Reisenburg and back again." ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper will}} offer {{a case study of}} the term ‘mansplaining’ as a concept that brings {{together}} feminist scholarship and online practices, revealing conflicts in both these areas. ‘Mansplaining’, a recent neologism used online, has not itself been theorised, but does owe a clear debt to feminist theory. ‘Mansplaining’ first appeared in 2008, and has no stable meaning. A popular online definition, however, describes it as "[not] just the act of explaining while male [ [...] . ]. Mansplaining is when a dude tells you, a woman, how to do something you already know how to do, or how <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> something you are actually right about [ [...] . ]. Bonus points if he is explaining how <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> something being sexist!" It is clear from this definition that ‘mansplaining’ relies on central but contentious feminist concepts such as standpoint and privilege. It also draws on feminist linguistics and their description of gender roles in conversation. Despite such roots, ‘mansplaining’ itself is hardly present in feminist scholarship. It is, however, extremely popular online as a way of naming gendered experience, both amongst feminists and more widely. The spread of ‘mansplaining’ can be attributed both to its foundations in feminist scholarship and to the appeal of naming something already existent in a new and provocative way. However, because ‘mansplaining’ is such a provocative term, it is also contentious, described by some as essentializing gendered behaviours. For this reason, and because of its origins in an online environment, the conceptual validity of the term is open to question. Of course, such questioning has larger consequences for contemporary feminist scholarship, in terms of its relation to activism and its online manifestations...|$|E

In about a week after its {{publication}} he took me into his library, and asked me what the people were saying about The Lord of the Isles. I hesitated, much in the same manner that Gil Blas might be supposed to do when a similar question was put by the Archbishop of Grenada, but he very speedily brought the matter to a point--'Come, speak out, my good fellow, what has put it in your head to be on ceremony with me? But the result is in one word--disappointment!' My silence admitted his inference to its fullest extent. His countenance certainly did look rather blank for a few seconds (for it is a singular fact, that before the public, or rather the booksellers, gave their decision he no more knew whether he had written well or ill, than whether a die, which he threw out of a box, was to turn out a sise or an ace). However, he almost instantly resumed his spirits and expressed his wonder rather that his popularity had lasted so long, than that it should have given way at last. At length, with a perfectly cheerful manner, he said, 'Well, well, James, but you know we must not droop--for you know we can't and won't give over--we must just try something else, and the question is, what it's to be?' Nor was it any wonder he spoke thus, for he could not fail to be unconsciously conscious, if I dare use such a term, of his own gigantic, and as yet undeveloped, powers, and was somewhat under forty years old. I am by no means sure whether he then alluded to Waverley, as if he had mentioned it to me for the first time, for my memory has greatly failed me touching this, or whether he alluded to it, as in fact appears to have been the case, as having been commenced and laid aside several years before, but I well recollect that he consulted me with his usual openness and candour respecting his probability of succeeding as a novelist, and I confess my expectations were not very sanguine. He saw this and said, 'Well, I don't see why I should not succeed as well as other people. Come, faint heart never won fair lady--let us try.' I remember when the work was put into my hands, I could not get myself to think much, of the Waverley Honour scenes, but to my shame be it spoken, when he had reached the exquisite scenes of Scottish manners at Tully-Veolan, I thought them, and pronounced them, vulgar! When the success of the book so utterly knocked me down as a man of taste, all that the good-natured Author observed was, 'Well, I really thought <b>you</b> might <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the Scotch. Why, Burns had already attracted universal attention to all about Scotland, and I confess I could not see why I should not be able to keep the flame alive, merely because I wrote in prose in place of rhyme.'"--Memorandum.|$|R
6000|$|Your {{letter is}} none the less {{interesting}} for being what, alas, I believed it might be; {{in spite of}} which interest--or in spite of which belief at least--here I am at it again! I know perfectly {{what you mean by}} your indifference to Academies and Associations, Bodies and Boards, on all this ground of ours; no one should know better, as it is precisely my own state of mind--really caring as I do for nothing in the world but lonely patient virtue, which doesn't seek that company. Nevertheless I fondly hoped that it might end for you as it did, under earnest invitation, for me--in your having said and felt all those things and then joined--for the general amenity and civility and unimportance of the thing, giving it the benefit of the doubt--for the sake of the good-nature. You will say that you had no doubt and couldn't therefore act on any: but that germ, alas, was what my letter sought to implant--in addition to its not being a question of your acting, but simply of your not (that is of your not refusing, but simply lifting your oar and letting yourself float on the current of acclamation.) There would be no question of your being entangled or hampered, or even, I think, of your being bored; the common ground between all lovers and practitioners of our general form would be under your feet so naturally and not at all out of your way; and it wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>you</b> in the least who would have to take a step backward or aside, it would be we gravitating toward you, melting into your orbit as a mere more direct effect of the energy of your genius. Your plea of your being anarchic and seeing your work as such isn't in the least, believe me, a reason against; for (also believe me) <b>you</b> <b>are</b> essentially <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> that! No talent, no imagination, no application of art, as great as yours, is able not to make much less for anarchy than for a continuity and coherency much bigger than any disintegration. There's no representation, no picture (which is your form,) that isn't by its very nature preservation, association, and of a positive associational appeal--that is the very grammar of it; none that isn't thereby some sort of interesting or curious order: I utterly defy it in short not to make, all the anarchy in the world aiding, far more than it unmakes--just as I utterly defy the anarchic to express itself representationally, art aiding, talent aiding, the play of invention aiding, in short you aiding, without the grossest, the absurdest inconsistency. So it <b>is</b> that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in our circle anyhow you can fix it, and with us always drawing more around (though always at a respectful and considerate distance,) fascinatedly to admire and watch--all to the greater glory of the English name, and the brave, as brave as possible English array; the latter brave even with the one American blotch upon it. Oh patriotism!--that mine, the mere paying guest in the house, should have its credit more at heart than its unnatural, its proud and perverse son! However, all this isn't to worry or to weary (I wish it could!) your ruthlessness; it's only to drop a sigh on my shattered dream that you might have come among us with as much freedom as grace. I prolong the sigh as I think how much you might have done for our freedom--and how little we could do against yours! ...|$|R

Gosh, that kid really plays beautifully {{and there are some}} pieces I could hear her play all night! Today I received a telegram (EFM) and of course was very, very happy. Also, rec’d two letters from you. The air mail you wrote on 11 / 18 and 11 / 22 arrived. Sometimes V-mail is very fast and other times air mail is just as fast if not faster. However, in the test case you made on the 18 th of Nov., your V-mail did arrive before your air mail. Honey, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> Geo. Bender. He is a petty politician, but so what? They all are! However, it might interest you to know that Geo. Bender has voted for every liberal or progressive bill that Congress has ever tried to put through! Read your Reader’s Scope magazine[1], Nov. issue. As a matter of fact, I sent it to you in one of the packages I sent you awhile back, so soon I hope you get it! Gosh, is this letter messy. Forgive me darling! However, once again my tummy is “on the blink” and it has given me a headache and it makes me mad cause I can’t do all the letter writing I planned on doing. I merely wrote a short V-mail to Shelton and Haygood and then I wrote to Patty Shelton and Hugh Luddecke’s wife. I wrote short notes to Evelyn Meinikoff and Fred Grail and Rhoda Menschel! Of course I did plenty of things today. After working a half day, I went downtown and finished buying some stuff (gifts) for Ukie. I really bought the kid the presents! Then, I couldn’t resist a pair of velvet (black) gloves for myself to go with my black coat, and also, I paid $ 10. 00 for a wonderful girdle—it fits swell and it is very novel—it has gray flowers on it. I also took one in aqua (dad says that can be my birthday present from him). I stopped in the Russian War Relief and got some pretty paper napkins for Mom. I sent the Meinikoffs a baby gift—it’s a kit containing Johnson’s baby oil, baby powder, etc. Cost $ 2. 00 and I think Evelyn will appreciate it. When I got to the store to call for Uk who is now having an “easy job” working for Dad, I found Sanf there. He was visiting! So, I “dragged” him to see Baubie G with me. Only stayed 30 minutes, cause I just couldn’t stand the “blubbering”—plus the fact that “snotty” Sonia was visiting her also! Uk and I wrapped packages again tonight. Xmas is a lot of fun and could be sheer joy if you could be here to plan and enjoy things with me. I adore you sweetheart. You are my life!
