6000|$|... 'A fiery devil,' {{retorted}} Sim; 'a flaming, furious devil. Don't <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> in its way, or you're done for, my buck. Be {{warned in}} time, G. Varden. Farewell!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Condemn? Oh, I {{am sorry}} for you with my whole heart. Only, why must you tell me all this? No, no; you are not to blame. I made you speak; I made <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> to shame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dave, <b>you</b> are <b>putting</b> <b>yourself</b> out a {{good deal}} for me," [...] {{answered}} Plum, gratefully. [...] "Somehow, I'd hate to meet those men alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There are French at Bona, you say. Remember, I ask <b>you</b> to <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> in no danger, only to {{bear the}} tidings to any European,' entreated Arthur.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are indeed}} {{a type of}} the Irish tragedy," [...] he said. [...] "You were entirely in the right, and <b>you</b> have <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> in the wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} teasing you a little," [...] he said. [...] "It gladdens me even to see <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> in a temper, Mary--it brings back old {{times when we}} were always such good friends, and {{sometimes}} had such grand quarrels." ...|$|E
6000|$|Esmond {{put himself}} between them at table. “D—— it,” says Frank, “why do <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> {{in the place}} of a man who is above you in degree? My Lord Mohun should walk after me. I want to sit by my Lord Mohun.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse my {{interrupting}} you," [...] said Conolly, gently; [...] "but {{that will}} not advance the argument unless <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> in mine. Besides, I am pledged to Marian. If she asks me to break off the match, I shall release her instantly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will!" [...] ses Dicky, {{trembling}} {{all over}} with temper. [...] "Who asked <b>you</b> to <b>put</b> it on the fire? Who asked <b>you</b> to <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> forward? I see it all now, and it's too late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Margaret, our adviser general," [...] {{said the}} doctor, [...] "what do <b>you</b> say? <b>Put</b> <b>yourself</b> {{in the place}} of Mrs. Charles Wilmot, and say, shall Miss Rivers teach or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As in {{everything}} else, {{it depends upon}} the price <b>you</b> <b>put</b> upon <b>yourself.</b> Now, as a casual observer, what wage per annum would you say I was worth?" ...|$|R
60|$|RICHARD. You can't help yourself, General. When {{you make}} up your mind to hang a man, <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> at a {{disadvantage}} with him. Why should I be civil to you? I may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on {{upon your}} journey, sir!" [...] said Mrs. Greene. [...] "I would {{not for a}} moment have <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> to {{inconvenience}} on our account." [...] And yet I had already lost fourteen napoleons, and given up all prospect of going to Venice! ...|$|E
6000|$|Esmond {{put himself}} between them at table. [...] "D--- it," [...] says Frank, [...] "why do <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> {{in the place}} of a man who is above you in degree? My Lord Mohun should walk after me. I want to sit by my Lord Mohun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} do that. <b>You</b> have <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> into a boat with these men, {{and you must}} remain in the boat. I should have thought all that was easy to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why can't you say something? I want a man's {{opinion of}} our prospects. Good gracious, how <b>you</b> fidget! <b>Put</b> <b>yourself</b> in Romayne's place, {{and tell me}} this. If you had left Stella--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am sorry, Miss Abbeway," [...] he said almost humbly, [...] "that {{you take}} my {{decision}} so hardly.

6000|$|... "Margaret, if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> into a passion, {{how can you}} {{understand}} reason? You ought to know, yourself, by the very fact of your being in a passion, that you are wrong. Would there be no disgrace, after all that has come out about Mr Maguire?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly! And then, {{when the}} Little Flock gathers {{in all the}} mentally lame, halt and blind in the settlement, you couldn't {{get out of it}} if you had the whole Herd of the Lost to back you, with the Hounds yelping round to keep your courage up; you've got to stay just where <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself,</b> heigh?" ...|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. But you {{ceased to}} care for me. (Tenderly.) I dare ask your love no more, but I still ask <b>you</b> to <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> into my keeping. Miss Phoebe, let me take care of you.|$|R

6000|$|... "But, my dear Miss Moffat, {{if these}} very {{conditions}} were proofs {{of his right}} mind, you surely would not object to make them known, if only to enable <b>you</b> to <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> in a condition to carry them out." ...|$|R
6000|$|Pierston {{was almost}} as much distressed as she. 'Why did <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> and me in such a position?' he said bitterly. 'It is no use to regret it now! And I can't say that I do. It affords me {{a way out of}} a trying position. Even if you had not been married to him you would not have married me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{soon as it}} was light, Felicia, who {{was very}} unhappy about her pot of pinks, went out to look for it, and the first thing she found was the unfortunate cabbage.

6000|$|... 'Dear Theodora, I did {{not mean}} to vex you; but will you only put {{yourself}} in our place for one moment. Your father and mother let you stay here on the understanding that you go out with us, and when we cannot go, do you think we ought to see <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> under the escort of a person to whom we believe they would object?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> might <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> in my place, {{and judge}} fairly between us. There {{has not been}} a thought or a feeling in my heart {{concealed}} from you since first all this began. You have known that I have never loved your friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind. We shall {{give you}} two others {{in the place of}} them. But <b>you</b> must <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> under my orders. You are welcome to all the {{official}} credit, but you must act on the line that I point out. Is that agreed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! Gilbert, I grieved {{most of all}} for {{you when}} first I heard your story, before I thought I should ever have {{anything}} to do with you,' said Albinia, hanging over him fondly.

60|$|LADY CHILTERN. Don’t {{come near}} me. Don’t touch me. I {{feel as if}} you had soiled me for ever. Oh! what a mask you have been wearing all these years! A horrible painted mask!

6000|$|... "My dear," [...] {{said his}} mother, {{who was a}} very wary and careful old squirrel, [...] "how {{can you think of}} it?

6000|$|... "You'll {{miss the}} House {{if you give}} it up; you will, after a bit, Mr. Finn. You've got to come round again, Mr. Finn,--if I may be so bold as to say so, and <b>you</b> shouldn't <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> {{out of the way}} of coming round comfortably." ...|$|R
