The episode was based on the 1951 film Ace in the Hole, which sees the story of a down-and-out journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career. Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; [...] " [...] came in out of nowhere and just gave me, start to finish, the whole story." [...] Vitti said renting the film was the first thing he did after finishing the script. He remarked, [...] "It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I suppose you'd be {{over when}} that was done,' Alice said thoughtfully: 'but don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> rather hard?' ...|$|E
6000|$|They were stopping, and the footman, who had alighted, had rung at the house-door. [...] "That <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> so charming?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had you {{yourself}} been struck as the prisoner was struck, Captain Downes, what course do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been proper {{for you to}} pursue?" ...|$|R
60|$|Your letter {{makes us}} a little uneasy about your health. Telegraph us how you are. If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> help <b>you,</b> make us a visit.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> help <b>you,</b> Miss, if {{you read}} my husband's letters to me? There are only three of them--they won't take long to read.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Discharge him! What {{good would}} that do? Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better wisdom {{to teach him}} better ways and keep him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{advisable}} {{to consult the}} master of this tent?' said Tancred, in a lower tone. 'He is very friendly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> worth {{while to}} make the attempt? Suppose you succeeded and found there was nothing on the other side?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Estelle; [...] "but, Charley, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{have been}} better {{for us to have}} brought our trunks with us on the omnibus?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it makes}} a difference, {{it makes a}} difference," [...] mused Julia. [...] "Dear old Rob-ert--I wouldn't hurt him for worlds. I wouldn't. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> hurt Robert?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it's not. You {{know what}} I mean very well. If I were to lose half my {{property}} to-morrow, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cut me {{up a good}} deal?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know as I ought to----" [...] She was frightened, awed at Bacchic madness. [...] "D-do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> all right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more {{pleasant}} {{if we could}} all eat together, Mrs. Wadsworth?" [...] said Laura, while they were partaking of the repast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing in {{the world}} could make him understand!" [...] she murmured. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> of any use if we met him outside?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} me with an anxious expression, and then said, [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> do for <b>you</b> to wait on the piazza until the rain is over?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. It couldn't do much harm, I s'pose, an' if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{please her}} any better, why, I'm willin' {{to stay on}} my knees half a day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What an infidel you are, Tom! How else do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{turn out}} easily {{when it was}} done! For a civil-engineer and land-surveyor not to know that! My goodness, Tom!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather," [...] replied March. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{better for}} me to ride behind you? I think I could manage to hold on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> as {{well that}} you also should keep out of sight, and so leave the coast clear for him?" [...] {{suggested}} Bax.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must {{be feeling}} very badly," [...] said the meek and anxious Mrs. Witton [...] "don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better to send for a doctor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} decisively. [...] "I believe you tangled <b>it</b> yourself. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> run more {{smoothly}} {{if you gave}} the thread more length? Well, why don't you act upon the suggestion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly; but {{you could}} see that she meant <b>it.</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> do for them to change from their hotel, and go to the Grand Union or the States or Congress Hall?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So am I," [...] said Robert. [...] "It {{seems to}} me that we have a lot of ideas in common. Donâ€™t <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> simplify matters if you stayed at Salthaven and married me?" ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wise to go {{quite so}} far at first? Surely {{it would be}} more prudent to begin with the best men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind that," [...] she said, [...] "but tell me, didn't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> just {{lovely to}} live with her in that {{delightful}} little inn?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{the fair}} {{thing for a}} man on the verge of insanity--a {{physical}} and mental wreck--to ask a woman to marry him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Poor dear Collins. Let me {{know whether}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> give him {{pleasure}} that I should write to him. I {{have often been}} near his state, and therefore have it in great commisseration. * * * ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is she {{finished}} already?' cried Barbaik, {{in a tone}} of disappointment. 'Oh, try again, my dear. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> do any good to beat her a little?' she added to Denis, who shook his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he drawled, reflectively, [...] "seeing she hasn't any masts left to cut away, nor any cargo to--stay, {{you might}} throw {{over some of}} the {{heaviest}} of the passengers if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> do any good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should not, of course, {{think of}} holding my {{services}} at present," [...] Macheson said gravely. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better, I will go away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{better to}} say he is bound to accept trustingly what God arranges, believing {{that it will be}} all for the best?" [...] {{returned}} Pauline.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he said, [...] "that {{mine was}} only a chance visit. Pray {{remember}} me to Miss Maud, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> any satisfaction to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could tell}} you who <b>it</b> is, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that would do any good--if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> help me {{to see it in}} the true light, or you could help me more by knowing who it is than you can now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't call it dissimulation. But {{of course}} a girl ought to hide her feelings. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been better for her not to have looked so {{obviously}} out of humour when you first saw her the other night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] she said, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> enable <b>you</b> {{to comply}} with what I have {{signified}} {{to be not only}} our own wishes, but those of Mademoiselle de La Vauvraye herself, if she were to state them to you?" ...|$|R
