Keneally disputed claims that she was never paid for her contributions, [...] "not least because I had {{recently}} sent Emilie a check myself." [...] He also confirmed with Spielberg's office that payment had been sent from there. Filmmaker Michael Haneke criticized the sequence in which Schindler's women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: [...] "There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> something like that with a naive audience like in the United States. It's not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well – but it was dumb." ...|$|E

[...] Nicole later told Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) about the baby and she offered to adopt it. James later revealed that when she joined Home and Away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character, except make her pregnant. Of the moment she was told that Nicole was going to have a baby, James said [...] "I went in to see our producer later and he said, 'Okay, I'm going to apologise in advance - we're making Nicole pregnant!'" [...] She initially did not want to portray a [...] "typical soap teenage pregnancy" [...] as she thought Nicole should be different. However the situation was explained to her and she became excited at the challenging storyline ahead.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the 1920s {{and most}} of the 1930s, the Labour Party's {{official}} policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and collective security under the League of Nations. At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, [...] "We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty. We are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country. We say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country." [...] During a debate on defence in Commons a year later, Attlee said [...] "We are told (in the White Paper) that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. We do not think you can do it by national defence. We think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> it by moving forward to a new world. A world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system. I shall be told that that is quite impossible." [...] Shortly after those comments, Adolf Hitler proclaimed that German rearmament offered no threat to world peace. Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the Soviet Union, created [...] "A chance to call a halt in the armaments race...We do not think that our answer to Herr Hitler should be just rearmament. We are in an age of rearmaments, but we on this side cannot accept that position." ...|$|E

40|$|Bridging the Divide” is {{an essay}} that {{addresses}} the perceived tension or “divide” between feminism and child protection. While, in theory, women’s and children’s rights are not necessarily antithetical, the policies that have been devised (allegedly to preserve and promote those rights) are, at times, at odds. For example, the policy of social services to remove a child from {{the home of the}} mother, rather than assist both mother and child by the creation of a better home environment, is certainly at odds with rights of the mother. To simplify the issue greatly, the right of women to have and raise a child is in conflict with the way that the state operates in its protective role - and a critical issue is that the state might not be color-blind or race neutral. This is an especially important issue for African-American women because the state feels compelled to intervene in their lives as they are at times presumptively seen as “irresponsible. ” “Briding the Divide” explores the role that a human rights discourse might play in addressing the “divide” or the perceived tension between feminism and child protection. Some preliminary questions it asks are: What are the alternatives {{when it comes to the}} expression of rights? Do we identify maternal or parental rights in negative terms, saying <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do anything not prohibited, or positive terms, saying <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>only</b> that which specifically is permitted? Does it matter? Whether parental rights are viewed in terms of “parents have rights to do anything not prohibited” or “parents have rights to <b>do</b> <b>only</b> that which is specifically permitted,” children’s rights are left undefined. Children remain on the margin. Children are in the default position. And this problem is exacerbated domestically, in the United States, by the view of some parental rights advocates that parents have omnipotent “rights” over children. Under this view, rights of children may be not only marginalized, but rendered non-existent. This view also begs any question or issue with respect to parental responsibility. Perhaps the key to the harmonization of children’s and parent’s rights is the identification and enumeration of children’s rights, so that we can see where rights of parents and children intersect and are interdependent, and then and thereby develop policies that foster the rights of both. In the international human rights context, the Convention on the Rights of the Child is an example of the harmonization of children’s and parent’s rights, and an analysis of the legal scheme developed by the Children’s Rights Convention might prove helpful to the feminism/child protection debate. “Bridging the Divide” concludes that perhaps the “divide” is an illusion and the reality of human rights is one of intersectionality and interdependence...|$|R

6000|$|This is the reason: That the English {{have laws}} and obey them, and the gipsies have none. This {{is the whole}} secret. This is why savages remain poor and miserable, that each man does what he likes without law. This is why civilised nations like England thrive and prosper, because they have laws and obey them, and every man does not do what he likes, but what the law likes. Laws are made not {{for the good of}} one person here, or the other person there, but for the good of all; and, therefore, the very notion of a civilised country is, a country in which people cannot do what they like with their own, as the savages do. [...] "Not do what he likes with his own?" [...] Certainly not; no one can or does. If you have property, you cannot spend it all as you like. You have to pay a part of it to the government, that is, into the common stock, for the common good, in the shape of rates and taxes, before you can spend any of it on {{yourself}}. If you take wages, you cannot spend them all upon yourself and do what you like with them. If you do not support your wife and family out of them, the law will punish you. You cannot do what you like with your own gun, for you may not shoot your neighbour's cattle or game with it. You cannot do what you like with your own hands, for the law forbids you to steal with them. You cannot do what you like with your own feet, for the law will punish you for trespassing on your neighbour's ground without his leave. In short, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> with your own what will not hurt your neighbour, in such matters as the law can take care of. And more, in any great necessity the law may actually hurt you {{for the good of the}} nation at large. The law may compel you to sell your land, to your own injury, if it is wanted for a railroad. The law may compel you, as it did fifty years ago, to serve as a soldier in the militia, to your own injury, if there is a fear of foreign invasion; so that the law is above each and all of us. Our own wills are not our masters. No man is his own master. The law is the master of each and all of us, and if we will not obey it willingly, it can make us obey unwillingly.|$|E
