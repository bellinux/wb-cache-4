500|$|Woon, a Peranakan, {{was born}} on 12 September 1956 in Singapore to schoolteachers. He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became {{principal}} of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, [...] "When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> might be a lawyer; {{would you like to}} do law?' I said, 'Fine, if you want to give me the scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me."

6000|$|Striped Chipmunk at once {{wanted to}} know how Miner could see. [...] "He doesn't see as you do," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "He has very small eyes, tiny things, which you might find if you should part the fur around them, but they are of use only to {{distinguish}} light from darkness. Miner hasn't the least idea what any of <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> <b>You</b> see, he spends his life under ground and of course has no use for eyes there. They would be a nuisance, for the dirt would be continually getting in them if they were any larger than they are or were not protected as they are. If you should feel of Miner's nose you would find it hard. That is because he uses it to bore with in the earth. Just notice those hands of his." ...|$|E

6000|$|On the {{day after}} this the {{carpenter}} had been out at work, and came home quite merry; {{but as soon as}} he entered the house his wife clapped her hands together and cried, 'My dear, what makes <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> that? <b>You</b> are ill.' ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{short film}} follows Mater's day-to-day {{activities}} after things {{have returned to}} normal in Radiator Springs. Mater likes to play scary pranks on other characters until a blue light begins haunting him. His final prank is his most successful: Lightning McQueen sees a tow hook hanging from behind a stack of cans and, assuming that Mater is hiding behind it, approaches to foil the prank. Mater then jumps off of the roof of Flo's café, screaming behind McQueen, who then is startled and knocks over the pile of cans, revealing that the hook was actually from the sign of Mater's place of business, thus a decoy. Everyone starts to laugh at McQueen for having fallen for this clever trick, and Mater teases, [...] "Whoa, Buddy. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> seen... the Ghostlight!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Cameron Marshall, however, {{was not a}} gold star gay man upon {{appearing}} in the film. An interviewer with the gay newspaper [...] "Between the Lines" [...] implies that Marshall performs heterosexual sex well enough in [...] "Shifting Gears" [...] that it seems like Marshall has had sex with women before, commenting [...] "you {{have sex with a}} chick. <b>You</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> had done it before." [...] In response, Marshall stated that he has had sex with women because he dated women and had girlfriends until he was 20, before switching over to dating men exclusively. Having entered gay porn at age 20 and having made [...] "Shifting Gears" [...] at age 22, it had been 2 years since Marshall had slept with a woman. At the time of filming [...] "Shifting Gears" [...] Marshall considered himself to be gay because, although he lost his virginity to a woman and had [...] "fun" [...] dating women, he was now [...] "over it" [...] and only dated men.|$|R

5000|$|In 2013, Body Gossip {{organised}} a flash mob on the South Bank in London. Participants {{were given}} paper hearts {{on which they}} were asked to write what they loved about their body; they then displayed the hearts simultaneously at 1 p.m. Ruth Rogers said of the event: [...] "Too many people dont have anything that they love about their bodies, and we thought we should try to encourage them to really look at themselves and go youre gorgeous. Were bombarded every single day with negative imagery and unattainable perfection. No matter what you feel that you should look like, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>you,</b> and you can be the best version of you. Youre your own brand of gorgeous." [...] In the same year, writer Jane Martinson noted in a blog for The Guardian: [...] "Statistics from campaigners Body Gossip suggest one in 10 young people will develop an eating disorder before they reach the age of 25 (with 1.6 million currently officially diagnosed in the UK [...] ); three children in a typical British classroom are self-harming and 30 per cent of boys and 70 per cent of girls aged 11-19 cite their relationship with their body their number one worry." [...] Body Gossip was part of an all-day event in London held to celebrate the 2013 United Nations International Day of the Girl; the organisation provided theatre and film performances based on stories submitted by members of the public.|$|E
5000|$|The bar {{scene is}} a pivotal {{point in the}} film as Sally shares a {{recording}} of an on the spot interview with Howard Cosell, and inspires Donald by saying, [...] "You know anybody will talk to you with a tape recorder in your hand, it makes <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> know what you're actually doing." [...] The Cosell interview is for Sally's thesis on pop art {{and its relationship to}} society. Donald meets Terry (Denise Flamino) a gorgeous young woman in the bar, grips the tape recorder and microphone and tries Claybrook's technique and gets her number. This bumps up Donald's confidence and he courageously goes to the source on what makes women tick, {{and the best way to}} approach them. Unfortunately this confidence ultimately blinds Becker as he swoons Cynthia Miller (Deborah Raffin) an alluring model and girlfriend of his employer (Chandler Cory) of four years. When Donald informs Robby of his dinner date, Harrington tells him, [...] "That's terrific I'm very proud of you, you're making great progress, now break the date, is it worth your job?" [...] To which Becker responds" [...] It's worth my life" [...] Donald calls from Studio 54, to tell Robby how well it's going, Harrington tries his best to stop Donald from going any further, but to no avail, the two hit the dance floor in a spectacular liveliness which really defines the New York Disco scene.|$|E

You see someone in the space where you should be {{but you do not}} recognize the interloper. Then, after an unseemly lag of a second or two you are forced to remake your own acquaintance; it seems you no longer know yourself at first sight. The you behind your eyes believes <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> did twenty years ago, and it assumes that dated image is the real you, even if recent photos tell a horror story. But photos seldom confirmed your self image, even when you were young, so you can dismiss the latest batch. In high school you accepted only one or two out of fifty on the contact sheet as satisfactory, though none of your friends or family, when asked, could distinguish the person in the photos you thought reasonably flattering from the many in which you looked like a total doofus. To them they were all indistinguishably you. They were not even putting you on, as you vainly believed, when they thought the best picture was the one you felt the most loathsome...|$|E

(7 February 2014) U.S. President Barack Obama {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} with NBC Sports' Bob Costas that the inclusion of gay athletes in the U.S. Olympic delegation was to send a pointed message in response to the Russian laws, saying that [...] "there is no doubt we wanted to make it very clear that we do not abide by discrimination in anything, including {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation. One of the wonderful things about the Olympics is that you are judged by your merit, how good you are regardless of where you come from, what <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> who <b>you</b> love and that I think is consistent with the spirit of the Olympics." ...|$|R
