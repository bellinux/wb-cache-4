500|$|... "Baby I" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Ariana Grande for her debut studio album Yours Truly (2013). It was written by Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds, Antonio Dixon and Patrick [...] "J. Que" [...] Smith and produced by the first two. The song was released by Republic Records on July 22, 2013, as the second single from the album. The song was initially written with the singer Beyoncé in mind, but she rejected it. [...] "Baby I" [...] is an R and pop song with drums, horns and a syncopated beat. It also contains an uptempo '90s-inspired beat. Lyrically, the song is {{about not being able}} to fully express your feelings towards someone <b>you</b> <b>love.</b> <b>The</b> song was well received by music critics who complimented the song's [...] "throwback" [...] sound while others praised Grande's vocals comparing to the singer Mariah Carey.|$|E
500|$|Ross Douthat, a {{conservative}} columnist of The New York Times, called Avatar [...] "the Gospel According to James" [...] and [...] "Cameron's long apologia for pantheism [...] has been Hollywood's religion {{of choice for}} a generation now." [...] In The Weekly Standard, John Podhoretz criticized the film's [...] "mindless worship of a nature-loving tribe and the tribe's adorable pagan rituals." [...] Christian critic David Outten disputed that [...] "the danger to moviegoers is that Avatar presents the Na'vi culture on Pandora as morally superior to life on Earth. [...] If <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> philosophy {{and culture of the}} Na'vi too much, you will be led into evil rather than away from it." [...] Outten further added: [...] "Cameron has done a masterful job in manipulating the emotions of his audience in Avatar. He created a world where it looks good and noble to live in a tree and hunt for your food daily with a bow and arrow.... Cameron said, Avatar asks us to see that everything is connected, all human beings to each other, and us to the Earth.' This is a clear statement of religious belief. This is pantheism. It is not Christianity." ...|$|E

500|$|Released on June 7, 2005, the {{collection}} has received generally positive reviews from critics. Slant Magazine's Keith Uhlich rated it three stars out of five, praising {{the quality of}} the episodes included in the set, but ultimately finding that they were best viewed {{in the context of the}} [...] "standalone" [...] episodes which were omitted—singling out [...] "Conduit" [...] and [...] "The Jersey Devil" [...] as episodes which would aid the series' [...] "dual character study". Writing for IGN, Dan Iverson rated {{the collection}} eight out of ten, finding that the mythology-based episodes formed the basis of the relationship between the characters of Mulder and Scully. Making reference to the first season episode [...] "Squeeze", not included in the collection, he added that [...] "even though people watched the series to see little green men and liver-eating elastic monsters, it was the relationship between the two which made the series a total success". However, he found that the set's extra features material was sparse, describing it as being just enough [...] "to keep us from complaining". Writing for DVD Talk, Jeffrey Robinson was impressed with the collection, finding that the featured episodes worked well together without losing cohesion, and stating that [...] "whether you are a casual viewer or a fan who already owns the season sets, owning The X-Files Mythology, Volume 1: Abduction is a must". Exclaim! Monica S. Kuebler felt negatively about the collection, noting that anyone who would be interested in it would be likely to already own the collected episodes through other releases, and asking [...] "should you buy Abduction? It all depends on how much five commentaries and a doc are worth to you, because chances are, if <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> X-Files ... you've probably already bought the episodes included here at least once".|$|E
2500|$|Grohl {{stated that}} it was [...] "a song about realizing {{that you are the}} source of all of the {{problems}} in a relationship and <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> other person so much, you want to free them of the problem, which is actually yourself. It was a riff that turned into another riff that turned into another riff and ended up being a nice little power punk song." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chrysta Cherrie of AllMusic {{concluded}} her {{review by}} stating that, [...] "Muppets: The Green Album freshens up the franchise for the newish millennium, and Generation Z listeners will enjoy hearing current artists in this different context, but other listeners may be left reaching for their classic Muppets fare." [...] A Sputnikmusic reviewer said that [...] "too {{few of the}} artists approach the material with the right ideas". Jeremy Frye wrote that the album's potency largely depended on the nostalgia factor; [...] "If you were to see The Green Album sitting on the counter at Starbucks and consider making an impulse buy because <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>The</b> Muppets, I’d say go for it. As tributes to significant portions of your childhood go, it could be much worse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the song}}'s release, Lorde teased the song on her Twitter account, saying [...] the [...] "Green Light" [...] would be [...] "different, and kinda unexpected. Complex and funny and sad and joyous and it'll make you DANCE." [...] Lorde {{announced}} {{the release of}} the single and its music video on Twitter on 2 March 2017. Later that day, in a Beats 1 interview with Zane Lowe, she also said: The song is really about those moments kind of immediately after your life changes and about all the silly little things that you gravitate towards. I say, 'She thinks <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> beach, you're such a liar.' What the fuck, she thinks you like the beach?! You don't like the beach! It's those little stupid things. It sounds so happy and then the lyrics are so intense obviously. And I realized I was like, 'how come this thing is coming out so joyous sounding?' And I realized this is that drunk girl at the party dancing around crying about her ex-boyfriend who everyone thinks is a mess. That's her tonight and tomorrow she starts to rebuild. And that's the song for me.|$|E
