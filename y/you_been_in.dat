2500|$|Culshaw's [...] "Doctor" [...] has telephoned {{four of the}} [...] "real" [...] Doctors—Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, and Sylvester McCoy. This {{prompted}} the bemused (and apparently confused) McCoy to ask the classic question: [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the pub?" [...] When Culshaw phoned Tom Baker himself and stated that he [...] "was the Doctor", Baker replied, [...] "But {{there must be some}} mistake...I'm the Doctor..." [...] Baker had previously worked with Culshaw and was aware of his impression but not when the call would come, if at all, so his reaction was genuine. On the other hand, McCoy has said that his reaction was faked, as he had been warned immediately before the call took place.

It is said Lord Stair;—Your Majesty's adopting it, Sir, will make the opinion general, said —I know it is the general opinion, and I know that there is no Man who calls himself a Gentleman that must not think himself obliged to you, for you have supported the cause of the Gentlemen—You know the tone at Court is a whisper, but The King said all this loud, so as to be heard by every one at Court.|$|E
