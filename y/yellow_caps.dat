500|$|The variety V.bombycina var. flaviceps is {{distinguished}} from the main form by its smaller, bright <b>yellow</b> <b>caps,</b> up to [...] in diameter, and its dirty-white, scaly volva. Murrill also noted that it developed a [...] "peculiar sickening odor during drying". V.bombycina var. microspora has smaller spores (6–7.5 by 4–5μm), a yellow cap, and a blotched brown volva. V.bombycina var. palmicola also has a yellow cap and small spores (5.9–7.5 by 4.3–5.4μm), but can be {{distinguished from the}} previous varieties by its distantly spaced gills.|$|E
500|$|Quite heavy {{compared}} with other mushrooms of similar size, the stocky fruit body contains relatively high amounts of chitin. Holding the brawny bolete {{has been described as}} [...] "having a stone in your hand". The cap is [...] in diameter. Hemispherical when young, it extends and flattens into a convex and finally a flattish shape, sometimes forming a slight depression in the centre. Initially curled downward and inward, the cap margin gradually turns outward, eventually flattening in maturity, and sometimes protruding beyond the pored undersurface. The surface texture starts out slightly velvety, but becomes smoother and hairless with age; in moist weather, the cap is slightly sticky. Changing over time, the colour of the cap is initially vivid yellow or golden yellow, then ochre, then darkening in age to brown. However, if the cap cuticle is bruised, or even touched, there are sudden changes in the colour that depend on the age of the mushroom: young, <b>yellow</b> <b>caps</b> become cherry-red, while ochre-brown cap tissue bruises to reddish-purple. These colour changes soon give way to bluish or greyish tones, which, when combined, give the cap a variegated appearance.|$|E
