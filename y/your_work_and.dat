2500|$|Work–life {{balance is}} a concept {{including}} the proper prioritization between work (career and ambition) and lifestyle (health, pleasure, leisure, family).

2500|$|The Spanish columns {{carried the}} Croix des Bouquets and the Calvaire in their initial rush. From the Croix {{they took the}} Sans Culottes Camp under {{artillery}} fire. The local French commander Frégeville was not present but Lespinasse took charge. Sacrificing his outlying positions he concentrated his strength at the Redoubt de la Liberté and a bitter fight ensued. A unit of French marines suffered heavy losses while {{on the other side}} the Irish Regiment of Ultonia was roughly handled. With the Spanish advance checked, Frégeville arrived on the scene and Lespinasse offered to hand over command to his superior. Frégeville magnanimously replied, [...] "No, you have done well; complete <b>your</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> that of France {{for the rest of this}} beautiful day". After eight hours of struggle the Spanish forces withdrew in good order. The French reported 235 casualties while Spanish losses numbered 335. Lespinasse was promoted to general of brigade on 18 February 1794. He was briefly suspended from command before being restored to duty.|$|E
