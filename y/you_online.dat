It's also stated in the article that without internet you would be unable to watch a stream. Jones' article points out that with cable there are more shows available as well as some streaming.

GLM ranks the schools [...] "according to their online presence -- or internet brand equity ... By focusing on online presence, the Monitor hopes to avoid the biases that characterize other rankings, which commonly rely on the opinions of university officials and college counselors rather {{than that of the}} greater public." [...] GLM believes the rankings provide an up-to-date perspective on which schools have the most popular brand. for example, it cites the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania (ranked fifth in 2010 by U.S. News) fared almost equivalently to Penn State (ranked 47th in 2010 by U.S. News), ranking 22nd and 24th respectively." [...] The resulting tool, the group claims, gauges the relative value of the various institutions and how they change over time.|$|E
