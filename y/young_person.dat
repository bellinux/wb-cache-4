40|$|This article {{reports the}} initial {{findings}} of a Danish action research project aiming to develop a digital tool that <b>young</b> <b>persons</b> could use to inform their municipal case workers about their wellbeing. The project vision was an integrated system with a smartphone interface for <b>young</b> <b>persons,</b> and a web interface for case workers, whereby both parties could track how the <b>young</b> <b>persons</b> were doing. Three meetings were held between researchers, software developers, <b>young</b> <b>persons</b> and their case workers. The <b>young</b> <b>persons</b> rejected self-monitoring on a normative scale. They rejected a scale proposed by case workers that encouraged them {{to focus on a}} positive future, favoring a scale which enabled them to focus on their wellbeing being low. The <b>young</b> <b>persons</b> and case workers disagreed about how data regarding change should be presented. Case workers preferred a graph that highlighted risk, where <b>young</b> <b>persons</b> favored a graph that emphasized positive change...|$|R

5|$|Le Père Goriot is also {{recognized}} as a bildungsroman, wherein a naive <b>young</b> <b>person</b> matures while learning {{the ways of the}} world. Rastignac is tutored by Vautrin, Madame de Beauséant, Goriot, and others about the truth of Parisian society and the coldly dispassionate and brutally realistic strategies required for social success. As an everyman, he is initially repulsed by the gruesome realities beneath society's gilded surfaces; eventually, however, he embraces them. Setting aside his original goal of mastering the law, he pursues money and women as instruments for social climbing. In some ways this mirrors Balzac's own social education, reflecting the distaste he acquired for the law after studying it for three years.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of Brygida Kürbis, it can be concluded that the 10-year marriage of Przemysł II and Ludgarda wasn't successful, and over time it became more obvious to everyone that the ducal couple was unable to have children, although this couldn't be completely certain, because Ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old. Nevertheless, is assumed that Przemysł II's growing aversion to his wife because of her infertility was well known by all. So when in mid-December 1283 Ludgarda died suddenly and separated (evidenced by her death in Gniezno, away from Przemysł II's court in Poznań), raised suspicion that the death of the duchess was unnatural. Nobody, however, had evidence of this. Contributing to rumors was that in the 13th century medical knowledge was negligible, and therefore often sudden death of a <b>young</b> <b>person</b> was interpreted as unnatural. In addition, the duke's rejection of a proper mourning to his wife, who was universally liked, increased the suspicions against Przemysł II.|$|E

Among <b>younger</b> <b>persons</b> the result was the reverse. 3. Among <b>young</b> <b>persons,</b> low score items were eating between meals and exercise.

5|$|Cognitive deficits {{that can}} follow TBI include {{impaired}} attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive {{functions such as}} abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. Memory loss, the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured people, occurs in 20–79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity. People who have suffered TBI may also have difficulty with understanding or producing spoken or written language, or with more subtle aspects of communication such as body language. Post-concussion syndrome, a set of lasting symptoms experienced after mild TBI, can include physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral problems such as headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Multiple TBIs may have a cumulative effect. A <b>young</b> <b>person</b> who receives a second concussion before symptoms from another one have healed {{may be at risk}} for developing a very rare but deadly condition called second-impact syndrome, in which the brain swells catastrophically after even a mild blow, with debilitating or deadly results. About one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), which causes cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. Dementia pugilistica, the severe form of CTBI, affects primarily career boxers years after a boxing career. It commonly manifests as dementia, memory problems, and parkinsonism (tremors and lack of coordination).|$|E
