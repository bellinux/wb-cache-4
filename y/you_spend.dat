500|$|The lyrics for [...] "My Happiness" [...] {{were written}} by Bernard Fanning, Powderfinger's lead singer and songwriter. The rest of the band are co-credited with Fanning for {{composing}} the track. The song describes feelings of love and separation; Sains Pennie Dennison said it described [...] "the pining feeling you experience when <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> {{time away from the}} one you love". Fanning called it [...] "a sad story of touring and the absence loneliness that comes with it". The extensive time spent touring took its toll on the band, and it was on the back of this that Fanning wrote [...] "My Happiness". Thus, he expressed confusion at its being considered a romantic song.|$|E

[...] Aaron Curtiss of Los Angeles Times {{noted that the}} game [...] "demands thought". T. Liam McDonald of PC Gamer US called Thief, [...] "a challenging, riveting game that defies easy categorization", and praised the game for its focus on the player's cunning. Jason Cross of Computer Games Strategy Plus noted that [...] "It's quite amazing how much fun {{it can be to}} avoid action". Chan Chun of New Straits Times described the game as being [...] "incredibly immersive and suspenseful," [...] and [...] "a highly-recommended game for those yearning to be a night rogue." [...] Peter Olafson of GamePro praised the game's AI, and said that the game [...] "gets better ... the more time <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> with it".|$|E

Chair of the judging, editor of the Evening Standard newspaper Geordie Greig, said that the panel were basing their decision partially on the durability and memorability of the work, stating [...] "we were looking for quality". Speaking of the novel itself, Greig called it [...] "a rich and evocative historical novel which engrosses with its vivid portrait of pre-revolutionary France", stating [...] "The qualities of Pure stood out for its memorable gothic tale of morality and mortality." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} officially {{canceled}} by ABC on May 13, 2010. In {{an interview with}} New York Magazine, Victor Fresco, the show's creator, was asked why he thought the show didn't catch on. He responded, [...] "I think not enough people knew about it. It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of people watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> a lot of money advertising and promoting, or you have to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it. And I don’t think we got either of that". Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there for it, because I know that the people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|E

500|$|Outside of {{the battle}} system, GameSpot commented that the world map's [...] "sparsely {{detailed}} overhead view gives {{the impression of a}} board game, and you need to employ a puzzle-game mind-set to effectively use your limited pieces to clear the appropriate number of tiles. It's an interesting way to open up new places to explore, and it even ties in to the combat". Critics also praised the weapon customization system, [...] "the weapon upgrade system puts a unique spin on traditional standards. Although you do earn the occasional new gun, <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> more time enhancing your current firearm." [...] RPGamer gave the game its Most Original award, for presenting [...] "a gaming experience unlike any this past year", including a [...] "unique battle system" [...] emphasizing tactical combat, the strategic way in which [...] "the world map was opened up", the ability to [...] "modify almost every aspect of the characters' appearances", and [...] "the way that its story is told." [...] The game was the second runner-up for RPGamer's Best Console RPG and Most Overlooked awards.|$|E
500|$|Everything Everything {{went into}} the studio aiming to [...] "make people want to move", and set about {{avoiding}} slower-paced songs that had featured strongly on their previous album. This became apparent to them following the writing of eventual album closer [...] "Warm Healer". Lead vocalist, Jonathan Higgs, told Anthem Magazine that [...] "we kind of ripped up that rule book after realiing, 'Right. Let’s not write something this quiet. Let’s do horrible stuff from now on'". The group worked on ideas for songs as they came to them, rather than their previous method of practising and recording as a live group. Bass guitarist, Jeremy Pritchard, explained to Skiddle that the group were keen to create a record that would [...] "stand up for the huge amount of time <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> touring a record", which in turn inspired a more pop-oriented sound than had appeared on Arc. Higgs later discussed how they used their previous sound to inform the direction of Get to Heaven, seeking to avoid [...] "quiet songs" [...] and [...] "tenderness" [...] {{in an effort to}} [...] "inject a new fire into ourselves".|$|E
500|$|On July 7, he was {{selected}} to his seventh consecutive All-Star Game, played at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. [...] In the Reds' clubhouse for the All-Star Game, Molina shared a locker with Reds' second baseman Brandon Phillips. [...] Since the brawl between the Cardinals and Reds in 2010, [...] the two mended their schism, and Molina has a photograph of their families together. [...] When informed whose locker he was using, Molina replied, [...] "This is Phillips' locker? [...] How about that? [...] I'll have to write something to him." [...] While the pregame roster introductions were made, Reds fans booed all six Cardinals players who were selected, and even former Cardinal Albert Pujols. [...] When Molina was introduced, he smiled and turned and pointed his thumbs {{toward the back of}} his jersey. [...] Pujols provided levity when he then joined in the booing. [...] After the game, Molina remarked to reporters, [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> 12 years coming to Cincinnati and you beat them so many times, they’re going to boo you." [...] In his career to that point, he hit [...]319 with a [...]352 on-base percentage and [...]500 slugging percentage in 270 career at-bats at Great American Ball Park.|$|E

500|$|The Green Book's motto, {{displayed}} on the front cover, urged black travelers to [...] "Carry your Green Book with you – You may need it". The 1949 edition included a quote from Mark Twain: [...] "Travel is fatal to prejudice", inverting Twain's original meaning; as Cotton Seiler puts it, [...] "here it was the visited, rather than the visitors, who would find themselves enriched by the encounter." [...] Green commented in 1940 that the Green Book had given black Americans [...] "something authentic to travel by and to make traveling better for the Negro." [...] Its principal goal was to provide accurate information on black-friendly accommodations to answer the constant question that faced black drivers: [...] "Where will <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> the night?" [...] As well as essential information on lodgings, service stations and garages, it provided details of leisure facilities open to African Americans, including beauty salons, restaurants, nightclubs and country clubs. The listings focused on four main categories– hotels, motels, tourist homes (private residences, usually owned by African Americans, which provided accommodation to travelers), and restaurants. They were arranged by state and subdivided by city, giving {{the name and address}} of each business. For an extra payment, businesses could have their listing displayed in bold type or have a star next to it to denote that they were [...] "recommended".|$|E
500|$|... "Call the Shots" [...] is a dance-pop and pop rock track {{written in}} the key of D major and with a {{moderate}} tempo of 126 beats per minute. Unlike previous singles released by the band, the song follows the verse–chorus form. The lyrics {{are concerned with the}} ending of a relationship, and opens with a repetitive melody followed by Coyle singing, [...] "Static tone on the phone, I'll be breaking again / Must be something better babe". As the chorus begins, the five members of the group trade lines and sing, [...] "Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me / It really doesn't faze me how <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> your time", with Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stating that [...] "only anterograde amnesia could wipe [...] from your brain". During the middle-eight, Roberts sings lyrics that were the inspiration for Girls Aloud's autobiography Dreams that Glitter – Our Story, released in 2008: [...] "I've seen life burn bright, seen it shimmer / Then fade like starlight to a glimmer, oh no / I've seen life flow by like a river / So full of twilight, dreams that glitter". Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy said that the instrumentation of [...] "Call the Shots" [...] was based on 1990s dance productions, and added that it incorporated [...] "oohs" [...] and [...] "ah ah ahs" [...] that [...] "reverberate around an infectious chorus," ...|$|E
