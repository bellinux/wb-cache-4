25|$|On June 10, 2016, Eisley {{revealed}} {{that they had}} begun the process of recording their fifth studio record {{with the assistance of}} producer Will Yip at the band's own studio in Tyler {{at the beginning of the}} month. DuPree-Bemis spoke of the new album in the band's press release, mentioning that, “Musically, you could say it’s classic Eisley, in the sense that it’s melodic, moody pop and is written from the heart. Lyrically, it’s very whimsical; it has a vibe that will take <b>you</b> <b>into</b> its own world and let you escape your normal life for a few minutes. I like to cloak things in a little mystery and romance; I think it’s part of what makes all of Eisley’s songs sound like they’re from the same world. Every record is like opening and reading a book in a series.” Tracking for the album concluded in early July, with mention of plans to release the record in early 2017.|$|E

25|$|Time is {{a natural}} force from which {{none of us is}} immune. This theme pervades the sonnet; the speaker recognizes that time will strip the beloved of his beauty and by saying that implies that time will take his beloved from him. Eventually, time will consume {{everyone}} in death, and, whether one chooses to recognize it or not, he will not have any control over exactly when that consumption will take place. This theme translates to Julius Caesar as well. Caesar is unfazed by the soothsayer's proclamation in act one, and even though Calpurnia seems for a time to have succeeded in keeping Caesar home on the day of his eventual murder, he goes to Senate anyway. Caesar walks into his own death, much less literally than Brutus, who does actually walk into the sword that kills him. But in these deaths {{in the context of the}} play serve to elucidate the truth that death (or 'Time', as the sonnet refers to it) will consume you regardless of your ambitions or future plans; it does not take <b>you</b> <b>into</b> consideration. Obviously, Caesar would not have gone to Senate if he knew he would be stabbed upon entering, just as Brutus and Cassius would not have engaged in a full-blown war if they knew they would be dead before it was over.|$|E

500|$|... "Love You To" [...] was {{the third}} track the Beatles {{recorded}} for Revolver, after [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and [...] "Got to Get <b>You</b> <b>Into</b> My Life". Rodriguez comments that [...] "Love You To" [...] " [...] explicit the Indian influence implicit throughout the entire album", as songs such as [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and [...] "Got to Get <b>You</b> <b>Into</b> My Life", together with the non-album single tracks [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] and [...] "Rain", all incorporate drone sounds or otherwise display the limited harmonic movement that typifies the genre. In a 1997 interview, Harrison said that the song's inclusion reflected the band's willingness to experiment during this period, adding: [...] "We were listening {{to all sorts of}} things, Stockhausen, avant-garde music, whatever, and most of it made its way onto our records." ...|$|E
500|$|Desson Thomson from The Washington Post {{wrote that}} [...] "just {{as he did}} in The Sixth Sense, writer-director M.

500|$|... "One of These Days" [...] was {{developed}} around an ostinato bassline created by Roger Waters, by feeding the output through a Binson Echorec.

500|$|The Hollywood Reporter John DeFore {{called the}} film [...] "genuinely moving" [...] and [...] "effortlessly {{balanced}} ... Brett Pawlak's handheld camerawork and Cretton's unsentimental direction have a frankness that acknowledges the dramatic extremes in these lives without needing to parade {{it before the}} audience." [...] Manohla Dargis from The New York Times also praised Cretton's direction, saying he [...] "brings <b>you</b> <b>into</b> this coed group home {{and the lives of}} its inhabitants casually, with images and scenes that, no matter how transparently considered, feel {{as if they had been}} caught on the fly." ...|$|E
500|$|EMI's Parlophone label {{released}} Revolver on 5 August 1966, {{one week}} before the Beatles began their final North American tour. [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] was sequenced between Lennon's song about a New York doctor who administered amphetamine doses to his wealthy patients, [...] "Doctor Robert", and [...] "Got to Get <b>You</b> <b>into</b> My Life", which McCartney said he wrote as [...] "an ode to pot". For the North American version of Revolver, however, Capitol Records omitted [...] "Doctor Robert", together with two other Lennon-written tracks; as a result, the eleven-song US release reinforced the level of contribution from McCartney and from Harrison.|$|E
500|$|The next biblical quotation, verse 13 of the gospel, [...] "" [...] (But {{when that}} one, the Spirit of Truth, shall come, He shall lead <b>you</b> <b>into</b> all truth.) is {{rendered}} by the choir.

500|$|In her 1993 {{review of}} Paul's Say Something, Debbie Catalano wrote, [...] "Ellis Paul draws {{a picture with}} his words then draws <b>you</b> <b>into</b> the world he's painting." [...] Like a Norman Rockwell painting, Paul's songs are replete with crucial details and careful {{observations}} that tell a story with a minimum or words. [...] In a 2002 article, Thomas Conner dissected a verse from Paul's [...] "Conversation with a Ghost" [...] from Say Something. [...] "Instead of bluntly saying, [...] "I ran into an old flame in Central Park", Paul writes around it, avoiding the clichés, painting the picture, showing us everything—the motives, the setting, the serendipity—except what we expect." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole, {{who plays}} junior FBI agent Astrid Farnsworth, {{described}} the episode in a May 2009 interview, [...] "It's about spontaneously combusting. This is the episode I get {{to get out}} of the lab. I remember thinking I can't wait to see what the set's going to look like and how they will make it look when the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was so funny because I thought there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads <b>you</b> <b>into</b> the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Another memorable line is [...] "Money doesn't talk, it swears," [...] {{which appears}} in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.

500|$|Writing for the New York Post, Lou Lumenick {{considered}} {{the film to}} be Scott's and Damon's best and thought {{that it is a}} [...] "straightforward and thrilling survival-and-rescue adventure, without the metaphysical and emotional trappings of Interstellar." [...] Manohla Dargis, of The New York Times, stated that the film, [...] "involves a dual journey into outer and inner space, a trip that takes <b>you</b> <b>into</b> that immensity called the universe and deep into the equally vast landscape of a single consciousness. For this accidental castaway, space is the place where he’s physically marooned, but also where his mind is set free", from a film director, whose [...] "great, persistent theme is {{what it means to be}} human".|$|E
500|$|Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune, {{felt that}} the film was [...] "far better as an antiwar film than as a poetic tribute to flight". Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote, [...] "It feels morose and unrelieved, {{despite the efforts of}} ..." [...] Variety wrote, [...] "Belying the lightheartedness of its title, Birdy is a heavy adult drama about best friends and the after-effects of war, but it takes too long {{to live up to its}} ambitious premise." [...] Jack Zink of the Sun-Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "takes a while to hook <b>you</b> <b>into</b> its story. This is one {{occasion}} we can afford the wait; Parker keeps us awake by repeatedly slapping us across the face visually." ...|$|E
500|$|Though DeLonge {{hoped to}} retain the angst present in the band's past work, he wanted to [...] "deliver it in a package that's very modern, using {{instrumentations}} and formulas to launch <b>you</b> <b>into</b> different places with music that is not just three-chord pop-punk with riffs." [...] He later felt the album was not progressive as he had wished: [...] "I'm thinking, 'Why don't we do this? Why don't we create these landscapes?' I {{think we should have}} been pushing ourselves, and trying to push the genre forward." [...] Likewise, Barker felt DeLonge wanted their music to be derivative of groups such as U2 or Coldplay, commenting, [...] "For us, we were always like 'Blink is Blink, man. We want to sound like fucking Blink-182.'" ...|$|E
