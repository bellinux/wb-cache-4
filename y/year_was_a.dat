5|$|After sailing for the Clyde {{and back}} to New York in July on its first mercy mission, Blanche F. Sigman moved to its new homeport of Charleston in August 1944. Sailing later that month, the Sigman headed to the Mersey and Liverpool. In October the ship sailed for Gibraltar, Oran, and Leghorn. In December, it {{repeated}} its previous voyage but also stopped at Naples as well, eventually making its way back to Charleston in January 1945. Throughout 1945, the hospital ship made six transatlantic treks, visiting Marseille three times, Naples, Oran, Gibraltar, Milford Haven, Wales, Avonmouth, Cherbourg, and Horta. The Sigmans sixth mission of the <b>year</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> return trip to Cherbourg that ended with a return to its new homeport of New York.|$|E

5|$|Although Poore's Brickworks {{was well}} established, Jones {{believed}} there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10million bricks a year. It was decided that 5million bricks per <b>year</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network. Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.|$|E
5|$|He did {{not play}} in the England's 7–1 defeat to Hungary in Budapest in May 1954. However {{he was in the}} squad for the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland. Matthews helped England to a 4–4 draw with Belgium, though was left out of a win over Switzerland, before he {{returned}} to the first XI as England crashed out of the competition with a 4–2 defeat to Uruguay at the St. Jakob Stadium after mistakes from goalkeeper Gil Merrick. His third match of the <b>year</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 win over Northern Ireland at Windsor Park in the 1955 British Home Championship, though on the pitch he did not gel well with Don Revie. Matthews then put in a superb in a 2–0 win over the Welsh, before he helped England to record a 3–1 victory over World Champions West Germany, though only three of the Germans used at Wembley had been in the first XI in the World Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (1797–1871) {{started making}} pianos in 1835 {{from his house}} in Seesen {{at the edge of}} the Harz mountains; a source of fine beech and spruce wood for the instruments. Among the pianos that Steinweg {{produced}} in his first <b>year</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> square piano designed by and built for Friedrick Grotrian. (This instrument is now in the Braunschweig museum.) H.E. Steinweg entered three of his pianos in a state fair in 1839, two of them square pianos, but his grand piano brought wide notice. In 1850, H.E. Steinweg took most of his large family to New York City, leaving the piano factory to his eldest son C.F. Theodor Steinweg (1825–1889) who stayed behind to run it under his own name. Meanwhile, in New York City, the Steinweg family Americanized their surname to Steinway and in 1853 they founded the piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons.|$|E

5|$|In late July, a monsoon {{depression}} moved {{across much of}} India, and another monsoon disturbance persisted {{off the coast of}} Pakistan. The interaction between the two systems resulted in heavy rainfall across the region, flooding dozens of villages. Monsoonal rainfall killed 285people between Pakistan and India in the summer of 2003. In late August, another {{monsoon depression}} moved across northeastern India. A depression that struck Andhra Pradesh in India killed 21people in early October. Later that month, a tropical depression crossed Thailand from the western Pacific Ocean, contributing to ongoing flooding that killed 19. Once in the Indian Ocean, this system struck southeastern India without causing much damage. The last system of the <b>year</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> cyclonic storm that struck southeastern India in December, killing 81people and causing $28million in damage (2003USD).|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{entered his}} 2006 junior {{season in the}} running for the Biletnikoff Award and Heisman Trophy.

Johnson tallied 1,202 yards on 76catches. Johnson's 15touchdowns in 2006 was a new Georgia Tech single-season record. Against the West Virginia Mountaineers in the Toyota Gator Bowl, Johnson had nine catches for 186yards and two touchdowns, albeit in a losing effort.|$|E
5|$|On 27 January 1647, the Venetians lost Tommaso Morosini, {{when his}} ship {{was forced to}} face the entire Ottoman fleet of 45 galleys. In the ensuing fight, Morosini was killed, but managed to cause {{significant}} casualties to the Ottomans, including Koca Musa Pasha himself. The ship itself was rescued by the timely arrival of the Venetian fleet under the new Captain General, Giovanni Battista Grimani. This stand-off, where a single ship had caused such damage and casualties to the entire Ottoman fleet, was a major blow to Ottoman morale. Despite some successes like a raid in Çeşme, {{the remainder of the}} <b>year</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> failure for the Venetians, as several attempts to blockade Ottoman harbors failed to stem the flow of supplies and reinforcements to Crete.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{principal}} sources of revenue Hamilton prevailed upon Congress to approve was an excise tax on whiskey. In his first Tariff Bill in January 1790, Hamilton proposed to raise the three million dollars needed to pay for government operating expenses and interest on domestic and foreign debts {{by means of an}} increase on duties on imported wines, distilled spirits, tea, coffee, and domestic spirits. It failed, with Congress complying with most recommendations excluding the excise tax on Whiskey (Madison's tariff of the same <b>year</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> modification of Hamilton's that involved only imported duties and was passed in September).|$|E
5|$|The Igu Aro festival (counting of the <b>year)</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> royal festival the eze Nri used to {{maintain}} his influence over the communities under his authority. Each of these communities sent representatives to pay tribute during the ceremony to show their loyalty. At the end the Eze Nri would give the representatives a yam medicine and a blessing of fertility for their communities. The festival {{was seen as a}} day of peace and certain activities were prohibited such as the planting of crops before the day of the ceremony, the splitting of wood and unnecessary noise. Igu Aro was a regular event that gave an opportunity for the eze to speak directly to all the communities under him.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} <b>year</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{strong one}} as Jim Brown gritted out another league-leading rushing season. The Browns ended with an 11–3 record and comfortably won the eastern division. That {{set up a}} second straight appearance in the NFL Championship game against the Packers on a slippery, mucky Lambeau Field on January 2, 1966. While the score was close early on, Vince Lombardi's team held the Browns scoreless in the second half, winning 23–12 in an upset on a Paul Hornung touchdown. After the season, the NFL and the competing American Football League agreed to merge starting in 1970, but would play an inter-league championship from the 1966 season onward. The 1965 championship thus became the NFL's last before the Super Bowl era, which ushered in a new age of popularity and prosperity for professional football.|$|E

5|$|William {{returned}} to England to release his army from service in 1073 but quickly {{returned to}} Normandy, {{where he spent}} all of 1074. He left England {{in the hands of}} his supporters, including Richard fitzGilbert and William de Warenne, as well as Lanfranc. William's ability to leave England for an entire <b>year</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sign that he felt that his control of the kingdom was secure. While William was in Normandy, Edgar the Ætheling returned to Scotland from Flanders. The French king, seeking a focus for those opposed to William's power, then proposed that Edgar be given the castle of Montreuil-sur-Mer on the Channel, which would have given Edgar a strategic advantage against William. Edgar was forced to submit to William shortly thereafter, however, and he returned to William's court. Philip, although thwarted in this attempt, turned his attentions to Brittany, leading to a revolt in 1075.|$|E
