In the pilot, Coach Taylor's protege and star quarterback Jason Street (Scott Porter), suffers a spinal injury that ends his football career. He faces life as a paraplegic. At first, Street struggles with these disabilities and the upturn of his life. Gradually, he copes with his new reality.

5|$|Agârbiceanu visited Bucharest, the Old Kingdom capital, in 1906, {{and sent}} {{enthusiastic}} travel notes for Unirea. He became {{a regular contributor}} to the Bucharest nationalist review Sămănătorul, which gave De la țară a sonorous welcome, and later to Sămănătoruls leftist rival, Viața Românească. From 1909, he {{was also one of the}} regulars at Neamul Românesc. For his literary activity, he was elected a corresponding member of Astra in 1912, and was promoted to full membership in 1925. From 1910 to 1919, he was parish priest at Orlat in Sibiu County. Agârbiceanu was also a member of Austria-Hungary's Romanian National Party (PNR), and supported PNR <b>youth</b> <b>leader</b> Octavian Goga, his colleague at Luceafărul and Tribuna. In 1910, he followed Goga as he parted from the PNR and launched his own independent faction.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Griffin {{was invited}} to address {{a meeting at the}} University of Bath by {{politics}} student and BNP <b>youth</b> <b>leader</b> Danny Lake. Lake wanted Griffin to visit the university and explain the BNP's policies to lecturers and students. The invitation was viewed by some as an attempt by the party to establish a foothold on the university campus. Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the decision to allow the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety, the University cancelled the invitation.|$|E

The section chief is the elected <b>youth</b> <b>leader,</b> a volunteer adult is appointed as the section adviser, {{and the area}} director (or his designate) is the professional (staff) adviser. In addition to the section chief, the section has two additional elected officers.

5|$|The <b>youth</b> <b>leader</b> of {{the troop}} {{is the senior}} patrol leader (SPL), elected by the Scouts in the troop. He is {{responsible}} for the overall performance of the troop, runs troop meetings and ensures that the program for troop meetings and other activities is carried out. He is advised by the Scoutmaster. There may also be one or more assistant senior patrol leaders. Each patrol elects a patrol leader who then appoints an assistant patrol leader and other positions within the patrol. Together, the senior patrol leader, assistant senior patrol leader and patrol leaders make up the patrol leaders council (PLC), the group of Scouts that is responsible for developing the troop's program with the advice of the Scoutmaster.|$|E
5|$|At around 11:00 pm on 1 May, Bormann {{left the}} Führerbunker with SS doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler <b>Youth</b> <b>leader</b> Artur Axmann, and Hitler's pilot Hans Baur {{as members of}} one of the groups {{attempting}} {{to break out of the}} Soviet encirclement. Bormann carried with him a copy of Hitler's last will and testament. The group left the Führerbunker and travelled on foot via a U-Bahn tunnel to the Friedrichstraße station, where they surfaced. Several members of the party attempted to cross the Spree River at the Weidendammer Bridge while crouching behind a Tiger tank. The tank was hit by Soviet artillery and destroyed, and Bormann and Stumpfegger were knocked to the ground. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and several others eventually crossed the river on their third attempt. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and Axmann walked along the railway tracks to Lehrter station, where Axmann decided to leave the others and go in the opposite direction. When he encountered a Red Army patrol, Axmann doubled back. He saw two bodies, which he later identified as Bormann and Stumpfegger, on a bridge near the railway switching yard. He did not have time to check thoroughly, so he did not know how they died. Since the Soviets never admitted to finding Bormann's body, his fate remained in doubt for many years.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} {{dissertation}} was to produce a model of youth leadership development, rooted in a youth engagement framework, created through the voices of <b>youth</b> <b>leaders</b> themselves. Participants were 16 <b>youth</b> <b>leaders</b> in the Respect in Schools Everywhere (RISE) Program, a school-based, youth engagement, anti-violence program. Three different qualitative methodologies were utilized to analyze the interviews of <b>youth</b> <b>leaders</b> to develop and validate this model of youth leadership development. Specifically, an inductive, cross-case and a deductive case-based thematic analysis of pre- and post-program interviews of seven <b>youth</b> <b>leaders</b> were conducted to describe and develop the model of youth leadership. A template analysis of nine other youth leaders’ post-program interviews was conducted to validate, confirm, and expand the model. A final model of youth leadership development was created that answers the following questions: (i) How do <b>youth</b> <b>leaders</b> understand and conceptualize leadership? (ii) What leadership-related development do the <b>youth</b> <b>leaders</b> report through their experience in a youth engagement program? (iii) What youth engagement programmatic practices, or mechanisms, {{are associated with the}} leadership-related outcomes? Specifically, youth conceptualized leadership as sharing knowledge, taking initiative, being a role model, having social skills, being respectful, and as a group process. For youth, leadership was seen as a collective capacity; one that relies on a team-based approach. Through applying the main tenets of youth engagement, such as meaningful involvement, opportunities to lead, and the support of a caring adult, youth endorsed development in their leadership skills, social network, self-concept, and engagement in their school and community. Overall, {{the findings of this study}} suggest that youth engagement is a promising model for developing <b>youth</b> <b>leaders.</b> Further, not only do youth have insights and skills to impact their schools and communities, but they also have important contributions to make to the development of theory and practice...|$|R
5|$|Persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany {{followed}} the Nazi takeover. Hitler {{moved quickly to}} eliminate political Catholicism, rounding up functionaries of the Catholic-aligned Bavarian People's Party and Catholic Centre Party, which along with all other non-Nazi political parties ceased to exist by July. The Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat) treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933, amid continuing harassment {{of the church in}} Germany. The treaty required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. Hitler routinely disregarded the Concordat, closing all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders were targeted, with thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped-up charges of currency smuggling or immorality. Several high-profile Catholic lay leaders were targeted in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives assassinations. Most Catholic youth groups refused to dissolve themselves and Hitler <b>Youth</b> <b>leader</b> Baldur von Schirach encouraged members to attack Catholic boys in the streets. Propaganda campaigns claimed the church was corrupt, restrictions were placed on public meetings and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.|$|E

25|$|While driving {{together}} {{on their way}} to a Scouting function in Pocatello, Idaho, Dr. Mortensen proposed they call their program “Varsity Scouting”. The name fit.

An award, the Varsity Scout Letter, was designated as the top award for Varsity Scouts.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Multisectorial {{actions are}} needed to fight against sedentariness. Youth {{organizations}} (YO) gather thousands {{of children and adolescents}} each weekend. Most of them propose to develop all dimensions of the individuals and to contribute to the education of the youth. Unfortunately, very few studies are available to confirm if this is the case. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the <b>youth</b> <b>leaders</b> consider that they play a role in physical activity (PA) promotion. Methods. A questionnaire was developed and tested by a pilot study. It comprised four parts (Introduction, Descriptive variables; <b>Youth</b> <b>leader’s</b> representations about PA; <b>Youth</b> <b>leader’s</b> representations about the role of the YO in PA promotion). Most of the questions were Lickert scales. Answers of 232 <b>youth</b> <b>leaders</b> were analysed. They were belonging to all youth movements of the Liege area. Results. <b>Youth</b> <b>leaders</b> tended to support the idea that YO have to play a role in PA promotion: 57. 3 % totally agree on the fact that YO allows youth to be physically active; 40. 1 % consider that it is effectively the case. On the other hand, only 1. 3 % believes that their group attend to sports during YO’s activities and 4. 7 % that youth use what they learn about PA in YO in their everyday life. Conclusions This study emphasized that YO should be more involved as an determining actor in the overall PA promotion and that <b>youth</b> <b>leaders</b> should be more systematically informed and prepared about the potential role that they could play...|$|R
