25|$|Jayceon Terrell Taylor (born November 29, 1979), {{better known}} by his stage name The Game (or simply Game), is an American rapper and actor. The Game {{is best known}} as a rapper in the West Coast hip hop scene and for being one of Dr. Dre's signers under Aftermath Records. Born in Compton, California, he {{released}} his first mixtape <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>It</b> Is Vol. 1 in 2002; shortly after, he was signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment label. He rose to fame in 2005 with the success of his major-label debut album The Documentary and found continued success with the 2006 follow-up Doctor's Advocate. The Recording Industry Association of America certified The Documentary double platinum in March 2005.|$|E
25|$|While {{recovering}} in {{the hospital}} from gunshot wounds he incurred in late 2001, Game told his brother {{to go out and}} buy all of the classic hip-hop albums. Over the course of five months, he studied all of the various influential rap albums and developed a strategy to turn himself into a rapper. With the help of his older brother Big Fase, they founded the label. It originally featured such artists as Glasses Malone, Vita, and Nu Jerzey Devil, along with Game himself. His stage name was coined by his grandmother, who was a huge fan of the 1997 blockbuster, The Game. Game first gained prominence when he attended a hip-hop summit hosted by Russell Simmons and Louis Farrakhan. After he had fully recovered, Game and Big Fase made a mixtape together. He released his first mixtape <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>It</b> Is Vol. 1 in 2002, and landed a record deal with the independent label Get Low Recordz owned by JT the Bigga Figga.|$|E

But <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>It</b> taught me a valuable lesson. It taught me that I was getting way too intense during the game. It let me know I wanted to win way too bad. I had to calm down. I wanted to win at all costs. Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game, I only thought about winning." ...|$|E

500|$|Robyn's debut studio album Robyn Is Here {{was issued}} in Sweden in 1995, {{followed}} by a North American release two years later. The record sold 1.5 million copies worldwide, per sales reports provided by BMG Sweden, and spawned the releases of the top-ten singles [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> (<b>What</b> <b>It</b> Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love". Robyn Is Here also achieved a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million units. In 1998, Robyn returned to Sweden after spending nearly 12 months on tour in North America. She told Billboard, [...] "I returned [...] from my year in the U.S. [...] I was so extremely tired of everything, including myself and my music." [...] She then began working on her second studio album, to be titled My Truth. Robyn enlisted Ulf Lindström, Johan Ekhé, Christian Falk, Billy Mann, Cherno Jah, Masters at Work, Ken Fambro and Internal Dread to produce the project. She had previously collaborated with Lindström, Ekhé and Falk on Robyn Is Here.|$|E
500|$|... "Electric" [...] {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. While reviewing My Truth, {{a writer for}} Nöjesguiden particularly commended the single and [...] "Main Thing". The writer praised the extended intro of [...] "Electric", calling the first [...] 90 seconds [...] "magical". John Lucas of AllMusic deemed the single a stand-out and described it as [...] "distinctive" [...] and [...] "minimal". Aftonbladet Per Bjurman praised the electronic funk sound. [...] "Electric" [...] made its debut on the Sverigetopplistan singles chart at number eight on 22 April 1999. The next week, it ascended to acquire a peak position at number six. It became Robyn's third top-ten single on the chart, following [...] "Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)" [...] and [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> (<b>What</b> <b>It</b> Takes)". [...] "Electric" [...] stayed in the top-ten for four weeks, and remained on the chart for fourteen weeks in total.

500|$|Two critics from Pitchfork Media {{reviewed}} [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{separately from}} Night Time, My Time. Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth-best song released in 2013. She spoke favorably of its lyrical content, commending the chorus lyrics [...] "How could <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{feels like to}} fight the hounds of hell?" [...] and [...] "You think you know me so well" [...] for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for [...] "bullied high school weirdos", and appreciating that the lines [...] "I know it's not your fault / That you don't understand / I blame myself" [...] for acknowledging her own wrongdoings {{with the intention of}} starting anew. Jillian Mapes complimented the [...] "bluntness" [...] that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had [...] "anthem potential". She praised the verses for verbalizing self-confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines [...] "I’m just a face without a choice / Trust you’d never like to guess what I think above the shoulders." [...] She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a [...] "declaration of force [...] a song about the power of vulnerability" [...] rather than confusing it for an [...] "admission of weakness".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{initially}} {{set for a}} late 2004 release, however, since the other high-profile albums—including Eminem's Encore—were to be released around the same time, it was pushed back to January 18, 2005. On September 28, 2004 The Game released a promotional album entitled Westside Story through Aftermath Entertainment and G-Unit Records. The album was used to promote his major-label debut album, The Documentary.

500|$|As {{the sets}} were {{being built in}} Las Vegas, {{producer}} Frank Mancuso, Jr., son of Paramount president Frank Mancuso, Sr., had the screenplay rewritten in secret, and gave Bakshi a new screenplay by screenwriters Michael Grais and Mark Victor that [...] "was barely the same". Larry Gross {{also contributed to the}} script, but his work would later go on to be uncredited. In interviews {{at the time of the}} film's release, Mancuso, Jr., who was best known for the Friday the 13th franchise, stated a desire to move away from horror films, and wanted to produce a film [...] "about what happens when someone creates a world, becomes defined by it, and then can't escape [...] a film about being trapped by your own creation." [...] Bakshi remembers that he got into a fight with Mancuso, Jr. and [...] "punched [...] in the mouth." [...] Paramount threatened Bakshi with a lawsuit if he refused to complete the film. [...] "I thought if I did the animation well, it would be worth it, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>It</b> wasn't worth it." [...] Bakshi also stated that he [...] "had a lot of animators there that I'd brought in and I thought that maybe I could just have fun animating this stuff, which I did." [...] Bakshi had developed the film as a mix of comedy and horror that he described as [...] "a hard R-rated story" [...] but Paramount wanted a PG-13 film, one of the reasons for the doomed and angry relationship between filmmaker and studio.|$|E

500|$|... "Put You on the Game" [...] was {{the fifth}} and final {{official}} single from The Documentary. The single was the lowest charting single from the album, reaching only at 96 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. The single attained respectable international charting. In the United Kingdom the single entered on the UK Singles Chart at number 46, and in the Republic of Ireland the single entered on the Irish Singles Chart at number 22. The single was produced by Timbaland and co-produced by Danja. This was the first single released by The Game after his truce with 50 Cent fell apart and after The Game released <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>It</b> Is Vol. 3.

During the DVD Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin The Game watches the video for this song pausing at specific spots in the video which shows a dead man at on the ground blocked off by police tape. The Game then repeatedly states that he is wearing G-Unit sneakers, a diss at 50 Cent saying his career is dead. Damon Johnson directed the music video. Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "club track so crunkalicious, it's almost shocking that a California newbie — not a Ludacris — was the recipient of its deep-fried Southern charms." [...] The song was placed 44th on about.com's Best Hip-Hop Songs of 2005.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2006, Game {{extended}} {{a peace treaty}} to 50 Cent, which was not immediately replied to. However, a couple days later on Power 106, he stated that the treaty was only offered for one day. On Game's album Doctor's Advocate, he says the feud is over on {{a few of the}} songs. The feud seemed to have gained steam after Tony Yayo allegedly slapped the fourteen-year-old son of Czar Entertainment CEO Jimmy Rosemond.

2500|$|In {{his papers}} of 1935, Istrati {{presents}} himself exclusively {{as an enemy}} of [...] "the Jewish bourgeoisie", a class he describes as [...] "corrupt, pseudo-humanitarian, pseudo-democratic" [...] and accuses of stirring up scandal. Istrati's articles in Cruciada Românismului are more adamantly philosemitic. One of them, [...] "A Letter to Love", led {{to a series of}} articles on the subject, from Stelescu and other Crusade people. In his own articles, Talex answered for the Stelist movement: [...] "Panait Istrati, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is we need? A fist... The Crusade of Romanianism will attempt to become that fist... Our antisemitism? Just the same as yours: a humane one.

The song [...] "Show Me Love" [...] was used prominently in the 1998 Lukas Moodysson film Fucking Åmål, and the song's title was used as the film's title in English-speaking countries. As Robyn's popularity grew across the globe, and especially in the US, she was diagnosed with exhaustion and returned to Sweden to recover.|$|E
