5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth {{would be unable to}} see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E

500|$|The band {{suffered}} a setback, however, when Wentz had an emotional breakdown in February 2005, culminating in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. He had {{withdrawn from the}} rest of the group, with his condition only apparent through his lyrics, and had also become obsessed with the recent Indian tsunami and his own self-doubt. [...] "It is particularly overwhelming when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cusp of doing something very big and thinking that it will be a big flop," [...] he said later. Wentz swallowed a handful of Ativan anxiety pills (he described the act as [...] "hypermedicating") in the Chicago Best Buy parking lot. After being rushed to the hospital and having his stomach pumped, Wentz moved back home to Wilmette to live with his parents.|$|E
500|$|In 1916, Coach Yost {{shared his}} {{recollections}} of the Buffalo game with Big Bill Edwards: [...] "Buffalo University came to Michigan with a much-heralded team. They were coached by a Dartmouth man {{and had not}} been scored upon. Buffalo papers referred to Michigan as the Woolly Westerners, and the Buffalo enthusiasts placed bets that Michigan would not score." [...] The score {{at the end of}} the first half was 65 to 0. About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, [...] "on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket." [...] Yost was curious and asked, [...] "Simpson, what are you doing over here? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong side." [...] To which, Simpson replied, [...] "Don't say anything. I know where I am at. The coach has put me in three times already and I'm not going in there again. Enough is enough for any one. I've had mine." ...|$|E
500|$|John Colonnello, a youth pastor from Athens, Alabama, criticized Rihanna's {{failure as}} a role model for young girls and women who look up to her. Colonello said that Rihanna is {{promoting}} the importance of one's physical appearance, and unhealthy sex: [...] "the message should be that it's about who <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside and your character. That you should be honest, trustworthy, faithful, kind, loving, compassionate and more." [...] The video is the third by Rihanna in 2011 to receive a negative reaction from organizations; [...] "S" [...] was banned from eleven countries due to its explicit sexual content, while [...] "Man Down" [...] attracted media attention when the Parents Television Council (PTC) criticized Rihanna for depicting a [...] "cold, calculated execution of murder" [...] in the video and for portraying a scenario of rape. On November 23, 2011, the music video for [...] "We Found Love" [...] was banned from broadcast before 10pm in France, owing to its violent, dangerous, and sexually suggestive nature. Ulster Cancer Foundation, an anti-smoking organization, condemned Rihanna for smoking in the music video. Doreen Reegan, a spokesperson for the organization, commented on the singer's decision to include smoking as part of her promotional image, saying: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1946, Argentine President Juan Perón began {{transforming}} Argentina into a one-party {{state with}} the assistance of his wife, Evita. Almost immediately, the spoils system was the rule of the day, as ideological critics of the ruling Partido Justicialista were fired from government jobs. During this period, Borges was informed that he was being [...] "promoted" [...] from his position at the Miguel Cané Library to a post as inspector of poultry and rabbits at the Buenos Aires municipal market.

500|$|In 2006, Hoffman {{was named}} to his fifth All-Star game, but was the losing pitcher in the game after having two strikes with two outs to Michael Young, who was later named the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player. His All-Star {{performance}} bothered him, and he suffered two of his five blown saves that year in the week that followed. August 20 marked Hoffman's 776th outing for the Padres, breaking the Pirates Elroy Face's major league record for most relief appearances with one club. On September 24 in the Padres last home game of the year, Hoffman retired eventual 2006 NL batting champion Freddy Sanchez for the final out of a 2–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates, keeping the Padres [...] game lead atop the NL West with seven games left to play. With the save, Hoffman became the all-time Major League saves leader, surpassing Lee Smith's record of 478. As the Padres celebrated on the mound with Hoffman, the Pirates remained in the dugout watching in respectful salute. [...] "I've never seen a crowd get into one inning for one guy like that before", said Pirates reliever John Grabow. [...] "You get goose bumps even if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other team." [...] The Padres presented Hoffman with a golden bell trophy, a reference to [...] "Hells Bells".|$|E

2500|$|In a 2002 {{interview}} with The Observer, Kaplický said: [...] "The {{world is full}} of beautiful things, {{and you have to be}} observant as an architect – if not, you are in trouble. Creativity is everywhere. ... The initial idea for a job comes to me literally just like that sometimes, and if that first idea is good then <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right track. It's not a sign of creativity to have 65 ideas for one problem, that's just a waste of energy. I also don't think you need to go anywhere particular to be creative; people just use that as an excuse. But I do think a lot of creativity depends on your relationships with other people, your personal relationships, your partner or whatever. Your personal happiness or unhappiness comes out in your work, it's a reflection of your emotional state and you can't separate the two." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ørsted Pedersen {{worked in}} duo and trio {{arrangements}} with pianist Kenny Drew, recording over 50 albums together. He {{also worked with}} Stéphane Grappelli and Joe Pass and recorded extensively as a leader. His best known songs are [...] "My Little Anna", [...] "Jaywalkin'", and [...] "The Puzzle", as well as jazz arrangements of traditional Danish folk songs. A duo performance with Rune Gustafsson at Vossajazz 1980, concluded on the album Just The Way <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> label Sonet Gramofon, recorded half a year after this first meeting. He was awarded the Nordic Council Music Prize in 1991.

He was presumably the most sought-after Danish instrumentalist internationally ever, and had traveled and recorded with a series of the greatest jazz soloists internationally.|$|E
2500|$|The ride {{starts with}} an indoor section, where riders pass Jigsaw's {{equipment}} and Billy on his tricycle, who laughs {{as the train}} passes by. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second dispatched car (two cars are dispatched one after the other, seemingly plunging them directly into a pit of strobe-lit spikes which are narrowly avoided), the vehicle will stop while Billy gives a speech, informing {{you that there is}} no escape, and proclaiming, [...] "Here's what happens when you lose", before allowing the train to pass – this regulates the distance between cars. Riders then approach two dimly-lit swinging blades which appear to get closer, before a hidden drop that is nearly vertical moves riders out of the way. Air blasts at riders imitating the firing of syringes from loaded crossbows, which appear to miss over riders' heads. The train then enters a heartline roll, as riders can see Jigsaw in a pool of blood. Water is sprayed at the train during the roll to imitate blood, and a loud scream can be heard at the same time. The train exits the warehouse and travels towards the [...] vertical lift hill.|$|E
40|$|In the pretend map {{above the}} grid {{reference}} {{for the church}} is 222563. This is because the closest line {{to the left of}} the church is 22 and the church it self is about 2 tenths of the way across between line 22 and 23, hence line 22 + 2 tenths = 222. The next bit is exactly the same, except this time you read up from line 56, ten 3 more tenths until you reach the church, hence 56 + 3 tenths = 563.
