On one occasion he even saved Alcibiades' life and then refused to accept honors for it (219e-221c). Socrates, he concludes, is unique in his ideas and accomplishments, unrivaled by any man from the past or present (221c).

Frank Sinatra included the song on his 1955 album In the Wee Small Hours. Sarah Vaughan made an uptempo recording in 1962 with Count Basie's band.|$|E

500|$|His Band and the Street Choir {{was first}} {{released}} on LP on 15 November 1970 and was Morrison's third record {{to be produced}} for Warner Bros. It was re-released by the record company on CD in 1987, 1990 and 2005, and LP in 2008 with Rhino Records. On October 30, 2015, along with Astral Weeks, the album was remastered and reissued by Warner Bros. Records with five session bonus tracks; three alternate takes, and two alternate versions of [...] "I've Been Working" [...] and [...] "I'll Be <b>Your</b> <b>Lover,</b> Too".|$|E
500|$|... "I'll Be <b>Your</b> <b>Lover,</b> Too" [...] was {{inspired}} by Morrison and Planet's marriage. This acoustic ballad has a moderate 4/4 tempo, with one 5/8 bar before the vocal comes in. [...] "Blue Money", a pun-filled reference to Morrison's financial situation, is about a model, perhaps his wife. (Planet worked in the industry before meeting Morrison.) [...] "Sweet Jannie" [...] is the second twelve-bar blues on the album; written about young love, the song is another that reviewers speculated was about Planet. The lyrics, [...] "I've {{been in love with}} you baby / Ever since you were in Sunday school" [...] lead Clinton Heylin to believe it was written about memories from Morrison's childhood when he attended Sunday school in Belfast; Planet is a California-raised Texan.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{spent most}} of December in California, {{performing}} a dozen concerts with his band, and then took a break through the third week in January following {{the birth of his}} son Jesse. On January 21, 1966, he returned to Columbia's Studio A to record another long composition, [...] "She's <b>Your</b> <b>Lover</b> Now", accompanied by the Hawks (this time with Sandy Konikoff on drums). Despite nineteen takes, the session failed to yield any complete recordings. Dylan did not attempt the song again, but one of the outtakes from the January 21 session finally appeared 25 years later on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991. (Although the song breaks down {{at the start of the}} last verse, Columbia released it as the most complete take from the session.) ...|$|E

500|$|Warner Bros. Records {{scheduled}} His Band and the Street Choir for rush-release to sell over Christmas 1970, {{leaving little}} time to plan the packaging. These pressured conditions led the company to mistitle the promotional releases as His Band and Street Choir and prepare an incorrectly ordered track listing. At the end of [...] "I'll Be <b>Your</b> <b>Lover,</b> Too" [...] an unedited conversation is left on the finished record, which Peter Mills notes {{is an example of}} the album's rough edges. Janet Planet designed the album cover and wrote the sleeve notes, which sound [...] "a little desperate", in the words of Brian Hinton, as she wrote, [...] "This is the album that you must sing with, dance to, you must find a place for these songs somewhere in your life." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Sinatra {{released}} In the Wee Small Hours, {{his first}} 12" [...] LP, [...] featuring {{songs such as}} [...] "In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning", [...] "Mood Indigo", [...] "Glad to Be Unhappy" [...] and [...] "When <b>Your</b> <b>Lover</b> Has Gone". According to Granata {{it was the first}} concept album of his to make a [...] "single persuasive statement", with an extended program and [...] "melancholy mood". Sinatra embarked on his first tour of Australia the same year. Another collaboration with Riddle resulted in the development of Songs for Swingin' Lovers!, sometimes seen as one of his best albums, which was released in March 1956. It features a recording of [...] "I've Got You Under My Skin" [...] by Cole Porter, something which Sinatra paid meticulous care to, taking a reported 22 takes to perfect.|$|E
500|$|The {{intensity}} which Rice {{looked for}} in the track was not immediately achieved during recording, {{because it is a}} sentimental ballad and because of its lyrics. As the delivery date of the recording approached, they got more tense since most of the album was put together. Only this song was left as they could not decide on the final title, and Rice tried out names which did not make sense within the political and dramatic atmosphere of the story. They had initially tried out various lyrics as the main hook and title of the song including [...] "It's Only <b>Your</b> <b>Lover</b> Returning" [...] and [...] "All Through My Crazy and Wild Days" [...] amid fears that mentioning Argentina would reduce the commercial appeal. Rice recalled, [...] "What a crass decision! It was probably the only time (honest) that I had made the mistake of caring more abort a lyric's potential outside the show than its importance within it, and as a result both song and show suffered." [...] Covington had already recorded the phrase [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] for using it {{in the beginning of the}} show. Shortly before the album was finally mixed, Lloyd Webber suggested to Rice that the line also worked as the title of Eva's speech. As soon as Covington recorded with the new name, the song fit [...] "perfectly" [...] in the mood of the sequence and was included in the album.|$|E
