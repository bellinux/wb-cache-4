40|$|The Human Protein Interaction Database ([URL] was {{designed}} (1) to provide human protein interaction information pre-computed from existing structural and experimental data, (2) to predict potential interactions between proteins submitted by users and (3) {{to provide a}} depository for new human protein interaction data from users. Two types of interaction {{are available from the}} pre-computed data: (1) interactions at the protein superfamily level and (2) those transferred from the interactions of <b>yeast</b> <b>proteins.</b> Interactions at the superfamily level were obtained by locating known structural interactions of the PDB in the SCOP domains and identifying homologs of the domains in the human proteins. Interactions transferred from <b>yeast</b> <b>proteins</b> were obtained by identifying homologs of the <b>yeast</b> <b>proteins</b> in the human proteins. For each human protein in the database and each query submitted by users, the <b>protein</b> superfamilies and <b>yeast</b> <b>proteins</b> assigned to the protein are shown, along with their interacting partners.

30|$|<b>Yeast</b> <b>proteins</b> {{could be}} present as Saccharomyces cerevisiae derived antigens in {{hepatitis}} B vaccine (up to 25  mg/dose) and in quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (less than 7 mcg/dose) [39]. Yeast is also contained in pneumococcal 13 -valent conjugate (PCV- 13), in meningococcal and in oral thyphoid vaccines. Allergic reactions to <b>yeasts</b> <b>proteins</b> {{appear to be}} rare. In the US, in more than 180, 000 vaccine adverse reactions, only 15 were resulted from a reaction to <b>yeast</b> <b>proteins.</b> Furthermore, these 15 cases may have been even related to other vaccine components [45]. Although rare, in children with proven yeasts allergy, it is recommended to prefer yeast-free Vaccine (e.g. bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine). If not available, these children should be evaluated with skin prick tests and serum specific IgE dosage to Saccharomyces cerevisiae before vaccination. If an IgE sensitization is confirmed, children could receive graded vaccine; if negative, vaccine could be administered in the usual manner, with a 60  minutes observation after injection (Table  2).|$|R

2500|$|While the {{specific}} function of CCDC130 is still unknown, {{there have been}} several studies and research papers identifying it as a component of the U5 portion of the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP that helps form Complex B of the human spliceosome after coming together with Complex A. Complex B then undergoes more modifications and conformational changes before becoming a mature spliceosome. In one study, the conservation of spliceosomal components is discussed by comparing the human spliceosome with that of yeast. In this study, CCDC130 is categorized as a known splicing factor and its homolog in yeast is Yju2. [...] This <b>yeast</b> <b>protein</b> is a splicing factor that helps form the complete, active spliceosome and promotes the first step of splicing, which involves cleavage at the 5' splice site of the first exon. Based on this information, it is likely that CCDC130 plays a similar role in the human spliceosome, but due to the higher complexity of the human spliceosome, this protein may perform other functions or a completely different function. Due to its high number of phosphorylation sites, it is likely that this protein is activated and recruited to the spliceosomal complex through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation (see Post-translational modifications). Since this gene is ubiquitously expressed and expressed 2.9 times higher than the average gene, it is clear that this protein plays an integral part in the proper function of the spliceosome.|$|E

40|$|Protein {{localization}} {{data are}} a valuable information resource helpful in elucidating eukaryotic protein function. Here, we report the first proteome-scale analysis of protein localization within any eukaryote. Using directed topoisomerase I-mediated cloning strategies and genome-wide transposon mutagenesis, we have epitope-tagged 60 % of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. By high-throughput immunolocalization of tagged gene products, we have determined the subcellular localization of 2744 <b>yeast</b> <b>proteins.</b> Extrapolating these data through a computational algorithm employing Bayesian formalism, we define the yeast localizome (the subcellular distribution of all 6100 <b>yeast</b> <b>proteins).</b> We estimate the yeast proteome to encompass ∼ 5100 soluble proteins and > 1000 transmembrane proteins. Our {{results indicate that}} 47 % of <b>yeast</b> <b>proteins</b> are cytoplasmic, 13 % mitochondrial, 13 % exocytic (including proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum and secretory vesicles), and 27 % nuclear/nucleolar. A subset of nuclear proteins was further analyzed by immunolocalization using surface-spread preparations of meiotic chromosomes. Of these proteins, 38 % were found associated with chromosomal DNA. As determined from phenotypic analyses of nuclear proteins, 34 % are essential for spore viability—a percentage nearly twice as great as that observed for the proteome as a whole. In total, this study presents experimentally derived localization data for 955 proteins of previously unknown function: {{nearly half of all}} functionally uncharacterized <b>proteins</b> in <b>yeast.</b> To facilitate access to these data, we provide a searchable database featuring 2900 fluorescent micrographs at [URL]...|$|R
