500|$|John Calvert of The Quietus called [...] "Pyramids" [...] {{a little}} [...] "structurally {{ramshackle}} though never erratic, it's {{the type of}} massive album centrepiece that was inconceivable before The-Dream's stadium-R reinvented the genre as a mythological epic." [...] Paley Martin of Most Blunted stated that the track [...] "is {{so much more than}} a song; it is an audible baptism, a narrative delicacy, a self-indulgent experience! And you best believe once <b>you</b> <b>press</b> play, this ride will take you to the destination of your choice." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that the real triumph was Ocean's song structure: [...] "verses and hooks collapse onto each other, rhymes pop up out of nowhere, and the singer acts like minutely balancing a 10-minute concept piece is no big deal." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post Company described the track as a [...] "righteous funk opus that spans nearly 10 minutes", commented that it [...] "is loaded with metaphorical riddles, drawing parallels between Cleopatra and a 21st-century prostitute. Puzzle over it. Dance to it. All of the above." ...|$|E
2500|$|March 24, 2004: [...] "I {{would love}} to be able to tell you who did it, who brought this {{proposal}} to me, but I don't know. The two – since <b>you</b> <b>press</b> me, the two possibilities that are most likely are either the Department of State or the White House Chief of Staff's Office. But I don't know." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 13, 2011, Kiss began {{recording}} {{a new album}} due for release later in the year. Simmons stated, the album [...] "is gonna be the next step to Sonic Boom. Very similar– straight rock songs, no ballads, no keyboards, no nothing, just rock." [...] The band also used old analog equipment instead of more popular digital recording gear. Simmons said: [...] "Technology is a seductive bitch, she will seduce you. <b>You</b> <b>press</b> this button, you don't have to do anything. But analog is the love of your life. You can push real hard and it always gives back. For the new album, the actual recording process was 24-track tape and an old Trident board. And as many tubes as possible. You need tubes, electricity and thick wood to make that thick sound." ...|$|E

When <b>you</b> <b>pressed</b> the button to {{activate}} the scene you observed a room filled with cobwebs, and other creepy things, many of which became animated (accompanied with recorded sounds) when <b>you</b> <b>pressed</b> the button. The witch stood over a cauldron, stirring her brew round and round, Spiders rose and fell {{just in front of}} you. It was humorous but too frightening for some small children.|$|R

2500|$|Townshend played {{keyboards}} {{on several}} Who songs. On Who's Next, {{he began to}} work with analogue synthesizers, using the ARP 2600 model that he first encountered at Cambridge University. He {{had this to say}} about the instrument: [...] "I like synthesizers because they bring into my hands things that aren't in my hands: the sound of an orchestra, French horns, strings. There are gadgets on synthesizers that enable one to become a virtuoso on the keyboard. You can play something slowly and <b>you</b> <b>press</b> a switch and it plays it back at double speed. Whereas on the guitar you're stuck with as fast as you can play and I don't play fast, I just play hard. So when it goes to playing something fast I go to the synth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Madison {{received}} a generally positive reception. Prior to the game's release, Game Informers Megan Marie praised her character design, listing her {{as one of}} [...] "Ten Faces We Won't Soon Forget", citing her [...] "intimately rendered face" [...] and detailed face. Polish portal Wirtualna Polska listed her at 10 in a list of [...] "most beautiful girls from games", drawing attention not only to her looks but also her interesting personality. Greg Miller, writing for IGN, listed Madison {{as one of the}} characters he'd [...] "fallen for", praising her realism and the emotions behind her sex scene with Ethan. After release, Matt Bradford of GamesRadar listed her, together with Ethan, as two of the best [...] "everyman heroes" [...] in gaming, saying they [...] "proved that normal people can come through in the end... provided <b>you</b> <b>press</b> the right buttons." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Darren Franich listed her as one of [...] "15 Kick-Ass Women in Videogames", commenting on Heavy Rains [...] "down-to-Earth" [...] characters, and considering her as an [...] "anti-Lara Croft".|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, but <b>you</b> <b>pressed</b> {{the point}} after your officer had {{seen fit to}} interfere. Be wary in future, lest you make the acting too true to nature, and you get applauded in a manner quite as well performed." ...|$|R
