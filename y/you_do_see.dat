You go to a Bond picture expecting some style or, at least, some flash, some lift; you don't expect the dumb police-car crashes you get here. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>see</b> some ingenious daredevil feats, but they're crowded {{together}} and, the way they're set up, they don't give you the irresponsible, giddy tingle you're hoping for." [...] Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. [...] "Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don't think I've ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation. If Glen has any emotions about what he puts on the screen, he keeps them to himself.)" ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} what she learned about her {{character}} through [...] "The Other Woman", Elizabeth Mitchell surmised that Juliet's [...] "mistakes are morally questionable, if not morally wrong. [...] But <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>see</b> that behind this {{is a human being}} who is struggling to live and have a life that makes sense to her." [...] Mitchell did not think that Juliet was too surprised that Ben has romantic feelings for her, but [...] "it was horrifying under the circumstances" [...] because she had just found out that Goodwin had died. [...] Michael Emerson thought that his character Ben was childish when he shouted [...] "you're mine!" [...] to Juliet; Mitchell compared him to [...] "a twelve-year-old boy throwing a temper tantrum over... his first love". [...] Mitchell said that [...] "it was emotionally draining shooting this episode" [...] because she was intimidated by Emerson and Matthew Fox's acting skills.s Elizabeth Mitchell Opens Up on Juliet, Jack and Her 'Constant']", E!.

500|$|In 1986, Dawkins and {{biologist}} John Maynard Smith {{participated in}} an Oxford Union debate against A. E. Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society). In general, however, Dawkins has followed {{the advice of his}} late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because [...] "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would [...] "give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all". He suggests that creationists [...] "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public." [...] In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that [...] "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." [...] When Moyers questioned him {{on the use of the}} word theory, Dawkins stated that [...] "evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening." [...] He added that [...] "it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>see</b> is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chesterton's {{fence is}} the {{principle}} that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood. The quotation is from Chesterton’s 1929 book The Thing: Why I am a Catholic, in the chapter, [...] "The Drift from Domesticity": [...] "In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists {{in such a case}} a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away." [...] To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: [...] "If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>see</b> the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the film, {{the camera}} moves slowly towards a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, {{revealed}} to include Jack Torrance seen at the middle of a 1921 party. In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick overtly declared that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel. Still, this has not stopped interpreters from developing alternative readings, such as that Jack has been [...] "absorbed" [...] into the Overlook Hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wroteAs the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it? After all, it's right {{at the center of the}} central picture on the wall, and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn-out winter of mind-numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place. Is it just that, like Poe's purloined letter, the thing in plain sight is the last thing you see? When <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>see</b> it, the effect is so unsettling because you realise the unthinkable was there under your nose – overlooked – the whole time.|$|E
