5|$|After the war, Terry-Thomas {{began his}} stage career with an {{appearance}} in Piccadilly Hayride at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London; {{the show was}} a hit and he appeared in it from September 1946 until January 1948. In 1949 he appeared in his first television programme, Technical Hitch, and scored a success later that year with his own television series, How Do <b>You</b> <b>View?,</b> which was noted for being the first comedy series on British television. In 1956 he was cast by the Boulting brothers in Private's Progress. The role boosted his film career, initially in Britain, and then in America. In 1958 Terry-Thomas released {{the first of two}} solo comedy records, Strictly T-T; the same year he also appeared as Bertie Wooster in a cast recording of Jeeves, with Roger Livesey playing Jeeves.|$|E
25|$|A {{good example}} that {{highlights}} {{the pros and}} cons of using dynamic arrays vs. linked lists is by implementing a program that resolves the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is an election method that works by having a group of people stand in a circle. Starting at a predetermined person, you count around the circle n times. Once you reach the nth person, take them out of the circle and have the members close the circle. Then count around the circle the same n times and repeat the process, until only one person is left. That person wins the election. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of a linked list vs. a dynamic array, because if <b>you</b> <b>view</b> the people as connected nodes in a circular linked list then it shows how easily the linked list is able to delete nodes (as it only has to rearrange the links to the different nodes). However, the linked list will be poor at finding the next person to remove and will need to search through the list until it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the nth person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array.|$|E
500|$|Some of the {{innovations}} Terry-Thomas brought into his earlier television programmes were later copied by others; How Do <b>You</b> <b>View?</b> later provided the [...] "prologue" [...] format of Up Pompeii!, {{and was the}} first to use regular BBC announcers as foils in comic sketches—a practice continued later, particularly with the shows of Morecambe and Wise. Terry-Thomas's anecdotes, stringing several stories together, later inspired Ronnie Corbett in his monologue spot in his series The Two Ronnies. In 2014, BBC Radio 4 broadcast Memories of a Cad, a comedy drama by Roy Smiles about the relationship between Terry-Thomas and Richard Briers, played by Martin Jarvis and Alistair McGowan respectively.|$|E

500|$|Born in London, Terry-Thomas {{made his}} film debut, uncredited, in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933). He {{spent several years}} {{appearing}} in smaller roles, before wartime service with Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) and Stars in Battledress. The experience helped sharpen his cabaret and revue act, increased his public profile and proved instrumental {{in the development of}} his successful comic stage routine. Upon his demobilisation, he starred in Piccadilly Hayride on the London stage and was the star of the first comedy series on British television, How Do <b>You</b> <b>View?</b> (1949). He [...] appeared on various BBC Radio shows, and made a successful transition into British films. His most creative period was the 1950s when he appeared in Private's Progress (1956), The Green Man (1956), Blue Murder at St Trinian's (1957), I'm All Right Jack (1959) and Carlton-Browne of the F.O. (1959).|$|E
500|$|In between filming How Do <b>You</b> <b>View?,</b> Terry-Thomas {{continued}} {{performing on}} radio {{as well as}} in cabaret, in Britain and increasingly the US. In October and November 1949 he appeared at the Palmer House Night Club, Chicago; in June 1951 he appeared at The Wedgwood Room, Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York, and between 22 December 1951 and 29 February 1952 he returned to the London Palladium for 109performances in Humpty Dumpty. In September 1952 he travelled to the Federation of Malaya to entertain British troops in a series of concert parties, before returning to the UK to appear in the Royal Variety Performance in November. He finished the year in South Africa, as Honourable Idle Jack in Dick Whittington, which finished in January 1953; he considered the pantomime to be [...] "so tatty and unrehearsed it was pathetic".|$|E
500|$|While filming The Deceivers in Rajasthan, India, in 1987, Brosnan's wife Harris became seriously ill. She {{was later}} {{diagnosed}} with ovarian cancer and died on 28 December 1991 at age 43. Brosnan struggled {{to cope with}} her cancer and death. [...] "When your partner gets cancer, then life changes. Your timetable and reference for your normal routines and the way <b>you</b> <b>view</b> life, all this changes. Because you're dealing with death. You're dealing {{with the possibility of}} death and dying. And it was that way through the chemotherapy, through the first-look operation, the second look, the third look, the fourth look, the fifth look. Cassie was very positive about life. I mean, she had the most amazing energy and outlook on life. It was and is a terrible loss, and I see it reflected, from time to time, in my children." [...] Harris had always wanted Brosnan {{to play the role of}} James Bond, and in 1995, four years after her death, Brosnan was given the role in GoldenEye.|$|E

500|$|Terry-Thomas {{identified}} himself as a comedy actor, but regarded himself [...] "first and foremost, as a comedian with a built-in ability to inject humour into situations". He worked hard at the humour element, especially during his days in cabaret and revue; he wrote that he [...] "spent {{an enormous amount of}} time studying how to write humour and reading books on the philosophical approach to it, but it didn't get me very far. I decided that humour was like a good watch. It would go well if left to do its job but the moment one started poking around, it went wonky". While working on his television series How do <b>you</b> <b>View?,</b> he would change lines around to ensure the scene worked well, even if he gave the best lines to others; it was a quality which was appreciated by a number of others, including Jack Lemmon, who appeared with Terry-Thomas in How to Murder Your Wife. Lemmon commented that [...] "like most really good professionals he was generous to fellow actors. He worked with you, not at you".|$|E

Drawing {{parallels between}} the Mitt Romney dog incident and his political [...] "plans and schemes", the song criticizes Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and is sung {{from the perspective of}} the Romney family's dog. Cooder was inspired by Al Sharpton's quote [...] "how he treated his dog tells you a lot about him", and found the dog to be [...] "a useful character... when <b>you</b> <b>view</b> it in the light of the blues. Like a servant, a yardman, someone very low in the social order. He's just begging to be let down [...]" [...] Bud Scoppa of Uncut characterizes the song as [...] "the musical equivalent of a political cartoon". [...] "Brother Is Gone" [...] is poignantly styled as a sad folktale and features a haunting mandolin riff, a rueful tone, and wounded vocals. Its lyrics attribute the conservative Koch Brothers to the Deal with the Devil myth, which Cooder adapted from Robert Johnson's [...] "Cross Road Blues". The lyrics cite their [...] "crossroads" [...] as [...] "the prairie town of Wichita", where Koch Industries is headquartered. He said in an interview that [...] "the only logical explanation for the Brothers I could come up with is, they made their deal at the crossroads with Satan." [...] AllMusic's Thom Jurek cites it as [...] "among the finest songs 's written." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over {{the execution of the}} prostitution story in this episode, asking, [...] "If you buy that the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan would feel the same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme." [...] Sepinwall described the story as [...] "something that so fundamentally changes the way <b>you</b> <b>view</b> a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, {{that it has to be}} just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then." [...] Todd VanDerWerff opined that,"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: No matter what we try to do to make them equal, men are always going to turn women into objects on some level, because that’s just how men perceive them." [...] VanDerWerff compared it to the [...] "Employee of the Month" [...] episode of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call [...] "The Other Woman" [...] a stronger episode.|$|E

500|$|On 26 October 1949 Terry-Thomas {{wrote and}} starred in a new series on the BBC Television Service, How Do <b>You</b> <b>View?,</b> noted for being the first comedy series on British television. The {{programme}} was based around an on-screen persona of Terry-Thomas as [...] "a glamorous, mischievous and discreetly cash-strapped man-about-town", introducing a series of sketches in which he appeared alongside Peter Butterworth as his chauffeur; Janet Brown (Butterworth's real-life wife); Avril Angers; H.C. Walton as the family retainer, Moulting; and Diana Dors. The programme was broadcast live and often included Terry-Thomas walking through control rooms and corridors of the BBC's Lime Grove and Alexandra Palace studios. The author and historian Mark Lewisohn described the series as being [...] "inventive... truly televisual {{and not just a}} radio programme in costume". The series ran until 21 December 1949; a second series followed between April and May 1950, with Sid Colin taking over the scripting duties and Terry-Thomas providing additional material. By the third series, which was broadcast between November 1950 and February 1951, the audience reached four million viewers. In total there were five series of How Do You View?; the final episode was broadcast on 11 June 1952. Writing about Terry-Thomas on television, Wilfred Greatorex observed that [...] "he has... physical attributes that make him a gift to visual entertainment: a large, rather gaunt face, pre-fabricated for close-ups; the notorious space of one-third of an inch between his two most prominent top teeth; a mouth that is full of expression. Add to these pictoral [...] advantages his eight-inch cigarette holder and Eddie Cantor eyes".|$|E
2500|$|Venice {{presented}} fewer difficulties, {{and was a}} {{scene of}} special fascination for him: [...] "You see Venice rising from the sea", he wrote, [...] "its long line of spires, towers, churches, wharfs ... stretched along the water's edge, and <b>you</b> <b>view</b> it {{with a mixture of}} awe and incredulity". The palaces were incomparable: [...] "I never saw palaces anywhere but at Venice". Of equal or even greater importance to him were the paintings. Here there were numerous masterpieces by his favourite painter Titian, whose studio he visited, as well as others by Veronese, Giorgione, Tintoretto, and more.|$|E

Miller, {{author of}} Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Havoc (2002), writes: [...] "Cubism {{directly}} helped Niels Bohr discover {{the principle of}} complementarity in quantum theory, which says that something can be a particle and a wave at the same time, but {{it will always be}} measured to be either one or the other. In analytic cubism, artists tried to represent a scene from all possible viewpoints on one canvas." [...] Miller continues: [...] "An observer picks out one particular viewpoint. How <b>you</b> <b>view</b> the painting, that’s the way it is. Bohr read the book by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes on cubist theory, Du [...] "Cubisme".

2500|$|More {{orders were}} {{received}} at 3pm {{to move to}} Varesnes on the south bank of the River Oise but whilst en-route they were countermanded with surprise orders to counter attack and retake a village called Babouef. Therefore, the war worn Brigade who had been fighting and marching for four punishing days solid were about faced and moved off to the attack with an enthusiasm that {{is nothing short of}} incredible. By rights, the Brigade should have been incapable of the action yet those quoted as being there remark that it was the most memorable event of the entire rearguard action. At 5pm, with the Fusiliers on the right, the Bedfords on the left and the Northamptons in reserve, the Brigade formed up with the Babouef to Compeigne road on their right and the southern edge of the woods above Babouef to their left. The Germans had not expected a British counter attack, thinking there was nothing but ragged French units in their area, so were surprised at the arrival of three small but determined British battalions. They put little fight up and many Germans fell in the hand to hand fighting that lasted for around [...] before the village was secured and the remaining enemy – that could get away – fled. Ten machine guns and [...] prisoners were taken with very light casualties recorded by the Brigade; an incredible feat whatever way <b>you</b> <b>view</b> it. They dug in on the German side of the village amongst the cornfields and settled in for the night. Cooking limbers were even brought up and the idea of a quiet night gave the exhausted men a welcomed break from the extreme stress they had all been through in the past five days. Unfortunately, their rest did not last long.|$|E
