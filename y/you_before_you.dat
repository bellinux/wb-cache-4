500|$|Brooks's 1923 self-portrait has a grimmer tone. Brookswho also {{designed}} her own clothespainted {{herself in a}} tailored riding coat, gloves, and top hat. Behind her is a ruined building rendered in gray and black, underneath a slate-colored sky. The only spots of strong color are her lipstick and the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor that she wears on her lapel, recalling the Red Cross insignia in The Cross of France. [...] Her eyes are shaded by the brim of her hat, so that, according to one critic, [...] "she's watching <b>you</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> {{get close enough to}} look at her. She's not passively inviting your approach; she's deciding whether you're worth bothering with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeremiah 1:5 states that, [...] "Before I formed {{you in the}} womb, I knew <b>you,</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> were born, I set you apart; I {{appointed}} you as {{a prophet}} to the nations." [...] For some, this verse, while talking specifically about Jeremiah, {{is an indication that}} God is aware of the identity of [...] "developing unborn human beings even before they enter the womb", or that for everyone, God has a plan that abortion might be seen as frustrating. Others say that this interpretation is incorrect, and that the verse is not related to personhood or abortion, as Jeremiah is asserting his prophetic status as distinct and special.|$|E

When {{asked about the}} new album during an interview with CBN.com, Grant says, [...] "... my hope is just for those songs to provide companionship, remind myself and whoever else is listening what's important. I feel like songs {{have the ability to}} connect us to ourselves and to each other, and to our faith, to the love of Jesus, in a way that conversation doesn't do.

[...] One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: [...] "I will {{bring it to you}} within the twinkling of an eye!" [...] Then when Solomon saw it placed before him, he said: [...] "This is by the Grace of my Lord - to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And whoever is grateful, truly, his gratitude is for (the good of) his own self; and whoever is ungrateful, (he is ungrateful only for the loss of his own self).

2500|$|Erickson was an irrepressible {{practical}} joker, {{and it was}} {{not uncommon}} for him to slip indirect suggestions into all kinds of situations, including in his own books, papers, lectures and seminars. For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office {{near the end of his}} life. When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: [...] "My teacher told me that I should come to see <b>you</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> died." [...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying is the last thing I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson said, with a twinkle in his eye, [...] "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always wake up every morning. And do you want to know how to ensure that you will wake up every morning?", he continued, [...] "Drink lots of liquids before you go to sleep!" ...|$|E
2500|$|When Cao Cao, a warlord {{who rose}} to {{prominence}} in {{the final years of}} the Han dynasty and became the de facto head of the Han central government, was still relatively unknown to others, he once visited Qiao Xuan. Qiao Xuan was surprised to see Cao Cao and he told him, [...] "The world is about to enter a state of chaos. You're the person who will restore peace and order!" [...] At the time, Qiao Xuan and He Yong were the only two persons who felt that Cao Cao was extraordinary. Cao Cao later often said that Qiao Xuan was someone who really understood him. The Wei Shu (魏書) recorded that Qiao Xuan told Cao Cao, [...] "I've seen many famous persons but I've never seen someone like <b>you</b> <b>before!</b> <b>You</b> should work hard. I'm old already! I {{hope to be able to}} entrust my family to you." [...] Cao Cao's fame increased after his meeting with Qiao Xuan. The Shishuo Xinyu recorded that when Qiao Xuan met Cao Cao, who was still a youth then, he told him, [...] "The world is in chaos and warlords are fighting for supremacy. Aren't you the person who will eliminate all of them and restore order? You're actually a hero in chaotic times but a villain in times of peace. It's a pity that I'm old already because I won't be able to see you become wealthy and powerful. I entrust my descendants to you." [...] Qiao Xuan also recommended Cao Cao to see Xu Shao, a well-known commentator and character evaluator.|$|E
