During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly. Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he had intentionally improvising things that he felt that the character would say. After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was, but that perhaps they should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mind? What are you talking about? Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There's no question, there's no question!

500|$|On 14 October 2009, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{announced}} Havers {{had joined}} the cast of Coronation Street as Lewis, a potential love interest for Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). A writer for What's on TV said Havers {{was to make a}} one-off appearance in December before continuing in the role throughout 2010. The show's executive producer, Kim Crowther, told Gareth McLean of the Radio Times that while the team was planning the Audrey and Lewis storyline, they decided they wanted to introduce someone who was very charming, and slightly younger than Audrey. Casting director June West considered various actors for the part, including Anthony Head, but she suggested Havers for the role as she knew he was a big fan of the show. Crowther quipped, [...] "When you think of Nigel, you think of someone suave enough to charm <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> high heels. Half the work is done." [...] Havers said he could not refuse the part because his character was fascinating and had an interesting story arc, and that being on the show had always been his ambition. Havers was initially contracted until July 2010 and he made his debut screen appearance as Lewis on 18 December 2009. In March 2010, Havers stated that he was keen to renew his contract, as he was enjoying his time with the soap.|$|E

500|$|In 2017, Nolan {{directed}} and produced Dunkirk, {{based on his}} own original screenplay. The story is set amid World War II and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France in 1940. During the year-long production of his first film, Following (1998), Nolan and Thomas hired a small sailing boat to take them across the English Channel and retrace the journey of the little ships of Dunkirk. [...] "We did {{it at the same}} time of year to get a sense of what it was like, and it turned out to be an incredibly dangerous experience. And that was with no bombs dropping on us." [...] For Dunkirk, Nolan said he was inspired by the work of Robert Bresson, silent films such as Intolerance (1916) and [...] (1927) as well as by The Wages of Fear (1953). Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, he wanted to make a [...] "sensory, almost experimental movie" [...] with minimal dialogue. Nolan said he waited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film, but with an American budget. Before filming, Nolan also sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, [...] "Knowing and respecting that Chris [...] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama." [...] Starring Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden, Aneurin Barnard, Harry Styles, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Kenneth Branagh, Dunkirk was released in theaters on 21 July 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results, grossing over $520 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World War II film of all time. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in his review: [...] "It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies—they are rare—that lift <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times lauded the film, calling it [...] "a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday's fights and today's." ...|$|E

It was the most emotional scene in the movie ... and for him to get stopped in the middle of it. He is very intensely involved in his character. He didn't walk around like that all day long.

2500|$|That such {{a letter}} was a fiction was {{demonstrated}} very soon after; when Stephen asked Desiderius to fulfil the promises {{he had made}} over the body of Saint Peter, the Lombard king responded: ”Be content that I removed Christophorus and Sergius, who were ruling <b>you,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> way, and ask not for rights.

The duo became instantly renowned for their poking and prodding of the contestants, their straight-talking advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits. The editor of ELLE, Sarah Bailey, has stated [...] "You just don't expect posh girls to grab your tits, call your trousers 'too clitty' and use words like 'pussy pelmet' but they do. You are so shocked by {{what they are saying}} that by the time you have recovered and thought of something to say they have whipped <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> jeans and eased you into a Lycra cat suit." [...] They have stated that their relationship is more like a marriage and that being total opposites, they balance each other out. They cannot imagine working without each other and have even considered taking insurance out on their television partnership should something unforeseen happen. Woodall and Constantine have been accused of being patronising, but reject these claims.|$|E
2500|$|The Boston Globe writer Scott McLennan {{called the}} band [...] "relentless" [...] in his {{favorable}} review. He {{went on to}} explain that, [...] "New Found Glory flaunts the chemistry brewed over the 14 years that these five Floridians have been together. Guitarists Chad Gilbert and Steve Klein maneuver speedy melodies around singer Jordan Pundik's tales of love and loss, while drummer Cyrus Bolooki and bassist Ian Grushka propel the band. New Found Glory is at its best when sounding highly caffeinated, even if breakneck tempos belie a song's blue mood." [...] Vanessa Spates of daily newspaper The Lantern awarded Radiosurgery an [...] "A" [...] grade in her review. She wrote that [...] "Seven studio albums is an impressive feat for a punk rock band in a post-rock era. They keep a youthful quality in the manic guitars and the fury of drums. The entire album is infectious and invokes a lot of heartbreak anthems that everyone can relate to." [...] Roz Smith, writing for New Jersey tabloid The Aquarian Weekly, felt the album was undeniably [...] "catchy", emphasizing its [...] "choruses, upbeat guitar riffs, bass grooves and slamming drums." [...] Nicole Villeneuve of Candadian magazine Exclaim! also offered a positive review and wrote how the album was full of [...] "lively hooks and crisp songs in a taut pop-punk package." [...] Chad Grischow of IGN scored the album at 8.5 out of 10 and called it a [...] "vibrant, infinitely listenable treat." [...] He {{went on to explain}} that, [...] "Channeling the brand of freewheeling, fun-loving pop-punk the quintet burst onto the scene playing years ago, the lean, in-your-face set of tracks examining a crumbled relationship hits hard." [...] Rock Sound journalist Terry Bezer explained how there [...] "isn't a wasted minute on Radiosurgey", whilst awarding a near perfect 9 out of 10 score. He noted how the album [...] "will delight pop-punk purists and NFG faithful alike", before praising the songwriting as some of the band's most infectious to-date. Steve M, staff writer for Sputnikmusic awarded Radiosurgery a [...] "great" [...] 3.5 out of 5 score. He felt the album contained [...] "all the little quirks of their earlier material," [...] before adding, [...] "it is difficult not {{to get caught up in}} Radiosurgery for what it is: a short and sweet pop-punk album designed to get <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> chair and moving." [...] Consequence of Sound writer Kevin Barber awarded the album three stars out of five in his review. He wrote that, [...] "On Radiosurgery, New Found Glory have found their older, faster, and stronger sound, dishing out anthemic choruses, while still holding on to their [...] "" [...] maturity." [...] Jason Heller of The A.V. Club was less receptive, awarding the album a [...] "C" [...] grade and bemoaning the bands, [...] "same bouncy/bittersweet dynamic. It's also stuck religiously to its chunky, melodic sound. But where 2009's Not Without A Fight had a hint of a bite, Radiosurgery shows all the signs of tooth decay." ...|$|E
