Bacteria and yeasts are known to {{decompose}} allantoin, but evidence as to the pathway is very incomplete. Barker (1943) has reported that Streptocus allantoic de-grades allantoin anaerobically, giving rise to ammonia, urea, carbon dioxide, formic, acetic, lactic, and oxamic acids and possibly glycolic acid. It has been postulated from growth studies with bacteria (Young and Hawkins, 1944) and yeast (DiCarlo et al., 1953) that the aerobic decomposition of allantoin occurs via allantoic acid yielding glyoxylic acid and urea. The present paper reports on the mechanism of allantoin degradation by an unidentified species of Psudomonas isolated by enrichment culture techniques.

A medium (TSA plus salts) is described based upon the addition of sodium lactate (4 ml per liter), magnesium sulfate (2 g per liter), and ferrous ammonium sulfate (0. 05 %) to TSA, which appears suitable for the isolation and growth of Desulfovibrio on the surface of agar plates in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Sodium lactate does not appear to be essential in this medium for good growth and sulfate reduction in a hydrogen atmosphere, but is essential in a nitrogen atmosphere. Growth of Desulfovibrio (hydrogen atmosphere) on the agar surface of media commonly used for its cultivation as well as on an inorganic medium containing bicarbonate as a source of carbon is poor and erratic unless inoculated (Desulfovibrio) plates of TSA plus salts are incubated in the same container with plates of these media.

Our aim {{was to assess the}} palatability of food coated with sodium pyrophosphate and <b>yeast</b> <b>extract,</b> alone or in combination, and 20 adult cats were used in a two-bowl preference test. The preference for the experimental foods was tested by external application of sodium pyrophosphate (0. 3 %), <b>yeast</b> <b>extract</b> (0. 2 %), and a blend (0. 5 %) containing pyrophosphate and <b>yeast</b> <b>extract</b> in a same basal diet.
