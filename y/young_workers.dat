5|$|Denied {{the use of}} compulsion, Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons to {{volunteer}} for essential war work, and fit <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange {{the comforts of home}} and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army at a time when Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E

Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where they were held. Most importantly, this new {{freedom of the press}} and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.|$|E

5|$|Nationwide strikes {{broke out}} {{in the spring and summer}} of 1988. They were much weaker than the strikes of 1980 and were {{discontinued}} after the intervention by Wałęsa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations with the opposition. The strikes were the last act of active political involvement of the working class in the history of People's Poland and were led by <b>young</b> <b>workers,</b> not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the economic restructuring in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that followed was conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass social organization or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the past commitment to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager to bargain with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.|$|E

25|$|There {{is clear}} polyethism among A. pallipes where the <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> {{care for the}} larvae and older workers forage and defend the nest. It is {{hypothesized}} that the <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> are delegated {{to stay in the}} nest and care for larvae because it is significantly safer {{within the confines of the}} nest while the older workers are outside being exposed to predation in order to increase life expectancy of the workers. Other activities performed by the older workers include removing larvae from the nest, rubbing gaster on the nest and destroying cells. Intra-cell activities like checking cells, moving gaster and self-grooming were all-indicative of younger workers. Therefore, there is a clear relation between age and function thus implying that A. pallipes displays temporal polyethism behavior.|$|E
30|$|Stern (1987, 1994) {{shows that}} firms {{can also be}} {{interested}} in parting with employees when their productivity is higher than their wage. Here she assumes that employees' productivity is determined by occupational experience. Under these conditions it can be profitable for the firm to shed older workers {{before they reach the}} regular retirement age and to replace them with <b>younger</b> <b>workers.</b> In this case the firm calculates the lower costs for the <b>younger</b> <b>workers</b> against the additional costs for new hirings and the costs of dismissing the older workers. The wage costs for the <b>younger</b> <b>workers</b> are lower since they have less experience.|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} many tests of Karasek’s demand–control model of work stress.

30|$|Across all {{growth and}} {{dominance}} regimes, {{about half of}} newly hired workers or more are less than 35 years old, which indicates that, overall, firms rejuvenate by hiring younger—only {{about a third of}} the incumbent workforce consists of <b>younger</b> <b>workers.</b> However, growing firms experience a less pronounced influx of <b>younger</b> <b>workers</b> among all hires (five percentage points lower than their downsizing counterparts). Relating the share of young among the newly hired workers to the share of <b>younger</b> <b>workers</b> in the total workforce shows that overall, four out of five firms rejuvenate through hiring (lower part of Table  2). However, comparing dominant and dominated firms by employment growth reveals that 84 percent of dominant, growing establishments rejuvenate based on the influx of <b>younger</b> <b>workers,</b> whereas this in only the case for 69 percent of dominated, growing firms. One explanation for this pattern is that, in times of high labor demand and with the number of younger professionals becoming scarcer due to demographic change, dominated firms are less attractive employers and they therefore have to rely on other age groups to fulfill their labor demand.|$|R

25|$|It was {{not until}} the 1890s that the first modern {{legislative}} attempts to regulate minimum wages were seen in New Zealand and Australia. The movement for a minimum wage was initially focused on stopping sweatshop labor and controlling the proliferation of sweatshops in manufacturing industries. The sweatshops employed large numbers of women and <b>young</b> <b>workers,</b> paying them what were considered to be substandard wages. The sweatshop owners were thought to have unfair bargaining power over their employees, and a minimum wage was proposed as a means to make them pay fairly. Over time, the focus changed to helping people, especially families, become more self-sufficient.|$|E

All bee larvae are fed some royal jelly for the first few days after hatching but only queen larvae are fed on it exclusively.
