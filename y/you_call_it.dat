5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and you put in the huge battery and <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E

500|$|Olivia became {{concerned}} about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own way.... I don't know if she still considers herself engaged to you—but she obviously can't marry you—it's hardly decent! There's another point too—which is the personal inconvenience & bother to myself—I had all last winter, practically to keep 2 days a week for you to come & see her... She must marry—She & I can't possibly go on living this feminine life practically à deux for ever, & we haven't money enough to separate... You ought to go away—Englishmen don't understand yr American ways, & any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or whatever <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it)</b> with her. If you had ₤500 a year I should be delighted for you to marry her! ...|$|E

500|$|The {{rights for}} the English-language film were later {{acquired}} by Hammer Films at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, where Let the Right One In won the [...] "Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature," [...] and Matt Reeves was quickly introduced as the director. John Nordling and Carl Molinder, the Swedish producers of the original film, were both involved as producers for the adaptation. Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that [...] "I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell." [...] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes initially referred to the film with [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a faithful remake, I think that's true to say that's what it is. It's not a reimagining; the same beats , maybe the scares are a little bit more scary." [...] He later said, [...] "I call it his [...] version. I don't call it his remake or his re-imagining of it." [...] The decision to make a new film adaptation has been criticized by Tomas Alfredson. He has stated on numerous occasions that he is not in favor of remaking his film. [...] "If one should remake a film, it's because the original is bad. And I don't think mine is," [...] he said. Producer Donna Gigliotti said, [...] "We're incredibly admiring of the original, but to be honest with you, that picture grossed $2 million. It's not like we're remaking Lawrence of Arabia." [...] Producer Simon Oakes {{made it clear that the}} plot of Let Me In would closely resemble that of the original film, except that it will be made [...] "very accessible to a wider audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{explanation}} of the Altair name, which editor Les Solomon later told the audience at the first Altair Computer Convention (March 1976), is that the name was inspired by Les's 12-year-old daughter, Lauren. [...] "She said why don't <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> Altair - that's where the Enterprise is going tonight." [...] The Star Trek episode is probably Amok Time, as {{this is the only}} one from The Original Series which takes the Enterprise crew to Altair (Six).|$|E
2500|$|Searle's {{arguments}} {{are not usually}} considered an issue for AI research. Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig observe that most AI researchers [...] "don't care about the strong AI hypothesis—as long as the program works, they don't care whether <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence." [...] The primary mission of artificial intelligence research is only to create useful systems that act intelligently, {{and it does not}} matter if the intelligence is [...] "merely" [...] a simulation.|$|E

Doo was my security, my safety net". He was also known to be violent, an alcoholic, and a womanizer who was a somewhat reluctant participant in his wife's life as a country music celebrity. Nonetheless, he was a central figure in many of his wife's hits, including [...] "Fist City", [...] "The Pill", [...] "Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' On Your Mind)", and [...] "You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)". Loretta said, [...] "Doo really gave me {{a lot of things to}} write about, you know. He was very...what do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it?</b> Inspirational".|$|E

2500|$|When south-central Los Angeles {{erupted in}} riots—in which 58 were killed—after the Rodney King verdict in 1992, Waters gained {{national}} attention [...] "when she helped deliver relief supplies in Watts and demanded {{the resumption of}} vital services". Waters described the riots as a rebellion, saying [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a riot {{it sounds like it}} was just a bunch of crazy people who went out and did bad things for no reason. I maintain it was somewhat understandable, if not acceptable." [...] In her view, the violence was “a spontaneous reaction to a lot of injustice.” [...] In regards to the looting of Korean-owned stores by local black residents, she said: “There were mothers who took {{this as an opportunity to}} take some milk, to take some bread, to take some shoes... They are not crooks.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The defense filed {{a motion}} {{for a new trial}} based on the Madeiros {{confession}} on May 26, 1926. In support of their motion they included 64 affidavits. The prosecution countered with 26 affidavits. When Thayer heard arguments from September 13 to 17, 1926, the defense, along with their Madeiros-Morelli theory of the crime, charged that the U.S. Justice Department was aiding the prosecution by withholding information obtained in its own investigation of the case. Attorney William Thompson made an explicitly political attack: [...] "A government which has come to value its own secrets more than it does the lives of its citizens has become a tyranny, whether <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a republic, a monarchy, or anything else!" [...] Judge Thayer denied this motion for a new trial on October 23, 1926. After arguing against the credibility of Madeiros, he addressed the defense claims against the federal government, saying the defense was suffering from [...] "a new type of disease,...a belief in the existence of something which in fact and truth has no such existence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Nutting {{recalled}} that Eden told him, [...] "What's all this nonsense about isolating Nasser or 'neutralising' him as <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it?</b> I want him destroyed, can't you understand? I want him murdered, {{and if you}} and the Foreign Office don't agree, then you'd better come to the cabinet and explain why." [...] When Nutting pointed out {{that they had no}} alternative government to replace Nasser, Eden apparently replied, [...] "I don't give a damn if there's anarchy and chaos in Egypt." [...] At a private meeting at Downing Street on 16 October 1956 Eden showed several ministers a plan, submitted two days earlier by the French. Israel would invade Egypt, Britain and France would give an ultimatum telling both sides to stop and, when one refused, send in forces to enforce the ultimatum, separate the two sides – and occupy the Canal and get rid of Nasser. When Nutting suggested the Americans should be consulted Eden replied, [...] "I will not bring the Americans into this ... Dulles has done enough damage as it is. This {{has nothing to do with}} the Americans. We and the French must decide what to do and we alone." [...] Eden openly admitted his view of the crisis was shaped by his experiences in the two world wars, writing, [...] "We are all marked to some extent by the stamp of our generation, mine is that of the assassination in Sarajevo and all that flowed from it. It is impossible to read the record now and not feel that we had a responsibility for always being a lap behind ... Always a lap behind, a fatal lap." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{critical}} backlash began {{over the}} repetitive {{nature of his}} lyrics, his clean-cut image, and his perceived over-reliance on sampling others' entire hooks for {{the basis of his}} singles—criticisms also directed to his contemporary, Vanilla Ice. He was mocked in music videos by 3rd Bass (including a rap battle with MC Serch), The D.O.C., DJ Debranz, and Ice Cube. Oakland hip-hop group Digital Underground criticized him in the CD insert of their Sex Packets album by placing Hammer's picture in it and referring to him as an unknown derelict. Q Tip criticized him in [...] "Check the Rhyme," [...] asking, [...] "What you say Hammer? Proper. Rap is not pop, if <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> that then stop." [...] LL Cool J dissed him in [...] "To tha Break of Dawn" [...] (from the Mama Said Knock You Out album), calling Hammer an [...] "amateur, swinging a Hammer from a bodybag ," [...] and saying, [...] "My old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap.", though this could have been seen as a response to Hammer calling him out in [...] "Let's Get it Started", when he was mentioned along with Run DMC and Doug E Fresh as rappers that Hammer claimed to be better than. (LL Cool J would later compliment and commend Hammer's abilities/talents on VH-1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop, which aired in 2008). However, Ice-T came to his defense on his 1991 album O.G. Original Gangster: [...] "A special shout out to my man M.C. Hammer: a lot of people dis you, man, but they just jealous." [...] Ice-T later explained that he had nothing against people who were pop-rap from the start, as Hammer had been, but only against emcees who switch from being hardcore or dirty to being pop-rap so that they can sell more records.|$|E
