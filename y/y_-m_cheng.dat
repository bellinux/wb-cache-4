40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} {{complete}} conformally flat manifolds of dimension n � 3 with nonnegative Ricci curvature enjoy nice rigidity properties: {{they are either}} flat, or locally isometric to {{a product of a}} sphere and a line, or are globally conformally equivalent to R n or a spherical spaceform S n /Γ. This extends previous results due to Q. <b>-M.</b> <b>Cheng</b> and B. -L. Chen and X. -P. Zhu. In this note, we study complete conformally flat manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. It is well known in dimension 2 that the sphere, the plane and their quotients are the only surfaces that can be endowed with a metric of nonnegative curvature. As Riemannian surfaces are always conformally flat, it seems natural to look at higher dimensional analogues of this fact. Schoen and Yau showed in [20] that conformal flatness together with nonnegative scalar curvature (or any variant of it involving the Yamabe constant) still allows much flexibility. On the contrary, if one concentrates on stronger curvature conditions such as Ricci curvature bounds, one might expect that they put some quite strong restrictions on the manifold. For instance, in case the manifold is closed, various characterizations of the spherical spaceforms, or S 1 ×S n− 1, have been obtained, but with the help of some extra assumptions like constant positive, or constant nonnegative, scalar curvature, see for instance Q. <b>-M.</b> <b>Cheng</b> [7] for results and references. In the same vein, but in the non-compact case, B. -L. Chen and X. -P. Zhu proved in [5] that the only complete non-compact conformally flat manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and fast curvature decay at infinity are the complete (non-compact) flat manifolds.

40|$|The ribosomal S 6 kinase 2 (RSK 2) is a {{well-known}} serine/threonine kinase {{and a member of}} the p 90 ribosomal S 6 kinase (p 90 RSK) family of proteins. It is activated downstream of the MEK/ERKs cascade by mitogenic stimuli such as EGF or TPA. Here, we show that RSK 2 is activated by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and directly phosphorylates IκBα at Ser- 32, leading to IκBα degradation. The phosphorylation of IκBα promotes the activation and translocation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) subunits p 65 and p 50 to the nucleus. The net result is an increased NF-κB activity, which serves as a mechanism for RSK 2 blockade of TNF-α-induced apoptosis and enhanced cell survival. —Peng, C., Cho, Y. -Y., Zhu, F., Xu, <b>Y.</b> <b>-M.,</b> Wen, W., Ma, W. -Y., Bode, A.

We report on the observation of bright emission of single photons under pulsed resonance fluorescence conditions from a single quantum dot (QD) in a micropillar cavity. The brightness of the QD fluorescence is greatly enhanced via the coupling to the fundamental mode of a micropillar, allowing us to determine a single photon extraction efficiency of (20. 7 ± 0. 8) % per linear polarization basis. This yields an overall extraction efficiency of (41. 4 ± 1. 5) % in our device. We observe the first Rabi-oscillation in a weakly coupled quantum dot-micropillar system under coherent pulsed optical excitation, which enables us to deterministically populate the excited QD state.

Here we show the partial amino acid sequence of arginine deiminase of Mycoplasma arginini and the complete nucleotide sequence of the arginine deiminase gene of M. arginini. The open reading frame deduced from this sequence consists of 1, 230 bp encoding 410 amino acids. The mature form of this enzyme contains 409 amino acids after the deletion of the first methionine. In this open reading frame, TGA nonsense codons are used as tryptophan codons; this usage was verified by determination of the amino acid sequence. The molecular weight of the enzyme calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence is 46, 372.

40|$|The {{shift of}} a {{magnetic}} hysteresis loop away from zero field in a thin film systemcomposed of a ferromagnet (FM) coupled to an antiferromagnet (AF) is calledexchange bias. It is typically accompanied by an enhanced coercivity when theFM/AF bilayer is field-cooled below the Neel temperature (TN) of the AF. The loopshift, Hex, depends on the exchange coupling energy and the thickness of theferromagnetic layer. The exchange bias effect has been extensively studied during thelast decade due to its applications in spin valves for the ultra high density magneticrecording. Our previous works [1, 2] indicate that the exchange bias in FM/AF systemsstrongly depends on the structures of antiferromagnetic oxides (eg. CoO, Fe 2 O 3) forthe same type of ferromagnetic layer (NiFe). In this proposal, the NiCo/(Ni,Co) Obilayers will be prepared by a dual ion beam deposition technique [3]. The NiFe toplayers will be grown by directly sputtering the commercial NiCo target from theKaufman ion source.

In the second year, effects of the cooling field in NiCo/(Ni,Co) O bilayerswill be studied at temperature down to 10 K. In the third year, the magnetotransportproperties (electrical resistance and magnetoresistance) of NiCo/(Ni,Co) O bilayerswill be investigated both at room temperature and at low temperature.

Numerical simulations demonstrate that it is the last option that takes place - the local density distribution and the nearest-neighbor correlations in the middle chain correspond to a shock phase with completely delocalized domain wall. Surprisingly, the main quantitative parameters of that shock phase are governed by a real root of a cubic equation the coefficients of which simply depend on the probability of choosing the shortcut.

40|$|When we {{consider}} an asynchronous distributed computation on which local checkpoints have been defined (namely, {{a communication and}} checkpoint pattern- in brief, CCP), two types of dependencies between its local checkpoints can be observed. The first type is due to causal sequences of messages that establish on-line trackable dependencies. The second type is due to noncausal sequences of messages (called Z-paths) that establish “hidden ” dependencies between local checkpoints (a dependency is “hidden ” if {{it can not be}} tracked online). The Rollback Dependency Trackability (RDT) property, defined by <b>Y.</b> <b>-M.</b> Wang, has been introduced to study CCPs. A CCP satisfies the RDT property if every pair of local checkpoints that are connected by a “hidden ” dependency are also connected by a causal sequence of messages. The RDT property has a great interest: CCPs that satisfy this property allow relatively simple solutions to a lot of practical problems. This paper first introduces the notion of RDT-compliant property. In a given CCP, an X-path is a Z-path that satisfies a property X. The property X is RDT-compliant if every CCP without X-paths satisfies the RDT property. Then, the paper presents a particular RDT-compliant property. This property enjoys several very interesting features. (1) It is “visible ” (i. e., it can be tested on-line). (2) It is stronger than previously known RDT-compliant properties. Consequently, this property provides a characterization of RDT better than the previous ones. The question of the minimal characterization of the RDT property is finally investigated. ...|$|R

A similar trend was observed along an ODP transect perpendicular to the ridge axis with increasing fluid alteration from west to east. Much {{of the increase in}} fluid alteration along the ODP transect is explained by greater water-rock exchange with increasing basement temperature to the east. In contrast, the trend along the 3. 5 <b>-m.</b> <b>y.</b> -old ridge is best explained by diffusive exchange with the overlying sediment. The rate of this exchange is used to constrain hydrologic properties within basaltic basement. Flow within the 3. 5 <b>-m.</b> <b>y.</b> -old ridge is inferred to occur from south to north and lacks significant exchange with basement fluids from the active ridge crest to the west. Thus the two flow systems are hydrologically distinct, and flow paths are likely influenced by the complex distribution of permeability in basement, the pattern of seafloor morphology, and the type and rate of sedimentation...|$|R

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains {{as one of the}} leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide and there are no effective treatments currently available. Gene therapy applications have emerged as important alternatives for the treatment of diverse nervous system injuries. New strategies are evolving with the notion that each particular pathological condition may require a specific vector. Moreover, the lack of detailed comparative studies between different vectors under similar conditions hampers the selection of an ideal vector for a given pathological condition. The potential use of lentiviral vectors versus several modular protein-based nanovectors was compared using a controlled cortical impact model of TBI under the same gene therapy conditions. We show that variables such as protein/DNA ratio, incubation volume, and presence of serum or chloroquine in the transfection medium impact on both nanovector formation and transfection efficiency in vitro. While lentiviral vectors showed GFP protein 1 day after TBI and increased expression at 14 days, nanovectors showed stable and lower GFP transgene expression from 1 to 14 days. No toxicity after TBI by any of the vectors was observed as determined by resulting levels of IL- 1 β or using neurological sticky tape test. In fact, both vector types induced functional improvement per se...|$|R

In fact, the author has fitted a first-order autoregressive moving average model to the data pub-lished by Heirtzler et. al. [1968]. This conclusion, if true, is of •;-importance because it suggests that the mechanism governing the reversals of the geomagnetic dynamo possesses a memory.

40|$|In {{three-dimensional}} magnetic configurations for a plasma {{in which}} no closed field line or magnetic null exists, no magnetic reconnection can occur, by the strictest definition of reconnection. A finitely long pinch with line-tied boundary conditions, {{in which all the}} magnetic field lines start {{at one end of the}} system and proceed to the opposite end, is an example of such a system. Nevertheless, for a long system of this type, the physical behavior in resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) essentially involves reconnection. This has been explained in terms comparing the geometric and tearing widths [1, 2]. The concept of a quasi-separatrix layer[3, 4] was developed for such systems. In this paper we study a model for a line-tied system in which the corresponding periodic system has an unstable tearing mode. We analyze this system in terms of two magnetic field line diagnostics, the squashing factor[3 - 5] and the electrostatic potential difference used in kinematic reconnection studies[6, 7]. We discuss the physical and geometric significance of these two diagnostics and compare them in the context of discerning tearing-like behavior in line-tied modes. [1] G. L. Delzanno and J. M. Finn.

40|$|The {{family of}} p 21 -activated protein kinases (PAKs) {{appear to be}} present in all organisms that have Cdc 42 -like GTPases. In {{mammalian}} cells, PAKs have been implicated in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, but there are no reported effects of these kinases on the cytoskeleton. Recently we have shown that a Drosophila PAK is enriched in the leading edge of embryonic epithelial cells undergoing dorsal closure (N. Harden, J. Lee, H. -Y. Loh, <b>Y.</b> <b>-M.</b> Ong, I. Tan, T. Leung, E. Manser, and L. Lim, Mol. Cell. Biol. 16 : 1896 - 1908, 1996), where it colocalizes with structures resembling focal complexes. We show here by transfection that in epithelial HeLa cells alpha-PAK is recruited from the cytoplasm to distinct focal complexes by both Cdc 42 (G 12 V) and Rac 1 (G 12 V), which themselves colocalize to these sites. By deletion analysis, the N terminus of PAK is shown to contain targeting sequences for focal adhesions which indicate that these complexes are the site of kinase function in vivo. Cdc 42 and Rac 1 cause alpha-PAK autophosphorylation and kinase activation. Mapping alpha-PAK autophosphorylation sites has allowed generation of a constitutively active kinase mutant. By fusing regions of Cdc 42 to the C terminus of PAK, activated chimeras were also obtained. Plasmids encoding these different constitutively active alpha-PAKs caused loss of stress fibers when introduced into both HeLa cells and fibroblasts, which was similar to the effect of introducing Cdc 42 (G 12 V) or Rac 1 (G 12 V). Significantly dramatic losses of focal adhesions were also observed. These combined effects resulted in retraction of the cell periphery after plasmid microinjection. These data support our previous suggestions of a role for PAK downstream of both Cdc 42 and Rac 1 and indicate that PAK functions include the dissolution of stress fibers and reorganization of focal complexes...|$|R

40|$|Cognitive {{linguistics}} builds {{upon the}} idea of constitutive analogy between language, topology (or spatial structure), and, more generally, perception. Although this approach {{has proven to be}} very fruitful, its underlying principles may be open to question or at least call for further examination both with respect to linguistic description and to the way it conceptualizes perception, subjective experience and embodiment. As an entry to this matter, consider the fact that many descriptive frameworks tend to dissociate topological/schematic aspects from other aspects of various kinds of structural “interactions” (ranging from energy transmission chains to case roles structures, passing through telicity or agentivity). Similar dichotomy {{is at the root of}} the (contestable) typological distinction between verb-framed and satellite-framed languages. In our view, this distinction creates a strong bias in the analysis of units presumably dedicated to the expression of spatial relations and of their interactions. The case of verbs of movement (courir, marcher, tomber, ramper, surfer, nager, passer, plonger: ‘to run, walk, fall, crawl, surf, swim, pass, plunge') will illustrate this proposal. These verbs manifest a permanent (though variable) interweaving of space with qualitative, perceptual, and praxeological dimensions. It is true that these qualitative and praxeological dimensions are more easily perceivable in “functional”, “abstract”, or “figurative” uses. But actually, they are also at work in a number of uses commonly characterized as spatial. More importantly, it is these very same dimensions that play an essential role in the natural propensity of these verbs to be transposed into a variety of fields where neither space nor movement play a significant role. This may be amply sufficient to dismiss the idea that the above dimensions can await “later” semantic or pragmatic analyses, and to consider that, on the contrary, they are central to the semantics of motion verbs. For example, the semantic core of marcher ‘to walk' involves displacement/motion, but more basically regularity, mechanicity, and correct operation: le moteur marche ‘the engine is running', ça marche bien, ton affaire ? ‘is your business going well?', il nous a fait marcher ! ‘he put us on!'. Similarly, tomber ‘to fall' involves verticality, supervening, suddenness, but also surprise, non-control, along with gradations between spatiality, agentivity, evenementiality, metaphoricity: la pluie tombe ‘the rain falls', tomber la veste ‘to take off one's jacket', la température tombe ‘the temperature drops', la nouvelle tombe ‘the news just came through', ça tombe bien ‘it comes at the right moment', tomber dans les pommes ‘to pass out', tomber amoureux ‘to fall in love'. It is sometimes suggested (e. g. Langacker, Talmy) that the analysis should nevertheless be centered on a purely topological/cinematic core meaning which is granted a grammatical status. Thus, for instance, the semantics of the French verb monter (often referring to an ascent) would of necessity be centered on a generic ascension schema. But this occurs at the cost of providing a specious ad hoc account of other more ‘functional' uses (which nonetheless remain related to space), like in Paul monte une maquette (‘Paul puts together a model'), where the notions of increment, internal fitting, and achievement are central (Lebas and Cadiot 2003). In fact it is difficult to see how we can attribute a secondary status to the quality of motion, given that motion does not refer here to displacement, in the sense of change of position (even in topological space), but rather to a transition or transformation affecting one and only one place. Topological/cinematic descriptions are sometimes supplemented by resorting to a model of force and/or transmission of energy understood in a fairly physicalist way. However, this can hardly account for a host of phenomena ranging from the bodily involvement to the practical structure of action. An alternative tactics based on discrete (grammatical) repertories of case-roles constraining thematic roles (in the core of each lexical unit) does not fare any better: for only uses complying with certain restricted ontologies can be analysed in this manner. In our view, the main reason of these difficulties resides in disregarding the fact that linguistic expression of action goes hand in hand with the grasp of the stylistic/physiognomic character of (bodily) movements and of “internal” accompanying qualia. In actuality, the most generic dimensions of meaning build precisely on these singular properties of experience, intrinsically shaped by language and culture. Failure to recognize this leads one to treat as secondary or derived the “functional” or “metaphorical” uses of the same words (e. g. monter un projet: ‘to set up a project', monter un complot: ‘to hatch a plot'). If indeed polysemy is to be viewed as a fundamental property of language and a primary challenge for linguistics, it becomes obvious that it corresponds to intrinsically transposable, flexible, qualitative schemas. In our view, semantic analysis of all parts of speech should, in cognitive linguistics, take a better motivated theoretical apparatus, especially with respect to its underlying theory of perception (both from sensory and semantic point of view). Accordingly, grammatical, lexical and textual studies should be more tightly connected. We believe that the theory of Semantic Forms, outlined in Cadiot & Visetti (2001), provides such an apparatus. In this presentation we shall deal with the following issues: 1. The necessity of a semiotic and ‘transactional' theory of immediate experience, characterized by the simultaneous grasp of practical, qualitative, inter-subjective and axiological values (praxis, ethics, esthetics). As earlier noted, spatially and/or topologically grounded schemas capture only a few isolated aspects of meaning (which are equated in some theories to a grammatical core of meaning). Recognizing bodily experience as the proper model for a generic level of meaning and language activity leads us to focus on the self-centering, synesthetic, and anticipatory character of that experience (exemplified by qualitative terms, such as: resistance/yielding, holding tight, rupture, softness, roughness, bury, block, insert, get rid of, drown, touch [...] .). 2. Socio-semiotic constitution of linguistic values and human conduct. The constitution of language depends on our social and cultural world of life (Lebenswelt) which includes bodily experience in relation to the practical and interpersonal environment. One should not imagine here a “body” that functions as a “symbol” for semantics and is independent of language. The bodily experience in question cannot merely refer to an independent causal predetermination but to a sensitive, practical (and already linguistically shaped) agent and/or patient of socio-semiotic practices that give rise to meaning. Thus, the semantic concept of embodiment makes a sense only if the body in question does not amount to a pre-linguistic basis, but is a cultural construction, a ‘fictive' body shaped by social practices – mainly at semiotic level. 3. The necessity to take into account the existence of different phases in the process of differentiation/stabilization of meaning. These phases come along with various types of anticipation (more or less generic and/or unstable) afforded by linguistic units, the meaning of which should be viewed as a deployment across multiple phases. This is crucial for the proper treatment of polysemy and for the proper thematic analysis of discourse and texts. The import of phenomenological tradition (Husserl, Gurwitsch, Merleau-Ponty), and of the Berliner Gestalt school extended by microgenetic theories (Rosenthal 2004) appears here to be fundamental. Microgenetic theories are particularly suited to the integration in a single framework of physiognomic, social and cultural dimensions of meaning. It then becomes possible to describe the construction of semantic forms as a micro-developmental process, which involves more or less stable ‘phases'. At its core, instead of schematic devices, one would find what we call linguistic motifs that may be viewed as unstable germs of form. Cadiot, P., Visetti, <b>Y.</b> <b>-M.</b> (2001).

The main {{objective of this}} thesis was to relate engineering tolerance requirements to manufacturing constraints {{by means of a}} common engineering model for variation in assemblies. A comprehensive system for defining assembly specifications (engineering requirements) and for analytically predicting assembly variations was developed, which will allow closer control of product quality and performance. Vector loops were used to model mechanical assemblies. The loops join relevant dimensions into chains. Closed loops define the kinematic constraints on the assembly. Open loops define engineering constraints. Linearized equations derived from the vector loops were used to solve for the assembly variations. The linearized equations are expressed in terms of scalar sensitivities and known component tolerances. Simplified methods were developed for determining sensitivities using nodal coordinates. Eight distinct assembly specifications were identified, patterned after the ANSI <b>Y</b> 14. 5 <b>-M</b> 1982 standards for geometric dimensioning and tolerancing. They are general enough to cover a wide range of assembly applications. For each case, the required form of the loop equations was determined and solution procedures have been demonstrated for computing assembly variations and comparing the results to the specified assembly limits.

Identification of those proteins induced only in the host is particularly difficult. Using a novel double-antibody screen designed to identify clones in a gene library of L. interrogans serovar Pomona expressing host-inducible proteins, we have characterized a gene (lk 75. 3) encoding a sphingomyelinase-like preprotein of 648 amino acids with cytotoxic activity for equine pulmonary endothelial cells and weak hemolytic activity for equine and rabbit erythrocytes. lk 73. 5 was found as a single gene copy in all serovars of L. interrogans but not in other Leptospira spp. except L. inadai.

AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} fluoride iontophoresis on the microtensile bond strength (MTBS) between coronal dentin and two resin-based adhesive systems, and to measure quantitatively dentinal tubule occlusion. METHODS: Twelve freshly extracted intact human mandibular third molars were divided randomly into four groups. The superficial occlusal dentin of each tooth was exposed and treated. Group A 1 : One-Step Plus total-etch adhesive system; group A 2 : One-Step Plus total-etch adhesive system after fluoride iontophoresis; group B 1 : ACE BOND SE self-etching adhesive system; group B 2 : ACE BOND SE self-etching adhesive system after fluoride iontophoresis. A resin composite buildup was made for each tooth, which was then sectioned along its long axis to produce 10 beams (1. 0 mm x 1. 0 mm) for the microtensile bond strength (MTBS) test. Five dentin disks were cut in half and their occlusal surfaces etched with 6 % citric acid. The test halves were treated with fluoride iontophoresis. Four SEM photomicrographs were taken from corresponding sites on each test and each non-treated control half-disk. Image-Pro Plus 4 software quantified the percentage of tubule occlusion. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, chi(2) - and t-tests, with the probability level set at alpha= 0. 05. RESULTS: The mean MTBS (MPa) for each group was, A 1 : 30. 86 (S. D. 6. 84); A 2 : 25. 04 (8. 49); B 1 : 19. 22 (6. 88); B 2 : 19. 40 (6. 92). There were significant differences among all groups (P < or = 0. 02), except between groups B 1 and B 2 (P= 0. 92). Fluoride iontophoresis resulted in significantly increased dentinal tubule occlusion (P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Fluoride iontophoresis treatment reduced significantly the dentin bond strength of One-Step Plus total-etch adhesive, but not that of ACE BOND SE self-etching adhesive.
