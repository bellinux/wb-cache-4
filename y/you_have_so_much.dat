2500|$|According to the United Nations, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948 {{displaced}} 750,000 Palestinians. Today, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) reports {{their descendants}} total five million around the world. Mohamed El Rashidy, vice-president of the Canadian Arab Federation, {{said the new}} museum will have to address and reflect what Palestinians have gone through and [...] "give them a voice." [...] "You can be courageous when you {{have this kind of}} diversity [...] because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> strength. We shouldn’t fear stating the inconvenient truths and facts about history." ...|$|E
2500|$|No direct {{orders to}} commit atrocities by Milošević {{have ever been}} discovered, though little or no effort was made by Milošević to punish people deemed {{responsible}} for such atrocities, including Ratko Mladić who, after being accused of allowing atrocities to occur against Croats in Vukovar, was sent to lead the Army of the Republika Srpska, in which capacity Mladić was accused of ordering atrocities, including the murder of thousands of Bosniak men and boys in Srebrenica. Even after the reports of Srebrenica were released, Milošević refused to accept that Mladić {{was responsible for the}} crimes he was accused of. Wesley Clark, {{who was a member of}} the US team that helped negotiate the 1995 peace agreement ending the Bosnian War, claimed in his testimony during the trial of Milošević that Milošević had prior knowledge of the Srebrenica massacre and knew of Mladić's plans. During the negotiations, Clark had asked Milošević: 'Mr. President, you say <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> influence over the Bosnian Serbs, but how is it then, if you have such influence, that you allowed General Mladić to kill all those people in Srebrenica?' with Milošević answering: 'Well, General Clark... I warned Mladić not to do this, but he didn't listen to me.'" ...|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. Not in the least. What is your opinion, Lady Utterword? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> good sense.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the little}} children? Well you've done well for once! I must say I {{recommend}} you. I didn't think <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bravo!" [...] cried Peterkin, {{springing}} up and seizing the teacher's hand. [...] "Missionary, you're a regular brick! I didn't think <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It costs a heap to go there--didn't know <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money," [...] put in Guardley, with a {{smile that}} neither Earl nor Randy appreciated.|$|R
6000|$|ROBERTS: 'You {{are good}} at those things. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> aplomb, you know. YOU could carry it off, you know, first-rate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I suppose so,' I {{replied with}} a smile, and not without a blush. 'And because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{constancy}} and patience, Traddles.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right, Redwing. I am glad <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> sense," [...] {{said another}} voice, and Mrs. Redwing alighted very near to Redwing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon I'm sorry," [...] rejoined Larry, {{ignoring}} Neale's last words. [...] "I always hoped you'd {{get over}} Allie's loss.... <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to live fer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't call me laddie!" [...] Mr. Brewster pondered. [...] "Very well," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I didn't know <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> sense," [...] {{he added}} grudgingly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What! <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> meat lately {{that you}} will refuse this {{delicate}} gazelle that I brought down this morning with my own lance? 'Tis food for a caliph.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> meat already," [...] replied his wife, [...] "you have no occasion; {{here are}} a calf, two sheep, and half a hog." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of {{your father}} in you, that you never will. But {{take care of your}} brother, and don't let his brains work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She knows enough--enough for all decent purposes. What do you {{women want}} with learning, when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> else--everything, I should say--everything. Leave us something, eh, Katharine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No {{trouble at}} all,' said Theodora, kindly. 'I am sorry <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to tire <b>you</b> in the morning. Now, {{come up to}} your room. I wish I could carry you, as Arthur does.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Leland {{stared at}} her in evident astonishment. [...] "My dear, I never knew <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> and, if <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> it must be every penny that belongs to you. I couldn't let you strip {{yourself}} of everything for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, bonny Prince Charlie, take me down, {{and play}} the lover as charmingly as you did an hour ago. I never thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> warmth in you," [...] said Bella, taking his arm and drawing him on against his will.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{say that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money, {{and hope to}} have more. And that you like him--Yes? Am I right? You like him very much?--hein? Is it so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{have you}} a {{national}} joke?" [...] asked the Altrurian. [...] "But, of course! <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> humor. I {{wish you could}} give me some notion of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should you}} want me? I don't know anything, I've {{never had any}} advantages--and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> I read {{an article in the}} {{newspaper}} about you today--Mr. Caldwell gave it to me--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, Mr. Dribble," [...] said I, [...] "you {{seem quite}} a {{different}} man here from what you were at dinner. I {{had no idea that}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> stuff in <b>you.</b> There you were all silence; but here you absolutely keep the table in a roar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, you're rasher than I thought," [...] Thorn rejoined with a searching look. [...] "Well, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{lost your}} money and it's {{something}} of a surprise to hear <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> Anyhow, it was yours, and although the loss is serious, I don't understand how you're embarrassed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Romance? Bah! It's {{the most}} ridiculous unreality in the world. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> sympathy for that stupid girl, in that poor woman in her anxiety about her disappointment, why hadn't you a little for her sick husband? But a husband is nothing--when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Garnett: [...] "You {{can manage}} it, if anybody can. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> dignity {{that you could}} awe him into doing his duty by a single glance. I wouldn't be in his place!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the great}} way to inspire brotherly love all round is to keep on getting richer and richer till <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money that every one loves you. Money, gentlemen, is a glorious thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|She leaned {{towards him}} with pale face and limpid, heavenly eyes. [...] "You {{have been good}} to me, but I cannot ask you to fight my battles. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> else {{to do in the}} world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Master," [...] remarked Dick, [...] "I did {{not think}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> wit--that is, since you fell in love, for before then you were sharp enough. Well, you are right, and a little matter like that may turn a battle. Not but what I had thought of it already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{this was}} the letter David insisted on sealing before I put it into mine!" [...] exclaimed Miss Fosbrook, {{as soon as she}} had made out the words. [...] "We have been in great trouble at the loss; but we agreed not to write to <b>you,</b> because <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> on your mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} done so," [...] Morris answered, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the {{appearance}} of leaving your daughter at liberty. She seems to me quite her own mistress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Mrs. Cornbury, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{regard for}} Miss Rachel, you'd better advise {{her to think}} no more of that young man. He's no good; he's not indeed. If you ask, you'll find he's in debt everywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Do you know,’ said Jasper, when he {{had pushed}} away his plate and glass, and had sat meditating for a few minutes: ‘do you know that I find some crumbs of comfort in the {{communication}} with which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> amazed me?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Conway was {{too much}} {{surprised}} to make a direct answer, but she continued, 'If my brother could exert his interest--and I {{know that he has}} so high an opinion of dear Mr. Dynevor--and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> influence. That dear, generous Fitzjocelyn, too--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} you {{make such a}} bitter {{partisan}} speech before, Captain Jim. I didn't think <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> political venom in you," [...] laughed Anne, who was not much excited over the tidings. Little Jem had said [...] "Wow-ga" [...] that morning. What were principalities and powers, {{the rise and fall}} of dynasties, the overthrow of Grit or Tory, compared with that miraculous occurrence? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or for an admiral, my good sir. To {{be frank}} with you, Sir George, when I first had the honour of your acquaintance, I {{did not think}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in <b>you.</b> There {{was a sort of}} English {{attention}} to small wares, a species of knee-buckleism about your debutt, as Mr. Dodge calls it, that made me distrust your being the whole-souled and one-idea'd man I find you really are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] {{cried the}} jubilant doctor, [...] "as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> confessed <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> {{tell me all}} about her. Name and address, please." ...|$|R
