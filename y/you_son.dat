After a difficult battle Narud's forces were overpowered and Narud was cornered by not only Artanis Kerrigan and Raynor, but Alexei Stukov, who called him [...] "Duran." [...] He asked Duran if he remembered {{what he had done}} to him, and Narud assumed Stukov was simply there to gloat. Stukov said [...] "No, I'm here to say good night <b>you</b> <b>son</b> of a bitch." [...] (an echo of the words Duran had said right before shooting him). He then shot Narud with a psychic blast, finishing him for good.|$|E

500|$|The two {{brothers}} had often argued, and {{earlier in the}} decade, studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting, [...] "I'll get you for this, <b>you</b> <b>son</b> of a bitch" [...] and threatening to kill him. This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again. When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack {{did not attend the}} funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at Cap d'Antibes. [...] Asked to respond to his brother's death, Jack said, [...] "I didn't give a shit about Harry." [...] At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.|$|E
500|$|Within his {{otherwise}} lukewarm review, Derek Winnert {{ends with}} [...] "the Bahamas backdrops are pretty and the shark looks as toothsome as ever." [...] Richard Scheib also praises the [...] "beautiful {{above and below}} water photography" [...] and the [...] "realistic mechanical shark," [...] although he considers [...] "the melodrama back on dry land... a bore." [...] Critics commented upon the sepia-toned flashbacks to the first film. A scene with Michael and Thea imitating each other is interspersed with shots from a similar scene in Jaws of Sean (Jay Mello) and Martin Brody. Similarly, the shark's destruction contains footage of Martin Brody aiming at the compressed air tank, saying [...] "Smile, <b>you</b> <b>son</b> of a ...," [...] The New York Times comments [...] "nothing kills a sequel faster than reverence... Joseph Sargent, the director, has turned this into a color-by-numbers version of Steven Spielberg's original Jaws." ...|$|E
500|$|Other American POWs were {{similarly}} tortured and maltreated {{in order to}} extract [...] "confessions" [...] and propaganda statements. [...] Many, especially among {{those who had been}} captured earlier and imprisoned longer – such as those in the [...] "Alcatraz Gang" [...] – endured even worse treatment than McCain. [...] Under extreme duress, virtually all the POWs eventually yielded something to their captors. [...] There were momentary exceptions: on one occasion, a guard surreptitiously loosened McCain's painful rope bindings for a night; when, months later, the guard later saw McCain on Christmas Day, he stood next to McCain and silently drew a cross in the dirt with his foot. In October 1968, McCain's isolation was partly relieved when Ernest C. Brace was placed in the cell next to him; he taught Brace the tap code the prisoners used to communicate. On Christmas Eve 1968, a church service for the POWs was staged for photographers and film cameras; McCain defied North Vietnamese instructions to be quiet, speaking out details of his treatment then shouting [...] "Fu-u-u-u-ck you, <b>you</b> <b>son</b> of a bitch!" [...] and giving the finger whenever a camera was pointed at him. McCain refused to meet with various anti-Vietnam War peace groups coming to Hanoi, such as those led by David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, and Rennie Davis, not wanting to give either them or the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory based on his connection to his father. [...] McCain was still badly hobbled by his injuries, earning the nickname [...] "Crip" [...] among the other POWs, but despite his physical condition, continued beatings and isolation, {{he was one of the}} key players in the Plantation's resistance efforts.|$|E

However, Swanson admitted that one line she was shouting at Davidson went, [...] "You'd rip the wings off of a butterfly, <b>you</b> <b>son</b> of a bitch!" [...] when recounting a conversation with Walsh later in life. If the word rain was used in a title, they asked that it be removed. They also wanted to change Davidson's name to something else, but Swanson and Walsh refused.|$|E

He told Nick Greiner [...] "I'll go you 50/50", and the NSW State government paid {{the other half of}} the cost. [...] In a press conference he later remarked on his temporary oblivion [...] "I've been to the other side and let me tell <b>you,</b> <b>son,</b> there's fucking nothing there...there's no one waiting there for you, there's no one to judge you so you can do what you bloody well like".|$|E
2500|$|At noon on Thursday, September 24, 1891, Francis Heney's brother Ben, who {{had been}} helping guard Francis, was in San Francisco {{attending}} to family business. Francis Heney left his office for lunch. His secretary Lautaro Roca was to join him momentarily. Handy waited outside the courthouse, and a half-block away at Pennington St. and Church Ave., as Heney walked past Handy, Handy suddenly shouted and grabbed the smaller man from behind, whirled him around, seized Heney by the throat and pushed him against a wall, choking him with all his might. Handy then let go and hit Heney in the face, saying, [...] "Take that <b>you</b> <b>son</b> of a bitch." [...] Handy's finger-trigger didn't keep up with his hair-trigger temper. Heney broke away and ran, pulling a pistol from his pocket. The noon-time crowd around the courthouse saw the fracas. Some shouted, [...] "Don't shoot! Don't shoot!" [...] Handy grabbed the pistol and tried to take the weapon from Heney. The two men struggled for control of it when it discharged, striking Handy in the lower abdomen. Handy, although wounded, lifted the smaller Heney {{off the ground and}} then both men fell to the street, still grappling for the revolver. But Heney refused to release his grip on the pistol while Handy still struggled for it. Deputy Sheriff John Wiegle and several other people finally removed the gun from Heney’s grip and Handy’s fingers from Heney’s hands.|$|E

2500|$|While the bus {{was leaving}} San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a {{distance}} that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, {{and that there were}} several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, [...] "Open the door, asshole! Move, <b>you</b> <b>son</b> of a bitch, unless you want me to shoot you dead." [...] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. [...] "You are all fucked," [...] yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. But {{that was not the case}} this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, [...] "in the middle of nowhere." [...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: [...] "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" [...] But no one answered. One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head. Treviño Morales then yelled: [...] "I will ask all of you one more time. Who the fuck wants to live?" [...] All of the men raised their hands. [...] "Good. We will test your abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." [...] Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, [...] "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." [...] All of the passengers were shocked at the order the individual in front of them gave them. Everyone got their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, and stared at their partners nervously. Treviño Morales then said: [...] "Now beat the shit out of each other." ...|$|E
