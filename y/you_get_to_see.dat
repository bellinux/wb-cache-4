It isn’t often that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how people move on from these huge events, but “Marionette” gives us just that.

500|$|Anna Maxwell Martin {{appeared}} as Jane's sister Cassandra. The actress called her character [...] "terribly sensible", noting that she [...] "gets her heart broken. It's very sad. She's the levelling force for Jane Austen, the wild one. She {{tries to get}} her back in line, but fails miserably." [...] Becoming Jane also featured Laurence Fox as Mr. Wisley and Dame Maggie Smith as Lady Gresham, whom Jarrold viewed as possessing [...] "similarities to Lady Catherine De Burgh in Pride and Prejudice but in this film <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her hidden vulnerabilities – the pain of never having had children and her controlling maternal power over Wisley." [...] Other cast members included Ian Richardson as Judge Langlois, Leo Bill as John Warren, Jessica Ashworth as Lucy Lefroy, Michael James Ford as Mr. Lefroy, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Robert Fowle, and Helen McCrory as Mrs. Radcliffe.|$|E
500|$|Believing {{that his}} {{character}} was [...] "sort of a surrogate father figure" [...] to Henry, Sbarge {{admitted that the}} script [...] "made me weep because what {{they came up with}} is so lovely and magical and delightful." [...] Referring to his character's storyline as a hero's journey, Sbarge said the intention was to show that Jiminy Cricket did not just begin as a noble guy – [...] "what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> on this trip are the fire rings he had to walk through to get to a place where he could evolve to develop a sense of doing the right thing." [...] The episode featured guest stars Harry Groener and Carolyn Hennesy as Jiminy's parents Martin and Myrna. Groener had previously worked with Espenson in the third season of the fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is their only appearances in the series.|$|E

500|$|PokerTracker 3 is {{also known}} for its {{integrated}} heads-up display, a transparent video overlay data presentation that makes statistics and notes are readily available during play. The HUD allows an online poker player to focus his attention on the poker table {{he or she is}} playing at, rather than on the PokerTracker application. The HUD provides a vast array of realtime statistics for in-game analysis, customizable to the user's preference. In addition to the statistics available constantly during play on the poker window, detailed statistics are available in a pop-up window, accessible via a single mouse click. Marbella Slim of the Daily Star used the vision of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator character in an analogy with the HUD: [...] "In some scenes, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what the robot Terminator is seeing and he has all these data streams in front of his vision - it's a HUD or a head-up display." [...] Unlike other poker tracking products, PokerTracker 3 includes a HUD as part of the basic program. [...] The PT3 HUD, which automatically overlays a player's opponents' statistics next to their avatars, is essentially a built-in version of the formerly available PokerAce HUD.|$|E
500|$|AJ {{brings out}} a {{different}} side to Masood, which Ganatra said could [...] "upset the status quo". He said that AJ {{was brought in}} [...] "to stir up Masood's life, and that has exciting prospects", and they would [...] "get up {{to all sorts of}} shenanigans." [...] Presenter Kate Thornton, when interviewing Ganatra, said AJ was a [...] "playmate" [...] for Masood, while Wadia said that AJ brings the comedy back to Masood. Inside Soap Kate White called AJ [...] "a world away from family man Masood", while Soaplife said AJ is [...] "not a good influence but he sure puts a smile on [...] face and a new spring in his step." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said that AJ's influence on Masood is [...] "infectious". AJ's arrival allows people to see what Masood was like before he married Zainab, as all that was known about him to that point was his life with her. Ganatra stated: [...] "So by opening this door, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what Masood was like in his childhood and as a teenager. Masood did have a naughty streak—he was in a band with his brother, and they got up to mischief. Masood [...] has been put on the straight and narrow [...] But prior to that, he was a teenager like any other—getting into trouble, and that was in cahoots with his brother AJ!" [...] Ganatra said that, as British Asians, Masood and AJ grew up going to clubs and getting into trouble with girls. Now, Masood sees AJ as somebody with [...] "no responsibilities, no children and no stress of having to provide for a family" [...] and as AJ suffers marrital problems, is feeling lonely and has no children, Ganatra said [...] "they want each other's lives, which is quite a nice dynamic to play." [...] He added that [...] "AJ would love the stability of a family life like Masood's, while Masood would love to pack his bags, get drunk and perhaps end up in a stranger's bed. I'm interested to see him bring out Masood's naughty streak—and where that could take them..." [...] AJ is accepting of Syed's homosexuality and his relationship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge).|$|E

2500|$|Edwards and {{the design}} group {{reviewed}} all previous incarnations of Godzilla's design for inspiration. Edwards stated, [...] "The way I tried to view it was to imagine Godzilla was a real creature and someone from Toho {{saw him in the}} 1950s and ran back to the studio to make a movie about the creature and was trying their best to remember it and draw it. And in our film <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him for real." [...] He {{went on to say that}} his Godzilla remains true to the original in all aspects. Edwards also stressed that, [...] "It was important to me that this felt like a Toho Godzilla" [...] and concluded by wishing, [...] "I'd love ours (Godzilla) to be considered as part of the Toho group." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coonan {{spoke to}} David Brown from Radio Times about the crash, {{where it was}} said that Carl would [...] "show just how evil he can be" [...] by causing it. Coonan said that Carl causes the crash because he wants to depose Phil as [...] "top boy" [...] in Albert Square, saying it is [...] "such an insane thing to do. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how nuts Carl is. He doesn't care if Phil dies yet he risks {{damaging}} himself as well. [...] He realises he will {{have to get rid of}} him." [...] He also said that Phil is a [...] "major barrier" [...] for Carl getting what he wants, so he could either go into business with Phil or eliminate him. On filming the crash, Coonan explained that he was inside the car when the glass was detonated, and he suffered cuts on his leg and hand. Brown said the crash looks [...] "visceral and intense" [...] on screen, and said that Phil is not scared of Carl because he sees him as a [...] "wannabe" [...] and a [...] "young pretender", but added that [...] "there is obviously more to [...] than [...] realises." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mamma Mia! {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 54% of critics gave the film positive reviews {{based upon a}} sample of 175 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The Times gave it four stars out of five, as did Channel 4 (Britain) which said it had [...] "all the swing and sparkle of sequined bell-bottoms." [...] BBC Radio 5 Live's film critic Mark Kermode admitted to enjoying the film, despite describing the experience as 'the closest <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> A-List actors doing drunken karaoke'. The Guardian was more negative, giving it one star, stating that the film gave the reviewer a [...] "need to vomit", while Bob Chipman of Escape to the Movies said it was [...] "so base, so shallow and so hinged on meaningless spectacle, it's amazing it wasn't made for men". The Daily Telegraph stated that it was enjoyable but poorly put together ("Finding the film a total shambles {{was sort of a}} shame, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'll go to see it again anyway."), whereas Empire said it was [...] "cute, clean, camp fun, full of sunshine and toe tappers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ed Godziszewski (author of The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Godzilla) {{felt that}} the film didn't provide much social {{commentary}} like previous Godzilla films, stating, [...] "The 2014 film paid superficial lip service at best to the nuclear issue, but really there's almost nothing of substance there. Rather than offering caution about nuclear energy, the new film almost gives you the idea that nuclear weapons are actually the answer to everything" [...] but did feel that [...] "there {{was a lot more}} to enjoy in the 2014 film" [...] and didn't feel bothered by Godzilla's insufficient screen time. Godziszewski also praised the film's monster scenes, feeling they were executed better than Pacific Rim, stating, [...] "Instead the monster battles in Godzilla 2014 were staged much more like a Japanese film. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> prolonged shots of the monsters in action, filmed {{in a way that the}} action was easy to understand" [...] and concluded by stating, [...] "Since G2014 delivered that, I could overlook the relatively weak drama and the lack of social conscience. It's unsatisfying that they made Godzilla into a secondary player in his own film, but at least when the monsters were on screen, they delivered the goods." ...|$|E

Honest, there's lot of fellows that have graduated from colleges that don't begin to make as much money as fellows that went to work early. Old Shimmy Peters, that teaches Latin in the High, he's a what-is-it from Columbia and he sits up all night reading a lot of greasy books and he's always spieling about the 'value of languages,' and the poor soak doesn't make but eighteen hundred a year, and no traveling salesman would think of working for that. I know what I'd like to do. I'd like to be an aviator, or own a corking big garage, or else--a fellow was telling me about it yesterday--I'd like to be one of these fellows that the Standard Oil Company sends out to China, and you live in a compound and don't have to do any work, and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world and pagodas and the ocean and everything!

60|$|We left Rome on the 4th of June, and {{travelled}} by vettura through Orvieto and Chiusi. Beautiful scenery, interesting {{pictures and}} tombs, but a fatiguing journey. At least, Pen's pony and I were {{both of us}} unusually fatigued, and scarcely, {{at the end of}} a week, am I myself yet. I am not as strong since my illness last summer. We stay here till the early part of July and then remove to Siena, to the villa we had last year; and there Pen keeps tryst with his Abbé and the Latin. He has made great progress this winter in Latin and much besides, and he isn't going to be a 'wretched little Papist,' as some of our friends precipitately conclude from the fact of his having a priest for a tutor. Indeed Pen has to be restrained into politeness and tolerance towards ecclesiastical dignities. Think of his addressing his instructor (who complained of the weather at Rome one morning) thus--in choice Tuscan: 'Of course it's the excommunication. The prophet says that a curse begins with the curser's own house; and so it is with the Holy Father's curse.' Wasn't that clever of Pen? and impertinent, but our Abbé only tried at gravity; he sympathises secretly with the insorgimento d' Italia, and besides is very fond of Pen. Poor Pen, 'innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,' how his mama has been wickedly cursing her native country (after Chorley)! It's hard upon me, Fanny, that you won't tell me of the spirits, you who can see. Here is even Robert, whose heart softens to the point of letting me have the 'Spiritual Magazine' from England. Do knock at Mrs. Milner Gibson's doors till <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the 'hands' and the 'heads' and the 'bodies' and the 'celestial garlands' which she has the privilege of being familiar with. Touch the hands. Has Mr. Monckton Milnes seen anything so as to believe? Is it true that Lord Lyndhurst was lifted up in a chair? Does he believe? I hear through Mr. Trollope and Chapman that Edwin Landseer has received the faith, and did everything possible to persuade Dickens to investigate, which Dickens refused. Afraid of the truth, of course, having deeply committed himself to negatives. This is a moral lâcheté, hard for my feminine mind to conceive of. Dickens, too, who is so fond of ghost-stories, as long as they are impossible....|$|E
