500|$|Pronouns {{are used}} to refer to {{entities}} deictically or anaphorically. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation — for example the pronoun I identifies the speaker, and the pronoun you, the addressee. Anaphorical pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence I already told <b>you</b> <b>that.</b> <b>The</b> reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. [...] "he sent it to himself" [...] or [...] "she braced herself for impact").|$|E

On May 11, 2012, NBC renewed The Office for a ninth season. Series developer Greg Daniels returned as showrunner this season. Daniels stated that the season would feature more big season arcs, saying [...] "I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the way that we used to in the beginning, I think the thing we're going to do is bring back a lot of arcs."

500|$|Unlike Looking Glass' {{previous}} first-person games—Ultima Underworld, Ultima Underworld II and System Shock—Terra Nova {{takes place}} in outdoor environments. The game's engine, named TED, supports weather conditions, day and night environments, real-time water reflections and moving clouds, among other effects. Most of {{the work on the}} outdoor renderer was done by programmer Eric Twietmeyer; however, contemporary computers were not powerful enough to display fully three-dimensional (3D) outdoor environments. The problem was solved by programmer James Fleming: the game's engine renders and applies textures to foreground objects in full 3D graphics, but—according to PC Gamer US—it displays a [...] "bitmapped background in the distance" [...] to provide the [...] "illusion of detail". As with Flight Unlimited and the CD-ROM release of System Shock, Terra Nova was designed to support head-mounted displays. The game features QSound technology. Describing QSound's effect before the game's release, Suzanne Kantra Kirschner of Popular Science wrote that [...] "you'll hear the rustle of leaves from the right speaker a split second before you hear it in the left signaling <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> enemy is approaching from the right".|$|E

[...] The structure had been destroyed during in a gale on 3 November and four months effort had been wasted. Stevenson hired a boat to take him out to inspect the damage the same day he received this news. Firm in his self-belief, he resolved to build a stronger but otherwise identical replacement. Work began in April 1839 and by early September the completed barrack stood [...] above the rock. Entry was via ladders attached to the legs that led into the lowest level containing a kitchen. The middle level contained two cabins, one for Stevenson, the other for his master of works, whilst the top level provided sleeping quarters for a further 30 to 40 men.|$|E
