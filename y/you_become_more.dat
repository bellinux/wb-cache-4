500|$|Perry {{describes}} herself as a [...] "singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star" [...] and maintains that honest songwriting {{is very important to}} her. She told Marie Claire: [...] "I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think <b>you</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> relatable when you're vulnerable." [...] Kristen Wiig commented that [...] "as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record." [...] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, [...] "being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet." [...] The New York Times labeled her [...] "the most potent pop star of the day – her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent [...] "clichés". Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene, Jessie James, Kelly Clarkson, Lesley Roy, Britney Spears, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj.|$|E

2500|$|The games {{also have}} an impact on the open-world genre. James Hunt of Den of Geek {{described}} the first Crackdown game as [...] "the first in a line of original, postmodern superhero creations on games consoles, and great fun to boot." [...] Its formula of controlling super-powered beings in a massive sandbox environment, and using their abilities to cause mayhem and destruction has influenced other video game series such as Infamous, Prototype, Saints Row, The Saboteur and Just Cause 2. Game creator Brian Fleming was influenced by the climbing and parkour aspects of the first Crackdown in designing the gameplay for Infamous. The series' mainstay gameplay of collecting orbs in an open world environment to increase a character's abilities, was also copied by another similar game called Prototype. Keiichiro Toyama cited Crackdown as a big influence in developing his award-winning game Gravity Rush, stating that he [...] "really liked the aspect of unlocking skills and becoming more powerful, and achieving a higher level of freedom as <b>you</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> powerful".|$|E

On {{the other}} hand, the Catholic, {{in most cases}} too {{indolent}} to read, and, in all, too proud to dread, the rebuke of the reforming painters, confused them with the crowd of his old flatterers, and little noticed their altered language or their graver brow. In a little while, finding they had ceased to be amusing, he effaced their works, not as dangerous, but as dull; and recognized only thenceforward, as art, the innocuous bombast of Michael Angelo, and fluent efflorescence of Bernini. But when <b>you</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> intimately and impartially acquainted {{with the history of}} the Reformation, you will find that, as surely and earnestly as Memling and Giotto strove in the north and south to set forth and exalt the Catholic faith, so surely and earnestly did Holbein and Botticelli strive, in the north, to chastise, and, in the south, to revive it.

You see perhaps some indications of play between two boys upon the same seat, and hastily conclude that they are disorderly boys and must be separated. Something {{in the air and}} manner of one or both of them confirms this impression, and you take the necessary measures at once. You then find, when <b>you</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> fully acquainted with them, that the appearances which you observed were only momentary and accidental, and that they would have been as safe together as any two boys in the school. And perhaps you will even find, that, by their new position, you have brought one or the other into circumstances of peculiar temptation. Wait, therefore, before you make such changes, till you have ascertained actual character,--doing this, however, without any unnecessary delay.|$|E
