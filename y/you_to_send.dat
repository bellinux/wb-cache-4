500|$|On 20 April 1770, Smart {{was arrested}} for debt. On 11 January 1771, he was tried by Lord Mansfield, the gentleman who {{originally}} introduced Smart to Alexander Pope, and he was soon recommended to the King's Bench Prison. Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the [...] "Rules" [...] (allowing him some freedom), and Smart's final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic. In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev. Mr. Jackson, saying: [...] "Being upon recovery from a fit of illness, and having nothing to eat, I beg <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> me two or three shillings which (God willing) I will return, with many thanks, {{in two or three}} days." [...] On 20 May 1771, Smart died from either liver failure or pneumonia shortly after completing his final work, Hymns, for the Amusement of Children.|$|E
500|$|In Age of Empires III, {{the player}} {{advances}} through technological [...] "Ages", representing historical time periods; these {{provide access to}} greater improvements, units, and buildings. They include the Discovery Age, which represents the discovery and exploration of the Americas by Europeans and allows the player to explore and develop their economy; the Colonial Age, which represents the European Expansion into the [...] "New World" [...] and unlocks early military units; the Fortress Age, which represents the fortification of the European colonies, unlocks forts, and allows the player {{to have a more}} complete military; the Industrial Age, which triggers a strong economy, due in part to factories—advanced buildings that automatically produce resources or artillery—and unlocks all units and shipments; and the Imperial Age, which unlocks all buildings and upgrades, and allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> unit and resource shipments a second time. All Ages cost food and coin to advance to, except the Colonial Age, which only costs food (800). The price of age advancement is incremental, but does not vary between civilizations.|$|E

Indeed, she said so herself, adding, that she loved her kinswoman well, together with all that belongs <b>to</b> <b>thee,</b> Simon." ...|$|R
2500|$|In September 2012, Sarah Downey, a [...] "privacy expert" [...] {{with the}} {{software}} company Abine expressed her concern {{that in spite of}} the new [...] "Advertising Identifier", Apple didn't disclose details on what the identifier was actually based on. She stated: [...] "I need them to tell me why it's not identifying because as we've seen from a lot other [...] "non-identifying" [...] pieces of data, they can identify you quite easily", and that [...] "If you're using the opt-out, [...] may no longer gather information to serve you targeted ads. To me, that says they may still collect your information to do things other than serve you targeted ads, like build databases about <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> you marketing or to sell to third parties".|$|E
2500|$|Verdi had {{received}} a synopsis of the opera from Cammarano, the subject of which was not his. [...] But, as Budden notes, Verdi adopted a somewhat passive attitude, impressed as he was at being {{able to work with}} this librettist. In a letter of 23 February 1845, Verdi had expressed his optimism that [...] "Voltaire's tragedy will become an excellent melodrama," [...] with the added hope that if the librettist would [...] "put some passion into your libretto" [...] and that he, Verdi, would write music to match. In their early correspondence, it appears that Cammarano had already sent some sample verses because Verdi's 23 February letter also contained his enthusiasm for receiving more: [...] "I beg <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> me promptly some more verses. It's not necessary for me to tell you to keep it short. You know the theatre better than I do." [...] It is quite clear that Verdi's characteristic requirement for brevity appeared this early on in his career.|$|E

But Spotted Tail, you cannot read or write. You claim that the government has tricked your people and placed the lines of your reservation a long way inside of where it was agreed that they should be. [...] You signed that paper, knowing only what the interpreter told you it said. If anything happened when the paper was being made up that changed its order, if you had been educated and could read and write, you could have known about it and refused to put your name on it. Do you intend to let your children remain in the same condition of ignorance in which you have lived, which will compel them always to meet the whiter man at a great disadvantage through an interpreter, as you have to do? [...] As your friend, Spotted Tail, I urge <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> your children with me to this Carlisle School and I will do everything I can to advance them in intelligence and industry in order that they may come back and help you." ...|$|E
