40|$|AbstractYellow vein mosaic {{disease is}} the major {{limitation}} {{in the production of}} bhendi or okra (Abelmoschus esculentus), an important vegetable crop of India. This disease is caused by a complex consisting of the monopartite begomovirus Bhendi <b>yellow</b> vein <b>mosaic</b> virus (BYVMV, family: Geminiviridae) and a small satellite DNA β component. BYVMV can systemically infect bhendi upon agroinoculation but produces only mild leaf curling in this host. DNA β induces typical symptoms of bhendi <b>yellow</b> vein <b>mosaic</b> disease (BYVMD) when co-agroinoculated with the begomovirus to bhendi. The DNA β component associated with BYVMD has a number of features in common with those reported for ageratum yellow vein disease and cotton leaf curl disease. BYVMV represents a new member of the emerging group of monopartite begomoviruses requiring a satellite component for symptom induction...|$|R

The analysis of double-stranded RNA in prickly pear tissue whit the symptoms mentioned above revealedthe presence of viral RNA. In symptomatic tissue, flexible rods of 950 - 1700 nm in length were observed with the aidof transmission electron microscopy. The virus was transmitted mechanically to Nicotiana tabacum var.

For diseases with long latency period (leaf scald, ratoon stunting, <b>yellow</b> leaf, <b>mosaic,</b> fijivirus, smut and orange rust), primers were designed for real time PCR. For testing, infected leaves, fungal colonies, amplified DNA fragment or 40 seedlings were used. Real time PCR analyses have enabled the detection of sugarcane samples with highest dilution of DNA.

The pair of primers designed for scald, apparently {{was not able to}} distinguish only bacteria of the genus Erwinia, whereas the primers described in the literature were observed amplify others genera, such as Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas, Erwinia, Stenotrophomona and Pantoea.
