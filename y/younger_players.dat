5|$|After the English cricket team's tour of Australia in 1932–33, {{known for}} the Bodyline bowling tactics used by the English team, {{relations}} between the Australian Board of Control and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) were strained.

Mitchell-Innes was included in the touring party, and played in ten first-class matches, including two of the four contests against the New Zealand national cricket team.
