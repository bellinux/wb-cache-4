5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so {{within minutes of}} the injury, due to {{complications}} such as pneumothorax and insufficient airway and to other injuries that occurred at the same time.

25|$|A Metonic cycle equates to 235 lunar {{months in}} each 19-year cycle. This gives {{an average of}} 6939 days, 16 hours, and 595 parts for each cycle.

Since none of these values is evenly divisible by seven, the Jewish calendar repeats exactly only following 36,288 Metonic cycles, or 689,472 Jewish years.
