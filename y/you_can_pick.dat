Manning said she felt isolated and fragile, and was reaching out to someone she hoped might understand.|$|E

Fey {{wrote the}} role of Prince Gerhardt Hapsburg specifically for Reubens, {{and he did not}} have to audition. Fey, in regard to Reubens, said: [...] "We were thrilled beyond belief to get him to do [...]" [...] Kevin Lasit, the show's prop master, built Gerhardt's wheelchair and puppet legs. Fey said that Lasit [...] "really outdid himself", and noted that Reubens was kneeling in the wheelchair in the seat built over the top of him. In addition, Reubens wore prosthetic teeth and a wig to accommodate his character's look. According to Fey, in the DVD commentary for this episode, the show shot an alternate endingat Reubens's requestin which Gerhardt does not die, [...] "but ultimately it felt better stakes for the story if he'd die", in which Will Forte's character says, [...] "The Habsburg line has ended. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up your gift bags at the coat check." [...] In [...] "Black Tie", Rosellini played Bianca, the ex-wife of Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy. Rosellini would make a second appearance in the February 8, 2007, episode [...] "Up All Night".

500|$|Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture {{wrote that}} [...] "the song veers toward Stefani's more mellifluous, sentimental fare," [...] {{calling it a}} [...] "heartrending track". Amanda Dykan of AltWire praised the track, stating: [...] " [...] reaches through, wraps its acrylic-nailed fingers around your {{pulsating}} heart, rips it from your chest, throws it on the floor, and stomps all over it." [...] Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media claimed that [...] "Stefani – now 20 years wiser – flips it"; she continued with: [...] "It’s a rare moment on the album where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> out Stefani from a sea of other pop singers." [...] Mapes concluded by claiming that [...] "Used to Love You" [...] was her greatest song since [...] "Don't Speak", comparing its effect to Madonna's 1989 single [...] "Like a Prayer". Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture warned that when listening to this [...] "heartending track" [...] that [...] "tissues are a must". Consequence of Sound critic Adam Kivel enjoyed the track, calling it a [...] "recognizable moment in heartbreak delivered in a charming falsetto burble". Nate Jackson from OC Weekly appreciated the [...] "somber" [...] of the track, while Marcus Floyd from Renowned for Sound awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars, claiming that [...] "every lyric and every note are sung with heart and chorus just gets you". Michael Smith from the same website acknowledged [...] "Used to Love You" [...] {{as one of the}} strongest songs on This Is What the Truth Feels Like, calling it [...] "unexpectedly heartfelt".|$|E

It introduces My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy themes of decadence and hedonism, with West musing how [...] "the plan was to drink until the pain was over / But what’s worse, the pain or the hangover?". His lyrics on the track contain various musical and popular culture references, including those to the song [...] "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)", the Lamborghini Murciélago sports car, rapper Nas, fashion designer Phoebe Philo, short story [...] "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", the song [...] "Sex on Fire", singer Leona Lewis, and television character Steve Urkel.

For the song, West enlisted 11 guest vocalists, including Alicia Keys, John Legend, Elton John, Tony Williams, Elly Jackson, and Rihanna, who sings the song's hook. In an interview for MTV, Jackson said of the song's vocal layering, [...] "He got me to layer up all these vocals with other people, and he just basically wanted to use his favorite vocalists {{from around the world to}} create this really unique vocal texture on his record, but it's not the kind of thing where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> it out".|$|E

It's a game <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up and play for a few hours, stomping though a few dungeon floors, trying {{to solve a problem}} or two, but after a while it meanders towards repetition. In truth, the game is filled with innumerable challenges, likable characters and a high production value. But beneath the surface, the lightweight story and characters combined with the almost rigidly episodic game flow still hold it back." ...|$|E

As it is, most of the team seem to split off once a level's over (or turn into aliens at pre-determined moments during it), so you're left merely using each NPC as a means of progression." [...] He was also critical of the graphics, which he argued [...] "look old school, with bad texturing, uninteresting particle effects, and vanilla architecture." [...] He concluded [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up The Thing cheap you won't be too disappointed; it's by no means a bad game, but it's all the more disappointing thanks {{to the fact that it}} could and should have been brilliant." ...|$|E
