25|$|Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's 1980 song Enola Gay {{depicts the}} events of the 1945 {{deployment}} of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima {{from the point of view}} of the crew of the B29 Superfortress Bomber Enola Gay. Clear references are made to the exact time the bomb detonated ("It's eight fifteen, and that's the time that it's always been"), and questions are asked as to whether the action was necessary. The song also references a supposed radio message in which the crew detail no anomalies as a result of nuclear detonation ("We got <b>your</b> <b>message</b> on the radio - conditions normal and you're coming home"); the American government denied any rumours of radiation sickness associated with the dropping of the bombs.|$|E

On September 14, 1861, after reorganizing, they were ordered by Governor Edwin D. Morgan, {{at the request of}} Secretary of War Simon Cameron, to return to Virginia with two days' cooked rations. They were to be encamped at Fort Monroe on the tip of the Virginia Peninsula.

[...] In his reply, dated the same day he gave Nicola a decidedly clear answer, Washington said, [...] "No {{incident}} {{in the course of}} the war in me triggers painful feelings as <b>your</b> <b>message,</b> that such ideas are circulating in the army, as you expressed it". [...] Washington mentioned that he knew not what part of his conduct could have given rise to such a petition, which he thought a [...] "calamity" [...] facing the United States.

[...] The only available newspaper report of Branham's activities at this time {{was that of the}} Jeffersonville Evening News on June 2, which indicated that the Branham campaign reported 14 converts. Given the lack of corroborating evidence for this supposed supernatural event it is possible that Branham later embellished the incident by [...] "remembering" [...] the forerunner message when he was achieving success in the healing revival.|$|E

Lewis Corner of Digital Spy felt that the track put [...] "Simon [...] in his place in a way Louis Walsh could only dream of." [...] Brad O'Mance for Popjustice likened the song to Massive Attack's 1991 song [...] "Unfinished Sympathy" [...] "with a different song on top", while Official Charts Company writer Rob Copsey described it as [...] "gutsy and uplifting". However, Michael Clemons of The Daily Reveille thought that while {{it was not a}} stand out track, it was a good listen. Chuck Campbell of Knoxville News Sentinel thought that the track's lyrical theme, and the album's theme as a whole, was flawed as a concept, writing [...] "The problem with repeatedly declaring you don’t need the approval of someone who has wronged you is that <b>your</b> <b>message</b> is false. Clearly if Lewis indulges in six straight bitter songs about defiantly rebounding from a bad relationship (which she does on “I Am”), she obviously craves validation from the very person (or people) who did her dirty." ...|$|E

Mussolini wrote to Bergonzoli: [...] "I have given you a difficult task but one suited to your courage and experience as an old and intrepid soldier—the task of defending the fortress of Bardia to the last. I am certain that 'Electric Beard' and his brave soldiers will stand at whatever cost, faithful to the last." [...] Bergonzoli replied: [...] "I am aware of the honour and I have today repeated to my troops <b>your</b> <b>message</b> — simple and unequivocal. In Bardia we are and here we stay."
