500|$|The Kite Runner {{has been}} accused of 'hindering' Western {{understanding}} of the Taliban by portraying its members as representatives of various social and doctrinal evils that the Taliban and their supporters do not consider typical and which they feel portray Taliban in an unfavourable light. Examples of this would be: Assef's pedophilia, Nazism, drug abuse, and sadism, {{and the fact that he}} is an executioner. The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most-challenged books of 2008, with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to its [...] "offensive language, sexually explicit , and unsuit age group." [...] Afghan American readers were particularly hostile towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed. Hosseini responded in an interview, [...] "They never say I am speaking about things that are untrue. Their beef is, 'Why do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about these things and embarrass us? Don't you love your country?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday, April 27, a man {{was arrested}} in Corpus Christi, Texas for trying to sell a {{saxophone}} to a music store. On Thursday, April 25, the thirty-year-old man walked into a music store without an instrument and asked the sales person {{if they wanted to}} buy an alto Bundy saxophone. The girl told him that she would need to speak to her manager. The man replied, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him about it for? You work here, don't you?" [...] The girl claimed that the man seemed nervous. Once the manager was summoned, the man fled. The store contacted the police. The man was arrested two days later at a waterfront hotel after purchasing a [...]45 revolver from a pawn shop. On Tuesday, April 30, the sales girl identified him as the same man who tried selling the saxophone. Although no saxophone was found in his possession, the police found a bag of bloody clothing in his hotel room. The man claimed that the blood was from a cut he had received on his forehead in a bar fight.|$|E

[...] Asked on Channel 4 News in July 2015 why he had called representatives from Hamas and Hezbollah [...] "friends", Corbyn explained, [...] "I use it in a collective way, saying our friends are prepared to talk," [...] and that the specific occasion he used it was to introduce speakers from Hezbollah at a Parliamentary meeting about the Middle East. He said that he does not condone the actions of either organisation: [...] "Does it mean I agree with Hamas and what it does? No. Does it mean I agree with Hezbollah and what they do? No. What it means is that I think to bring about a peace process, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to people with whom you may profoundly disagree ... There {{is not going to be}} a peace process unless there is talks involving Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas and I think everyone knows that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Corbyn {{has been}} vocal on Middle East foreign policy. He {{is a member}} of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, campaigning against {{conflict}} in Gaza and what the organisation considers to be [...] "apartheid in Israel".

He has called for the lifting of sanctions as part of a negotiated full settlement of issues concerning the Iranian nuclear programme, and the starting of a political process to decommission Israel's nuclear arsenal.|$|E

I oughtn't to {{have asked him}} to go to church,--it bores him so much. I used to feel terribly about it once, when we were first married. But things have changed very much of late years, {{especially}} with all this scientific talk. In England it's quite different from what it used to be. Some of the best people in society are skeptics now, and that makes it quite another thing." [...] Lydia looked grave, but she said nothing, and her aunt added, [...] "I wouldn't have asked him, but I had a little headache, myself." ...|$|E

5000|$|Founder Staley {{put it this}} way:"The whole {{aesthetic}} and direction was founded on the two Johns: John Coltrane and John Cage. … I’ve always felt that if you’re talking about the American avant-garde, don’t just talk about Cage or the Downtown minimalist scene; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the avant-jazz scene, too. There’s just as extensive a scene going on in jazz {{as there is in}} the new music, classical, electronics world. So that’s always been an essential part of our programming." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{best way}} to {{understand}} Soans’ theme for Talking to Terrorists is with {{the words of the}} first ex-Secretary of State, [...] "Talking to Terrorists {{is the only way to}} beat them… If you want them to change their minds, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to them. They won’t do it very willingly because they don’t trust you, but yes, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to terrorists". Soans uses this dialogue at the very beginning of the play to honestly begin his production with the idea that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to terrorists to accomplish any sort of resolution. Throughout the play the ex-terrorist characters constantly mention that they only did what was right in their minds to protect themselves and their community. Soans also wanted to balance his view on terrorism by adding characters that repeat the words of politicians and victims to illustrate the theme that talking to terrorists is the only way to create peace and end misery for humankind. The other half of Soans’ idea is that terrorism is a vicious circle and several times it is mentioned that the ideas of terrorism came from terrorism, such is the case with the Bethlehem school girl who states in Act One that she hopes her Christmas will be better than the last few days and that the soldiers are beginning to pester her. It is revealed in Act Two that the Bethlehem schoolgirl was quite happy for the 9/11 disaster in America, she states, “When I first saw the Twin Towers on television, I felt sorry. But now I feel happy that they died. It's their turn to suffer. I could see many thousands of them die. I wouldn’t feel a thing.” It's thoughts like these, that human lives are expendable to justify revenge that lead into acts or support of terrorism. Ultimately Soans expresses the idea that terrorism is bad, but terrorists aren’t monsters, they're humans with a message and need to be talked to resolve any issue; meeting violence with violence only fuels conflict.|$|E

5000|$|... "When you’re {{talking about}} {{reforming}} an industrial system, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{about something that}} can be operated across the board. With much attention, very skilled people, small groups, reform always can be successful in some sense. But then people jump from this to something that’s going to operate across the board and reform the whole industrial system. They forget the Homans principle that no society, no governmental system, or no industrial system can work successfully if it depends on extraordinary abilities {{on the part of the}} people who run it. It has to be operable by ordinary damn fools like me." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song most {{directly}} {{inspired by the}} end of Blink-182 is [...] "No, It Isn't", which was also inspired by feelings of betrayal afterward.

So maybe <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it, and maybe you have to write a song about it." [...] The Postal Service influence is noticeable in [...] "Make You Smile", which makes frequent use of boy-girl exchange and lament. The song was initially dubbed [...] "Puppy Killing Machine" [...] — a name created by Heller that Hoppus deemed [...] "so ridiculous" [...] in relation to its upbeat, poppy nature. The anthemic [...] "Chapter 13" [...] closes the record and was inspired from chapter 13 of Dante's Inferno, which revolves around suicide. [...] "I had this image in my head of a guy seeing a woman across a crowded room and in that instant, he knows exactly what's going to happen: He falls in love with her, goes crazy, and kills himself in a hotel room," [...] said Hoppus. [...] "That's a good way to end the album, huh?" ...|$|E

5000|$|... "The {{only reason}} we were being cool and calling it an 'indefinite hiatus' is because that's what this dork {{at the head of}} our record label was telling us. So that's when you find out that {{everyone}} was conspiring against you," [...] Barker recalled. Schur had announced the formation of his own imprint, Suretone Records, in March and released We Don't Need To Whisper, the debut from DeLonge's new group, Angels & Airwaves, in May. [...] "It Isn't' is about coming out a year later and telling the truth ... obviously we weren't going to say anything bad about him while we were recording our record, but now that it's done, we are gonna talk about it," [...] said Barker in 2006. [...] "For a year, people were saying that what Tom did was valid or called for. It eats at you. So maybe <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it, and maybe you have to write a song about it." [...] The song was titled [...] "No, It Isn't" [...] as a [...] "pre-emptive strike against the inevitable questions as to whether it is about Tom DeLonge." [...] Hoppus elaborated on the title in 2006: [...] "Originally I was going to hide behind something else when people asked what the song was about. Obviously they'd ask if it was about Tom and I was going to say, 'No, it isn't; it's about a girl I used to date,' or something. But we all love the song so much and I thought, 'Why would I hide behind anything other than that's the way I feel?' So it was actually way more meaningful and liberating to say that’s what the song’s about." ...|$|E
