[...] The Daily Mail gave the game a 4/5, with particular praise being given to the game's varied environments, of which they remarked that [...] "whether it's walking along the sun-kissed balcony of a beach-side villa, or exploring the dank, underground sewers below a nightclub, Absolution brings each world to life with remarkable aplomb." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "At least, friend Oros," [...] I went on awkwardly enough, [...] "events {{have shaped}} {{themselves}} to <b>your</b> <b>advantage,</b> for you inherit a royal mantle." ...|$|E
60|$|BARTHWICK. On the contrary, I had not <b>your</b> <b>advantages.</b> My father kept me {{very short}} of money.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} master reflectively, gazing at Uncle Ben, [...] "unless you avail {{yourself}} of <b>your</b> <b>advantages</b> now and {{have one of}} your own. I suppose now that you are rich, you'll marry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chatellerault," [...] I laughed, [...] "abandon these {{defensive}} subterfuges; {{confess that}} you are but uttering excuses, and acknowledge that you have conducted this affair with a clumsiness unpardonable in one equipped with <b>your</b> <b>advantages</b> of courtly rearing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Noel Rainguesson, you are {{preparing}} yourself for trouble. I will say just one word to you, {{and it will}} be to <b>your</b> <b>advantage</b> to--" ...|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS (nervously). Don't, Julia. Now don't abuse <b>your</b> <b>advantage.</b> You've got me here at your mercy. Be {{good for}} once; and don't make a scene.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is't not best so? You {{have given}} me no cause to think of you to <b>your</b> <b>advantage.</b> I am {{therefore}} kind to exclude you from my thoughts." ...|$|E
6000|$|The fellow {{looked at}} her with a {{singular}} expression of spite, mixed with deference. 'You abuse <b>your</b> <b>advantages,</b> madam,' he said, 'and act as foolishly in doing so as I did in affording you such a hank over me. But you are a tyrant; and tyrants have commonly short reigns.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Lydgate, {{you know}} well what <b>your</b> <b>advantages</b> are. You know that our young men here cannot cope with you. Where you {{frequent}} a house it may militate very much against a girl's making a desirable settlement in life, and prevent her from accepting offers {{even if they are}} made." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now, sir," [...] he said, [...] "will you accord me your close {{attention}} for a moment. On my honour {{it will be}} to <b>your</b> <b>advantage</b> so to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I may {{be allowed}} to say so, {{it would be for}} <b>your</b> <b>advantage</b> that he should like you;--that is, if you mean to take a part in politics." ...|$|E
60|$|Lyndar. That for his virtue, sir, {{you make}} defence, Shows {{in your own}} a noble confidence. But him defending, and excusing me, I know not what can <b>your</b> <b>advantage</b> be.|$|E
60|$|JOHNNY. You never meant--You didn't {{do it for}} <b>your</b> own <b>advantage.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... ‘It {{does not}} seem to me very civil in you,’ remarks Neville, at length, ‘to reflect upon a {{stranger}} who comes here, not having had <b>your</b> <b>advantages,</b> to try {{to make up for lost}} time. But, to be sure, I was not brought up in “busy life,” and my ideas of civility were formed among Heathens.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|L. Dupe. Out {{upon that}} dark room for deeds of darkness! and that rotten bed! I wonder it did hold your lordship's vigour: But you dealt gently with the girl. Well, you shall see I love you: For I will manage this {{business}} to both <b>your</b> <b>advantages,</b> by {{the assistance of}} heaven I will; good my lord, help, lead me out. [...] [Exeunt.|$|R
6000|$|... "'At least,' said he, 'you {{will not}} have me arrested at once. It would be to <b>your</b> <b>advantage</b> as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go along! I'm {{up to the}} {{something}} to <b>your</b> <b>advantage</b> dodge, and to the mustachio dodge too. Do you fancy I don't know a bailiff, because he's dressed like a swell?" ...|$|E
60|$|If {{you send}} more proofs, I shall never finish this infernal story--"Ecce signum"--thirty-three more lines enclosed! to the utter discomfiture of the printer, and, I fear, not to <b>your</b> <b>advantage.</b> B.|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{share in}} the Union Ditch is worth a hundred {{thousand}} dollars," [...] continued her father; [...] "and if he isn't nominated for district judge this fall, he's bound {{to go to the}} legislature, any way. I don't think a girl with <b>your</b> <b>advantages</b> and education can afford to throw away the chance of shining in Sacramento, San Francisco, or, in good time, perhaps even Washington." ...|$|R
60|$|TANNER. [impressively] I trust, Enry, that, {{as between}} {{employer}} and engineer, I shall always {{know how to}} keep my proper distance, and not intrude my private affairs on you. Even our business arrangements {{are subject to the}} approval of your Trade Union. But don't abuse <b>your</b> <b>advantages.</b> Let me remind you that Voltaire said that what was too silly to be said could be sung.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{out on me}} indeed," [...] {{said the}} cavalier; [...] "out on me for a poor tame-spirited creature, that submits to be bandied about in this manner, {{by a man who}} is neither better born nor better bred than myself. I tell thee, Mark, you make an unfair use of <b>your</b> <b>advantages</b> over me. Why will you not let me go from you, and live and die after my own fashion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It will be {{very much}} to your advantage,' {{answered}} Montague poising a brush in each hand, and looking steadily upon him. 'It {{will be very}} much to <b>your</b> <b>advantage,</b> I assure you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{very good}} choice," [...] said Mr. Petter; [...] "he {{is a man}} of fine mind, and it will {{certainly}} be to <b>your</b> <b>advantage</b> if you can get him to work with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|An Apparition! Madam, said I, yes, to be sure; why you know, you {{are nothing}} else but an Apparition; {{and what else}} would you be, when it is so {{infinitely}} to <b>your</b> <b>Advantage?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|I {{grant you}} enter the lists of life, to {{struggle}} for bread, business, notice, and distinction, in common with hundreds. But who are they? Men like yourself, and of that aggregate body your compeers, seven-tenths of them come short of <b>your</b> <b>advantages,</b> natural and accidental; while two of those that remain, either neglect their parts, as flowers blooming in a desert, or misspend their strength like a bull goring a bramble bush.|$|R
60|$|L. Dupe. Why, if {{the worst}} {{come to the}} worst, he leaves you an honest woman, and there's an end on't: But fear not that; hold out his messages, and then he'll write, and that is it, my bird, which you must drive it to: Then all his letters will be such ecstasies, such vows and promises, which you must answer short and simply, yet still ply out of them <b>your</b> <b>advantages.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{not what}} {{your work is}} worth," [...] he explained. [...] "It's what <b>your</b> <b>advantages</b> can get for you. People are always going about supposing--just what you suppose--that people ought to get paid in {{proportion}} to the good they do. It's forgetting what the world is, to do that. Very likely some day civilization will get to that, but it hasn't got to it yet. It isn't going to get to it for hundreds and hundreds of years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You abuse <b>your</b> <b>advantage</b> over me, madam--I really {{dare not}} go--I am on guard over this other miss here; and if I should desert my post, my life were not worth five minutes' purchase.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{may still}} turn it to <b>your</b> <b>advantage,</b> my lady," [...] Fanny ventured to add, [...] "if you will consent {{to say nothing}} to anybody of your having a servant who has learnt French." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Major," [...] {{answered}} Jeekie, reassuming {{his grand}} manner, [...] "I shall continue {{to collect information}} which may prove to <b>your</b> <b>advantage,</b> but personally I wish that you were clear of the whole caboodle, except Miss Barbara." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exist? Most charmingly! My dear Lena, {{you don't}} know <b>your</b> own <b>advantages.</b> Why, <b>your</b> voice alone {{would be enough}} to make you unforgettable!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His letter implies it," [...] {{he agreed}} and then pulled himself up. Gerald was clever {{and no doubt}} meant to divert his thoughts. [...] "After all, this doesn't matter," [...] he went on. [...] "I'll pay these bills, {{but if you get}} into debt at Woolwich, you had better not come home. I have enough trouble about money, and your {{allowance}} {{is going to be a}} strain. There's another thing: Carter, who hasn't had <b>your</b> <b>advantages,</b> got in as a prize cadet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you never}} think of <b>your</b> own <b>advantage</b> at all?" [...] he inquired. [...] "Have you none of the ambitions that most women seem to have?" ...|$|R
