We envision a local culture that upholds the marriage of a woman to a man, and a man to a woman, as ordained of God. This culture affirms marriage as the best path to health, security, fulfillment, and joy. It casts the home built on marriage as the source of true political sovereignty and ordered liberty.

40|$|A {{difficult}} but important idea {{to get used}} to is that the brain has not access to ground truth about the world and people in it but instead runs a model of these things. Most of this model is driven by previous experience but at least for humans, an additional component is the ability to simulate situations in the future. Naturally to be successful at this has enormous survival value. However to run this simulation requires additional mechanisms that are not covered by purely memory-driven algorithms. These mechanisms are the candidates for a substrate that produces the feeling of conscious experience. Before we try to pin down some attributes of consciousness, it might be helpful to visit the feeling of being unconscious. We have all been unconscious in a dreamless sleep. Nonetheless it is a very gentle unconsciousness because, as you know, while you are asleep the brain {{has a lot to do}} to save the experiences that were selected form the last period you were awake. In addition, before you went to sleep, you had expectations about what things would be like when you awakened, and for the most part these are met. Perhaps a better experience of unconsciousness is obtained by those of us who have been under anesthetic during a medical operation. In these cases the drift into unconsciousness and awakening is abrupt and the interim experiences are a blank. Without the aftereffects of whatever procedure we have had, the time we were under the anesthetic would be just seamlessly missing. The experience of being conscious and not conscious, the latter as measured when consciousness returns, is easy to relate to because we all have it. But while we all have the feeling of being conscious, to try and jump into 1 2 CHAPTER 12. CONSCIOUSNESS a satisfactory explanation of its holism is fraught with difficulty. The main reason is that ‘consciousness ’ is another one of our summarizing words that tags a lot of underlying structure. Thus the job of this chapter is to deconstruct the experience of consciousness and examine its components and their respective functions together with the rationales for those functions. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> for a disappointing experience. Think of a car. One can take it completely apart and layout all its pieces on the garage floor with their attendant functions labeled, but the dissected and labeled ‘car ’ is not the same thing as the assembled vehicle...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The {{authors of}} this essay both teach and have been doing {{collaborative}} research within a Department of Anglo-American Studies (Faculty of Arts and Humanities) in a Portuguese University (Universidade do Minho, Braga, {{the north of the}} country), where the teaching of feminism and gender studies has an important role to play, both as a critical methodology indispensable amongst other recent critical and hermeneutical approaches to the text (be it strictly literary or otherwise visual, i. e., painting, film, performance, etc.), ← 27 | 28 → and as a way to anchor literature and art in general in social reality, inviting thus a situated engagement with the object of our study. It is not however ‘easy’ to teach feminist / gender studies in most places in the world (as {{it is not easy to}} be a feminist), and certainly Portugal is amongst these. You have to struggle to feed it into the curricula, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to argue your case when proposing a graduate or undergraduate course, or even a course within a specific degree, and it is not easy either to find a willing publisher for a monograph or a collection in the field, as the word ‘feminist’ is often thought of as unmarketable. Our aim in this essay is to offer as far as possible an overview of the situation of gender studies in the Portuguese academia, mainly in connection with the teaching and research activities of English Studies. It seemed to us natural that we should first refer to what is closest to our own sphere of action, that is, the contribution to the field at the University of Minho. We could thus trace the first teaching modules of feminism and gender studies at the English and American Studies Dept of the Universidade do Minho since the early 1990 s, within a) English Literature courses, comprehending Contemporary Literature, Modernism, Victorian, Shakespeare and Elizabethan Studies, and b) seminars on Critical Theory and Theory of Literature, namely within postgraduate courses. A number of women were involved in the teaching of these courses, some of them had recently completed their PhDs in the UK, others were starting their master’s and doctoral degrees in the newly created programs in Portugal. The launching of projects arrived slightly later, in the mid- 1990 s, first on a rather informal basis, gathering researchers, male and female, with a focus on interdisciplinarity, under the umbrella of the Humanities Research Centre at UM, CEHUM (Centro de Estudos Humanísticos da Universidade do Minho), supported by the Portuguese research council FCT (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia). Only later were some of these projects made financially competitive through the possibility of grants, namely towards the organization of conferences and ensuing publications. Amongst these it is worth mentioning three volumes which came out of those earlier projects and produced a strong impact in local academic terms, due to the novelty of their focus and for directly addressing feminism as an ‘out of the closet’ issue in Portugal: A Mulher, O Louco e a Máquina (Woman, Madness and the Machine; 1998), Re-presentaçõnes do Corpo / Re-presenting the Body ← 28 | 29 → (2003), Poéticas Inter-artes: do Texto à Imagem, ao Palco, ao Écran / Interart Poetics: Text to Image, Stage, Screen and beyond (2006).
