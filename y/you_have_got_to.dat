5|$|Cosell:... but (the game)'s {{suddenly}} {{been placed}} in total perspective for us; I'll finish this, they're in the hurry-up offense.Gifford: Third down, four. (Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> say what we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, {{we have to say}} it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E
500|$|Bamber {{was tried}} in October 1986 before Maurice Drake and a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court, during a trial that lasted 19 days. The {{prosecution}} {{was led by}} Anthony Arlidge QC, and the defence by Geoffrey Rivlin QC, supported by Ed Lawson QC. The Times wrote that Bamber cut an arrogant figure in the witness box. At one point when prosecutors accused him of lying, he replied: [...] "That is what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> establish." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{formed an}} {{effective}} partnership with fellow winger Ryan Fraser as Bournemouth enjoyed their best start to {{a season in}} the second tier in 2013–14. In mid-November 2013 Pugh stated his belief that Bournemouth had made a [...] "decent start" [...] to the season; by this point he had scored 4 goals from 16 appearances. He believed his playing intelligence improved by playing against more attack-minded full backs in the Championship, saying that [...] "They are still quick to react and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> use your brain {{a little bit more}} than in League One. It's developed me as a player because you need to learn how to perform in different situations against different players". Pugh made 45 appearances and scored 5 goals in 2013–14 as Bournemouth finished in 10th place in the Championship, which at the time was the highest league ranking in the club's history.|$|E

500|$|When Dixon first {{emerged into}} the public {{spotlight}} with Mis-Teeq, she was primarily the group's MC, whilst one of her band-mates Sabrina Washington usually sang lead vocals on the records. Washington encouraged her to rap from the band's inception, saying: [...] "When she started she was a bit shy, but I always said that it adds something, an element of difference. It {{was the first time}} I'd ever heard a woman MC and I was like, 'Alesha, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do that,' and she was like 'No Bri, don't make me look stupid'". However, when she began her solo career her first UK album, The Alesha Show, saw Dixon undergo a genre-shift. The album featured no rapping and was primarily R and soul, unlike Mis-Teeq's music, which focused mainly on garage and hip hop. Dixon commented that the record consisted of [...] "a lot more guitar-written songs with pop produced around it". Dixons third album The Entertainer consists mainly of uptempo pop and dance-pop tracks.|$|E
500|$|Hurley was by now {{aware that}} his forward was using drugs, and {{attempted}} to keep his player's habit a secret while he patiently worked {{to bring him back}} around. However, Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players, who became unsettled and complained about Friday's conduct. The club became increasingly minded to sell him, but although top-flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested, they were reluctant to buy because of Friday's temperament; in Downs's words, [...] "They weren't sure they could handle him". By the end of October 1976, Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player, believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team. [...] "The squad needs you but I owe it to the club because I can't have you using drugs," [...] Hurley told Friday. [...] "If I know you're using drugs it won't take them [...] long to find out. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get your act together." [...] Friday was made available for transfer, at his own request, on 28 October.|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
6000|$|... "And if I hadn't promised them?" [...] {{the tailor}} {{returned}} with some show of feeling.

2500|$|On anarchism, Orwell {{wrote in}} The Road to Wigan Pier: [...] "I worked out an anarchistic theory that all {{government}} is evil, that the punishment always does {{more harm than}} the crime and the people can be trusted to behave decently if you will only let them alone." [...] He continued and argued that [...] "it is always necessary to protect peaceful people from violence. In any state of society where crime can be profitable <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> have a harsh criminal law and administer it ruthlessly." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the missing}} Hunt {{material}} came to light, Gray reportedly said to Dean, “Goddammit John. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> hang tight. Who else knows about it?” [...] By early July 1972, however, Gray had an alarming {{picture of the}} apparent conspiracy as conveyed to him by Vernon Walters and he changed tack. Although he arguably should have made it his business to know before helping Dean in any way, once he did know for certain that the White House was somehow involved, {{he was no longer}} a predictable and reliable ally they could count on.|$|E

2500|$|Cornwallis {{was serving}} under Field Marshall Haig {{when he played}} in a charity cricket match, taking a hat-trick. He was later invited by C. H. B. Marsham to play for Kent County Cricket Club against Sussex in the 1919 County Championship. Cornwallis, who had not played cricket since school, {{initially}} laughed off the invitation but was told by Haig to accept – being told it was [...] "one of those things <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> say you have done once, Cornie". He took a wicket in the match {{and went on to}} play several more times for Kent in 1919.|$|E
2500|$|Mayor Michael Bloomberg said: [...] "Where does [...] come from?' I don't know. Do {{you really}} want every time they pass the basket in your church, and you throw a buck in, they run over and say, '...where do you come from? ... Where {{did you get this}} money?' No." [...] The TV news anchor Rick Sanchez said: [...] "...if you start going into who is giving money to whom ... {{you have to go to}} my church. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go to Rome and start asking where the money is going into Rome.

I have not lost faith. We can win if we go out there to-morrow and get stuck right into it." [...] He told them that he knew they had not produced their English form. He told them that their batting, bowling, fielding and catching were too often just too bad to be true. Chosen, as they were, to represent their country, they obviously could do better. Brown's told them just what he thought of everything. He finished by saying that if they went on to the field on the morrow with confidence in themselves, they could do the job.|$|E

2500|$|After the September 11 attacks, {{a series}} of {{controversial}} military campaigns were launched, known as the War on Terror. In November 2001, shortly after the invasion of Afghanistan, the MTV Europe Music Awards were held in Frankfurt, where Gorillaz won awards for Best Song and Best Dance. As Albarn and Jamie Hewlett walked onto stage to make a speech after receiving the latter award, Albarn wore a T-shirt with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament logo on it. In his speech, he said [...] "So, fuck the music. Listen. See this symbol here, [...] this the symbol for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

2500|$|There is no {{official}} state nickname. However, Missouri's unofficial nickname is the [...] "Show Me State", which appears on its license plates. This phrase has several origins. One is popularly ascribed to {{a speech by}} Congressman Willard Vandiver in 1899, who declared that [...] "I come from a state that raises corn and cotton, cockleburs and Democrats, and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I'm from Missouri, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> show me." [...] This {{is in keeping with}} the saying [...] "I'm from Missouri" [...] which means [...] "I'm skeptical of the matter and not easily convinced." [...] However, according to researchers, the phrase [...] "show me" [...] was already in use before the 1890s. Another one states that it is a reference to Missouri miners who were taken to Leadville, Colorado to replace striking workers. Since the new men were unfamiliar with the mining methods, they required frequent instruction.|$|E

I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us then. I said to them, [...] "This is how we have got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time. I tried that with our band and we got into doing it. It worked. Instead of just strolling in at any hour, it made it more like we were saying, [...] "Let’s do it!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Chief American Horse was a {{delegate}} to many peace conferences in Washington. During the tumultuous times from 1865 to 1877, [...] American Horse advocated yielding {{to the government}} at any cost, being no doubt convinced of the uselessness of resistance. This quelled the people {{for the time being}} and up to the killing of Crazy Horse. [...] In the crisis precipitated by this event, American Horse was again influential and energetic in the cause of the government. [...] From this time on he became an active participant in the affairs of the Teton Sioux. [...] He was always noted for his eloquence, which was nearly always conciliatory, yet he could say very sharp things of the duplicity of the whites. [...] He had much ease of manner and was a master of repartee. [...] I recall his saying that ”if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> wear golden slippers to enter the white man’s heaven no Indian will ever get there, as the whites have got the Black Hills and with them all the gold.” “His record as a councilor of his people and his policy in the new situation that confronted them was manly and consistent.” ...|$|E
2500|$|He was {{described}} by social commentator and antitheist Christopher Hitchens in terms as [...] "Chaucerian fraud" [...] and a [...] "faith-based fraud." [...] Hitchens took special umbrage with Falwell's alignment with [...] "the most thuggish and demented Israeli settlers", and his declaration that 9/11 represented God's judgment on America's sinful behaviour; deeming it [...] "extraordinary that not even such a scandalous career is enough to shake our dumb addiction to the 'faith-based.'" [...] Hitchens also mentioned that, despite his support for Israel, Falwell [...] "kept saying to his own crowd, yes, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> like the Jews, because they can make more money in 10 minutes than you can make in a lifetime". Appearing on CNN a day after Falwell's death, Hitchens said, [...] "The empty life of this ugly little charlatan proves only one thing: {{that you can get}} away with the most extraordinary offenses to morality and to truth in this country if you will just get yourself called 'reverend'." [...] On C-SPAN, Hitchens made the comment that [...] "if he had been given an enema, he could have been buried in a matchbox".|$|E
