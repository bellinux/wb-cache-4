6000|$|DANCY. [Entering] WINSOR {{came to me}} <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> General Canynge's evidence. Is {{that what}} you wanted to speak to me about? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were all}} in {{confusion}} <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> poor Mrs. Crawley, and the dean dined here; he had been over at Hogglestock to see his friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} my husband is dead," [...] she said. [...] "He died <b>yesterday</b> night, <b>about</b> ten o'clock, in {{hospital}} at Madeira, did he not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, they do," [...] he answered. [...] "You {{forget you}} telephoned to the Hall <b>yesterday</b> {{afternoon}} <b>about</b> the hospital business you had forgotten and gave our number, {{which would be}} quite enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I am, miss," [...] she replied. [...] "I don't {{know what}} it is. I can't hold myself still. I felt so <b>yesterday</b> at <b>about</b> this same time, miss. Don't be uneasy, I think I'm ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, David. I had a {{talk with}} Minna <b>yesterday,</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Keller's illness. Is it true that he was cured out of the blue-glass bottle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{of course}} I am. He was {{around to see}} me only day before <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> the rent. I am a bit behind, and I had to put him off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{read the}} daily papers," [...] he remarked. [...] "Didn't I see {{something}} <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> Lady Elisabeth Landon having won the scratch prize at Ranelagh at a ladies' golf meeting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, with luck. Drake's the man I'm afraid of. He's {{done it in}} 4-48 {{twice during}} training. He was second in the half <b>yesterday</b> by <b>about</b> three yards, but you can't tell {{anything}} from that. He sprinted too late.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] I said, [...] "when Dellius {{has had his}} answer; and knowest thou {{that but}} <b>yesterday,</b> Charmion--whom <b>about</b> the palace they name the 'Keeper of the Queen's secrets'--Charmion swore that {{the answer would be}} 'Go in peace, I come to Antony!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{he and the}} envoy spoke <b>yesterday</b> for half-an-hour <b>about</b> the new danseuse and the American troubles: chiefly {{about the}} new danseuse.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have a word}} to say to you, Arnold," [...] the old gentleman began, [...] "before {{you become}} a married man. Do you {{remember}} the conversation at dinner <b>yesterday,</b> <b>about</b> the dancing-party at Swanhaven Lodge?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear friend," [...] {{returns the}} old man, [...] "I was applied--Judy, shake me up a little!--I {{was applied to}} <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> the captain, and my opinion still is that the captain is not dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not as well}} to-day as I was {{yesterday}} afternoon. Last week I was feeling pretty {{good part of the}} time, but <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> four o'clock the air turned humid, and I don't feel so well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will kindly {{close the}} door," [...] said Holmes. [...] "Now, Bannister, {{will you please}} tell us the truth <b>about</b> <b>yesterday's</b> incident?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense, I know better, Marianne. I have a {{suspicion}} that I could tell what the Captain was <b>about</b> <b>yesterday</b> {{when he walked}} off after dinner.' ...|$|R
5000|$|On July 11, 2012 the Commissioner Brett Vickers {{announced}} on Twitter [...] "@PLLcommissioner I love throwing people off {{by setting up}} websites." [...] & [...] "Heading South..........had two great meetings in the two new PLL cities Wednesday and <b>yesterday.</b> Excited <b>about</b> September!" [...] Adding speculation that New Jersey {{may not be the}} league's newest member.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, love," [...] I said, [...] "I had an odd fancy, <b>yesterday,</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Bruff? I thought, when I saw {{you after}} your walk with him, {{that he had}} been telling you some bad news." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Witheringly.) A nice {{specimen}} of a reformer, I must say. You, who babbled <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> theft. The most high, righteous and noble Ali Baba, {{who has come}} into the den of thieves and {{who is also a}} thief.|$|E
6000|$|I shall begin sending {{documents}} so soon as I can get them. I wrote you <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> a [...] "Congressional Globe." [...] As {{you are all}} {{so anxious}} for me to distinguish myself, I have concluded to do so before long.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will go on}} to Clady also. I did send a {{man there}} <b>yesterday</b> to see <b>about</b> the flue. It's the flue that's wrong, I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah! Here is news," [...] cried Dick, after perusing a {{telegram}} {{that had been}} handed to him. [...] "You'll remember I telegraphed to Benton, the town below here. Well, here is word that the houseboat was seen passing Benton <b>yesterday</b> at <b>about</b> five o'clock, and headed towards the west shore. That ought to give us something to work on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait an hour," [...] said Andrew. [...] "The smelter people {{promised to}} let me know the results they got and the letter was due <b>yesterday.</b> I'm anxious <b>about</b> the thing." ...|$|R
60|$|Yours of <b>yesterday,</b> <b>about</b> a {{call for}} three hundred thousand, is received. I suppose you {{had not seen the}} call for five hundred thousand, made the day before, and which, I suppose, covers the case. Always glad to have your suggestions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know that, and, come {{to think}} of it, I was reading only <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> a movies' actor who, in a war scene taken out on the Hackensack meadows, fell into a trench, and broke an arm and also a leg. Just the same, I wouldn't mind trying it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, boy, {{have you}} thought over what I said to you <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> fixing upon some profession? You are aware that you cannot expect to lead a life of idleness in this world. I {{know that you are}} fit for nothing, but fit or not fit, you must take to {{something}} without delay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the by, poor young Thompson, {{who died}} <b>yesterday,</b> was <b>about</b> your size; {{and you had}} better bid a lump sum {{for the whole of}} his kit. I shall be happy to be your banker for that, and the needful sum for your {{traveling}} expenses. When you join your regiment you will, of course, be able to draw your pay, from the date on which you were gazetted." ...|$|R
6000|$|The papers {{will have}} {{informed}} you, before you receive this, of poor dear Southey's decease. He died <b>yesterday</b> morning <b>about</b> nine o'clock. Some little time since, he was seized with typhus fever, but {{he passed away}} without any outward signs of pain, as gently as possible. We are, of course, not without sadness upon the occasion, notwithstanding there has been, for years, cause why all who knew and loved him should wish for his deliverance.[189] ...|$|R
5000|$|Suppose {{you know}} that today's ball was red, {{but you have no}} {{information}} <b>about</b> <b>yesterday's</b> ball. The chance that tomorrow's ball will be red is 1/2. That's because the only two remaining outcomes for this random experiment are: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Right, Lily, {{he heard}} {{something}} at dinner <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> {{a school for}} clergymen's sons, which struck him as likely to suit young Devereux Aylmer, and off he set at seven o'clock this morning to Raynham, to breakfast with Mrs. Aylmer, {{and talk to her}} about it. Never let me hear again that he is engrossed with his own affairs!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, I {{was reading}} an article <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> india-rubber {{in one of}} your magazines,' I answered; 'and the person who wrote it said the raw gum was {{hardened}} for vulcanising by mixing it with sulphur. When I heard you ask Cécile for the hot-water-bottle, I thought at once: [...] "The sulphur and the heat account for the tarnishing of Mrs. Evelegh's bangle."' ...|$|E
60|$|Yours of <b>yesterday</b> <b>about</b> provost-marshal system received. As part of {{the same}} subject, let me say I am now pressed in regard to a pending {{assessment}} in St. Louis County. Please examine and satisfy yourself whether this assessment should proceed or be abandoned; and if you decide that it is to proceed, please examine as to the propriety of its application to a gentleman by the name of Charles McLaran.|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, we {{can take}} it easily, Wilcox, and we will stop at the first cocoa-nut tree we come to. Now, Tom, {{as we go along}} you shall tell us <b>about</b> <b>yesterday,</b> we have not heard a word yet.” ...|$|R
40|$|It {{seems that}} the BVerfG has learned a lesson. <b>Yesterday’s</b> {{referral}} <b>about</b> the the European Central Bank’s policy of Quantitative Easing (QE) sets a completely different tone. It reads like a modest and balanced plea for judicial dialogue, rather than an indictment. Fifty years after the original event, a new Summer of Love seems to thrive between the highest judicial bodies. It shows no traces of the aplomb with which Karlsruhe presented its stance to Luxembourg three years ago...|$|R
6000|$|... "We took a {{long drive}} <b>yesterday</b> around <b>about</b> the lovely country [...] roads. But it was a drive whose {{pleasure}} was damaged {{in a couple of}} [...] ways: by the dreadful shrines and by the shameful spectacle of gray [...] and venerable old grandmothers toiling in the fields. The shrines [...] were frequent along the roads--figures of the Saviour nailed to the [...] cross and streaming with blood from the wounds of the nails and the [...] thorns.|$|R
