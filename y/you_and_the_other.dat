H. are reciprocal polars with respect to me (intellectually and morally, for the Scottish baronet is a polar bear, and you, I was going to say, are a polar gentleman). When I send a bit of investigation to Edinburgh, the W. H. of that ilk says I took it from him. When I send you one, you take it from me, generalize it at a glance, bestow it thus generalized upon society at large, and make me the second discoverer of a known theorem.|$|E
500|$|Leslie sees Jeanine Restrepo (Loretta Fox), an {{influential}} zoning board member {{who could help}} Leslie with her plans to turn the Sullivan Street pit into a park. Leslie is too nervous to approach her, so she practices with Mark (Paul Schneider), who teasingly pinches her nose because he says as Jeanine, [...] "I can do whatever I want"; Ann pinches Mark's nose and Leslie pinches Ann's, and Mark summarizes, [...] "It's fun {{to pretend to be}} zoning board members." [...] Marlene suggests Leslie try sucking up to Jeanine in her speech, but it comes across awkwardly when Leslie claims to [...] "love" [...] Jeanine. When Leslie tries to approach her later, Jeanine suggests Leslie make an appointment with her secretary. Marlene says this means Jeanine is blowing them off, and tells Leslie to blackmail Jeanine with the knowledge that her husband has a DUI offense in Illinois. Leslie shares the advice with Ann, who says she believes it is unethical and wrong; offended, Leslie accuses Ann of pampering Andy. ("He's got three crutches, {{and one of them is}} <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two are crutches.") Ann storms off.|$|E
500|$|Chris Williams of Billboard said [...] "with a vocal assist from Ne-Yo and {{a clever}} guest rap by Kanye West, it appears Hilson {{is intent on}} a {{knockout}} punch of her own." [...] Dan Nishimoto of Prefix Magazine said the song {{was one of the}} better radio-friendly tracks on the album. Melinda Newman of HitFix said that [...] "the mid-tempo track is undeniably catchy and will embed itself within your brain after only a few listens." [...] Sophie Bruce of BBC Music positively received the song, calling it the album's [...] "biggest potential hit." [...] Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars, complimenting production by Danja, and saying that the song sounded like a more obvious hit than [...] "Return the Favor", he complained that [...] "getting two R A-listers to appear on your track should be a real coup, but not when one's got a more distinctive voice than <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> steals the show with some typically ballsy rapping." [...] Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters criticized the repetitive hook, stating [...] "Hook-wise, it’s a little like listening to an album of kids chanting while playing double-dutch." [...] He also said that Hilson's vocals [...] "show promise but fail to distinguish the Hilson brand from the crowd." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Harris," [...] he shouted, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> go into <b>the</b> house, <b>and</b> {{first of}} all bring me out one of these fellows' whips. Cairns, pick up his rifle, and reload it. Sankey, do <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> keep guard at <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> don't let those viragoes out"--for three women had just appeared, and were cursing with a fluency that Billingsgate would have envied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah! To leave Paris {{in order}} to engage horses, while <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> do all <b>the</b> work. That is neither {{difficult}} nor dangerous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Florence {{found me}} an errand {{that kept me}} out of the way," [...] said Hilda pointedly. [...] "Now what have <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> been talking about?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Your {{letter to}} Congressmen McLean protesting the {{location}} of a proposed defense housing project in Union Township has been referred to this office. [...] This is to advise you that a decision has been made to locate the project in Clark Township. It is desired to make it entirely clear, however, that in reaching this decision this office in no manner agrees that the numerous protests received from various persons and organizations in Union Township were based upon valid premises. [...] We feel certain that if <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> protesters had been acquainted with all of the facts in the situation, you would not have filed your protest. [...] On the contrary, it is believed that you would have urged the Government to locate the project in your township. [...] Since the project will be undertaken in your immediate neighborhood, you will have ample opportunity to determine for yourselves whether or not the disadvantages to the community, as claimed by your Mayor, were based upon sound facts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Bartley. [...] "Something {{you got out}} of me {{when you}} were trying to make me tell you the difference between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Equity girls?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> I know not," [...] she {{answered}} hurriedly; [...] "but for me I {{think that it}} means death. Yet, not until--not until----" [...] And she ceased.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have settled}} that I am {{to go home}} as soon as I can go down country, and he is going up with <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> to Cawnpore." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then as Seaforth listened, a shout came ringing {{across the}} glinting space before them that seemed curiously still. [...] "Hold on. We're coming. Is that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> Tom?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} shall be cautious," [...] the captain replied; [...] "but I really {{do not think that}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> need bother yourselves to be always {{standing}} on sentry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then if it {{was wrong}} to honor them in that way, and if they were of kin to the Fiend, they could be {{dangerous}} company for <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> children, couldn't they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{takes your}} enemy and your friend, working together, {{to hurt you}} to the heart; the one to slander <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> to get the news to you. [...] --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.|$|E
6000|$|... "There we must disagree," [...] Andrew replied. [...] "If I {{am right}} about the lode, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{shareholders}} will be told all you wish to know; if I am wrong, the loss will be mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Nairn told me I {{would find}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> in <b>the</b> verandah," [...] she {{informed}} him. [...] "She {{said she would}} join <b>you</b> presently, <b>and</b> it was too fine to stay in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{as though}} I have seemed a live person to <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> mummies. Once <b>the</b> change came so swiftly that I smiled at you,--I could not help it,--and you looked away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Nairn told me I {{would find}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> on <b>the</b> veranda," [...] she {{informed}} him. [...] "She {{said she would}} join you presently. It is too fine an evening to stay in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Clinton, {{the surgeon}} has sent {{me up with}} two letters that were found inside the jacket of the wounded {{sergeant}} who was brought in this afternoon. One is directed to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> to Captain Percy Clinton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I, lad," [...] cried March gaily, as {{he flung}} himself upon the grassy mound; [...] "I'm goin' to admire this splendid country till I'm tired of it, and leave <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> fellows {{to do the}} work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he'd just slice you all in halves {{and then}} patch {{half of the}} boy to half of the girl, {{and the other half}} to half of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> half of you to {{the other half of the}} girl. See?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{said the}} Gardener meekly. [...] "You must excuse me, my dear Shaggy, for {{opposing}} your wishes, but <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> including Ozga, must {{get out of}} Rose Kingdom immediately, if not before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should like}} to oblige him,' said the gentlemanly old incumbent. 'And I would forego all fees willingly. Still, if <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> don't think <b>you</b> can carry it out, I am in doubt what to say.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Haven't you had sea trips {{enough with}} being cast {{away in the}} middle of <b>the</b> Pacific, <b>and</b> being wrecked in the Gulf of Mexico? It seems to me every time <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> leave home {{something}} serious happens to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what I expect, Macumazahn, but I do know that never while I live will I be parted from the lady Heddana. At last I have found some one to love, and <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> would steal her away from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Major WALTER, Boksburg.--Honoured Sir,--I must express to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{officers}} of Boksburg my heartfelt {{thanks for the}} great kindness shown towards my wife, {{and at the same}} time for the message, and I hope that this kindness may some time be repaid to you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot conceive," [...] writes Dinwiddie in reply, [...] "what service {{you can be}} of {{in going}} there, as the plan concerted will, in course, be communicated to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> officers. However, as you seem so earnest to go, I now give you leave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{must have}} {{inherited}} it. I'm told that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> held <b>the</b> barricade stubbornly for two hours. Don Martin {{admits that he}} might not have taken Rio Frio if it hadn't been for the stand you made." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I do, Calvert. Didn't {{you hire}} my horses, once?" [...] I replied. [...] "You must take my meaning {{the right way}} when I say that I'm pleased to see you here. But what brought <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> into this desolation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Alice put {{her hand}} in his. [...] "I think I shall love it; I'm not afraid, Jake. There's {{something}} in <b>the</b> clear air <b>and</b> sunshine that makes one brave. Then it's virgin country; waiting for <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> to make good use of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] I answered, [...] "it {{is the day}} of {{new moon}} when the Zulus don't fight. Still if {{anything}} of the sort should happen, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> boys had better slip away to Natal, since the Government must pay for the wagons and oxen." ...|$|E
6000|$|Brooke {{shook his}} head. [...] "No," [...] he said, drily, [...] "I don't think there are. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> man make two, while I {{scarcely}} fancy {{either of you}} will get hold of the papers, because I gave them back to Devine, and he has sent them to Vancouver." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'General Dingo has {{informed}} me, Señor Casparis, of your gallant {{service in}} our cause. I desire {{to thank you}} with my person. The bravery of <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> señores Americanos turned the struggle for liberty in our favour. Our party triumphed.

6000|$|... "No--no, I haven't {{anybody in}} the world. That is why I hate vacation, that is why I've hated to hear <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> {{discussing}} your vacation plans. You all have somebody to go to. It has just filled me up with hatred of my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ingleby laughed frankly, {{though there}} was a little flush in his face. [...] "I know I very often talk like a fool--and <b>the</b> {{difference}} between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> is that <b>you</b> very seldom think it necessary to remind me of it. That is, of course, one difference. The rest----" ...|$|R
