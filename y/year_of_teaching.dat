5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching,</b> he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E

After another reassignment, he {{was assigned}} as an instructor to a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps program at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. While instructing the Naval ROTC, Williams was also asked by {{the dean of the}} University of Michigan's School of Business to instruct 150 students in business and finance. After a <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> at the University of Michigan, Williams was discharged from the United States Navy with the military rank of lieutenant commander in 1947.|$|E
25|$|Rusk {{began his}} {{mountaineering}} {{career in the}} summer following the completion of his first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> school. He and his uncle W. A. Maxwell ascended Mount Adams via the South Climb. The next year, 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of Adams. This was the first recorded circuit by white women and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone. On this trip, he named Avalanche Valley and Rusk Glacier; however, the Rusk Glacier name was not official until 1901 when Rusk assisted Harry Fielding Reid in mapping Adams.|$|E

25|$|The young Clarence {{attended}} Allegheny College and the University of Michigan Law School, {{but did not}} {{graduate from}} either institution. He attended Allegheny College for only one year before the Panic of 1873 struck, and Darrow {{was determined not to}} be a financial burden to his father any longer. Over the next three years he taught in the winter at the district school in a country community. While teaching, Darrow started to study the law on his own, {{and by the end of}} his third <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching,</b> his family urged him to enter the law department at Ann Arbor. Darrow only studied there a year when he decided that it would be much more cost-effective to work and study in an actual law office. When he felt that he was ready, he took the Ohio bar exam and passed. He was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1878. The Clarence Darrow Octagon House, his childhood home in Kinsman, contains a memorial to him.|$|E

Eisenhower asked the most practical questions, and was unquestionably motivated—he finished first in his class. [...] Nearly every officer who commanded a division in Europe during World War II attended the Command and General Staff School during Middleton's tenure there from 1924 to 1928. There was also a point in time during World War II when every corps commander in Europe had been a student of Middleton's.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the leadership readiness beliefs of 185 prospective school leaders in which they participated during school management program. A moderate level was found in leadership readiness (Total), and in Focus and magnitude subscales. While a high level was found in Purposeful Community subscale.

Regarding to <b>teaching</b> experience, results <b>of</b> study in "Focus subscale" indicate that the (5 -less 10 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> experience) had significantly upper leadership readiness than both the (less 5 years) and (10 and more <b>years)</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> experience.

500|$|During Johnson's twenty-seventh <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> at the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, he framed a {{bill for}} the West Virginia Legislature which would {{separate}} the institution into two schools: one for the deaf {{and one for the}} blind. It read in part: [...] "Be it enacted, That the West Virginia schools for the deaf and the blind, located at Romney, in the county of Hampshire, shall, after the expiration of the present term, that is to say after the 15th day June, 1897, cease to be a school for the education of deaf and blind youth, and shall thereafter be a school for the education of deaf youth only", and would provide a separate school for the blind. Despite Johnson's active support for the bill, it failed to pass. In 1892 he wrote an article which was published in the Perkins Institute for the Blind publication The Mentor, [...] "Keep the Schools Out of Politics", decrying the appointment of school administrators, educators and trustees on the institute's Board of Regents based on affiliation with the West Virginia Democratic Party instead of qualifications.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{although}} Toole {{was disappointed}} that the novel could not be published as is, he was exuberant that a major publisher was interested in it. He entered his second <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> at Dominican {{as one of the}} favorite new professors on staff. Students marveled at his wit, and Toole would make entire classes burst into laughter while hardly showing expression. He never retold a story or joke, and had many repeat students. Shortly before Christmas break in 1964, Toole received a letter from Gottlieb. In it Gottlieb remarked that he had shown the novel to Candida Donadio, a literary agent whose clients included Joseph Heller and Thomas Pynchon. Gottlieb told Toole they felt he was [...] "... wildly funny often, funnier than almost anyone around". Also they liked the same portions and characters of the book and disliked the same parts as well. Gottlieb gave a list of things he did not like concluding with: ...|$|E

This normal course is bad enough, but the regular school will be FIERCE! If it wasn't too late to get a job in the Cities, I swear I'd resign here. I bet I won't dare to go to a single dance all winter. If I cut loose and danced the way I like to, they'd think I was a perfect hellion--poor harmless me! Oh, I oughtn't to be talking like this.
