2500|$|<b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{there was}} a, quote, [...] "miscalculation {{of what the}} {{conditions}} would be in postwar Iraq." [...] What was the miscalculation, and how did it happen? ...|$|E
2500|$|I'd {{like to ask}} you, Mr. President, [...] your {{decision}} to invade Iraq ... Every reason given, publicly at least, has {{turned out not to}} be true. My question is: Why did you really want to go to war? .... <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it wasn't oil...quest for oil, it hasn't been Israel, or anything else. What was it? ...|$|E
2500|$|Nation {{continued}} her destructive ways in Kansas, her fame spreading through her growing arrest record. After she led a raid in Wichita, her husband joked {{that she should}} use a hatchet next time for maximum damage. Nation replied, [...] "That is the most sensible thing <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> since I married you." [...] The couple divorced in 1901; they had no children. Between 1902-06 she lived in Guthrie, Oklahoma.|$|E

I told him jest wot passed yesterday, sir, and that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> to me, [...] "Can you be here by seven in the morning?" [...] and that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> to him, through me, [...] "Can you be here by ten in the morning?" [...] and that I <b>had</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Yes" [...] to both. That's all, sir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|BRODIE. <b>You</b> should <b>have</b> <b>said</b> I was in trade, {{and had a}} good business. That's what <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> <b>said.</b> That's what <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>had</b> <b>you</b> {{been worth}} your salt. But it's blunder, blunder, outside and in (upstairs, down-stairs, and in my lady's chamber). You women! Did he see Smith? ...|$|R

2500|$|Part of what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> and Senator Kerry {{has said}} {{that you are going}} to do in order to get us out of the {{problems}} in Iraq is to internationalize the effort. Yet French and German officials have both said they have no intention even if John Kerry is elected of sending any troops into Iraq for any peacekeeping effort. Does that make your effort or your plan to internationalize this effort seem kind of naïve? ...|$|E
2500|$|You have, as {{you have}} {{proposed}} and {{as the president has}} commented on tonight, proposed a massive plan to extend health-care coverage to children. You're also talking about the government picking up {{a big part of the}} catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital. And <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that you can pay for this by rolling back the president's tax cut on the upper two percent. You heard the president say earlier tonight that it's going to cost a whole lot more money than that. I'd just ask you, where are you going to get the money? ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{first began}} to exhibit {{symptoms}} {{at the age of}} 29 but continued to work in the asbestos mill until 22 July 1922, when she was certified unfit to work. Because Kershaw's medical certificate (produced by her local physician Dr Walter Scott Joss) recorded the diagnosis as [...] "asbestos poisoning" [...] she was ineligible for National Health Insurance sickness benefits. As the illness was linked to her occupation, the insurers advised her that she should instead seek sickness benefits from her employers, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and wrote to Turner Brothers on her behalf on several occasions. However, Turner Brothers refused to pay any benefits because asbestos-related illness was not a recognised occupational disease at that time, and instructed their insurance company to [...] "repudiate the claim" [...] as it would be [...] "exceedingly dangerous" [...] to accept [...] "any liability whatever in such a case." [...] Percy George Kenyon, Turner's works' manager at Rochdale, wrote to Dr Joss demanding that he [...] "inform us what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to Miss [...] Kershaw about suffering from Asbestos poisoning" [...] and then wrote to the medical insurance board stating that [...] "We repudiate the term [...] "Asbestos Poisoning". Asbestos is not poisonous and no definition or knowledge of such a disease exists. Such a description is not to be found amongst the list of industrial diseases in the schedule published with the Workmen's Compensation Act." ...|$|E

60|$|Oddly enough, I {{encountered}} neither. But when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> everything, for {{in every}} other way the conditions could scarcely have been fouler.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{thought that}} what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> out of pity, because you fear lest my necessities should hurt me, I {{could give you}} no hope at all. I have my pride, mon ami. But if what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> you would still have said though I had {{continued}} mistress of Condillac, then, Tressan, you may repeat it to me hereafter, at a season when I may listen." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she assented. [...] "But {{you might}} be sorry again that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> it." [...] It sounded like coquetry, {{but he knew it}} was not coquetry.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> that before, Jim," [...] Reuben said. [...] "We {{would have}} kept {{together}} and have galloped on, and taken our chance of finding them." ...|$|R

5000|$|Ubykh is agglutinative and polysynthetic: [...] ('we {{will not}} be able to go back'), [...] ('if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> it'). Ubykh is often {{extremely}} concise in its word forms.|$|R
