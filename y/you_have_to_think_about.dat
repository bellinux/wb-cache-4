For {{the first time in}} his life, he felt how {{comfortable}} it was to have nothing on him but himself.

50|$|In {{a passage}} from Hell's Angels: Long Nights, Ugly Days, Orgy of the Doomed... Thompson sums up his fascination {{with the world of}} writing:I found out then that writing is a kind of therapy. One of the few ways I can almost be certain I'll {{understand}} something is by sitting down and writing about it. Because by forcing yourself to write about it and putting it down in words, you can't avoid having {{to come to grips with}} it. You might be wrong, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it very intensely to write about it. So I use writing as a learning tool.|$|E

On joining Stevenage and leaving his {{hometown}} club after four years, Hartley stated - [...] "I'm {{really looking forward}} to it. It's a great challenge. I have played against Graham's teams in the past and they are always strong and tough to play against. Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what you want out of your career. I'm a hungry and ambitious person. This is a new challenge - it's a new set of lads, a new manager, a new town and new ambitions, it's what I need. I think I need this new start to improve again and I'm excited by it".|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with CityBeat, bassist Elijah Thomson explained the origin of band name: [...] "Russ and Jason had named their studio Everest Recordings because of {{a pack of cigarettes}} that Geoff Emerick had. He was an engineer on a lot of the Beatles stuff and supposedly Abbey Road was originally going to be named Everest {{and they were going to}} do a photo shoot in Nepal. It became a logistical nightmare and, as the legend goes, Paul or somebody said, [...] "Let’s shoot a picture out front and be done with it." [...] So the name Everest has significance to them, however it is sort of a common thing for something to be named. It is hard to Google something like that. That is something <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> nowadays and maybe it gets lost in the shuffle a little bit." ...|$|E
5000|$|Platt married Mary Camilla ("Camilla") Bonsal Campbell on September 12, 1992 at the First Congregational Church in Kittery Point, Maine. He now {{focuses on}} film and {{television}} more than theater because [...] "I've got a wife and three kids, so film is just the most viable thing for me right now. I still love the theater, but the commitment in {{time and energy to}} do live theater is so great, and, frankly, the financial rewards are just not as attractive. When you have a family, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> those things." [...] Platt's older daughter, Lily, was born in 1995, his son, George, was born in 1997, and his younger daughter, Claire, was born in 1999. Platt has an open airline ticket when filming so he can return home frequently because his family does not accompany him to filming locations.|$|E
5000|$|When {{being offered}} to produce someone, Dunn prefers [...] "people {{to send the}} roughest demos {{possible}} rather than more elaborate ones. And I try to see if it’s music that I - or my aesthetics - can work with. Like, with their vision, and the end goal". He {{also pointed out that}} [...] "people themselves are a really big thing for me. I just try to find people that you can spend ten days with in a small room, still enjoy each other’s music and company, and be collaborative". As a musician, Dunn described himself [...] "as an arranger in the studio. I learned a lot of that from Eyvind, working with him on his music or in different capacities.

Howell won the tournament, scoring a maximum 5 points after beating Bowers in the final round, although he commented afterwards [...] "This is the first time I have played in a circular chess contest and it was difficult.

5000|$|Prior to [...] "Where Do I Go from You" [...] being {{released}} as a single, Walker expressed {{that he thought}} [...] "Summer Song" [...] {{would be a better}} choice. He explained in an interview with CMT, [...] "There can only be one boss, and we know who that is. But it's OK. That's the way it goes." [...] In an interview with GAC, Walker explained the song by saying, [...] "Out of all the songs I've recorded since [...] "What's It To You," [...] my first record, this has that youthful energy I had on that first song. Production-wise it's as modern as anything I've ever done. I'm pretty much considered a new traditionalist, but I do have R&B and pop roots mixed in." [...] Walker told the Albuquerque Journal, [...] "I like the new single that's out right now because it's musically just one of those songs you can groove to right away. It's not one that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> So I like the fact that my record label picked it as the follow-up." ...|$|E

The only thing <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> is making the pitch, because you know Yadi's going to catch whatever you throw." [...] — Cardinals starting pitcher Adam Wainwright Molina is known for his in-game pitch-calling skills, and pitchers rarely reject signs that he shows for the next pitch. Matheny stated, [...] "We tell all our young pitchers when they come up to pitch their game. Yadi needs to find out how they work. He's a quick study. But at the same time, they tend to just follow him. We do put them in Yadi's hands." [...] Molina reads opposing hitters and will move fielders with subtle signs and gestures to align them with his pitch calling. [...] La Russa commented that [...] "it's not just instinct. It's sense, based on how a hitter's standing, how he responds to the pitch or two before, and he's very creative in how he makes his adjustment based on what he sees with the hitter and knowing what his pitcher can do." ...|$|E

5000|$|The post Cold War {{period is}} known as the [...] "Special Period" [...] in Cuba. During this time period the Cuban cinema {{industry}} suffered greatly (as did the Cuban citizens due to severe economic depression). This is best phrased by Elliott Young:The state expected artists, filmmakers, and intellectuals to become economically autonomous and not rely on state subsidies; this new market orientation forced cultural producers to seek foreign financing or simply to leave the country altogether. The impact of the economic crisis hit the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográfico (ICAIC) directly, leading to an exodus of personnel and the slowing down of production to the extent that, in 1996, the Institute did not release a single feature filmThe films that were produced were no longer made solely for Cuban people, but mainly for foreign audiences. Pastor Vega states [...] "Before one only thought about the Cuban public. Now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> 'marketing' and 'profits' and all that." [...] However, the films that were produced for the Cuban people, tended to take a more drastic turn towards more controversial issues. One of the biggest genres that came out of this period was about homosexuality. One of the most popular movies that come out of this time period is called Fresa y chocolate (1994, Strawberry and Chocolate). The success of this movie [...] "can be partially explained by the way the film elicits multiple recognition from the Cuban viewer" [...] and that it makes the viewer think/look at the film in a different light.|$|E
