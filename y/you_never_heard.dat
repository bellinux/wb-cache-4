500|$|Technically, it {{is known}} as a speaker that easily reveals poor quality in recordings. [...] Recording {{engineers}} sought to dull its treble response by hanging tissue paper in front of it, resulting in {{what became known as the}} [...] "tissue paper effect", a type of comb filtering. The NS-10 has been used to monitor a large number of successful recordings by numerous artists, leading Gizmodo to refer to it as [...] "the most important loudspeaker <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of".|$|E

500|$|Zappa's last tour in a {{rock and}} jazz band format took place in 1988 with a 12-piece group which had a {{repertoire}} of over 100 (mostly Zappa) compositions, but which split under acrimonious circumstances before the tour was completed. The tour was documented on the albums Broadway the Hard Way (new material featuring songs with strong political emphasis); The Best Band <b>You</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Heard</b> in Your Life (Zappa [...] "standards" [...] and an eclectic collection of cover tunes, ranging from Maurice Ravel's Boléro to Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven); and Make a Jazz Noise Here. Parts are also found on You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, volumes 4 and 6. Recordings from this tour also appear on the 2006 album Trance-Fusion.|$|E

Warne had doubts about the name 'tod' for a fox, but Potter responded:"Tod" [...] is surely a very common name for a fox? It is probably Saxon, it was the word in ordinary use in Scotland a few years ago, probably is still amongst the country people.

500|$|... {{women in}} Saudi Arabia have limited freedom of {{movement}} and in practice {{are not allowed to}} drive motor vehicles. In 1990, dozens of women in Riyadh drove their cars in protest, were imprisoned for one day, had their passports confiscated, and some of them lost their jobs. In September 2007, the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, co-founded by Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Uyyouni, gave a 1,100 signature petition to King Abdullah asking for women to be allowed to drive. On International Women's Day 2008, Huwaider filmed herself driving and received international media attention after the video was posted on YouTube. Inspired by the Arab Spring, a woman from Jeddah, Najla Hariri, started driving in the second week of May 2011, stating [...] "Before in Saudi, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> about protests.

500|$|Typically, {{there were}} two dog {{trainers}} on the set, each teetering on a stepladder only Lassie could see and waving a chunk of meat at the dog. [...] "It would look as though Lassie was looking at Jon (Provost), but he was really looking past Jon at the piece of beef", Lockhart recalled in 2004. When Provost delivered his line, the trainer behind Lockhart would whisper [...] "Lassie!" [...] and wave another piece of meat. Lassie's head would turn to Lockhart who would deliver her line. Then the trainer behind Provost would get Lassie's attention again, and Provost would deliver his next line. [...] "The sound editor would cut out all that," [...] Lockhart said, [...] "You finally got to where <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> the trainers. Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it." [...] In addition to the main Lassie, three other Lassies might be involved in an episode shoot: a stand-in for rehearsals, a stunt double, and a [...] "fighter" [...] for scenes involving battles with other animals.|$|E

500|$|When Selman returned, Scully scolded him {{and told}} him that he had to {{apologize}} to the mayor of East St. Louis, who, unbeknownst to Selman, was portrayed by Marc Wilmore. Wilmore, a former writer on the television comedy The PJ's, had been asked by Scully to participate in a practical joke, in which he would play the mayor of East St. Louis and confront Selman about his controversial statement. According to Selman, Wilmore gave an [...] "Oscar-worthy performance". [...] "I was terrified", he stated in the DVD commentary for the episode, [...] " [...] a twenty-minute discussion in which [...] said that [...] children were teased at school , and that the Fox affiliate were gonna be thrown off the air..." [...] According to Wilmore, Selman immediately blamed the other writers. Said Selman, [...] "Well, everyone participates, you know [...] Have <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of the word 'collaboration'?"

2500|$|According to Brian Dunning no one {{has ever}} seen this diary, and there is no {{evidence}} that it ever existed: [...] "Conveniently, every person with firsthand knowledge of the Bell Witch hauntings was already dead when Ingram started his book; in fact, every person with secondhand knowledge was even dead." [...] Dunning also concluded that Ingram was guilty of falsifying another statement, that the Saturday Evening Post had published a story in 1849 accusing the Bells' daughter Elizabeth of creating the witch, an article [...] which was not found at the time. Joe Nickell argues the chapter includes the use of Masonic themes and anachronism which impacts credibility. Jim Brooks, native of Adams, writes in his work Bell Witch Stories <b>You</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Heard,</b> that Bell family descendants report that Ingram did not return the manuscript to the family. Brooks explores the possibility that Ingram would have had an enhanced opportunity to modify the story by not returning the papers.|$|E

[...] "He frequently wrote in language that echoed Henry Morton Stanley's African diary. ‘Imagine discovering a continent so vast that it may have no end to its dimensions. Imagine a new world with more resources than all our future greed might exhaust, more opportunities than there will ever be entrepreneurs enough to exploit, and a peculiar kind of real estate that expands with development. Imagine a place where trespassers leave no footprints, where goods can be stolen infinite number of times and yet remain in the possession of their original owners, where business <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of can own the history of your personal affairs.’" [...] He wanted to encourage and provoke youngsters to explore the cyberspace through his writing.|$|E
