5|$|Birmingham City Football Club, an {{association}} football club based in Birmingham, England, {{was founded in}} 1875 as Small Heath Alliance. For the first thirteen <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> existence, there was no league football, so matches were arranged on an ad hoc basis, supplemented by cup competitions organised at local and national level. Small Heath first entered the FA Cup in the 1881–82 season, and won their first trophy, the Walsall Cup, the following season. During the 1880s, they played between 20 and 30 matches each season.|$|E

5|$|Hibs {{played on}} The Meadows {{for the first}} two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> history, before moving to grounds in Newington (Mayfield Park) and Bonnington Road, Leith (Powderhall), in {{different}} spells between 1877 and 1879. After the lease on Mayfield Park expired, Hibs moved to a ground known as Hibernian Park, on what is now Bothwell Street in Leith. Hibs failed to secure the ground lease and a builder started constructing houses on the site in 1890.

5|$|In the 1950s, {{the site}} {{began to be}} used as a {{religious}} retirement community by elderly Lhasans, who constructed small huts in which they could live out the final <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives in intensive Buddhist practice. Nuns began to renovate the site in the 1980s and founded the modern nunnery, as it is seen today, in 1984, and has since grown into one of the largest nunneries in the Lhasa Valley. However, somewhat unusually, the houses are owned individually by the nuns, but the nunnery has an administrative body and a site for communal gathering.|$|E

5|$|On 17 May 2008, the BBC {{reported}} that the tenants had put the remaining 40 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lease up for sale, with an asking price of £15,000,000.

In September 2008 {{it was announced that}} Starboard Settlement, a trust, had acquired the remainder of the lease for considerably less than the asking price. The trust formed a company based in Guernsey, Herm Island Ltd, to manage the island for the trustees.|$|E
