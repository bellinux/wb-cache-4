25|$|In 1939, Tucker {{organized}} a sit-in at Alexandria Library, which refused to issue library cards to black residents.

Tucker had instructed the men to dress well, speak politely and offer no resistance to the police so as to minimize the chance of the men being found guilty of disorderly conduct or resisting arrest. Tucker defended the men in the ensuing legal actions, which resulted in the disorderly conduct charges against the protestors being dropped by city attorney Armistead Boothe (who would later become a key figure in desegregating Virginia schools), and in a branch library being established for blacks.|$|E

Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media cited the latter point as a probable source of concern among parents having their children watch the series. While she regarded the emptiness of the protagonists' adventures as [...] "surprisingly amusing" [...] in a similar vein to Seinfeld, Ashby ultimately called it [...] "mindless entertainment", stating [...] "there are no subtle themes nor any clever satire to be had here." ...|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>men,</b> and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace.

40|$|We {{examined}} whether implicit {{stereotypes of}} <b>younger</b> <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> as physically threatening extend to older <b>Black</b> <b>men.</b> In Experiment 1, participants categorized objects as weapons or tools, following briefly presented prime images {{of men who}} varied in age (younger, older) and race (Black, White). In Experiment 2, we used new prime images of <b>younger</b> and older <b>Black</b> and White <b>men,</b> and participants categorized words as threatening or safe. Results revealed robust racial biases in object and word identification, replicating prior research: Threatening stimuli were more quickly and accurately identified after Black primes, whereas non-threatening stimuli were more quickly and accurately identified after White primes. Process-dissociation analyses further indicated that these effects were entirely driven by racial biases in automatic processing. Prime age did not moderate any of these effects, suggesting that implicit threat-based racial biases commonly evoked by <b>younger</b> <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> appear to extend to older <b>Black</b> <b>men...</b>|$|R
