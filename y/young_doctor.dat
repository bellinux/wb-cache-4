5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh {{returned}} to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where Félix Rey, a <b>young</b> <b>doctor</b> still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey {{did not attempt to}} reattach it as too much time had passed.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the plot of Cars bears a {{striking}} resemblance to that of Doc Hollywood, the 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot <b>young</b> <b>doctor,</b> who, after causing a traffic accident in a small town, is sentenced to work at the town hospital, {{falls in love with a}} local law student and eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values. Some have gone so far as to say that the makers of Cars plagiarized the script of Doc Hollywood.|$|E
50|$|After the 13-week {{trial period}} The Sullivans (which had a budget which was three times bigger than The <b>Young</b> <b>Doctors)</b> {{emerged as the}} {{critical}} success, so The <b>Young</b> <b>Doctors</b> was cancelled. Fans of The <b>Young</b> <b>Doctors</b> lobbied Channel 9, who reversed their decision. The <b>Young</b> <b>Doctors</b> continued in its 6.00 pm slot and had a successful run. After several years, many long running characters left the series and in the final season during 1982 several new cast members were added.|$|R
40|$|For an {{experienced}} physician, {{it is common}} practice that the patient undresses for a physical examination. Medical students and <b>young</b> <b>doctors</b> can be more restrained. Unfamiliarity, feelings of shame and fear of being accused of sexual intimidation can prevent them from having the patient undress. This can lead to an incomplete performance of the physical examination by <b>young</b> <b>doctors,</b> and to missed diagnoses. This article's aim is to offer educators guidance to help <b>young</b> <b>doctors</b> in dealing with this subject...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Young</b> <b>Doctors</b> {{was also}} aired on Sky Channel from Monday, 6 February 1989.

When Sky purchased the newer Australian soap E Street in April 1992, they eventually cancelled The <b>Young</b> <b>Doctors</b> after around 900 episodes in July to accommodate an afternoon repeat of the American medical series St Elsewhere.|$|R
5|$|Kurosawa, with {{producer}} Sōjirō Motoki {{and fellow}} directors and friends Kajiro Yamamoto, Mikio Naruse and Senkichi Taniguchi, formed a new independent production unit called Film Art Association (Eiga Geijutsu Kyōkai). For this organization's debut work, and first film for Daiei studios, Kurosawa {{turned to a}} contemporary play by Kazuo Kikuta and, together with Taniguchi, adapted it for the screen. The Quiet Duel starred Toshiro Mifune as an idealistic <b>young</b> <b>doctor</b> struggling with syphilis, a deliberate attempt by Kurosawa to break the actor away from being typecast as gangsters. Released in March 1949, it was a box office success, but is generally {{considered one of the}} director's lesser achievements.|$|E

Inspired by a conversation with Kelly's parents about Hindu marriage customs, Michael publicly proposes to Carol (Nancy Carell). Uncomfortable, Carol declines his offer and leaves the room. She later explains that this is only their ninth date, and drives home, leaving Michael to find a ride.|$|E

25|$|The longstanding estate {{battle of}} Jarndyce v Jarndyce {{hangs over the}} heads of many {{conflicting}} heirs, confused by multiple wills. Possible beneficiary John Jarndyce of Bleak House welcomes orphaned cousins Ada Clare and Richard Carstone — also potential heirs — as his wards, and has hired Esther Summerson as a housekeeper and companion for Ada.

25|$|Edward William Archibald {{was born}} on August 5, 1872 in Montreal, Quebec to father John Sprott Archibald and mother Ellen Hutchison. The young Edward's family had moved around a great deal before he was born, with his {{ancestors}} first living in Scotland, then moving through Ireland, New Hampshire, Nova Scotia and eventually Quebec. His parents insisted that all their children experience a foreign culture experience, with {{the added benefit of}} becoming bilingual. To this end, the young Archibald was sent to Grenoble, France by his parents to study upon reaching adolescence. In 1888, after returning to Canada, Archibald entered the McGill University Faculty of Arts, graduating from there with a Bachelor of Arts in 1892. He continued at McGill, entering medical school and graduating with a Doctor of Medicine in 1896. There, he became interested in the medical specialisation field of surgery, and although the invention of general anaesthesia and other technological improvements made surgery a fast-moving field, Archibald said that he opted to become a surgeon due to the logic involved and the application of theoretical knowledge in practice. The <b>young</b> <b>doctor</b> began his surgical career with a three-year program at McGill University, with what was essentially an apprenticeship in the field at Royal Victoria Hospital, which had opened only a few years earlier. Archibald also spent a year in Europe, where he studied under the guidance of Ludwig Aschoff and Jan Mikulicz-Radecki. He was impressed the most by the surgical methods of the latter, which were groundbreaking for the time.|$|E
