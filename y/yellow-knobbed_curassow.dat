50|$|The <b>yellow-knobbed</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax daubentoni) {{is a large}} {{species of}} bird found in forest and {{woodland}} in Colombia and Venezuela. It feeds mainly on the ground, but flies up into trees if threatened. Its most striking features are its crest, made of feathers that curl forward, and the fleshy yellow knob {{at the base of}} its bill. Females lack this fleshy yellow knob, but otherwise resemble the male in the plumage, being overall black with a white crissum (the area around the cloaca). The adult is 84-92.5 cm (33-37 in) and weighs about 2-3 kg (4.4-6.6 lbs). It eats fruits, leaves, seeds, and small animals. Unlike most other gamebirds, curassows nest off the ground, with both sexes helping in the construction. The female lays just 2 eggs - a tiny clutch compared to those of many ground-nesting gamebirds.|$|E
40|$|Multi‐faceted field {{sampling}} in {{a mosaic}} landscape in Venezuela generated insights on how topographical characteristics, forest composition, degree of habitat interspersion, and paleoecology influenced the abundance {{and distribution of}} vertebrates. Physical heterogeneity resulted in distinct vegetation types and a very uneven distribution of medium to large‐sized vertebrates. Variations in forest composition resulted in dramatic contrasts in primate densities. White‐tailed deer densities varied {{an order of magnitude}} between vegetation types. <b>Yellow‐knobbed</b> <b>curassow</b> densities peaked in moist forest. Similar chachalaca densities were encountered in dry forest. Although there was spatial overlap between jaguars and pumas, from a large‐scale perspective pumas made more use of drier habitats. In select habitats the abundance and biomass of red‐footed tortoises exceeded that of multiple species of large native mammals combined. This variation in animal abundance highlights the significance of scale in the interpretation of ecological data...|$|E
5000|$|The {{northern}} lineage quite {{soon thereafter}} radiated into {{the ancestors of}} the great, blue-billed, and <b>yellow-knobbed</b> <b>curassows,</b> which were isolated from each other by the uplift of the northern Cordillera Occidental, and the Serranía del Perijá, respectively; it is fairly certain that these lineages were well distinct {{by the end of}} the Miocene. (Pereira & Baker 2004) ...|$|R
50|$|Adults {{look very}} much {{like those of the}} red-billed curassow (C. blumenbachii), whose males have only an indistinct maxilla knob. Its females have a blackish cere, rather pale legs and feet, and their wings - {{particularly}} the remiges - usually have distinct chestnut brown marbling. The black curassow subspecies C. alector erythrognatha, found north of the Solimões, has a cere like the wattled curassow female, but its bill is lighter and the crissum is white in both sexes. Young C. globulosa males are easily confused with those of the <b>yellow-knobbed</b> <b>curassows</b> (C. daubentoni), but the latter has a white tail-margin and yellow (not orange) bill wattle. All these similar species are allopatric however, with only C. a. erythrognatha occurring adjacent to the range of C. globulosa.|$|R
50|$|From captivity, hybrids {{with the}} blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti) are known. That species {{is one of}} the {{northern}} group of Crax. The <b>yellow-knobbed</b> <b>curassows</b> (C. daubentoni) is probably closest to it, but regardless, they are quite distinct from the wattled curassow. But viable (though not dependably fertile) hybrids are suspected to be possible between any two species of Cracidae. The color and shape of the bill ornaments of male Crax hybrids are not easily predicted, but character displacement would demand the eastern (if any) subspecies of the black curassow (C. a. alector) to have a red ornamentation, as no red-ornamented congeners occur in or near its range. The red cere of the western black curassow may well be due to occasional hybrid introgression of C. globulosa alleles, as {{it is unlikely that the}} Solimões is entirely impassable to these birds.|$|R
50|$|Crax is a genus of {{curassows}} in {{the order}} Galliformes, a clade of large, heavy-bodied, ground-feeding birds. They are known from tropical South America with one species, the great curassow, ranging northwards through Central America as far as Mexico. The currasows in this genus are noted for their sexual dimorphism; males are more boldly coloured than females and have facial ornamentation such as knobs and wattles. They are also characterised by curly crests and contrastingly-coloured crissums (the area around the cloaca). Crax curassows probably originated as a distinct lineage during the Late Miocene. During the Messinian, the ancestral Crax split into two lineages separated by the Colombian Andes and the Cordillera de Mérida which uplifted at that time. The northern lineage radiated into the great, blue-billed, and <b>yellow-knobbed</b> <b>curassows,</b> while the four southern species evolved as they became separated by the uplifting of various mountain ranges.|$|R
