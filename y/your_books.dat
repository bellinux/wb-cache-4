The feeling pervades the work of so many writers, although some of them may express it unconsciously." ...|$|E
500|$|After the 2001 {{inauguration of}} Harvard University's twenty-seventh president, Lawrence Summers, Lewis and Summers came into {{conflict}} over {{the direction of}} the College and its educational philosophy. Lewis, for example, emphasized the importance of extracurricular pursuits, advising incoming freshmen that [...] "flexibility in your schedule, unstructured time in your day, and evenings spent with your friends rather than <b>your</b> <b>books</b> are all, in a larger sense, essential for your education", while Summers complained of an insufficiently intellectual [...] "Camp Harvard" [...] and admonished students that [...] "You are here to work, and your business here is to learn." [...] After Lewis issued what The Harvard Crimson called [...] "a scathing indictment of the view that increasing intellectual rigor ought to be the [...] priority"pointing out that prospective employers show less interest in grades than in personal qualities built outside the classroomhe was peremptorily removed as dean in March 2003.|$|E

500|$|In {{his other}} works he experimented {{more with less}} {{traditional}} approaches to reality, so that [...] "the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression". A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude. The style of these works fits in the [...] "marvellous realm" [...] described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism. Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, [...] "what is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed." [...] García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,"The way you treat reality in <b>your</b> <b>books</b> ... has been called magical realism. I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it ..." [...] "This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn't limited {{to the price of}} tomatoes and eggs." ...|$|E
2500|$|An avid reader, young Margaret read [...] "boys' stories" [...] by G.A. Henty, the Tom Swift series, and the Rover Boys {{series by}} Edward Stratemeyer. Her mother read Mary Johnston's novels to {{her before she}} could read. They both wept reading Johnston's The Long Roll (1911) and Cease Firing (1912). Between the [...] "scream of shells, the mighty onrush of charges, the grim and grisly {{aftermath}} of war", Cease Firing is a romance novel involving the courtship of a Confederate soldier and a Louisiana plantation belle with Civil War illustrations by N. C. Wyeth. She also read the plays of William Shakespeare, and novels by Charles Dickens and Sir Walter Scott. [...] Mitchell's two favorite children's books were by author Edith Nesbit: Five Children and It (1902) and The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904). She kept both on her bookshelf even as an adult and gave them as gifts. Another author whom Mitchell read as a teenager and who had a major impact in her understanding of the Civil War and Reconstruction was Thomas Dixon. Dixon's popular trilogy of novels The Leopard's Spots: A Romance of the White Man's Burden (1902), The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan (1905) and The Traitor: A Story of the Rise and Fall of the Invisible Empire (1907) all depicted in vivid terms a white South victimized during the Reconstruction by Northern carpetbaggers and freed slaves, with an especial emphasis upon Reconstruction as a nightmarish time when black men ran amok, raping white women with impunity. As a teenager, Mitchell liked Dixon's books {{so much that she}} organized the local children to put on dramatizations of his books. The picture the white supremacist Dixon drew of Reconstruction is now rejected as inaccurate, but at the time, the memory of the past was such it was widely believed by white Americans. In a letter to Dixon dated 10 August 1936, Mitchell wrote: [...] "I was practically raised on <b>your</b> <b>books,</b> and love them very much." ...|$|E
