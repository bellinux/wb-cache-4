This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all, then, Hawkins?" [...] {{asked the}} captain, with a troubled face. [...] "What {{is your own}} theory on the matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not unless <b>you</b> <b>make</b> an idol <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> sir, {{and fancy}} that men's souls {{were made for}} the prayer-book, and not the prayer-book for them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly so," [...] he returned. [...] "That's what I mean! You know, just accustom {{yourself}} to talk it over, with your tact {{and in your}} quiet way, with him and Ada, and see what <b>you</b> all <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> We are sure to come {{at the heart of}} the matter by your means, little woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{gave you}} that {{patchwork}} {{to see what}} <b>you</b> would <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and it {{is as good as}} a diary to me, for I can tell by the different squares how you felt when you made them,' continued Aunt Pen, with a twinkle in her eye as she glanced at the many-coloured bits on the carpet.|$|R
6000|$|... "It assuredly is a mystery," [...] said Captain Putnam at last. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Mr. Strong?" [...] {{he asked}} {{of his second}} assistant.|$|E
6000|$|... "This stumps me," [...] {{declared}} the senator's son. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it?</b> Do you think Shadow and Plum {{are up to}} something between them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is queer, {{to say the}} least," [...] remarked Tom as {{they came}} to a halt in a small clearing. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Dick?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "since <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a point <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> I'll get {{down the river}} right away and see where that pump is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is that, {{and why did}} <b>you</b> not <b>make</b> use <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{just now}} to prevent our being needlessly led farther into these mountains?" [...] asked Fred, in surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't. I {{only want}} to warn you that if <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a success <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> can't own a house and land and teams without facing the cost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{told the}} steward to prepare breakfast. Then we shall go back," [...] said I. [...] "But in God's name, Doctor Severall, what do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|ADAM. I {{made the}} earth bring forth by my labor, {{and the woman}} bring forth by my love. And this is what has come of it. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Eve, my wife? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Gar'ner?" [...] Daggett demanded, {{a little}} impatiently. [...] "Water there must be; for no craft that floats could have stood such a squeeze, {{and not have}} her sides open." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And how do {{you know}} it is true?' added Fernando. 'I mean, what Lance has been telling me! What <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> sure <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> if you are?' ...|$|R
6000|$|F.--If you did {{not wish}} to think of the pocopo, and {{speaking}} <b>of</b> man would <b>make</b> <b>you</b> think <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> you would not speak of man, would you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>you</b> <b>make</b> {{too much}} <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Certainly, it was {{fortunate}} we happened to come along; the rest followed. But I {{can understand how}} you feel--I had a good mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|EVE. I nourished the egg in my {{body and}} fed it with my blood. And now they let it fall as the birds did, and suffer not at all. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Cain, my first-born? ...|$|E
6000|$|LILITH. I {{suffered}} unspeakably; I tore myself asunder; I lost my life, {{to make of}} my one flesh these twain, man and woman. And this is {{what has}} come of it. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Adam, my son? ...|$|E
6000|$|I cannot {{scan the}} words the scroll proclaims; [...] Peer as I will, these too quick-thronging dreads [...] Bring {{water to the}} eyes. Grant us, good Heaven, [...] That victory be where she is needed most [...] To prove Thy goodness!... What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{conceive}} {{it possible}} <b>you</b> might <b>make</b> something <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in that way," [...] returned the other. [...] "But {{are you a}} seaman? I thought you {{had been in the}} diplomatic service." ...|$|R
6000|$|He said--"It's {{all right}} in summer, and it's good enough in winter--WHILE IT LASTS. <b>You</b> <b>make</b> the most <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> young 'un;" [...] and he slapped {{me on the back}} and laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hum," [...] {{said the}} Squire, [...] "I don't {{quite like this}} secrecy about these matters of business, but still if <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a point <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> why <b>of</b> course I cannot object." ...|$|R
6000|$|CAIN. I invented {{killing and}} conquest and mastery and the {{winnowing}} {{out of the}} weak by the strong. And now the strong have slain one another; and the weak live for ever; and their deeds do nothing for the doer more than for another. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> snake? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Austen," [...] he said, [...] "I am not at {{all sure}} that I have not brought you up on rather a fool's errand, but you seemed rather mystified {{yourself}} about these Deloras. Here's the cable from Dicky. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it?</b> Must have cost him something, extravagant young beggar!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know, Miss Porter," [...] {{replied the}} young man, [...] "unless we have {{discovered}} a runaway simian from the London Zoo who has brought back a European education to his jungle home. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Professor Porter?" [...] he added, turning to the old man.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And Emil, {{he is to}} be {{second mate}} next voyage; isn't that fine? I'm so happy that both your boys have done well; you gave up so much {{for them and their}} mother. <b>You</b> <b>make</b> light <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> dear, but I never forget it,' said Jo, with her hand in his as sentimentally as if she was a girl again and her Fritz had come a-wooing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "you {{must have}} heard enough about the lode to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> tired <b>of</b> <b>it!</b> However, I expect I shall {{have to go back}} to England before long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{let them}} kill me. And they'll be sorry. I've offered them fifty thousand--later on, of course. They laughed. They don't know. But I know." [...] He fumbled {{in his coat}} pocket and drew forth an object that flashed in the faint light. [...] "They don't {{know the meaning of}} that. But I do." [...] He looked at Grief with abrupt suspicion. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> out <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> eh? What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> out <b>of</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her, with his {{colourless}} candour, {{still in his}} place; she moved about again, a little, emphasising by her unrest her declaration of her tranquillity. He was as silent, at first, {{as if he had}} taken her answer, but he was not to keep it long. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> that, by your own show, Charlotte couldn't tell her all? What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> that the Prince didn't tell her anything? Say one understands that there are things she can't be told--since, as you put it, she is so easily scared and shocked." [...] He produced these objections slowly, giving her time, by his pauses, to stop roaming and come back to him. But she was roaming still when he concluded his inquiry. [...] "If there hadn't been anything there shouldn't have been between the pair before Charlotte bolted--in order, precisely, as you say, that there SHOULDN'T be: why in the world was what there HAD been too bad to be spoken of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gone {{to dress}} for dinner, I suppose," [...] he continued. [...] "It must be getting late. I think I ought to be going, too, if you don't mind. The {{professor}} gets a little restive if I keep him waiting for his daily bread. Great Scott, that watch can't be right! What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it?</b> Yes, so do I. I really think I must run. You won't mind. Good-night, then. See you to-morrow, I hope." ...|$|E
6000|$|Smoke pondered a few minutes, {{then again}} broke silence. [...] "Say, Shorty. Forty {{thousand}} dollars gold weighs two hundred pounds. Wild Water borrowed our sled and team to haul away his eggs. He {{came up the}} hill without a sled. Those two sacks of dust in his coat pockets weighed about twenty pounds each. The understanding was cash on delivery. He brought enough dust {{to pay for the}} good eggs. He never expected to pay for those three thousand. He knew they were bad. Now how did he know they were bad? What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> anyway?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{not given}} to colds,' {{answered}} Guy, and they walked on quickly for some minutes; after which he said, {{in a low voice}} and hurried manner,--'would <b>you</b> <b>make</b> some mention <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in the Thanksgiving?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So far, so good; and yet I don't quite {{see what}} <b>you</b> can <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It {{does not come}} to much, you know, even if {{the owner of the}} coat is the man you want And again, is he likely to have left such a very notable article of dress behind him in an hotel? Anyway, can't you send some detective fellow? Are you going over {{yourself}} in this awful weather?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eames," [...] he said, [...] "I {{want you}} to accept a little present from me,--just as a {{memorial}} of our affair with the bull. <b>It</b> will <b>make</b> <b>you</b> think <b>of</b> <b>it</b> sometimes, when I'm perhaps gone." ...|$|R
