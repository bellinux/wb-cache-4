5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

2500|$|A {{separate}} sound gag {{involved a}} song Benny had written, [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Beg Your Pardon, Then I'll Come Back to You". Its inane lyrics and insipid melody guaranteed {{that it would}} never be published or recorded, but Benny continued to try to con, extort, or otherwise inveigle some of his musical guests (including The Smothers Brothers and Peter, Paul and Mary) to perform it. None ever made it all the way through.|$|E

2500|$|Jesus {{asks the}} disciples who {{people say he}} is, and then, [...] "but you, who do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am?" [...] Peter answers {{that he is the}} Christ, and Jesus {{commands}} him to silence; Jesus explains that the Son of Man must go to Jerusalem and be killed, but will rise again; Moses and Elijah appear with Jesus and God tells the disciples, [...] "This is my son," [...] but they remain uncomprehending.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{is written}} in the key of A major, and their vocals span from E4 to B5. An {{alternate}} version of the song with different lyrics was written and recorded by the band in January 1999. The version was included in some early demo presses of the album. In the alternate version, the song has the opposite message ("I love it when I hear <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> want it that way").|$|E
2500|$|Termination: If {{you don't}} want your subject {{to know what}} you are doing, you simply {{distract}} their attention, usually by some appropriate remark, and casually terminate. Sometimes they remark, [...] "What did <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> <b>I</b> got absentminded there for a moment and wasn't paying attention to anything." [...] This is slightly distressing to the subjects and indicative of the fact that their attention was so focused and fixated on the peculiar hand stimuli that they were momentarily entranced so they did not hear what was said.|$|E

2500|$|... "Emena Thes" [...] {{is a power}} ballad {{with hard}} rock influences. The song begins with a piano {{introduction}} and follows the traditional verse-chorus format. The romantic ballad, a style Rouvas has become notable for over the years of his career, lyrically finds him asking the night and the stars what is to become of a troubled relationship. Rouvas professes his love to his lover, who still has not realized that she {{is in love with}} him, with the hook saying [...] "Wherever you go, whatever <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> am the one you want".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the next}} major at the 1990 U.S. Open at Medinah Country Club, Faldo {{finished}} tied for 3rd place. In his final round of 69 he three-putted from 45 feet on the 16th hole for a bogey and missed a 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th, which lipped out of the hole. This resulted in him missing out by one stroke on an 18-hole playoff with Hale Irwin and Mike Donald. Faldo refused {{to come to the}} press tent after his final round and later, en route to the locker room, snapped at a journalist who suggested that he had hit his putt too hard on the final green. Faldo said: [...] "I hit it perfect. I hit a foot past the hole. How can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> hit it too hard?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, New York's Brooklyn Public Library also {{banned the}} book due to [...] "bad word choice" [...] and Huck's having [...] "not only itched but scratched" [...] within the novel, which was {{considered}} obscene. When {{asked by a}} Brooklyn librarian about the situation, Twain sardonically replied: I am greatly troubled by what <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> wrote 'Tom Sawyer' & 'Huck Finn' for adults exclusively, & it always distressed me when I find that boys and girls have been allowed access to them. The mind that becomes soiled in youth can never again be washed clean. I know this by my own experience, & to this day I cherish an unappeased bitterness against the unfaithful guardians of my young life, who not only permitted but compelled me to read an unexpurgated Bible through before I was 15 years old. None can do that and ever draw a clean sweet breath again {{on this side of}} the grave.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2016, Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner {{met with}} Russian {{attorney}} Natalia Veselnitskaya, who {{was accompanied by}} some others, including Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, after Trump Jr. was informed that Veselnitskaya could supply the Trump campaign with incriminating information about Hillary Clinton such as her dealings with the Russians. The meeting was arranged following an email from British music publicist Rob Goldstone who was the manager of Emin Agalarov, son of Russian tycoon Aras Agalarov. In the email, Goldstone said that the information {{had come from the}} Russian government and [...] "was part of a Russian government effort to help Donald Trump's presidential campaign". [...] Trump Jr. replied with an e-mail saying [...] "If it's what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> love it especially later in the summer” and arranged the meeting. Trump Jr. went to the meeting expecting to receive information harmful to the Clinton campaign, but he said that none was forthcoming, and instead the conversation then turned to the Magnitsky Act and the adoption of Russian children.|$|E
2500|$|While {{her father}} is her main songwriter, Miley has written {{a few of her}} own songs. In [...] "She's a Supersneak," [...] Miley writes the song [...] "I Miss You" [...] about her mother after {{learning}} {{her father is}} dating another woman. (In real life, the song was written by Miley Cyrus for her grandfather Ron Cyrus.) In Hannah Montana: The Movie, Stewart writes [...] "Butterfly Fly Away" [...] and [...] "The Climb". Stewart wrote [...] "Butterfly Fly Away" [...] after an argument with Travis (Till) and her dad breaking off his relationship for her. In the story, [...] "The Climb" [...] began {{when she was in the}} hen house writing. Travis (Till) told her that the song didn't represent who she is or how she feels. Later in a concert, she performs it live revealing the entire song with its new lyrics. Then, in the episode [...] "He Could Be the One" [...] Miley wrote a song called [...] "I'm Just Having Fun". While practicing with her band, Miley decided the song needed lyrical innovation and revamping. Then, when she was mad at her father; Miley altered the lyrics to a [...] "I don't care what <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> don't care what you say, just 'cause your my daddy doesn't mean you get it your way". She decided to give up on the song, but later with her guitar player she finally made it into [...] "He Could Be the One", inspired by Jake (Cody Linley) and Jesse (her guitar player). In the 4th season, Miley writes a bunch of new songs that are heard and played throughout the season. She made a song with Iyaz called [...] "Gonna Get This".|$|E
