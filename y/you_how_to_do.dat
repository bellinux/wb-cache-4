500|$|... "Get Me Bodied" [...] {{was one of}} {{the music}} videos shot during the two-week filming for B'Day Anthology Video Album. It was {{conceptualized}} by Beyoncé and co-directed by Anthony Mandler. The version of the song used in the clip is the extended mix, which is featured on the deluxe edition of B'Day. The video was shot over two days and choreographed by Rhapsody, Todd Sams, Clifford McGhee and Bethany Strong. For the shoot, Beyoncé asked former Destiny's Child band-mates Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, and sister Solange to appear with her in the video. She said that it [...] "sets the tone of the video". Beyoncé's mother and stylist, Tina created over 60 outfits for Beyoncé and the 50 extras featured in the video. The instructional dance-oriented video was inspired by the 1960s choreographies. Beyoncé cited influences from the Broadway director-choreographer Bob Fosse, Southern and Jamaican movement and the Frug from the musical Sweet Charity; Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine further noted that the video was inspired by the scene [...] "Rich Man's Frug" [...] from the movie. She said: [...] "It tells <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> all the dances — it's modern, it's retro, it's vintage, it's stylized, it's all of those things put together." [...] The story moves from a tony party reminiscent of the jet set style of the sixties, followed with dance sequences. The video was released to US iTunes Store as a Video Triple on September 4, 2007. A re-edit of the video was produced for the Timbaland remix featuring Voltio. Although Voltio does not actually appear in the video, unused footages of the original video were replaced during the parts he sings. The re-edited video was posted on the MTV Overdrive on July 26, 2007. It was included on the DVD for Irreemplazable (2007).|$|E
