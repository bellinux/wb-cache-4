2500|$|There were 33 {{letters in}} Jaᶇalif; nine were for vowels. The {{apostrophe}} {{was used for}} the glottal stop (həmzə/hämzä) and was sometimes sorted as a letter. Other characters were also in use for foreign names. The small letter B looks like ʙ (to prevent confusion with Ь ь), and the capital letter <b>Y</b> <b>looks</b> like У. The letter Ꞑ ᶇ [...] ( [...] ) looks like N n/ŋ [...] which has a descender as in Cyrillic letters Щ, Җ, Ң. The letter no. 33 (similar to Zhuang Ƅ) isn't represented in Unicode, but it looks exactly like Cyrillic soft sign (Ь). Capital Ə also looks like Russian Э in some fonts.|$|R

40|$|Consider a self-similar space X. A typical {{situation}} is that X looks like several copies of itself glued to several copies of another space <b>Y,</b> and <b>Y</b> <b>looks</b> like several copies of itself glued to several copies of X, or {{the same kind of}} thing with more than two spaces. Thus, the self-similarity of X is described by a system of simultaneous equations. Here I formalize this idea and the notion of a `universal solution' of such a system. I determine exactly when a system has a universal solution and, when one does exist, construct it. A sequel (math. DS/ 0411345) contains further results and examples, and an introductory article (math. DS/ 0411343) gives an overview. Comment: 49 page...|$|R
