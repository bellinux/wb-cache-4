Admiral Harrington was there at the time. It need not surprise you, for he is not as old as he looks. That little boat was interesting in every way. The size of it. The boat was one [consults Admiral], he said ten feet long. The breadth of that boat [consults Admiral], two hundred feet. You see, the first and most important detail is the length, then the breadth, and then the depth; the depth of that boat was [consults again]--the Admiral says it was a flat boat. Then her tonnage--you know nothing about a boat until you know two more things: her speed and her tonnage. We know the speed she made. She made four miles---and sometimes five miles. It was on her initial trip, on, August 11, 1807, that she made her initial trip, when she went from [consults Admiral] Jersey City--to Chicago. That's right. She went by way of Albany. Now comes the tonnage of that boat. Tonnage of a boat means the amount of displacement; displacement means the amount of water a vessel can shove in a day. The tonnage of man is estimated by the amount of whiskey he can displace in a day.|$|E

To my {{unaffected}} annoyance, the blood-spitting has started again. I find the heat of a steamer decidedly wearing and trying in these latitudes, and I am inclined to think the superior expedition rather dearly paid for. Still, the fact that one does not even remark the coming of a squall, nor feel relief on its departure, is a mercy not to be acknowledged without gratitude. [...] The rest of the family seem to be doing fairly well; both seem less run down than they were on the EQUATOR, and Mrs. Stevenson very much less so. We have now been three months away, have visited about thirty-five islands, many of which were novel to us, and some extremely entertaining; some also were old acquaintances, and pleasant to revisit. In the meantime, we have really a capital time aboard ship, in the most pleasant and interesting society, and with (considering the length and nature of the voyage) an excellent table. Please remember us all to Mr. Scribner, the young chieftain of the house, and the lady, whose health I trust is better. To Mrs. Burlingame we all desire to be remembered, and I hope you will give our news to Low, St. Gaudens, Faxon, and others of the faithful in the city. I shall probably return to Samoa direct, having given up all idea of returning to civilisation in the meanwhile. There, on my ancestral acres, which I purchased six months ago from a blind Scots blacksmith, you will please address me until further notice. The name of the ancestral acres is going to be Vailima; but as at the present moment nobody else knows the name, except myself and the co-patentees, it will be safer, if less ambitious, to address R. L. S., Apia, Samoa. The ancestral acres run to upwards of three hundred; they enjoy the ministrations of five streams, whence the name. They are all at the present moment under a trackless covering of magnificent forest, which would be worth a great deal if it grew beside a railway terminus. To me, as it stands, it represents a handsome deficit. Obliging natives from the Cannibal Islands are now cutting it down at my expense. You would be able to run your magazine to much greater advantage if the terms of authors were on the same scale with those of my cannibals.

40|$|If you {{are new to}} sociology, {{and trying}} to get your head around exactly what it entails, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not realise that you have {{encountered}} it many times already. Sociological analyses feature regularly in media commentary and public debate, and concepts such as globalisation, economic rationalism, socialisation, class, social status, deviance, alienation, and lifestyle all have sociological origins. As US sociologist Robert Merton noted some time ago, ‘ours has become an age pervaded by sociology’, and sociological concepts have ‘drifted into our everyday language’ (1981, p. 42). This familiarity with the subject-matter of sociology’we are all members of society, and thus by definition should be automatic experts on the topic’can too often lead to the dismissal of the sociological enterprise as mere common sense. As you will soon find out, it is not that simple. Sociology involves a methodical study of human behaviours and societies (Macionis & Plummer 2008). It is the study {{of the relationship between the}} individual and society, investigating how human thought, action, and interaction shape and are shaped by society’or how ‘we create society at the same time as we are created by it’ (Giddens 1986, p. 11). The ‘sociological gaze’ exposes the link between individual experience and the social context in which we live, work, and play. Many authors have offered definitions that attempt to capture the essence of the sociological enterprise. Some of the main definitions of sociology can be found in Sociology Spotlight 1. 1. 3 r...|$|E

40|$|A simple question: Do {{you know}} how you manage to speak your native {{language}} without making grammatical errors despite the fact that <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not know how to describe the grammatical rules you use? Sometimes such simple questions do not have simple answers. The amazing capacity to effectively communicate complex information and thoughts through the medium of language {{is the result of the}} way language, and more specifically, linguistic rules are learned: in an implicit manner. Learning is implicit when we acquire new information without intending to do so and without awareness that knowledge is acquired (Forkstam & Petersson, 2005). In this thesis, an implicit artificial grammar learning (AGL) paradigm (Stadler & Frensch, 1998) was investigated from two perspectives: as a model probing the acquisition of structural, or syntactic, aspects of natural language (Petersson, 2005; Petersson, Forkstam, & Ingvar, 2004) and as a model for implicit learning. Reber, in his seminal work on AGL (1967), proposed that successful task-performance of participants is due to their ability to learn new grammatical rules implicitly. This ability, he claimed, is comparable to the way humans acquire the syntax-rules of their native language without systematic explicit guidance or awareness of what is learned. The AGL paradigm used here is unique in combining implicit acquisition with core characteristics of the actual conditions for syntax learning: implicit learning from grammatical examples without performance feedback. Three studies employed the above paradigm in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate structured sequence processing, while one study investigated a well-characterized natural language paradigm to investigate syntactic and semantic processing and their interaction. Consequently Reber’s statement (1967) concerning the comparability of the processes involved in artificial and natural language syntax could be investigated at the neurobiological level...|$|E
40|$|The use of Beam Loss Monitors (BLMs) as {{sensitive}} {{tools for}} various beam diagnostic applications {{will be discussed}} {{as well as their}} tasks in machine protection and loss location detection. Examples will illustrate that an appropriate design of a BLM-system and a proper understanding of loss events can improve machine performance. 1 INTROCUCTION You do not need a BLM-System {{as long as you have}} a perfect machine without any problems. However, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not have such a nice machine, therefore you better install one. Beam loss monitor systems are designed for measuring beam losses around an accelerator or storage ring. A detailed understanding of the loss mechanism, together with an appropriate design of the BLM-System and an appropriate location of the monitors enable a wide field of very useful beam diagnostics and machine protection possibilities. Beam losses can be divided into two different classes: 1) Irregular losses, sometimes called fast or uncontrolled losses: These losses may be distributed around the accelerator and not obviously on a collimation system. They are very often a result of a misaligned beam or a fault condition, e. g. operation failure, trip of the HF-system or of a magnet power supply. Losses should be avoided and should be kept to low levels • to keep activation low enough for hands-on maintenance, personal safety and environmental protection, • to protect machine parts from beam related (radiation) damage. This includes quench protection of superconducting magnets and acceleration structures and protection of detector components, • to achieve long beam lifetimes or an efficient beam transport to get high integrated luminosity for the related experiments. Sometimes such losses have to be tolerated even at a high level at low repetition rates during machine studies. However, a beam loss monitor system should define the allowed level of those losses. The better protection there is against these losses, the less likely is down time due to damage of components. A post mortem event analysis is most helpful to understand and analyse the faulty condition. Some examples of such a functionality of beam loss monitor systems will be given in this paper. 2) Regular losses, sometimes called slow o...|$|E
40|$|Rates of {{unplanned}} {{feeding tube}} removal {{have been reported}} at between 58 %- 100 % 1. Removal of tubes can cause distress to patients, relatives and to the staff who repeatedly replace tubes 2. It affects nursing time, increases cost, {{increases the risk of}} aspiration 3 and can contribute to poor nutritional status. Two methods used in the UK {{to reduce the risk of}} unplanned tube removal are mittens and nasal bridles or loops. 16 registered dietitians were interviewed as part of a qualitative phenomenological study exploring their experiences of decision-making related to artificial feeding. Convenience sampling enabled participants’ with a range of clinical experience and from a range of clinical settings to be recruited. Participants were asked about their views and experiences of the use of nasal bridles and mittens. Interviews were fully transcribed and analysed within an interpretive phenomenological framework 4. Nine out of the sixteen participants had direct experience of bridles and eleven had direct experience of mittens. Identified themes were: ‘are they telling us no tube?’; ‘removes patient choice’; ‘balancing benefits and harms’; and ‘pick your patients’. Many participants believed that patients might pull tubes because they were trying to tell the team that they didn’t want to be fed: ‘Maybe they don’t want to be fed [...] . and in a way you would be force feeding them’ P 1. Many felt uneasy using bridles or mittens as they would remove a patient’s choice to remove a tube: ‘ [...] . it takes away that [...] . freedom [...] . of getting it [the tube] out. ’ P 7. When balancing benefits and harms, the participants talked of reduced quality of life, trauma of tubes being repassed, gaining full nutrition and dignity. The participants were only comfortable with their use when the right patients were selected: ‘I think if they are used in the right patient group <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> have more success. ’ P 16. Balancing harm with benefits is important in ethical decision-making; all dietitians discussed this balance. One of these benefits was reducing the frequency of tube replacement which was believed to be traumatic for patients. The feeling that tube pulling may be patients trying to tell the team they didn’t want to be fed was common, however some did admit that when patients were confused this was just speculation. Removing choice was a concern for many, even though it was acknowledged that patients often lacked capacity. Many dietitians were uneasy about the use of bridles or mittens because of these concerns. Some participants believed that bridles and mittens were effective if patients were selected appropriately, for example, when patients could consent or when PEG insertion was avoided. In these situations many felt more at ease with their use. Dietitians views of use of bridles and mittens have not be reported before, but ambivalence to the use of restraints has been noted in nurses 5. Many dietitians are uneasy about bridle and mitten use. Greater team discussion about patient selection and what dietitians feel about the use of bridles or mittens may help reduce some dietitians’ unease...|$|E

In writing this chapter, we are reflecting on things we wished we had known (or were really glad we did know) at the beginning of our time in graduate school. Some of the information presented here will be covered in more detail in subsequent chap-ters, but we will present some tips for successful integration into a graduate program and some pitfalls to avoid.

Boice (2000) has conducted landmark work on identifying new faculty who are “quick starters; ” that is, new faculty who adapt more readily than others and are more efficient at carrying out faculty responsibilities. In a similar vein, new graduate students must figure out what the expectations of their programs are and how best to meet these expectations.
