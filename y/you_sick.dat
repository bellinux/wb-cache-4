2500|$|The chief Biblical text {{concerning}} the rite is : [...] "Is any among <b>you</b> <b>sick?</b> Let him {{call for the}} elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil {{in the name of}} the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven."

2500|$|Kricfalusi {{originally}} voiced Ren in {{a manner}} that he describes as [...] "a bad imitation of Peter Lorre." [...] Billy West said that he auditioned to play Ren; the creators of the series believed that having West—who was also voicing the title character in fellow charter Nicktoon Doug at the time—voice both Ren and Stimpy would give him too large of a workload. West voiced Ren after Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi; Kricfalusi would return for the Spike TV episodes and unaired episodes of The Ren & Stimpy Show. Chris Edgerly would voice the character in the game Nicktoons MLB though. In the pilot episode, Pierre Decelles provided Ren's signature diabolical laughter, while West performed Ren's laugh in the series. His catchphrase is [...] "You eediot", and he also uses variations of [...] "What is your problem, <b>you</b> <b>sick</b> little monkey?", which is similar to a quote by Lorre in The Maltese Falcon: [...] "You... you imbecile. You bloated idiot. You stupid fat-head, you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early polling showed Lieberman {{with as much}} as a 46-point lead, but {{subsequent}} {{polls showed}} Lamont gaining until Lamont took the lead just weeks before the primary. A controversy about a [...] "kiss" [...] Lieberman supposedly received from President Bush during the 2005 State of the Union address highlighted concerns that the senator was too close to the unpopular president to be a credible Democratic nominee. Lieberman released several campaign advertisements over the summer of 2006, seeking to connect himself to former President Bill Clinton and to portray Lamont as standing for little more than opposition to Lieberman. Lamont struck back against some of Lieberman's more negative ads with an advertisement produced by well-known political consultant Bill Hillsman. In Lamont's ad, a foreboding narrator says, [...] "Meet Ned Lamont. He can't make a decent cup of coffee, he's a bad karaoke singer, and he has a messy desk." [...] Lamont then chimes in, [...] "Aren't <b>you</b> <b>sick</b> of political attack ads that insult your intelligence? Senator Lieberman, let's stick to issues and pledge to support whoever wins the Democratic primary." ...|$|E
