5|$|In Britain the {{campaign}} emphasised the important lesson previously {{demonstrated in the}} Trafalgar campaign of the <b>year</b> <b>before,</b> <b>that</b> it was immensely difficult in {{the vastness of the}} Atlantic Ocean to detect and intercept French squadrons at sea: only off their own harbours and in the confined waters of the Caribbean were they vulnerable to detection and attack by British squadrons. The inadequate size and power of convoy escorts and the expense in resources employed in chasing French squadrons at sea meant that British trade was placed at risk by the depredations of independent French squadrons, and the maintenance of a tight blockade was essential. The British grip on French maritime travel was a constant source of irritation to Napoleon, who instigated a massive shipbuilding program with the intention of breaking the blockade: by 1808 he was able to muster over 80 ships of the line against the British blockade squadrons.|$|E

The cause of Allmenröder's death is debatable, but he {{died from a}} crash near Zillebeke. German infantry soldiers retrieved his body from no man's land the night he was killed. It was a ghoulish detail; the crashed Albatros was so embedded in a hasty cemetery of casualties from the <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>that</b> it took two hours to disinter Allmenröder from the decomposing bodies around him.|$|E

He was {{a key factor in}} his side's first-ever accession to the Champions League final; during their run Arsenal broke the record for the most consecutive clean sheets in the Champions League with ten, breaking the record of seven that Milan had set just one <b>year</b> <b>before.</b> <b>That</b> run formed the bulk of an 853-minute spell without conceding a goal, overtaking the CL record for an individual goalkeeper set by Edwin van der Sar.|$|E
25|$|Kessel, however, was sidelined for {{the first}} month of the season with a {{shoulder}} injury incurred the <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>that</b> required surgery. Finally, on November 3, 2009, Kessel made his much-anticipated debut as a Leaf against the Tampa Bay Lightning. He had a total of ten shots on goal in the game, a career-high, though he did not record any assists or goals. Despite not recording any points and his team falling 2–1 to the Lightning in overtime, Kessel was named the third star of the game. He later scored his first goal as a Maple Leaf just four days later in a 5–1 win over the Detroit Red Wings at the Air Canada Centre.|$|E
25|$|In {{a rematch}} of the thrilling 2006 second-round series, the Pistons and Cavaliers matched up in {{perhaps one of}} the most closely contested series in NBA history, with the first five games being decided by six points or less. The {{spotlight}} fell on LeBron James. Despite gaining some momentum in the opening games of the series against the experienced Pistons, key last-second decisions by James led to Cleveland losses in Games 1 and 2 in Detroit, by identical scores, in which Cleveland led for most of the two games. They faced a 0–2 deficit for the second straight year, but would easily remember from the <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>that</b> they could win three straight games to get back into the series.|$|E

25|$|The {{dissolution}} of the AAFC left 13 professional football teams in the U.S., a significant reduction from the 17 in existence the <b>year</b> <b>before.</b> <b>That</b> resulted in a large pool of players without teams. As part of the AAFC and NFL owners' peace deal, the Browns and the AAFC's Buffalo Bills reached an agreement under which the Browns would get the rights to guard Abe Gibron, defensive tackle John Kissell and halfback Rex Bumgardner. In exchange, Bills owner James Breuil got an ownership stake in the Browns. Similar deals were made between former AAFC owners and NFL teams in Los Angeles and New York City. The players left over after those deals were entered into a special draft from which the Browns selected defensive end Len Ford from the Los Angeles Dons and linebacker Hal Herring from the Bills. Gibron {{went on to a}} 10-year pro career, Kissell was a starter for the Browns for six seasons, and Herring played for three years. Ford, a tall and hard-hitting pass-rusher, became one of the top defensive ends of his era. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1976.|$|E

[...] However, records for the two teams are kept separately.

He said after the race that his main target was still the Ardennes classics rather than the remainder of the cobbled classics season, but that there was no reason why he could not succeed in both. He pointed out that he was glad to have escaped with Sagan as they worked well together – they had arrived at the finish of the 2014 Strade Bianche in a similar situation, with Kwiatkowski the winner there as well. He said that he thought he had surprised Sagan by sprinting first, rather than waiting for Sagan's sprint. He also acknowledged that he knew from his own experience a <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>that</b> it was [...] "very difficult" [...] to race with the pressure of the world champion's rainbow jersey.|$|E

On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered to Allied forces, officially ending World WarII, and in September 1945, Qingdao was liberated by forces of the Kuomintang, restoring {{the government of the}} Republic of China. The following year, on February 18, 1946, Bishop Tien was elevated to Cardinal, becoming the first Chinese Cardinal and to date the only SVD Cardinal. He traveled to Vatican City to accept the honor. His Vicariate Apostolic was elevated to the Diocese of Qingdao on April 11. Upon his return on May 27, he was greeted by representatives of the government of Shandong Province, who had arranged a welcome in his honor, with the United States Marine Band playing outside the main entrance of the cathedral. The Marine Band was attached to Naval Forces Western Pacific, headquartered in Qingdao at the time.

Determined to stop Schofield from uniting with Thomas' main force at Nashville, Hood resolved to attack him head-on at Franklin, even though the Federals were now behind formidable fortifications (built for a previous battle fought there the <b>year</b> <b>before)</b> <b>that</b> included breastworks six to eight feet high fronted by four-foot wide ditches, and thorny obstructions using branches from Osage Orange trees in the area.

Mon David has also made the rounds of the Las Vegas music circuit. Among the female performers, Mishka Adams has been the most prominent. A recent development is the fusion of spoken-word and jazz and also with rock, chiefly attributed to Radioactive Sago Project. Other notable names of late are Bob Aves with his ethno-infused jazz, The Jazz Volunteers and Akasha which have anchored the now legendary underground jazz jams at Freedom Bar for almost half of the 11 years of its existence. Today, underground jazz jams are now held in a bar called TAGO jazz bar which is located at Main Avenue, Cubao. Newer jazz groups emerged in the local jazz scene namely Swingster Syndicate pioneering in the post-bop and modern trad jazz, and Camerata Jazz known for their Filipino jazz arrangements and sound.|$|E
