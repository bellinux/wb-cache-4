6000|$|... "He had {{twenty years}} to brood about the vein at home," [...] Agatha replied. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> he studied {{all the books}} on mining he could get?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are shrewd," [...] she answered, smiling. [...] "He {{has some}} {{confidence}} in my judgment. I spent the years {{that should have been}} happiest in poverty and loneliness. Are <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> I'm a conspirator? If you value your safety, you will beware of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know {{a little}} German and Italian, though I can't lay claim to Czech," [...] she {{answered}} gayly. [...] "Why are <b>you</b> so <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> I should possess such modest accomplishments?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> at <b>that,</b> lady?" [...] demanded Eveline in her turn; [...] "or are you {{disappointed}} {{that you find}} me not a corpse, {{within the limits of}} the chamber which your hospitality and affection allotted to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{know our}} {{governor}}, Mr. Harthouse,' said Tom, 'and therefore, <b>you</b> needn't be <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> Loo married old Bounderby. She {{never had a}} lover, and the governor proposed old Bounderby, and she took him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see how a}} {{man could}} help makin' {{mistakes}} with that school-teacher's umbrella whanging away at his knowledge box, but I wasn't goin' to let on. 'She ain't no Jew, nuther,' says I, 'and she's your daughter, too; you needn't try to play no tricks on me. Pay me my money and take her away as quick as you can, that's my advice, or {{before you know it}} you'll be nabbed.'--'Pay ye!' he yelled; 'do you think I'd pay you anything for that little Jew?'--'She's just as much a Christian as you are,' says I. 'Ain't you a Christian, little gal? and is'nt this gentleman your father? and ain't <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> he wants to give you back to be put in the bag?' I said this hopin' she'd have sense enough to say he was her father so's to get rid of me.|$|E
6000|$|This epistle was not {{the letter}} of Lord Hillsborough solely, though he held the {{official}} pen. It was {{the letter of the}} noble lord upon the floor,[5] and of all the king's then ministers, who (with, I think, the exception of two only) are his ministers at this hour. The very first news that a British Parliament heard of what it was to do with the duties which it had given and granted to the king was by the publication of the votes of American assemblies. It was in America that your resolutions were pre-declared. It was from thence that we knew to a certainty how much exactly, and not a scruple more nor less, we were to repeal. We were unworthy to be let into the secret of our own conduct. The assemblies had confidential communications from his Majesty's confidential servants. We were nothing but instruments. Do you, after this, wonder that you have no weight and no respect in the colonies? After this are <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> Parliament is every day and everywhere losing (I feel it with sorrow, I utter it with reluctance) that reverential affection which so endearing a name of authority ought ever to carry with it? that you are obeyed solely from respect to the bayonet? and that this House, the ground and pillar of freedom, is itself held up only by the treacherous underpinning and clumsy buttresses of arbitrary power? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Teresa, my well-beloved friend,--I have {{considered}} the anxieties that trouble you, with this result: that I can do my best, conscientiously, to quiet your mind. I have {{had the experience of}} forty years in the duties of the priesthood. In that long time, the innermost secrets of thousands of men and women have been confided to me. From such means of observation, I have drawn many useful conclusions; and some of them may be also useful to you. I will put what I have to say, in the plainest and fewest words: consider them carefully, on your side. The growth of the better nature, in women, is perfected by one influence--and that influence is Love. Are <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> a priest should write in this way? Did you expect me to say, Religion? Love, my sister, is Religion, in women. It opens their hearts to all that is good for them; and it acts independently of the conditions of human happiness. A miserable woman, tormented by hopeless love, is still the better and the nobler for that love; and a time will surely come when she will show it. You have fears for Carmina--cast away, poor soul, among strangers with hard hearts! I tell you to have no fears. She may suffer under trials; she may sink under trials. But the strength to rise again is in her--and that strength is Love.' ...|$|E
60|$|MANGAN [taken aback]. Should <b>you?</b> <b>That</b> <b>surprises</b> me; for I thought I {{noticed this}} {{afternoon}} that you avoided me all you could. Not {{for the first}} time either.|$|R
6000|$|CHARLES. Why, there's the point! my distresses are so many, that I can't affort to {{part with}} my spirits; but I shall be rich and splenetic, all in good time. However, I suppose <b>you</b> are <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> I am not more sorrowful at parting with so many near relations; to be sure, 'tis very affecting; but you see they never move a muscle, so why should I? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>You</b> are <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> I {{should be}} {{interested}} in humanity." [...] She stood facing him. [...] "Well, I am," [...] she said, half humorously, half defiantly. [...] "I believe I am more interested in human beings than in {{anything else in the}} world--when they are natural, as these people are and when they will tell one their joys and their troubles and their opinions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did it then <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> a seaman out of {{employment}} should examine a vessel that he finds to his mind, perhaps with an intention {{to ask for}} service?" ...|$|R
60|$|It's {{very natural}} {{that he should}} be in love with <b>you.</b> I'm always <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> {{everybody}} else isn't. I don't see how I can prevent that except by taking you to live {{in the depths of the}} Sahara.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. He is {{out with}} the farm bailiff. You have taken us all by <b>surprise.</b> <b>You</b> wrote <b>that</b> we were to expect you by the next train." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} <b>surprised</b> <b>you</b> when <b>that</b> 'ere glass was broken in; but I noticed it didn't take a great {{while to get}} your wits about you." ...|$|R
60|$|As a {{footnote}} <b>you</b> may be <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> {{one of the}} children is called Junkie. This certainly does not mean that same as it does today: instead it is a nickname given to a favourite boy-child, and you will find several examples of this in Ballantyne's books.|$|R
6000|$|... "The trees be damned!" [...] snorted the lawyer. [...] "The tree had {{two legs}} on that evening. What our friend the poet," [...] he added, with a sneer, [...] "would call a walking tree. Apropos of our friend the poet, <b>you</b> seemed <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> night to find {{he was not}} walking poetically by the sea all the time, and I fear I {{affected}} to share your ignorance. I was not so sure then as I am now." ...|$|R
2500|$|Just as Kullback–Leibler {{divergence}} of [...] "actual from ambient" [...] measures thermodynamic availability, Kullback–Leibler divergence of [...] "reality from a model" [...] is {{also useful}} {{even if the}} only clues we have about reality are some experimental measurements. In the former case Kullback–Leibler divergence describes distance to equilibrium or (when multiplied by ambient temperature) the amount of available work, while {{in the latter case}} it tells <b>you</b> about <b>surprises</b> <b>that</b> reality has up its sleeve or, in other words, how much the model has yet to learn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, look here! I {{am going}} to tell you {{something}} <b>that</b> will rather <b>surprise</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>that</b> perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twas vulgarly {{given out}} that the contest was between Deists and [...] Christians, and when the news of my success came to the playhouse, [...] the whisper rose that the Christians were defeated. Are <b>you</b> not [...] <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> we could keep our popularity, {{notwithstanding}} this [...] imputation, which my friends could not deny to be well founded?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do," [...] he rejoined. [...] "The workhouse first, perhaps--and {{then the}} madhouse. What {{is there to}} <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> in <b>that?</b> You {{yourself}} told her to her face she was mad. Good Heavens! how pale you are! What is the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I {{should have}} failed (having an actress for my dearest friend) {{to use the}} means of {{introduction}} thus offered to me to try the stage--especially as my childish training had given me, in some small degree, a familiarity with the Art.|$|R
6000|$|... "Probably <b>you</b> are <b>surprised,</b> ladies, <b>that</b> I, a stranger, have {{remained}} so long to-night. The truth is, I {{had come here}} to have some conversation on private and very important matters, but finding you so lively, and, I must add, so pleasantly engaged, I deemed it expedient to defer my conversation until you should be more at leisure." ...|$|R
2500|$|Guillaume-Schack {{expressed}} {{this view}} {{when she opened}} a public talk in 1882 by saying, [...] "perhaps it will have <b>surprised</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> a matter so difficult to handle as the morality question should be discussed in public, and perhaps yet more that I, a woman, want to speak about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rose, <b>you</b> <b>surprise</b> me! All <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have read, and {{all that}} you have heard, must have shown you the difference. Do they not say `a man is {{floating}} with the tide,' when things are prosperous with him--and don't ships drop down with the tide, and beat the wind with the tide? And don't vessels sometimes `tide it up to town,' as it is called, {{and is n't it}} thought an advantage to have the tide with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, Joseph," [...] said he to the urchin, who gazed gravely in {{his face}} with a pair of very large and dark eyes, [...] "ponies is often skittish. Reason why one should be, an' another not, I can't comprehend. P'r'aps it's nat'ral, p'r'aps not, but howsomediver so 'tis; an' if it's more nor above the likes o' me, Joseph, <b>you</b> needn't be <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> it's somethink haltogether beyond you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who, indeed! Some {{young man}} the Marquess has picked up, and who comes lecturing here about poodles and parrots, and {{thinking}} himself quite Lord Paramount, I can assure <b>you.</b> I am <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> the Marchioness, {{who is a}} most sensible woman, can patronise such conduct a moment; but whenever she begins to see through him the young gentleman has always got {{a story about a}} bracelet, or a bandeau, and quite turns her head." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> will be <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> I {{was willing}} to do so much magazine-writing--a thing I have always been chary about--but I had good reasons. Our {{expenses}} have been so prodigious {{for a year and a}} half, and are still so prodigious, that Livy was worrying altogether too much about them, and doing a very dangerous amount of lying awake on their account. It was necessary to stop that, and it is now stopped.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must stop}} here for to-day. To-morrow I shall come to {{disclosures}} of vital interest to you. Have <b>you</b> been <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> I, your enemy by every cause of enmity {{that one man}} can have against another, should write to you so fully about the secrets of my early life? I have done so, because I wish the strife between us to be an open strife on my side; because I desire that you should know thoroughly {{what you have to}} expect from my character, after such a life as I have led. There was purpose in my deceit, when I deceived you--there is purpose in my frankness, when I now tell you all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{unless they}} be so uttered as {{to force a}} belief. I do love you. I know no other reason but that why you should be my wife. I have no other excuse to offer for coming to you again. You are the one {{thing in the world}} that to me has any charm. Can <b>you</b> be <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> I should be {{persistent}} in asking for it?" [...] He was looking at her still with the same gaze, and {{there seemed to be a}} power in his eye from which she could not escape. He was still standing with his right hand out, as though expecting, or at least hoping, that her hand might be put into his.|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! Just {{like you}} young fellows. In {{some things you}} have no more brains than geese. Being made of {{cast-iron}} and shoe-leather you assume that everybody else is, or ought to be, made of the same raw material. Don't <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>surprises</b> of this sort are apt to kill delicate people?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you have}} been an English spy," [...] was the quiet reply. [...] "It may <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I know that, but I do know. I have been a spy for Prince Shan in Paris. You were a spy for England in Berlin. You were a spy for your country's sake; I was a spy for love. Now I betray for hate." ...|$|R
60|$|Remembering {{what you}} do of Sunderland, <b>you</b> will be <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> our profit there was very considerable. I read in a {{beautiful}} new theatre, and (I thought to myself) quite wonderfully. Such an audience I never beheld for rapidity and enthusiasm. The room in which we acted (converted into a theatre afterwards) was burnt to the ground {{a year or two}} ago. We found the hotel, so bad in our time, really good. I walked from Durham to Sunderland, and from Sunderland to Newcastle.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hetta;--that's {{short for}} something. But it's very pretty. I have no brother, no sister. And I'll tell you, though {{you must not}} tell anybody again;--I have no real mother. Madame Melmotte is not my mamma, though papa chooses {{that it should be}} thought so.' All this she whispered, with rapid words, almost into Hetta's ear. 'And papa is so cruel to me! He beats me sometimes.' The new friend, round whom Marie still had her arm, shuddered as she heard this. 'But I never will yield a bit for that. When he boxes and thumps me I always turn and gnash my teeth at him. Can you wonder that I want to have a friend? Can <b>you</b> be <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> I should be always {{thinking}} of my lover? But,--if he doesn't love me, what am I to do then?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I tell you, Mark, and I {{would tell}} your namesake the apostle, {{that you are}} hard on me. You have practised sobriety and {{hypocrisy}} from your hanging sleeves till your Geneva cassock--from the cradle to this day,--and it {{is a thing of}} nature to you; and <b>you</b> are <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> a rough, rattling, honest fellow, accustomed to speak truth all his life, and especially when he found it {{at the bottom of a}} flask, cannot be so perfect a prig as thyself--Zooks! there is no equality betwixt us--A trained diver might as well, because he can retain his breath for ten minutes without inconvenience, upbraid a poor devil for being like to burst in twenty seconds, at the bottom of ten fathoms water--And, after all, considering the guise is so new to me, I think I bear myself indifferently well--try me!" ...|$|R
