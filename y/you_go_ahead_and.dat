500|$|After {{completing}} the album, Sony hired Bojan Bazelli {{to direct the}} song's music video. After filming the video's first version, record label executives felt the result was sub-par {{in comparison to the}} quality of the music. They scrapped the first video and re-filmed it with director Andy Morahan, changing the plot, scenery and imagery. After word got out of the two videos, a Sony employee spoke to the press about Carey, saying how [...] "the special treatment really upset" [...] him. He felt they treated Carey differently from how they would another artist signed to the label, and that they viewed her as a higher priority. He also claimed that Carey was the reason they re-filmed, [...] "they spend $200,000 on a video and Mariah doesn't like it. No big deal." [...] Another employee estimated the figure of both videos at over $450,000. After the reports were made, Don Ienner, the president of Sony, refuted the claims, calling them [...] "total bullshit" [...] although admitting, [...] "If we're going to take the time and effort that we did with Mariah, on every level, then we're going to image her the right way. If it costs a few extra dollars to make a splash in terms of the right imaging, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Referring to the perception, {{especially}} in the West, that India had previously been lecturing the world about the virtues of nonviolence, President Kennedy told the Indian ambassador to the US, [...] "You spend {{the last fifteen years}} preaching morality to us, and then <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> act the way any normal country would behave… People are saying, the preacher has been caught coming out of the brothel." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 20/20 Experience was {{produced}} in a span of 20 days. Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> get out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E

I had to live them first, and now that I'm living them there's no need to write them.

6000|$|... "Very well, Arthurs, we'll let <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> {{have full}} charge.

You can rest assured from now on {{you will not be}} {{interfered}} with. Give us the best team you can under the circumstances. There has been much dissension among the directors and faculty because of our new eligibility rules. It has stirred everybody up, and the students are sore. Then there has been talk of not having a professional coach this year, but we overruled that in last night's meeting. We're going to see what you can do. I may add, Arthurs, if you shape up a varsity this year that makes any kind of a showing against Place and Herne you will win the eternal gratitude of the directors who have fostered this change in athletics. Otherwise I'm afraid the balance of opinion will favor the idea of dispensing with professional coaches in the future." ...|$|E
