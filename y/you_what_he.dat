Brosnan said; [...] "No, I won't make a hero out of him. He caused a situation. I don't know whose bullet killed who, but {{a friend of mine}} died. But I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>what,</b> <b>he</b> had heroic qualities." [...] Father Brosnan said. [...] "George was a nice fellow, but his wife had left him, taking their thirteen-year-old daughter with her, and he didn't have much of a life.

6000|$|... "Well, if this ain't outragis!" [...] {{cried the}} one-eyed man; [...] "perfectly outragis! Going to murder <b>you,</b> says <b>you!</b> <b>What's</b> <b>he</b> a-goin' {{to do that}} for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> might do," [...] said Mr Cummins, {{brightening}} up. [...] "I'll {{tell you}} how you might save it:--let him exchange." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{first time}} after my return--the Sunday I came to <b>you.</b> <b>What's</b> <b>he</b> doing," [...] Densher went on, [...] "at that {{hour of the}} morning with her? What does his having been with her there mean?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Williams went on. [...] "He's weak, {{too weak}} to talk much, and so I'm going to tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants. He wants you to marry him before he dies." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{a moment}} my lord seemed at a full stop; and then, with some irritation, [...] "I ask <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> died of. Surely that's a plain question," [...] said he.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you think}} you can do better than I did you’d better go down and see him," [...] {{retorted}} the mate hotly. [...] "After all, it’s <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>’e</b> come to see. He’s your visitor." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Sure!" [...] Mr. Bundercombe replied. [...] "I don't {{follow the}} sales now, so I can't tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing; but we've an agent here--and any country that doesn't buy Bundercombe's Reapers {{is off the}} line as regards agriculture!" ...|$|R

6000|$|Fred colored. [...] "You {{wished to}} have the letter, sir. I should think it very likely that Mr. Bulstrode's denial {{is as good as}} the {{authority}} which told <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> denies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] exclaimed Cleve. Joan {{felt the}} leap {{of his body}} under her touch. [...] "Why, if I'd tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> sends that gang to do--you'd--you'd kill him in his sleep." ...|$|E

5000|$|Upon Wepner's {{refusal to}} grant him the favor he sought, Ali started {{shouting}} {{as soon as}} the show's host reappeared on the set: [...] "Do <b>you</b> know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called me?

6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is," [...] said Alice suddenly. [...] "He is {{companion}} and keeper {{to the man}} with whom he lives. Do you recollect his saying 'Mellish is mad'?" ...|$|E
