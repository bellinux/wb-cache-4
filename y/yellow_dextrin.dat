5000|$|Gouache {{paint is}} similar to {{watercolor}} modified to make it opaque. Just as in watercolor, the binding agent has traditionally been gum arabic but since {{the late nineteenth century}} cheaper varieties use <b>yellow</b> <b>dextrin.</b> When the paint is sold as a paste, e.g. in tubes, the dextrin has usually been mixed with an equal volume of water. To improve the adhesive and hygroscopic qualities of the paint, as well as the flexibility of the rather brittle paint layer after drying, often propylene glycol is added. Gouache differs from watercolor in that the particles are typically larger, the ratio of pigment to binder is much higher, and an additional white filler such as chalk, a [...] "body", may be part of the paint. This makes gouache heavier and more opaque, with greater reflective qualities.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work {{is aimed at}} producing dextrins from cassava starch and also to investigate the effects of acid concentration, roasting temperature and time on dextrin produced using 8 run screen experimental design before the preparation of adhesive. It was shown in the result that the best of white dextrin, <b>yellow</b> <b>dextrin</b> and British gum were obtained at concentrations of acid of 0. 3 M, 0. 3 M, and 0. 23 M and at roasting time of 30, 180 and 180 minutes and at roasting temperature of 60 oC, 90 oC and 120 oC respectively. The best of white dextrin which had the highest solubility of 36. 1 per cent was used to formulate the adhesive...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} of a <b>yellow</b> <b>dextrin</b> is thoroughly characterized during {{different stages of}} its production process with a SEC system equipped with four detectors (light scattering, viscosity, UV and RI). With this system, {{also referred to as}} SEC- 4 D, it was shown that the changes in characteristics are only in line with initial expectations up to 5 h after initiation of the reaction. After 5 h, changes in molar mass, intrinsic viscosity and colour point to the presence of significantly different structures. The combined results of the SEC- 4 D measurements indicate the formation of aggregate like structures made of small starch fragments which are intensely coloured and physically linked. The obtained results also indicate that the aggregate like structures are probably still susceptible to repolymerization and transglycosylation. The newly derived parameter YI- 400 nm {{played an important role in}} defining a plausible cause for the observed changes in characteristics. Â© 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

25|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>dextrins</b> {{are used}} as {{water-soluble}} glues in remoistable envelope adhesives and paper tubes, in the mining industry as additives in froth flotation, in the foundry industry as green strength additives in sand casting, as printing thickener for batik resist dyeing, and as binders in gouache paint {{and also in the}} leather industry.|$|R
50|$|Starch {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of various adhesives or glues for book-binding, wallpaper adhesives, paper sack production, tube winding, gummed paper, envelope adhesives, school glues and bottle labeling. Starch derivatives, such as <b>yellow</b> <b>dextrins,</b> can be modified by addition of some chemicals to form a hard glue for paper work; some of those forms use borax or soda ash, which are mixed with the starch solution at 50 - 70 C to create a very good adhesive. Sodium silicate can be added to reinforce these formula.|$|R
