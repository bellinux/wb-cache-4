And then I knew I had him. The next thought in my mind was I'm going to ask for $30,000. You always ask for twice as much as what <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> get. He put me on hold, and within less than a minute he came back and he said 'well, we can't give you thirty, we'll give you ten.' I said 'make if fifteen,' he said 'you have a deal.'" [...] Reporter: [...] "Could you see the {{headlines}} coming? Barresi: [...] "Oh yeah, sure, and I could see that money coming too." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then you can reckon on me; but there's another thing. Why do <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> {{lift the}} wreck when the salvage men could not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Too bad, Dave; {{especially}} when <b>you</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> meet your father by Christmas," [...] said Roger. [...] "But shut the door--it is too cold for comfort out there." ...|$|R

60|$|Oh, Tom, be truthful. <b>You</b> don't <b>hope</b> {{anything}} of the sort. You know <b>you</b> are <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> destroy him.|$|R
60|$|Aben. Traitors, <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> save yourselves in vain!-- Your forfeit lives shall {{for your}} treason pay; And Ozmyn's blood shall be revenged this day.|$|E

5000|$|... "Before <b>you</b> can <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> {{get people}} to live {{anywhere}} ... you must first of all show them {{that they can get}} there quickly, comfortably, and above all, cheaply. Transportation determines the flow of population." ...|$|R
