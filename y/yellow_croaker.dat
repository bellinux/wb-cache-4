40|$|Since the {{establishment}} and enforcement of the <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> stock rebuilding plan in 2007, stock research and evaluation are continuously being conducted on the stock and diverse rebuilding measures are also being considered. The current <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> stock rebuilding plan emphasizes policies to reduce fishing pressure and create resources, but it is relatively indifferent about the management of habitats and spawning grounds, protection of marine environment and reduction of pollution. More active participation by fishers and better understanding between fishers groups are required for the effective enforcement of the rebuilding plan. Education and information campaigns directed at fishers should be reinforced to support the rebuilding plan as these plans must include broader participation by fishers. Summarizing {{the results of the}} rebuilding plan, {{it is clear that the}} decreasing trend of the <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> stock has been reversed and its catch reached 33, 200 tonnes(M/T) in 2008. The increase is believed to be the result of a combination of rebuilding efforts e. g. clean-up of fishing grounds, stricter enforcement of regulations, fewer Chinese fishing vessels operating in the Yellow Sea and favourable changes in the marine ecosystem where the fisheries are taking place. This demonstrates that management measures must be accompanied by favourable environmental factors in order to be successful and that a holistic approach that addresses various threats to the species be examined. Accordingly, the effect of stock rebuilding plans for <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> on other related fisheries must sufficiently be taken into consideration. In order to rebuild <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> fisheries, a rebuilding plan for the ecosystem must gradually be established and related multi-fisheries should be managed systematically. In addition, because <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker,</b> are captured in the fishing grounds of Korea, China and Japan, efficient management in one nation will not lead to efficient recovery. Therefore, the joint management among Korea, China and Japan regarding the YCSRP is required.

The full-length cDNA of large <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> caspase- 3 (Lyccasp 3) is 2222 bp with an open reading frame of 858 bp encoding a polypeptide of 285 amino acids (aa). Lyccasp 3 exhibited a conserved caspase- 3 architecture including a prodomain, a large subunit and a small subunit. Moreover, several residues known to be critical in the caspase- 3 catalytic centre and binding pocket, as well as the active-site pentapeptide motif Q(172) ACRG(176) were present in the deduced Lyccasp 3. Recombinant Lyccasp 3 (rLyccasp 3) produced in Escherichia coli exhibited obvious hydrolyzing activity against synthetic peptide substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA. The Lyccasp 3 was constitutively expressed in all the tissues examined, although the expression levels varied from tissue to tissue. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that Lyccasp 3 transcript in spleen and kidney was quickly increased after stimulation with either poly (I:C) or inactivated trivalent bacterial vaccine. Enzyme activities of Lyccasp 3 were also up-regulated in these two tissues post-stimulation when analyzed by hydrolyzing activity assay. Since the activity of large <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> caspase- 9 (Lyccasp 9) in the spleen and kidney also increased when the fish was stimulated with the poly(I:C) or bacterial vaccine [1], we therefore proposed that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, which is initiated by caspase- 9 and executed by caspase- 3, was activated during the immune response induced by poly(I:C) or bacterial vaccine in large <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The functional enrichment analysis illuminated that transcripts involved in DNA bindings, enzyme activities, and signal pathways prominently exhibit less single-nucleotide variants but genes for the constituent of the muscular tissue, the cytoskeleton, and the immunity system contain more frequent SNP mutations, which may reflect the structural and functional selections of the translated proteins.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) on growth performance and humoral immune response of the large <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> (Pseudosciaena crocea R.). One thousand and two hundred large yellow croakers [initial average weight: (162. 75 ± 23. 85) g] were divided into four groups and reared in floating sea cages (3 m× 3 m× 3 m). The animals were fed with 4 diets: basal diet only (control) or diets supplemented with 5 %, 10 % and 15 % (w/w) FPH. The results show that dietary FPH levels significantly influenced the growth and immunity of the large <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker.</b> Compared with the control group, total weight gain (TWG) in all treatment groups, relative weight gain (RWG) and specific growth rate (SGR) in fish fed with diets supplemented with 10 % and 15 % FPH were significantly increased (P< 0. 05). Similar results were observed in immune parameters [lysozyme activity, serum complements, immunoglobulin M (IgM) ]. Lysozyme activity, complement C 4 and IgM were also significantly increased (P< 0. 05) in fish fed with diets supplemented with 10 % and 15 % FPH, while complement C 3 level was significantly increased (P< 0. 05) in all treatment groups. In general, with the supplementation of FPH, particularly at dose of 10 %, the growth performance and immunity of the large <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> can be improved effectively...|$|E
40|$|Outbreaks of {{infectious}} diseases in cultured large <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> have resulted in great economic losses. However, information regarding its immune defense is limited. In the present study, an approach by the combination of differential proteomics with EST resource was applied for investigation of a profile of serum immune response by large <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> to Aeromonas hydrophila challenge after immunization and for characterizing {{of one of the}} targeted immune molecules. Of the twelve altered proteins involved in the response, eight were identified by MS, in which three were randomly selected for antiserum preparation and were further confirmed by Western blotting. Furthermore, three beta(2) m clones, one of the altered molecules, were obtained from a previously constructed Kidney Smart cDNA library of this fish, and were compared for their identity, which contributed to the identification Of beta(2) m cDNA diversity. Meanwhile, the up-regulated beta(2) m in response to the bacterial immunization and challenge was further confirmed by Western blotting. Our results indicate that beta(2) m is involved in the immune response of large <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> to the challenge by A. hydrophila after immunization, which suggests an efficient approach for characterizing of targeted molecules at both the gene and protein levels.
