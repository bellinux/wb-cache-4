[...] From birth to death all we ever do is think: we have one thought, we have another thought, another thought, another thought.

500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, {{if you give them}} a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E

Nicole Scherzinger told MTV News that the video was all about having fun. [...] "Busta Rhymes is pretty phat, man. He is so much fun. He's so humble and he just makes you feel good. When you're around him, you feel magical. The lyrics are, 'Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me.'... But if you see the video, it's all about being who <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>having</b> fun and being confident — and feeling hot.

2500|$|Dining {{etiquette}} in Korea can {{be traced}} back to the Confucian philosophies of the Joseon period. Guidebooks, such as Sasojeol (士小節, Elementary Etiquette for Scholar Families), written in 1775 by Yi Deokmu (이덕무; 李德懋), comment on the dining etiquette for the period. Suggestions include items such as [...] "when you see a fat cow, goat, pig, or chicken, do not immediately speak of slaughtering, cooking or eating it", [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> a meal with others, do not speak of smelly or dirty things, such as boils or diarrhea," [...] "when eating a meal, neither eat so slowly as to appear to be eating against your will nor so fast as if to be taking someone else's food. Do not throw chopsticks on the table. Spoons should not touch plates, making a clashing sound", amongst many other recommendations which emphasized proper table etiquette.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, after {{extensive}} testing, Borlaug's team, under Anderson, {{began its}} effort by importing about 450tons of Lerma Rojo and Sonora 64 semi-dwarf seed varieties: 250tons went to Pakistan and 200 to India. They encountered many obstacles. Their first shipment of wheat {{was held up}} in Mexican customs and so {{it could not be}} shipped from the port at Guaymas in time for proper planting. Instead, it was sent via a 30-truck convoy from Mexico to the U.S. port in Los Angeles, encountering delays at the Mexico - United States border. Once the convoy entered the U.S., it had to take a detour, as the U.S. National Guard had closed the freeway due to Watts riots in Los Angeles. When the seeds reached Los Angeles, a Mexican bank refused to honor Pakistan treasury's payment of US$100,000, because the check contained three misspelled words. Still, the seed was loaded onto a freighter destined for Bombay, India, and Karachi, Pakistan. Twelve hours into the freighter's voyage, war broke out between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region. Borlaug received a telegram from the Pakistani minister of agriculture, Malik Khuda Bakhsh Bucha: [...] "I'm sorry to hear <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> trouble with my check, but I've got troubles, too. Bombs are falling on my front lawn. Be patient, the money is in the bank..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The love {{triangle}} of Sharon, Nick and Phyllis garnered attention {{and was considered}} one of the genre's most titillating storylines. Soap Opera Digest named it the [...] "Best Love Triangle". Jamaica Gleaner was enthralled by the twists and turns of the love triangle and published an interview with Michelle Stafford; the newspaper asked whether Nick would end his ten-year marriage to Sharon and rather enter into an official romance with her pregnant character Phyllis. Stafford replied, [...] "In a perfect world, she'd wish [...] Nick's. But he's married; he's not going to leave Sharon. And she doesn't want him to." [...] The triangle was also a topic of debate during its run. Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide labeled the week Phyllis discovered she was expecting as a [...] "can't-miss week" [...] for the popular triangle. Aubrey Hammack, a writer for AuthorsDen, analysed the storyline and published an article on the matter of adultery. He cited the storyline as realistic, [...] "Men are notorious for saying; I can separate my sexual side from my emotions. [...] Well, unless you are a person without a conscience, this is impossible. [...] Most men just don’t realize that once you have sex with someone, that the emotions kick in not to mention the feelings of being in love and caring about that someone <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> the affair with. [...] When this happens, things spin wildly out of control." [...] With Phyllis and Nick gaining a fan following, On-Air On-Soaps referred to this as the [...] "Phick vs. Shick" [...] fan-base war.|$|E
