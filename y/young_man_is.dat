5|$|Edward Scissorhands is a 1990 American romantic dark fantasy film {{directed}} by Tim Burton, produced by Denise Di Novi and Tim Burton, and written by Caroline Thompson from {{a story by}} Tim Burton and Caroline Thompson, starring Johnny Depp as an artificial man named Edward, an unfinished creation who has scissor blades instead of hands. The <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> taken in by a suburban family and {{falls in love with}} their teenage daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Additional roles were played by Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price and Alan Arkin.|$|E

5|$|In a dance club, a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> {{taken by}} a young woman, Marty (Kate Twa), for casual sex. The man dies afterwards, and Marty leaves the room as a man (Peter Stebbings). FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called to the scene; Mulder {{believes}} that the man's death {{was caused by a}} fatal dose of pheromones. There is also ambiguity in similar murders as to the sex of the killer. Evidence from the crime scene leads the duo to an Amish-like community in Steveston, Massachusetts, which Mulder calls the Kindred.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield (from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe) {{contains}} {{a scene where}} the grandfather as a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's tail-piece woodcut for the partridge. The woodcut shows a reaper with a scythe, a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe, which has just lifted. George Ewart Evans used {{the image on the}} title page of his 1956 book about Blaxhall (near Charsfield, on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).|$|E
5|$|A Portrait of the Artist as a <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> {{a nearly}} {{complete}} rewrite {{of the abandoned}} novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A KÃ¼nstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E

5|$|In orbit, the Enterprise {{crew and}} Jameson beam {{down into the}} tunnels beneath Karnas' manor, but find that their arrival was {{anticipated}} and face off against armed guards. Jameson collapses during the fight, and the crew beams back to the Enterprise, where they discover Jameson was not shot but instead the reverse aging drug is destroying his body. Karnas demands to see Jameson or he will kill a hostage every 15 minutes. Picard opts to beam himself, Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden), Jameson, and eventually Jameson's wife Anne directly to Karnas' office. Though Karnas initially refuses {{to believe that the}} <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> Jameson, Picard shows him the images of his reverse aging {{over the last few days}} after which Jameson reveals a scar on his wrist inflicted by Karnas years ago. Karnas prepares to fire on Jameson to get his revenge, but decides to get his revenge by watching Jameson suffer and die horribly from the drug instead. Jameson dies shortly afterward in his wife's embrace. Karnas agrees to let the hostages go, and to allow Jameson to be buried on Mordan IV at Anne's request.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins when}} a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> seen walking {{alone in a}} small town to the snowy {{football}} fields in a morning winter. A cut-scene shows Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped over one shoulder. She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her apartment. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. About halfway through, it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written in his coat pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers, reading her apology letter.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{poems in}} the sequence recommend the benefits of marriage and children. With the famous Sonnet 18 ("Shall I compare thee to a summer's day") the tone changes dramatically towards romantic intimacy. Sonnet 20 explicitly laments that the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> not a woman. Most of the subsequent sonnets describe {{the ups and downs}} of the relationship, culminating with an affair between the poet and the Dark Lady. The relationship seems to end when the Fair Youth succumbs to the Lady's charms (Sonnet 144).|$|E
25|$|Sonnet 110 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. Sonnet 110 was {{published}} {{along with the other}} sonnets in the 1609 Quarto. The sonnet falls in place with the Fair Youth sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. The mystery of the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> still unknown today. However, there are many different theories by various scholars of who this young man may be. There has been much debate whether or not this sonnet was written about Shakespeare's disdain with the stage and actors. Whereas others have interpreted sonnet 110 as the poet confessing his love to a young man.|$|E
25|$|James Joyceâs novel A Portrait of the Artist as a <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> {{partially}} set in UCD (when it was sited on Earlsfort Terrace) where Stephen Dedalus (now {{the name}} of the IT building) is enrolled as a student. Joyce's posthumously-published autobiographical novel Stephen Hero contains stories of his time in UCD. Flann O'Brienâs novel At Swim-Two-Birds features a UCD student who writes a meta-novel wherein the author is put on trial by the characters of his novel. Maeve Binchy's novel, Circle of Friends, deals with three female friends starting college in UCD in the 1950s. However, shots of Trinity College were used in the 1995 film. The second Ross O'Carroll-Kelly novel, The Teenage Dirtbag Years, follows Ross as he enters UCD.|$|E

25|$|It {{is rather}} universally {{accepted}} that {{a body of}} Shakespeare's sonnets, including 65, are addressed {{to a young man}} whose beauty the poems make known. The <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> like Caesar, then, in that Shakespeare recognizes the presence of feminine qualities in a man. But the common theme is more than recognition, it is an acknowledgment of tension created by that recognition. Especially by Cassius, Caesar is made out to be rather feminine, as is the young man in descriptions of his beauty. In that the speaker does not directly refer to the addressee of the sonnets as a man, and in that Brutus and the others find discomfort in Caesar's ruling ability because of his appeared weaknesses, shows that Shakespeare recognizes an anxiety about men with feminine qualities, or women with masculine qualities, like Queen Elizabeth, of whom Caesar {{may or may not be}} representative.|$|E
25|$|The {{acclaimed}} German (later naturalized Swiss) writer Hermann Hesse wrote a {{short story}} in 1915 in which a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> carried by a giant bird across a mountain range to a distant plain that is to him like another world. Strange News from Another Star tells of the horror experienced by this youth who has volunteered to go to find flowers to bury the dead from an earthquake; flowers that are required during the ceremony of the burial of the dead, in this young man's world, to ease a smooth transition into the next life. In order to speed his journey, he is carried across the mountains by this giant bird, but finds himself in a land where war has left the dead unburied and uncared for, a brutal world, perhaps {{like that of the}} trenches of World War I, a world that he can only believe is from his distant past. Hesse later went on to write the acclaimed novel Siddhartha, exploring the life of Buddha.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Tavis Morello , an Eagle Scout, {{and staff}} member working at Yawgoog Scout Reservation {{was fired for}} admitting he was gay to Scouting Official Gary Savignano, who then {{proceeded}} to confiscated Morello's Eagle Scout card. Director of the Narragansett Council at the time, Lyle Antonides, defended the action stating that âI think this <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> {{just trying to get}} a headline.â In response to the firing of their fellow staff member, {{the vast majority of the}} Reservations staff staged a sit-in as a sign of support, causing the camp to shut down. Following this, GLAD and the Rhode Island affiliate of the ACLU looked into the situation. ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown is quoted as saying, âBased on the information Iâve heard, this person was terminated because he acknowledged he was gay. And thatâs illegal.â Due to mounting legal pressures and increasing amounts of negative publicity, by the end of the camping season, the Narragansett Council had reversed its decision and offered to reinstate Morello, both as an employee and as an Eagle Scout.|$|E
