500|$|A huge party erupted {{both inside}} and outside De Kuip {{not only because of the}} title, but also because the final was held two days after Rotterdam's {{political}} hero Pim Fortuyn was murdered. Many Feyenoord fans were still full of emotion before and after the match. As a result of Fortuyn's murder, the victory was not officially celebrated in Coolsingel Square with their fans. During Feyenoord's UEFA Cup run, a parody was launched of the song [...] "Put Your Hands Up" [...] by Black & White Brothers, [...] "Put <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>Up</b> for Pi-Air", as a tribute to Pierre van Hooijdonk.|$|E

500|$|... "Turn Up the Music" [...] is an uptempo {{electronic}} dance, {{and house}} song, which {{last for a}} duration of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. Instrumentation is provided by pulsating beats, synthesizers and percussion. Rap-Up described the production as [...] "synth-heavy". The song opens with Brown singing [...] "Turn up the music cause the sun just came up / Turn up the music {{if they try to}} turn us down / Turn up the music cause I'm trying to hear the speakers blow / Turn up the music, fill your cup and drink it down". It is then followed by repeated chants of [...] "If you're sexy and you know it put <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> in the air". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the chanting was a reference to LMFAO's [...] "Sexy and I Know It" [...] (2011). Andy Kellman of Allmusic likened the song to Baltimora's [...] "Tarzan Boy" [...] (1985).|$|E
500|$|The song's {{production}} is primarily centered around hi-NRG beats, [...] "stuttering synthesizers", and hard snares. Robbie Daw of Idolator {{noted that the}} [...] "opening, pulsating synths are a straight-up throwback to the 'Poker Face' intro— albeit slightly sped up— while the handclap-laden chorus swells and soars with the same pop frenzy that made 'Paparazzi' such a delight." [...] The Guardians Michael Cragg described the song's composition as [...] "brilliantly camp– all squelchy synths and juddering beats" [...] and likened it to a [...] "ridiculous glam-rock song given a techno makeover". The chorus has been noted to contain [...] "a solid mixture of EDM-influenced pop, glitchy k-pop-lite euphoria and just a twinkle of that original joy of The Fame" [...] and features Gaga singing the lines, [...] "Give me the thing that I love (I'll turn the lights on) / Put <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> make 'em touch (Make it real loud)". Her vocal acrobatics during the song's verses have been compared to those of David Bowie, Annie Lennox, and Grace Jones.|$|E
500|$|Four singles were {{released}} from Aphrodite. Its lead single [...] "All the Lovers" [...] was a commercial success, peaking at number {{three in the}} United Kingdom and reaching the top ten in numerous countries like France, Italy, Scotland and Spain. In Australia, it narrowly missed the top ten by peaking at number 13 on the singles chart. [...] "Get Outta My Way" [...] was released as the second single and reached the top 20 in the United Kingdom, but underperformed in Australia after failing to peak inside the top 50. Similarly, the third single [...] "Better than Today" [...] missed the top 50 in Australia, and additionally missed the top 20 in the United Kingdom. In response to their poor chart performances, Minogue expressed disappointment in her label and stated that no further singles would be released. Despite this statement, [...] "Put <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>Up</b> (If You Feel Love)" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from Aphrodite and peaked at number 50 in Australia.

Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E

A [...] "hen night" [...] was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a [...] "massive" [...] {{party in the}} show's Albert Square to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Windsor admitted {{she had been so}} nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, [...] "I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous – we were both very nervous. The day you stop getting nervous you can hold <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up.</b> It shows you care." [...] The soap wedding was filmed in Harrow, North West London in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: [...] "It {{is one of the best}} weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot of people who do not want to see Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, there are certainly shocking revelations back at the Vic." [...] In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.|$|E
500|$|Billed by {{her record}} label Parlophone as her {{comeback}} album, Aphrodite {{is a celebration}} of Minogue's [...] "dance-floor roots", and is primarily a dance-pop and disco album. Its title alludes to the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. [...] "All the Lovers", {{one of the last}} tracks to be recorded for the album, is a [...] "squiggly" [...] electropop-influenced disco song written by Jim Eliot and Mima Stilwell, who had previously collaborated with Minogue on [...] "2 Hearts", the lead single from X. It is similar to Minogue's 2004 single [...] "I Believe in You", but has a [...] "more danceable edge", and features a [...] "gauzy, heartbeat rhythm" [...] and 1980s-stylised synthesiser riffs. The song was met with critical acclaim from music critics and was frequently commended for its production and chorus. The second track [...] "Get Outta My Way" [...] combines electronic music and bubblegum pop with disco elements. The song focuses on a [...] "frustrated and furious" [...] Minogue delivering [...] "wispy" [...] vocals in a form of a warning to her uncaring partner, indicating that she may leave him and start [...] "grinding away with another chap". Its lyrical content is suggestive in nature. The song received generally favourable reviews from music critics and was complimented for its musical composition and subject matter. [...] "Put <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>Up</b> (If You Feel Love)" [...] is a hi-NRG-influenced club song. Receiving mixed critical reviews, its lyrics were criticised for being clichéd although one critic named it a [...] "concert hit waiting to happen." [...] "Closer" [...] takes a darker and more atmospheric approach, featuring [...] "sighing background vocals and spiralling harpsichord-esque synths." [...] Critics felt {{that it was one of}} the more interesting and experimental songs of the album.|$|E

5000|$|... == Explanation == Transverse {{waves are}} waves that are {{oscillating}} perpendicularly to {{the direction of}} propagation. If you anchor {{one end of a}} ribbon or string and hold the other end in <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> you can create transverse waves by moving <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> and down. Notice though, that you can also launch waves by moving <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> side-to-side. This is an important point. There are two independent directions in which wave motion can occur. In this case, these motions are the y and z directions mentioned above, while the wave propagates away in the x direction.|$|R
500|$|The {{show was}} divided into four sections: Pimp, Old School, Gypsy and Rave. It began with [...] "The Sweet Machine", a 3D {{animation}} video displaying candy being manufactured and used as a Pinball. As the video ended, [...] "Candy Shop" [...] began with Madonna appearing on a M-shaped throne in the Givenchy-designed dress, sitting with her legs spread apart and holding a staff in her hands.

The next section, inspired by the style and culture of early 1980s New York, began with Madonna skipping on stage for [...] "Into the Groove". This performance was a mashup with [...] "Toop Toop" [...] by Cassius and featured the artwork of friend Keith Haring. She then performed a double Dutch dance interlude which led to [...] "Heartbeat". During that song, Madonna's dance movements were controlled by her back-up dancers as if they were puppeteers. She performed [...] "Borderline" [...] in a rock version, on electric guitar. [...] "She's Not Me" [...] followed, where Madonna made fun of her various incarnations and styles, from the music videos of [...] "Open Your Heart", [...] "Material Girl", [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin". The section ended with [...] "Music" [...] which contained elements of [...] "Put <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>Up</b> 4 Detroit" [...] and excerpts from [...] "Last Night a DJ Saved My Life". A short video was played featuring a tagged subway train. The doors of the train then closed to take in Madonna and her dancers. The [...] "Rain" [...] video interlude was played on the video screens; it featured an animated pixie finding shade under a petal during a rainstorm. This version contained musical elements from [...] "Here Comes the Rain Again" [...] by Eurythmics.|$|E
