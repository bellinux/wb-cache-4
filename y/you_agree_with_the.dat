2500|$|As of September, Governor Palin had {{submitted}} to two media interviews, the first with ABC's Charles Gibson, {{and the second}} with Fox News's Sean Hannity. Gibson asked Palin, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Bush doctrine?," [...] to which Palin responded, [...] "In what respect, Charlie?" [...] After asking Palin for her definition, Gibson defined the concept {{to be for the}} United States to [...] "have the right of anticipatory self-defense." [...] Gibson also asked Palin about a prayer she had offered with regard to soldiers in Iraq. Commentators' reactions varied. Those generally critical of Palin's candidacy applauded Gibson's penetrating questions and thought aspects of Palin's responses showed that she was not ready to serve as Vice President, whereas those generally supportive of her candidacy took a more positive view of her performance.|$|E

Kevin Drum of Mother Jones magazine said [...] "here's really {{no excuse for}} Emanuel's and Menino's actions... you don't hand out business licenses based on whether <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> political views of the executives. Not in America, anyway ... what makes this whole situation so weird is that Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy has always opposed gay marriage. He's a devout Southern Baptist, just like his father, who founded the company. The place is closed on Sundays, for crying out loud. There's just nothing new here." [...] UCLA law professor and blogger Eugene Volokh observed, [...] "enying a private business permits because of such speech by its owner is a blatant First Amendment violation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kelley responded, {{in a paper}} titled [...] "A Question of Sanction", by disputing Schwartz's {{interpretation}} of the sanction principle in particular and his {{interpretation of}} moral principles in general. Subsequently, in an essay appearing in The Intellectual Activist, Peikoff endorsed Schwartz's view and claimed that Kelley's arguments contradicted the fundamental principles of Objectivism. Peikoff maintained that many non-Objectivist systems of thought, such as Marxism, are based on [...] "inherently dishonest ideas" [...] whose advocacy must never be sanctioned. He attributed the fall of NBI and subsequent schisms not to [...] "differences in regard to love affairs or political strategy or proselytizing techniques or anybody's personality," [...] but to a [...] "fundamental and philosophical" [...] cause: [...] "if you grasp and accept the concept of 'objectivity,' in all its implications, then you accept Objectivism, you live by it and you revere Ayn Rand for defining it. If you fail fully to grasp and accept the concept, whether your failure is deliberate or otherwise, you eventually drift away from Ayn Rand's orbit, or rewrite her viewpoint or turn openly into her enemy." [...] Those who criticized his position were to make their exit: [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Branden or Kelley viewpoint or anything resembling it—please drop out of our movement: drop Ayn Rand, leave Objectivism alone. We do not want you and Ayn Rand would not have wanted you [...] " ...|$|E

The {{effects of}} the {{depreciation}} of the paper currency in the United States are thus described by Mr. Wells: “It renders it impossible to sell abroad the products which have cost too much at home, and invites from other countries the products of a cheaper labor paid for in a sounder currency.

6000|$|The grove {{beside the}} American Fall has been inclosed, and named Prospect Park, {{by a company}} which exacts half a dollar for admittance, and then makes you free of all its wonders and conveniences, for which you once had to pay severally. This is well enough; but {{formerly}} you could refuse {{to go down the}} inclined tramway, and now you cannot, without feeling that you have failed to get your money's worth. It was in this illogical spirit of economy that Basil invited his family to the descent; but Isabel shook her head. [...] "No, you go with the children," [...] she said, [...] "and I will stay, here, till you get back;" [...] her agonized countenance added, [...] "and pray for you;" [...] and Basil took his children on either side of him, and rumbled down the terrible descent with much of the excitement that attends travel in an open horse-car. When he stepped out of the car he felt that increase of courage which comes to every man after safely passing through danger. He resolved to brave the mists and slippery-stones {{at the foot of the}} Fall; and he would have plunged at once into this fresh peril, if he had not been prevented by the Prospect Park Company. This ingenious association has built a large tunnel-like shed quite to the water's edge, so that you cannot view the cataract as you once could, at a reasonable remoteness, but must emerge from the building into a storm of spray. The roof of the tunnel is painted with a lively effect in party-colored stripes, and is lettered [...] "The Shadow of the Rock," [...] so that you take it at first to be an appeal to your aesthetic sense; but the real object of the company is not apparent till you put your head out into the tempest, when <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> nearest guide--and one is always very near--that you had better have an oil-skin dress, as Basil did. He told the guide that he did not wish to go under the Fall, and the guide confidentially admitted that there was no fun in that, any way; and in the mean time he equipped him and his children for their foray into the mist. When they issued forth, under their friend's leadership, Basil felt that, with his children clinging to each hand, he looked like some sort of animal with its young, and, though not unsocial by nature, he was glad to be among strangers for the time. They climbed hither and thither over the rocks, and lifted their streaming faces for the views which the guide pointed out; and in a rift of the spray they really caught one glorious glimpse of the whole sweep of the Fall. The next instant the spray swirled back, and they were glad to turn for a sight of the rainbow, lying in a circle on the rocks as quietly and naturally as if that had been the habit of rainbows ever since the flood. This was all there was to be done, and they streamed back into the tunnel, where they disrobed in the face of a menacing placard, which announced that the hire of a guide and a dress for going under the Fall was one dollar.|$|E
