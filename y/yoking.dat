5|$|In an {{interview}} with Alma Books, Whitehead states {{that the concept of}} the book originated from an article about the naming process for new pharmaceuticals such as Prozac. The article made Whitehead question how a similar process is used to assert a certain control over one's environment (his example is a boulevard named after a particular person), and <b>yoking</b> the two concepts {{was the beginning of the}} ideas that led to his composition of the novel.|$|E

500|$|In Sanskrit, {{the word}} yoga {{comes from the}} root [...] which means [...] "to add", [...] "to join", [...] "to unite", or [...] "to attach" [...] in its most common senses. By figurative {{extension}} from the <b>yoking</b> or harnessing of oxen or horses, the word took on broader meanings such as [...] "employment, use, application, performance" [...] (compare the figurative uses of [...] "to [...] " [...] as in [...] "to put something to some use"). All further developments {{of the sense of}} this word are post-Vedic. More prosaic moods such as [...] "exertion", [...] "endeavour", [...] "zeal", and [...] "diligence" [...] are also found in Indian epic poetry.|$|E

The US did, after the December ultimatums to Venezuela, send an envoy to survey Venezuela's defensive capabilities, and thereby confirmed its confidence that the US Navy could repel a German invasion. The publication of a British government White Paper, revealing {{the nature of the}} [...] "iron-clad" [...] agreement, infuriated the British press, not least because the <b>yoking</b> of British and German interests was considered dangerous, and unnecessary for the mere collection of some foreign debts. This was exemplified by Rudyard Kipling's polemic poem [...] "The Rowers", published in The Times on 22 December {{as a response to the}} crisis; it included the words [...] "a secret vow ye have made with an open foe... a breed that have wronged us most... to help them press for a debt!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The first German {{settlers}} came to Lunenburg County 258 years ago. [...] Little {{remains of}} the German language and cultural practices.

[...] The German head yoke is still used for <b>yoking</b> oxen at showmanship pulls and the German claw hoe can still be found in various tool sheds. [...] German sauerkraut is cut from cabbage and turnip. [...] Another food is the Lunenburg sausage made from ground pork and beef, spiced with coriander and stuffed into the entrails of the hog. [...] The pudding version is spiced with summer savory and then cooked (Veinot, 2008).|$|E
2500|$|Ceres was {{credited}} {{with the discovery of}} spelt wheat (Latin far), the <b>yoking</b> of oxen and ploughing, the sowing, protection and nourishing of the young seed, and the gift of agriculture to humankind; before this, it was said, man had subsisted on acorns, and wandered without settlement or laws. She had the power to fertilise, multiply and fructify plant and animal seed, and her laws and rites protected all activities of the agricultural cycle. In January, Ceres was offered spelt wheat and a pregnant sow, along with the earth-goddess Tellus, at the movable Feriae Sementivae. This was almost certainly held before the annual sowing of grain. The divine portion of sacrifice was the entrails (exta) presented in an earthenware pot (olla). In a rural context, Cato the Elder describes the offer to Ceres of a porca praecidanea (a pig, offered before the sowing). Before the harvest, she was offered a propitiary grain sample (praemetium). Ovid tells that Ceres [...] "is content with little, provided that her offerings are casta" [...] (pure).|$|E
2500|$|Shakespearean scholar Helen Vendler characterizes Sonnet 65 as a [...] "defective key word" [...] sonnet. [...] Often, Shakespeare {{will use}} a {{particular}} word prominently in each quatrain, prompting the reader {{to look for it}} in the couplet and note any change in usage. [...] Here, however, he repeats the words [...] "hold" [...] and [...] "strong" [...] (modified slightly to [...] "stronger" [...] in Q1), but omits them in the couplet, thus rendering them [...] "defective." [...] Vendler claims that these key words are replaced by [...] "miracle" [...] and [...] "black ink" [...] respectively in the quatrain, citing as evidence the shift of focus from organic to inorganic, which parallels the same shift occurring more broadly from the octave to the sestet, as well as the presence of the letters i, a, c, and l visually <b>yoking</b> miracle to black ink. [...] Stephen Booth supports this line of criticism, noting the juxtaposition of [...] "hand" [...] and [...] "foot" [...] in line 11, suggesting someone being tripped up and perhaps mirroring the shift to come in the couplet.|$|E
60|$|During this conversation, Beechnut {{had been}} busily {{employed}} in <b>yoking</b> up the oxen. Stuyvesant looked on, watching the operations carefully, {{in order to}} see how the work of <b>yoking</b> up was done. He wished to see whether the process was such that he could learn to yoke up oxen himself; or whether any thing that was required was beyond his strength.|$|E

6000|$|... "His Majesty now {{arrived at}} Garz. The {{changing}} of the horses was managed by Herr von Luderitz of Nackeln, as first Deputy of the Ruppin Circle. He had his hat on, and a white feather in it. When the <b>yoking</b> was completed, our journey proceeded again.|$|E
60|$|Long before {{daylight}} {{the camp}} at Nephi was astir. The cattle were driven out to water and pasture. While the men unchained the wheels {{and drew the}} wagons apart and clear for <b>yoking</b> in, the women cooked forty breakfasts over forty fires. The children, in the chill of dawn, clustered about the fires, sharing places, here and there, with the last relief of the night-watch waiting sleepily for coffee.|$|E
60|$|Discovering that, {{in early}} life, Israel had been {{employed}} on a farm, {{the man of}} wisdom at length turned the conversation in that direction; among other things, mentioning to his guest a plan of his (the Doctor's) for <b>yoking</b> oxen, with a yoke to go by a spring instead of a bolt; thus greatly facilitating the operation of hitching on the team to the cart. Israel was very much struck with the improvement; and thought that, if he were home, upon his mountains, he would immediately introduce it among the farmers.|$|E
6000|$|Harriet and I and one Lars Peterson gave a {{great deal}} of time to an attempt to train a yoke of {{yearling}} calves to draw our handsled. I call it an attempt, for we hardly got beyond a struggle to overcome the stubborn resentment of the stupid beasts, who very naturally objected to being forced into service before their time. Harriet was ten, I was not quite nine, and Lars was only twelve, hence we spent long hours in <b>yoking</b> and unyoking our unruly span. I believe we did actually haul several loads of firewood to the kitchen door, but at last Buck and Brin [...] "turned the yoke" [...] and broke it, and that ended our teaming.|$|E

60|$|However, {{the deed}} {{had to be}} done; Swithin was to be made legally hers. Selfishness in a conjuncture of this sort was excusable, and even obligatory. Taking {{brighter}} views, she hoped that upon the whole this <b>yoking</b> of the young fellow with her, a portionless woman and his senior, would not greatly endanger his career. In such a mood night overtook her, {{and she went to}} bed conjecturing that Swithin had by this time arrived in the parish, was perhaps even at that moment passing homeward beneath her walls, and that in less than twelve hours she would have met him, have ventilated the secret which oppressed her, and have satisfactorily arranged with him the details of their reunion.|$|E
60|$|I now {{took the}} measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one-- so there was no <b>yoking</b> them. I then placed the first bench {{lengthwise}} along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{what would}} she think of him? They had been friends, he said to himself; they had passed over those {{boundaries}} of teasing unreality where most <b>yoking</b> gentlemen and young ladies are content to hold converse with each other, and had talked together reasonably and seriously, saying in some hours what they really thought and felt. And Rose had impressed him at times by her silence and reticence in certain connections, and on certain subjects, {{with a sense of}} something hidden and veiled,--a reserved force that he longed still further to penetrate. But now, he said to himself, he must have fallen in her opinion. Why was she so cold, so almost haughty, in her treatment of him the night before? He felt in the atmosphere around her, and in the touch of her hand, that she was quivering like a galvanic battery with the suppressed force of some powerful emotion; and his own conscience dimly interpreted to him what it might be.|$|E

6000|$|His honour, Master Maulstatute, {{uttered the}} word [...] "coach" [...] with the {{importance}} of one who, as Dr. Johnson saith of later date, is conscious of the dignity of putting horses to his chariot. The worshipful Master Maulstatute did not, however on this occasion, do Julian the honour of <b>yoking</b> to his huge family caroche the two [...] "frampal jades" [...] (to use the term of the period), which were wont to drag that ark to the meeting house of pure and precious Master Howlaglass, on a Thursday's evening for lecture, and on a Sunday for a four-hours' sermon. He had recourse to a leathern convenience, then more rare, but just introduced, with every prospect of the great facility which has since been afforded by hackney coaches, to all manner of communication, honest and dishonest, legal and illegal. Our friend Julian, hitherto much more accustomed to the saddle than to any other conveyance, soon {{found himself in a}} hackney carriage, with the constable and two assistants for his companions, armed up to the teeth--the port of destination being, as they had already intimated, the ancient fortress of Newgate.|$|E
60|$|And yet withal {{has there}} not been {{realised}} somewhat? Consider (to go no further) these strong Stone-edifices, {{and what they}} hold! Mud-Town of the Borderers (Lutetia Parisiorum or Barisiorum) has paved itself, has spread over all the Seine Islands, and far and wide on each bank, and become City of Paris, sometimes boasting to be 'Athens of Europe,' and even 'Capital of the Universe.' Stone towers frown aloft; long-lasting, grim with a thousand years. Cathedrals are there, and a Creed (or memory of a Creed) in them; Palaces, and a State and Law. Thou seest the Smoke-vapour; unextinguished Breath as of a thing living. Labour's thousand hammers ring on her anvils: also a more miraculous Labour works noiselessly, not with the Hand but with the Thought. How have cunning workmen in all crafts, with their cunning head and right-hand, tamed the Four Elements to be their ministers; <b>yoking</b> the winds to their Sea-chariot, making the very Stars their Nautical Timepiece;--and written and collected a Bibliotheque du Roi; among whose Books is the Hebrew Book! A wondrous race of creatures: these have been realised, and what of Skill is in these: call not the Past Time, with all its confused wretchednesses, a lost one.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Smith avers {{with obvious}} and impudent {{satisfaction}} that in Liege {{twice as many}} draught dogs as horses are seen in the streets, attached to vehicles. He regards [...] "a gaily painted cart" [...] drawn by [...] "a well fed dog" [...] and driven by a well fed (and gaily painted) woman as a [...] "pleasing vision." [...] I do not; I should prefer to see the dog sitting at the receipt of steaks and chops and the lady devoting herself to the amelioration of {{the condition of the}} universe, and the manufacture of poetry and stories that are not true. A more pleasing vision, too, one endeared to eye and heart by immemorial use and wont, is that of stranger and dog indulging in the pleasures of the chase--stranger a little ahead--while the woman in the case manifests a characteristically compassionate solicitude lest the gentleman's trousers do not match Fido's mustache. It is, indeed, impossible to regard with any degree of approval the degradation to commercial utility of two so noble animals as Dog and Woman; and if Man had joined them together by driving-reins I should hope that God would put them asunder, even if the reins were held by Dog. There would no doubt be a distinct gain as well as a certain artistic fitness in unyoking the strong-minded female of our species from the Chariot of Progress and <b>yoking</b> her to the apple-cart or fish-wagon, and--but that is another story; the imminence of the draughtwoman is not foreshadowed in the report of our Consul at Liege.|$|E
60|$|The audacious {{humor of}} his {{position}} sufficed with a people who liked a joke rather better than anything else; in his old age, his infidelity was something that would hardly have been changed, if possible, by a popular vote. Even his wife, to whom it {{had once been a}} heavy cross, borne with secret prayer and tears, had long ceased to gainsay it in any wise. Her family had opposed her <b>yoking</b> with an unbeliever when she married him, but she had some such hopes of converting him as women cherish who give themselves to men confirmed in drunkenness. She learned, as other women do, that she could hardly change her husband in the least of his habits, and that, in this great matter of his unbelief, her love was powerless. It became easier at last for her to add self-sacrifice to self-sacrifice than to vex him with her anxieties about his soul, and to act upon the feeling that, if he must be lost, then she did not care to be saved. He had never interfered with her church-going; he had rather promoted it, for he liked to have women go; but the time came when she no longer cared to go without him; she lapsed from her membership, and it was now many years since she had worshipped with the people of her faith, if, indeed, she were still of any faith. Her life was silenced in every way, and, as often happens with aging wives in country towns, she seldom went out of her own door, and never appeared at the social or public solemnities of the village. Her husband and her daughter composed and bounded her world,--she always talked of them, or of other things as related to them. She had grown an elderly woman, without losing the color of her yellow hair; and the bloom of girlhood had been stayed in her cheeks as if by the young habit of blushing, which she had kept. She was still what her neighbors called very pretty-appearing, and she must have been a beautiful girl. The silence of her inward life subdued her manner, till now she seemed always to have come from some place on which a deep hush had newly fallen.|$|E
60|$|When a {{stirring}} event occurs up here we smack our lips over it for months, and so I could still write {{a history of}} that memorable night in Thrums. I could tell how the doctor, a man whose shoulders often {{looked as if they}} had been caught in a shower of tobacco ash, brought me the news to the school-house, and now, when I crossed the fields to dumfounder Waster Lunny with it, I found Birse, the post, reeling off the story to him as fast as a fisher could let out line. I know who was the first woman on the Marywell brae to hear the horn, and how she woke her husband, and who heard it first at the Denhead and the Tenements, with what they immediately said and did. I had from Dite Deuchar's own lips the curious story of his sleeping placidly throughout the whole disturbance, and on wakening in the morning <b>yoking</b> to his loom as usual; and also his statement that such ill-luck was enough to shake a man's faith in religion. The police had knowledge that enabled them to go straight to the houses of the weavers wanted, but they sometimes brought away the wrong man, for such of the people as did not escape from the town had swopped houses for the night--a trick that served them better than all their drilling on the hill. Old Yuill's son escaped by burying himself in a peat- rick, and Snecky Hobart by pretending that he was a sack of potatoes. Less fortunate was Sanders Webster, the mole-catcher already mentioned. Sanders was really an innocent man. He had not even been in Thrums on the night of the rising against the manufacturers, but thinking that the outbreak was to be left unpunished, he wanted his share in the glory of it. So he had boasted of being a ringleader until many believed him, including the authorities. His braggadocio undid him. He was run to earth in a pig-sty, and got nine months. With the other arrests I need not concern myself, for they have no part in the story of the little minister.|$|E
6000|$|... "Without troubling {{our readers}} at any great length with our reasons for {{entertaining}} these suspicions, we may remark, {{that the absence}} of all other information on the subject, except what is contained in the work, is itself a fact of a most significant character. The whole German press, as well as the particular one where the work purports to have been printed, seems to be under the control of Stillschweigen and Co. --Silence and Company. If the Clothes-Philosophy and its author are making so great a sensation throughout Germany as is pretended, how happens it that the only notice we have of the fact is contained in a few numbers of a monthly Magazine published at London! How happens it that no intelligence about the matter has come out directly to this country? We pique ourselves here in New England upon knowing at least as much {{of what is going on}} in the literary way in the old Dutch Mother-land as our brethren of the fast-anchored Isle; but thus far we have no tidings whatever of the 'extensive close-printed, close-meditated volume,' which forms the subject of this pretended commentary. Again, we would respectfully inquire of the 'present Editor' upon what part of the map of Germany we are to look for the city of Weissnichtwo--'Know-not-where'--at which place the work is supposed to have been printed, and the Author to have resided. It has been our fortune to visit several portions of the German territory, and to examine pretty carefully, at different times and for various purposes, maps of the whole; but we have no recollection of any such place. We suspect that the city of Know-not-where might be called, with at least as much propriety, Nobody-knows-where, and is to be found in the kingdom of Nowhere. Again, the village of Entepfuhl--'Duck-pond'--where the supposed Author of the work is said to have passed his youth, and that of Hinterschlag, where he had his education, are equally foreign to our geography. Duck-ponds enough there undoubtedly are in almost every village in Germany, as the traveller in that country knows too well to his cost, but any particular village denominated Duck-pond is to us altogether terra incognita. The names of the personages are not less singular than those of the places. Who can refrain from a smile at the <b>yoking</b> together of such a pair of appellatives as Diogenes Teufelsdrockh? The supposed bearer of this strange title is represented as admitting, in his pretended autobiography, that 'he had searched to no purpose through all the Heralds' books in and without the German empire, and through all manner of Subscribers'-lists, Militia-rolls, and other Name-catalogues,' but had nowhere been able to find 'the name Teufelsdrockh, except as appended to his own person.' We can readily believe this, and we doubt very much whether any Christian parent would think of condemning a son to carry through life the burden of so unpleasant a title. That of Counsellor Heuschrecke--'Grasshopper'--though not offensive, looks much more like a piece of fancy-work than a 'fair business transaction.' The same may be said of Blumine--'Flower-Goddess'--the heroine of the fable; and so of the rest.|$|E
