2500|$|... "Every {{room has}} a {{relationship}} with something in the landscape that’s different from the room next door," [...] Heymann says. [...] "Each of the rooms feels like a slightly different place." [...] In the guest bathroom, for example, when you look up from the sink, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> on an oak tree rather than into a mirror, which is on a side wall.|$|E
2500|$|Keeping up an even-handed treatment, Kingsley {{introduced}} {{as a character}} in the story Professor Ptthmllnsprts (Put-them-all-in-spirits) as an amalgam of Owen and Huxley, satirising each in turn. Like the very possessive Owen, the Professor was [...] "very good to all the world {{as long as it}} was good to him. Only one fault he had, which cock-robins have likewise, as you may see if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of the nursery window—that, when any one else found a curious worm, he would hop round them, and peck them, and set up his tail, and bristle up his feathers, just as a cock-robin would; and declare that he found the worm first; and that it was his worm; and, if not, that then it was not a worm at all." [...] Like Huxley, [...] "the professor had not the least notion of allowing that things were true, merely because people thought them beautiful.... The professor, indeed, went further, and held that no man was forced to believe anything to be true, but what he could see, hear, taste, or handle." [...] A paragraph on [...] "the great hippopotamus test" [...] opens with the Professor, like Huxley, declaring [...] "that apes had hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have", but then like Owen presenting the argument that [...] "If you have a hippopotamus major in your brain, you are no ape".|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well then," [...] cries Jemmy {{all in a}} bustle. [...] "Vive the Military English! Vive the Lady Lirriper! Vive the Jemmy Jackman Ditto! Vive the Legacy! Now, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out,</b> Gran. And <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out,</b> godfather. I'll read! And I'll {{tell you}} what I'll do besides. On {{the last night of}} our holiday here when we are all packed and going away, I'll top up with {{something}} of my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Handed {{him over}} to the police," [...] the young man answered; [...] "but I am afraid they would never get him to the station. Have <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of the window?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And yet you assert delubris means [...] "deluges." [...] Whether I am a fit {{subject for}} such a jape is, of course, a matter of opinion, but.... Winton, you are {{normally}} conscientious. May we assume <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> delubris?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know the}} kind of women that Miss Chancellor had at her house, and what a group you must have made when <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> at the Back Bay! It {{depresses}} me very much to think of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Won't <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of your window, Mrs. Gill?' [...] Quoth the Fairy, niddling, {{nodding in}} the garden; [...] 'Can't <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of your window, Mrs. Gill?' [...] Quoth the Fairy, {{laughing}} softly in the garden; [...] But {{the air was}} still, the cherry boughs were still, [...] And the ivy-tod 'neath the empty sill, [...] And never from her window looked out Mrs. Gill [...] On the Fairy shrilly mocking in the garden.|$|E
6000|$|When the two {{had taken}} leave of the old woman, and Miss Annie {{had gone out of}} the door, Aunt Patsy leaned very far forward, and {{stretching}} out her long arm, seized Mr Croft by the skirt of his coat. He stepped back, quite surprised, and then she said to him, in a low but very earnest voice: [...] "I reckon dat dat ar sprain ankle was nuffin but a acciden'; but <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out,</b> sah, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out!</b> Hab you got dem little shoes handy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by {{tumbling}} there like a Christmas goose?" [...] he retorted, [...] "why don't <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for stumps and twigs as I do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was what}} sailors call a [...] "dirty night." [...] When <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> upon the sea, {{it seemed as}} if there were nothing there but horrible {{darkness}}. If you went down to the beach, however,--close under the fishing village of Sunland--you found that there was just enough of light to make the darkness visible.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, Jacob," [...] he said, [...] "in one way I {{never saw}} <b>you</b> <b>look</b> {{so well in}} your life. That bronze you got {{in the south of}} France is most becoming, and, if you'll forgive my saying so, you seem to have gained poise lately, to have lost that slight self-consciousness with which <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> upon life just at first. And yet <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> as I'd like to see you. I haven't even heard you laugh as you used to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll tell <b>you</b> what <b>you</b> <b>look</b> like, if that's {{any good}} to you. That slight smile of yours will meet behind, if <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> <b>out,</b> and then {{the top of your}} head'll come off." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. BRADMERE. I wouldn't {{trust you}} a yard. Once more, Godleigh! This is a Christian village, and we mean it to remain so. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for yourself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> {{that you}} don't take a header!" [...] warned Tom. [...] "This road is all right, but a loose stone might do {{a pile of}} damage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Easier {{said than}} done," [...] said the mate. [...] "The missis has got eyes like needles; still, I’ll {{do the best}} I can for <b>you.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>out!</b> Here she comes." ...|$|E
500|$|Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf, {{one of the}} show's makeup creators, was {{extremely}} pleased with Drago's makeup in the episode. She later noted, [...] "I remember Billy Drago was awesome–he looked so creepy after makeup. I just wanted this guy to look super-creepy and disturbing to look at, but real enough {{that you might be}} scared if <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> your window at night and saw him standing there".|$|R
6000|$|She {{had another}} pause while, across her carpets, {{he had another}} walk. [...] "If <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> <b>out</b> you'll have them {{straight}} over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Lucy, laughing. [...] "If <b>you</b> will <b>look</b> <b>out</b> the 'Beggar's Opera' {{from the}} large canterbury. It has a dingy cover." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't understand," [...] {{rejoined the}} Shaggy Man, sleepily. [...] "Anyhow, {{make friends with}} the Pink Kitten and you'll be all right. If the Pink Kitten despises <b>you,</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for breakers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you {{are going}} to try to hunt polar bears and such, eh?" [...] he said. [...] "Well, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> that the bears don't eat you up," [...] and he laughed broadly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thet old chief, Hawk, is comin'," [...] Holley {{informed}} Bostil. [...] "He hasn't {{been here}} fer several years. Recollect thet bunch of colts he had? They're bosses, not mustangs.... So <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out,</b> Bostil!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> for yourself, {{and thought}} what manner of home yours {{will be when}} he shall have been dead and buried?" [...] He paused, but she {{remained}} silent, and assumed a special cast of countenance, as though she might say a word, if he pressed her, which it would be disagreeable for him to hear. [...] "When he has gone will you not be very solitary without a husband?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He don't {{know these}} parts {{as well as}} he might. If <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> <b>out</b> he'll lose <b>you</b> in the mountains, and you'll never get home alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear that, Berry? He doesn't always break. <b>You</b> must <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for that," [...] said Burgess helpfully. Morris {{sat down}} and began {{to take off his}} pads.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Me too, I wish that," [...] says Uncle Aurette. [...] "But they'll be {{pressing}} better {{men than}} themselves {{to fight for}} 'em. The press-gangs are out already on our side. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{come to be}} such friends," [...] she said. [...] "I believe it'll be {{good for}} you to visit me in the city. Here--all day <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> across that awful lonely desert.... Come, Nell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't!" [...] she replied, {{drawing up}} her skirt in genteel fashion. [...] "I {{want nothing to}} do with you. Only, if he don't alter, well, just <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out,</b> for you'll find him on your doorstep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Trying {{to green}} you, probably. <b>You</b> must <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for {{that sort of}} thing. I'll show you the way to your study, if you like. Come along upstairs.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come {{along and}} have some supper. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> worn <b>out.</b> By Jove, Peggy, it's good seeing you again! Can you walk as far as Rector's, or shall I carry you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{also have}} to remember," [...] Mrs. Wix replied, [...] "that if <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> <b>out</b> your wife won't give you time to consider. Her ladyship will leave YOU." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> {{that you}} don't get your fingers burnt {{trying to do}} it!" [...] {{retorted}} Dave. And then the racing car started off and was speedily lost to view around a turn of the road.|$|E
6000|$|He {{seemed in}} doubt how to answer, and the babble without reached {{them as they}} sat--voices as of wavelets on a looping sea, one ever and anon rising above the rest. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> often?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{could hardly}} help ourselves," [...] Jack said, [...] "but {{it is too}} late to discuss that now. Will <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of the window and see if the lane is empty? If so, we had best make off without delay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Tom!" [...] pleaded Nellie, {{and as he}} arose {{and waved}} his hand she pulled {{him down on the}} seat. [...] "If <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> <b>out</b> you'll fall out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can go {{above the}} Falls, Laura," [...] {{answered}} her brother. [...] "There {{is a beautiful}} spot there called Lookout Point, where <b>you</b> can <b>look</b> <b>out</b> all over the valley." ...|$|R
5000|$|Oh, {{when the}} Panther screams, {{you know the}} battle's just begun —And if <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> <b>out,</b> he'll surely get you on the runFor Pittsburgh's Glory,And the honor of our University! ...|$|R
