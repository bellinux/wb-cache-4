You shouldn't view him in the same light now as you did in the past. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>visit</b> him soon." [...] Lu Su then headed to Lü Meng's camp. After some drinks, Lü Meng asked Lu Su, [...] "You've received an important appointment and you're going to be stationed near Guan Yu. Have you made any contingency plans to deal with unforeseen circumstances?" [...] Lu Su lackadaisically replied, [...] "I'll adapt to the situation when the time comes." [...] Lü Meng then said, [...] "The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is nonetheless a person with the might of bears and tigers. How can you not make preparations beforehand?" [...] Lü Meng then proposed five strategies to Lu Su {{on how to deal with}} Guan Yu. Lu Su left his seat, came closer to Lü Meng, placed his hand on his shoulder and said, [...] "Lü Ziming, I never knew you had such insights until I came here." [...] He also visited Lü Meng's mother and left after befriending Lü Meng.|$|E

When the woollen manufacture was introduced into the north, the shuttle competed with the plough in Rossendale, and about forty years ago we sent them the Jenny. The eighty souls are now increased to upwards of eighty thousand, and the rental of the forest, by the last county assessment, amounts to more than 50,000l., 41,000 per cent, on the value in the reign of James I. Now I call that an instance of Saxon industry competing successfully with Norman manners.' ...|$|E

Between ourselves, I've always {{thought that there was}} nothing very heterodox in socialism; in fact, I often think, Le Breton, the Bible's the most thoroughly democratic book that ever was written. But we haven't got to deal in practice with first principles; {{we have to deal with}} Society--with men and women as we find them. Now, Society doesn't like your Herr Schurz, objects to him, anathematises him, wants to imprison him. If you walk about with him in public, Society won't send its sons to your school.
