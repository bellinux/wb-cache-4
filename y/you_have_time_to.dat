500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Doughty advocates reappropriating pejoratives like 'morbid', and [...] {{wants to}} reverse the {{attitude}} that [...] "talking about death is deviant". She says, [...] "Death is not deviant, it's actually the most normal and universal act there is." [...] She is working to overcome the belief that dead bodies are dangerous and can only be handled by trained professionals using technical equipment and specialized facilities. She says {{the most important thing}} she wants the public to know is that the corpse is the family's legal quasi-property, and that you have the power over what happens to that body. Don't let anyone, funeral home, hospital, coroner, etc., pressure you into making a quick decision you might regret. Take the time to do your research and understand your options. The dead person will still be dead in 24 hours; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make the right decision for you. While a body is not commercial property, which can be transferred or held for a debt, for purposes of burial the body is treated as the next of kin's property. Her highest priority changes that she would like to see in US law would be the repeal of the laws in eight states that require a funeral home for at least some part of the process, and to make alkaline hydrolysis available in more than the current eight states.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I am gratified,' said Arthur, ponderously--in happier moments Maud had {{admired his}} gift of language; he read a great deal: encyclopedias and papers and things--'I am gratified <b>to</b> find that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> bestow a glance on me.

"Hardly, Dick, {{considering}} that {{last time you}} went out you tumbled off three times at some jumps two feet wide, and that, were you to fall {{in front of a}} pig, he would rip you up before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> think about it; besides which, you would almost certainly stick somebody with your spear." ...|$|R

6000|$|There was {{a moment}} of silence. Mrs. Blandford {{remained}} by the cabinet, methodically arranging some small articles displaced by the return of the book. [...] "Well," [...] she said, suddenly, [...] "you don't tell me what mother had to say.

6000|$|... "Maybe you could, {{in a kind}} o' way," [...] {{returned}} the other, also filling his pipe and sitting down; [...] "but I'll tell ye what Muster Lumley would do to you, Shames, if ye offered to fight him. He would dance round you like a cooper round a cask; then, first of all, he would flatten your nose--which is flat enough already, whatever--wi' wan hand, an' he'd drive in your stummick wi' the other. Then he would give you one between the two eyes an' raise a bridge there {{to make up for}} the wan he'd destroyed on your nose, an' before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> sneeze he would put a rainbow under your left eye. Or ever <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> wink he would put another under your right eye, and if that didn't settle you he would give you a finishin' dig in the ribs, Shames, trip up your heels, an' lay you on the ground, where I make no doubt you would lie an' meditate whether it wass worth while to rise up for more." ...|$|R
