500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I knew there was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know <b>your</b> <b>concerns</b> about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E
500|$|When the {{production}} company {{first arrived in}} Los Angeles, {{the cast and crew}} were [...] "intimidated" [...] by Scientologists. Scientology officials had previously visited the New York City production in the midst of rehearsals and handed out [...] "documentation of court cases where the Church of Scientology had successfully prosecuted those seeking to disparage the Church's methods." [...] Director/creator Alex Timbers characterized these events as [...] "terrifically wonderful and intimidating". Editors from the Los Angeles Times received phone calls from Scientologists urging them not to write about the play. [...] In addition, the parents of one of the children from the cast received phone calls from members of the entertainment industry who were Scientologists. The parents of these cast members were told that if their children performed in the play, [...] "it might be bad for their future career." [...] The parents politely informed these callers [...] "We read the script, and we don't think it is mean-spirited ... We understand <b>your</b> <b>concerns,</b> but we don't share your concerns." [...] When asked by Variety magazine for the Church's official take on the play, a Los Angeles Church of Scientology spokeswoman was quoted as saying: [...] "This is not litigation material. This is nothing." [...] In a 2007 interview, Jarrow commented on the Church of Scientology's history of responses to productions of the play: [...] "It's clear the Church doesn't like the show—but in my opinion that kind of controversy is evidence that the show's hitting a nerve and dealing with pertinent issues. So I take a certain pride in that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Threatening {{resignation}} {{can also}} be seen as both active–constructive and active–destructive. This strategy involves the employee threatening to resign as a [...] "form of leverage for obtaining responsiveness and action from supervisors and management." [...] When used to express <b>your</b> <b>concerns</b> about unsafe and intolerable work conditions it is deemed constructive. However, this strategy will appear to be destructive when the managers view the threat as [...] " [...] and unprincipled." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked by}} Justice Antonin Scalia [...] "If the congressional statute says the Government {{will build a}} church, that's okay, because then the money doesn't go outside the Government?" [...] Clement {{said there would be}} no {{taxpayer}} standing {{in the case of an}} [...] "internal Government church" [...] but [...] "Anybody who's subjected to the mass at the church probably has standing". He opined that [...] "in the context of the internal Government church, the fact that money is being spent to establish that church is the least of <b>your</b> <b>concerns.</b> It's the fact that the Government is establishing it [...] that's the principal concern." ...|$|E

2500|$|Senator Kerry, you've stated <b>your</b> <b>concern</b> for {{the rising}} cost of health care. Yet you chose the vice presidential {{candidate}} who has made millions of dollars successfully suing medical professionals. How do you reconcile this with the voters? ...|$|R

But I {{was so much}} vexed at what I heard, that <b>your</b> <b>concerns</b> have pressed {{before my}} own,--You behaved to me yesterday, during dinner, as if {{something}} had been told you which lessened or lowered me in your opinion--I beg leave {{to ask you what}} it was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] {{replied the}} Doctor, [...] "I admire you cordially. If {{you do not}} think I have already meddled {{sufficiently}} in <b>your</b> <b>concerns,</b> believe me, from my heart I think the contrary. Take or leave my services as I offer them; and trouble me with no more words of gratitude, for I value your consideration even more lightly than I do your intellect. A time will come, if you should be spared to see {{a number of years}} in health of mind, when you will think differently of all this, and blush for your to-night's behaviour." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{there are}} three ways of {{treating}} Asiatic officials,-by bribe, by bullying, or by bothering them with a dogged perseverance into attending to you and <b>your</b> <b>concerns.</b> The latter is the peculiar province of the poor; moreover, this time I resolved, for other reasons, to be patient. I repeated my question in almost the same words. Ruh! [...] "Be off," [...] was what I obtained for all reply. But this time the questioned {{went so far as}} to open his eyes. Still I stood twirling the paper in my hands, and looking very humble and very persevering, till a loud Ruh ya Kalb! [...] "Go, O dog!"

6000|$|The doctor made {{a sign of}} impatience. [...] "Well," [...] he said [...] "you {{have told}} me, which I think {{is as far as}} <b>your</b> <b>concern</b> in the matter goes. I may add that I'm not {{accustomed}} to dictation on behalf of a steerage passenger." ...|$|R

6000|$|Sir,--I have a {{good while}} had a wish to trouble you with a letter, and had {{certainly}} done it long ere now, but for a humiliating something that throws cold water on the resolution, as if one should say, [...] "You have found Mr. Graham a very powerful and kind friend indeed, and that interest he is so kindly taking in <b>your</b> <b>concerns,</b> you ought by everything in your power to keep alive and cherish." [...] Now, though since God has thought proper to make one powerful and another helpless, the connection of obliger and obliged is all fair; and though my being under your patronage is to me highly honourable, yet, Sir, allow me to flatter myself that,--as a poet and an honest man you first interested yourself in my welfare, and principally as such still, you permit me to approach you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then; {{you should}} be thankful to me for biding. How would the farm go on with nobody to mind it but a woman? But mind this, I don't wish 'ee to feel you owe me anything. Not I. What I do, I do. Sometimes I say I should be as glad as a bird to leave the place--for don't suppose I'm content to be a nobody. I was made for better things. However, I don't like to see <b>your</b> <b>concerns</b> going to ruin, as they must if you keep in this mind.... I hate taking my own measure so plain, but, upon my life, your {{provoking}} ways make a man say what he wouldn't dream of at other times! I own to being rather interfering.

6000|$|Another of Goldsmith's letters was to Robert Bryanton, {{with whom}} he had long ceased to be in correspondence. [...] "I believe," [...] writes he, [...] "that they who are drunk, or out of their wits, fancy {{everybody}} else in the same condition. Mine is a friendship that neither distance nor tune can efface, which is probably the reason that, for the soul of me, I can't avoid thinking yours of the same complexion; and yet I have many reasons for being of a contrary opinion, else why, in so long an absence, was I never made a partner in <b>your</b> <b>concerns?</b> To hear of your success would have given me the utmost pleasure; and a communication of your very disappointments would divide the uneasiness I too frequently feel for my own. Indeed, my dear Bob, you don't conceive how unkindly you have treated one whose circumstances afford him few prospects of pleasure, except those reflected from the happiness of his friends. However, since you have not let me hear from you, I have in some measure disappointed your neglect by frequently thinking of you. Every day or so I remember the calm anecdotes of your life, from the fireside to the easy-chair; recall the various adventures that first cemented our friendship; the school, the college, or the tavern; preside in fancy over your cards; and am displeased at your bad play when the rubber goes against you, though not with all that agony of soul as when I was once your partner. Is it not strange that two of such like affections should be so much separated, and so differently employed as we are? You seem placed at the center of fortune's wheel, and, let it revolve ever so fast, are insensible of the motion. I seem to have been tied to the circumference, and whirled disagreeably round, as if on a whirligig." ...|$|E
5000|$|My Concern for You: Try to get {{others to}} comply because of <b>your</b> <b>concern</b> for them.

I run where I went on hands an' knees. I figured it out this way: Suppose you had a foot to fall on each side, an' it was soft hay. They'd be nothing to stop you. You wouldn't fall. You'd go like a streak. Then it's just the same if it's a mile down on each side. That ain't <b>your</b> <b>concern.</b> <b>Your</b> <b>concern</b> is {{to stay on top}} and go like a streak. An', d'ye know, Saxon, when I went at it that way it never bothered me at all. Wait till he comes with his crowd Sunday. I'm ready for him." ...|$|R
60|$|GAYNOR (brutally). That's <b>your</b> <b>concern.</b> Don't {{lie about}} your poverty. You've a steady well-paid job, {{and plenty of}} money to throw away on drunken sprees, I'll bet.

60|$|You have settled, by {{an economy}} as perverted as the policy, two[125] establishments of government,--one real, one fictitious: both {{maintained}} at a vast expense; but the fictitious at, I think, the greatest. Such a machine {{as the latter}} is not worth the grease of its wheels. The expense is exorbitant; and neither the show nor the use deserve the tenth part of the charge.--Oh! but I don't {{do justice to the}} talents of the legislators: I don't allow, as I ought to do, for necessity. Their scheme of executive force was not their choice. This pageant must be kept. The people would not consent to part with it.--Right: I understand you. You do, in spite of your grand theories, to which you would have heaven and earth to bend, you do know how to conform yourselves to the nature and circumstances of things. But when you were obliged to conform thus far to circumstances, you ought to have carried your submission farther, and to have made, what you were obliged to take, a proper instrument, and useful to its end. That was in your power. For instance, among many others, it was in your power to leave to your king the right of peace and war.--What! to leave to the executive magistrate the most dangerous of all prerogatives?--I know none more dangerous; nor any one more necessary to be so trusted. I do not say that this prerogative ought to be trusted to your king, unless he enjoyed other auxiliary trusts along with it, which he does not now hold. But, if he did possess them, hazardous as they are undoubtedly, advantages would arise from such a Constitution, more than compensating the risk. There is no other way of keeping the several potentates of Europe from intriguing distinctly and personally with the members of your Assembly, from intermeddling in all <b>your</b> <b>concerns,</b> and fomenting, in the heart of your country, the most pernicious of all factions,--factions in the interest and under the direction of foreign powers. From that worst of evils, thank God, we are still free. Your skill, if you had any, would be well employed to find out indirect correctives and controls upon this perilous trust. If you did not like those which in England we have chosen, your leaders might have exerted their abilities in contriving better. If it were necessary to exemplify the consequences of such an executive government as yours, in the management of great affairs, I should refer you to the late reports of M. de Montmorin to the National Assembly, and all the other proceedings relative to the differences between Great Britain and Spain. It would be treating your understanding with disrespect to point them out to you.|$|E
