500|$|According to Vig, the {{inspiration}} for the song was a newspaper article about a woman who had gone back to get revenge on an abusive husband, [...] "so {{we thought it would be}} cool to get a bit of retribution in there." [...] Vig also said he noted violence could also come from psychological stand point by seeing the story of a sado-masochistic couple who could not keep away from each other. Lyrically, Manson claimed [...] "'Vow' is about having feelings [...] You have to face <b>your</b> <b>feelings</b> of revenge and work out why you feel that way. It's about that conundrum when you're really angry but in reality you're in a pitiful state. Angry, twisted, but deep down, vulnerable." [...] During promotion for the song, Garbage joked to journalists that [...] "Vow" [...] was about John and Lorena Bobbitt.|$|E

It was written by Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds, Antonio Dixon and Patrick [...] "J. Que" [...] Smith and produced by the first two. The song was released by Republic Records on July 22, 2013, as the second single from the album. The song was initially written with the singer Beyoncé in mind, but she rejected it. [...] "Baby I" [...] is an R and pop song with drums, horns and a syncopated beat. It also contains an uptempo '90s-inspired beat. Lyrically, the song is {{about not being able}} to fully express <b>your</b> <b>feelings</b> towards someone you love. The song was well received by music critics who complimented the song's [...] "throwback" [...] sound while others praised Grande's vocals comparing to the singer Mariah Carey.|$|E

500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from <b>your</b> <b>feelings,</b> but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E

[...] The same day, Roberts gave two more exclusive stills to website Digital Spy; in one image, she was smelling roses, while, in the second, she was [...] "playing with a pair of shoes". The video was released on 30 November 2011. After the official release, Nadia Mendoza of the Daily Mail stated the video was a departure from her previous two videos (for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] and [...] "Lucky Day"), saying that it [...] "looks and sounds a lot more grown up as she teases viewers by stripping to her bra and frolicking in the shower." [...] Mendoza found that Roberts was [...] "becoming quite the chameleon" [...] and had [...] "trampled all over her innocent charm to create a sex siren", referencing her transformation throughout her videos. Katherine St Asaph, of Pop Dust, found that the video's low budget had had a negative effect. She interpreted scenes with Roberts repeated changes clothing positively, noting [...] "t works because of the lyrics what, besides other people, can mess with <b>your</b> <b>feelings</b> more than trying on clothes?" ...|$|E
500|$|News.com.au reported, [...] "According to {{evidence}} found by Wikipedia, multiple users with known scientology IP addresses had been 'openly editing (Scientology-related articles) from Church of Scientology equipment and apparently coordinating their activities'." [...] Sky News {{noted that the}} ban on Scientology computers applies to [...] "Any computer addresses 'owned or operated' by the Church or associates linked to it". Fox News Channel reported on the decision, [...] "The encyclopedia's administrators found that Scientology computers had been repeatedly changing more than 400 pages related to the Church, deleting negative references and adding positive ones. The volume of changes was overwhelming administrators' ability to reverse them, hence the block." [...] Fox News Channel described {{the decision by the}} Arbitration Committee to block Scientology-controlled IP addresses as [...] "an unprecedented move"; The Guardian similarly noted, [...] "whatever <b>your</b> <b>feelings</b> towards the world of Scientology, Wikipedia's decision to enact a blanket ban appears to be unprecedented." [...] InfoWorld wrote that edits by the Scientology organization were motivated by, [...] "a massive organized effort to make the CoS look good and/or counter the relentless public criticism that has shadowed the organization since the earliest days of the Net." [...] Wired News reported that the ban on the Scientology organization was triggered by [...] "repeated and deceptive editing of articles related to the controversial religion". The Los Angeles Times noted that the ban stemmed from [...] "the church's self-serving wiki-revisionism". Der Spiegel noted that skeptics doubted the efficacy of the ban on the Scientology-controlled IP addresses, and commented on the likelihood of individuals creating multiple account names.|$|E

[...] Cyrus explained it was about attempting to avoid paparazzi but they appeared, [...] "not going away like little annoying flies." [...] Cyrus was inspired to write [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] by her deceased fish, Lyric and Melody, who died when Cyrus was eleven years of age. She said the topic drifted drastically once she began writing. [...] "It's saying if there's someone you've loved but for some reason you can't love them anymore, you have to take <b>your</b> <b>feelings,</b> scoop them out, and put them {{at the bottom of the}} ocean." [...] Cyrus, Armato, James, Aaron Dudley co-wrote [...] "Wake Up America", a track about environmentalism. The song was directed towards [...] "the people in the back seat", children of today's generation; she said that, in the future, they would be the ones [...] "driving [...] Earth to what it's gonna be." [...] "It's the only one you got, so you gotta take care of it. And if you don't, there's gonna be, maybe not for you, right then, and your generation but your kids and their kids ...

2500|$|At that time, the {{imperial}} administration was selecting many officials to fill its posts, {{and there were}} many officials who received positions after lying about their lineages or past experiences. [...] Emperor Taizong issued an edict ordering the officials to admit to their falsehoods, promising to spare them if they did so before a deadline, but stating that they would be executed if their falsehoods were discovered after the deadline. [...] When some officials were indeed discovered after the deadline to have falsified their lineages or past experiences, Emperor Taizong ordered that they be executed, but Dai rejected the order and instead sentenced them to exile. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "I issued an edict that those who did not admit would be executed, but you, lord, sentenced them only to exile. [...] This made my words not stand up to the people. [...] Are you betraying justice, lord?" [...] Dai responded, [...] "If Your Imperial Majesty had killed them on the spot, there would be nothing I could do. [...] Now that you have sent them to the supreme court, I have to follow the law." [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "You, lord, are following the law, but you are making me lose credibility." [...] Dai responded, [...] "The law is how the empire can keep its credibility. [...] Your Imperial Majesty made your words based on <b>your</b> <b>feelings</b> at that time, and you declared executions based on your anger. [...] By repudiating your action and putting them {{in the hands of the}} law, you are showing that you can hold back your anger and respect the state's credibility.

[...] Emperor Taizong was pleased and responded, [...] "I now know that if there is a problem with the law, you, Duke, will correct it. [...] I do not worry any more." [...] It was said that Dai often spoke against Emperor Taizong's wishes in this way, and that as a result, people were not falsely convicted or punished while he was serving.|$|E
2500|$|At first, {{it might}} {{appear that the}} boyfriend is {{straight}} up busted. But it's more complicated than that, especially as you see Mýa and her girls engaged in their own energetic calisthenics, then (apparently) commanding their male admirers to hit the ground and perform push-ups, constructing a kind of reciprocal relationship that, for instance, Christina Aguilera's video for [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] cannot do, in its celebration of the most excellent boyfriend {{whose job is to}} be endlessly appreciative of his girlfriend's super-gloriousness (see also, Christina's video for Genie in a Bottle," [...] in which she also dances seductively with a group of girls for a group of boys). Director Diane Martel has done her share of conventionally alluring Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera videos, but here the terms have shifted. Mýa and her girls—in moves recalling Janet's—don't pretend to be charming or enticing. Instead, they present themselves as young women with demands and desires, proudly hard-bodied and self-possessed.Mýa can rock the midriff tops like any other pop star, but as always, she remains slightly offbeat, neither apologetic nor solicitous. Sexy and self-assured without being coy, she knows who she is and what she wants, and says it outright: [...] "What'cha gonna do / When you can't say no / And <b>your</b> <b>feelings</b> start to show? / Boy I really need to know / And how you gonna act?" [...] In Mýa's world, it's not the girl who turns emotional and unsure of herself when a question of integrity arises, but the more fragile, less stable boy. She warns,"There's no need to / Reminisce about the past, / Obviously, 'cause that shit did not last." [...] The video's imagery underlines her admonition, as the camera shoots up at her looking unafraid and austere, backed by her crew as the dust flies from their work-out: [...] "She don't know me / She's about to know me / I'm in your life / That's how it's gon' be." [...] And if you want to mess around, you're free to choose, but it will cost: [...] "If you want her back / You can take her back. / Cause game recognize game. / I could do the same thing." [...] And she does. At the end of the [...] video, Mýa and her dancers exit, leaving their audience dusty and on their own.|$|E
