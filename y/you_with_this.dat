25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E

Five {{said that they would}} take him first in the draft; Sid Gillman said of Manning, [...] "this is a pro quarterback". The Colts' scouts initially favored Leaf, but the team's management and coaches were gradually won over by Manning's attitude, particularly as Manning showed up prepared to a scheduled interview meeting with the Colts' staff while Leaf arrived late. Colts general manager Bill Polian who had the final say on the draft selection recalled Manning saying [...] "I'll leave <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> thought. If you take me, I promise you we will win a championship. If you don't, I promise I'll come back and kick your ass." ...|$|E
2500|$|A grieving Orbison {{threw himself}} into his work, collaborating with Bill Dees to write music for The Fastest Guitar Alive, a film that MGM had {{scheduled}} for him to star in as well. It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy. Orbison's character was a spy who stole, and had to protect and deliver, a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, and was outfitted with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line, [...] "I could kill <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> and play your funeral march at the same time", with—according to biographer Colin Escott—"zero conviction". Orbison {{was pleased with the}} film, although it proved to be a critical and box office flop. While MGM had included five films in his contract, no more were made.|$|E

2500|$|Seated {{again on}} the Chair of Estate, Elizabeth then took the Coronation Oath as {{administered}} by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the lengthy oath, the Queen swore to govern each of her countries according to their respective laws and customs, to mete out law and justice with mercy, to uphold Protestantism in the United Kingdom and protect the Church of England and preserve its bishops and clergy. She proceeded to the altar where she stated, [...] "The things which I have here promised, I will perform, and keep. So help me God", before kissing the Bible and putting the royal sign-manual to the oath as the Bible was returned to the Dean of Westminster. From him the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, James Pitt-Watson, took the Bible and presented it to the Queen again, saying, [...] "Our gracious Queen: to keep your Majesty ever mindful {{of the law and}} the Gospel of God as the Rule for the whole life and government of Christian Princes, we present <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> Book, the most valuable thing that this world affords. Here is Wisdom; This is the royal Law; These are the lively Oracles of God." [...] Elizabeth returned the book to Pitt-Watson, who placed it back with the Dean of Westminster.|$|E
