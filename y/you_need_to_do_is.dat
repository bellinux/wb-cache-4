2500|$|While {{sharing a}} flat with Barry Gibb in London in late 1967, Young was {{encouraged}} to write songs. Gibb taught him that [...] "there are no rules in song-writing, there is a structure, but what <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> find the 'hook', {{and it could be}} in the melody, the chorus, the words or even an identifiable riff, and that can be the difference in writing a hit record." [...] During 1968, back in Australia, Young wrote [...] "The Real Thing" [...] as a reaction against a Coca-Cola jingle, [...] "Coke is the real thing". Young envisaged the song as a low-key acoustic ballad (in the style of The Beatles [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever") and he originally intended it for his friend and fellow singer Ronnie Burns. Young was practising the song in a dressing room during taping of TV pop music show Uptight when pop producer and fellow Go-Set writer Ian Meldrum heard it. Meldrum (who was also manager for solo singer Russell Morris (ex-Somebody's Image) was greatly impressed by the song and immediately insisted that Young cut a demo of it for Morris. Under Meldrum's production and with the collaboration of engineer John L. Sayers the song was radically transformed into a seven-minute psychedelic epic, with a elaborately edited backing track performed by an all-star band including ex-Zoot guitarist Roger Hicks (who composed the acoustic guitar intro), members of Melbourne band The Groop and backing vocalist Maureen Elkner. Reportedly the most expensive single ever recorded in Australia up to that time, it became one of the biggest Australian pop hits of 1969, peaking at numberone in May and was numberone on Go-Set Top Records for the Year of 1969, and made Morris an immediate national star. It was later covered by Kylie Minogue and by Midnight Oil. Young's next song for Morris, [...] "The Girl That I Love", was released as a double-A-side with [...] "Part Three into Paper Walls" [...] (another epic extended production co-written by Morris and Young) which reached numberone in October.|$|E

5000|$|On May 16, {{the three}} leading Libertarian {{candidates}} (Johnson, Petersen and McAfee) {{participated in a}} debate held in Las Vegas, Nevada. Longtime Libertarian and entertainer Penn Jillette hosted the debate, which was aired by TheBlaze cable channel on May 20. The candidates were asked questions by other celebrities, including comedians Drew Carey, Carrot Top, Jeff Ross as well as Dee Snider of Twisted Sister and The Five co-host Greg Gutfeld. The debate focused on corporate greed, the War on Drugs and the government’s use of force, {{both at home and}} abroad. “The government is, by definition, force, and there are certain things <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> defense, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> courts, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> police. But beyond that, I don’t know if we have to use a lot of force to decide how people make their lawns look,” Jillette said. On the issues Johnson said, “The fact that we have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world, the War on Drugs is really about Black Lives Matter. With regard to our military interventions, I think that they have the unintended consequence of making things worse, not better,” Johnson said. “They’re probably fine human beings, but the two-party system takes the soul of a man or woman,” McAfee said. “That has to change. It is why we, as Americans, are so dissatisfied. Where will they turn? There’s only us.” ...|$|R
