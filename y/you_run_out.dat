2500|$|Harrison {{was noted}} as [...] "one {{of the most}} {{refreshing}} young faces to light up TV screens this new season." [...] Fox publicists issued press releases glossing over Harrison's deficient education and claiming for her a passion for Shakespeare, Voltaire, and Aristotle which she never possessed. Midway through its second season, Bracken's World was cancelled. Harrison said later that the studio wanted recognizable stars every week, instead of allowing the regular cast to grow as an ensemble, {{as was the case}} with shows such as [...] [...] "Had they done it like a continuing drama and focused on the regular characters, it would have lasted longer," [...] she said. [...] "NBC, however, wanted a one-hour contained show, so they would stock each episode with a big guest star. After a while, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of story.".|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{would happen}} to you, Quox, if <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of gasoline?" [...] inquired Shaggy, who did not like this attack upon his friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{believe that}} unknown man was entirely to blame. It {{was a shame}} the way Gulligan carried on. As soon as <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> he turned upon me for not {{stopping}} you, and we had some pretty hot words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, a wise lady! A {{reasonable}} lady! But {{you will}} be cold before you get thither. There will be a frost ere morn. So, when I saw <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out,</b> I caught up something to put over you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The jemadar {{shouted to}} his men: [...] "Search the compound; they can't be far off; some of <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> to the plain; they can't {{have got a}} hundred yards away; besides, our guards out there will catch them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Isaac Marvelling. [...] "I heard <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of {{the yard}} behind the store right after I had called in Jackson {{to tell him about}} the robbery. We both saw you jump the fence and skip off in this direction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes you will, dear," [...] Dorothy declared. [...] "The piglet is gone, and <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of {{the room}} when Jellia opened the door. So, if you are innocent, Eureka, you must tell the Princess how you came {{to be in her}} room, and what has become of the piglet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No one," [...] {{answered}} Ozma. [...] "Your actions alone accuse you. The {{fact is that}} I left {{my little}} pet in my dressing-room lying asleep upon the table; and you must have stolen in without my knowing it. When next the door was opened <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> and hid yourself--and the piglet was gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you madcap!" [...] exclaimed {{the elder}} girl, {{when the other}} entered. [...] "When will you quit {{frightening}} us this way? It is two hours since <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> in that rag of an old dress and Marie's hat. Mamma has been so alarmed. She sent Louis in the auto {{to try to find}} you. You are a bad, thoughtless Puss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is all the}} same!--Stella, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> to the garden--by that door, you child!' And then it {{all came}} out to the two fresh auditors, who listened with conviction. 'And now,' {{concluded}} Robina, 'there is not a place where he can so much as speak to her! What shall we do to get them away?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have got}} an ax and a rifle, but if <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of grub, Graham, the section-hand on the {{railroad}} will put me wise," [...] said Peter. [...] "Tom's a white man and his post's {{not far from the}} spot we crossed the line. The trapper who lived here is dead and I reckon nobody but Tom and me knows about the shack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll just do as I tell you, my girl!" [...] said Irma firmly, {{and with}} a snap of her lean jaws. [...] "By the Holy Virgin, child! Are you going to disobey your mother now? God will punish you, you know, {{if you go on}} like that. Go at once as I tell <b>you.</b> <b>Run</b> <b>out</b> by this door here. No one will see you, you will {{overtake}} Béla before he is half-way down the street, and then you must just bring him back. That's all." ...|$|E
50|$|Being deathblown was not {{the only}} way to die in Roma Victor. Other forms of dying {{included}} drowning in a river if <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of vigour whilst still swimming, bleeding to death after receiving a fatal wound without proper medical treatment, and suicide. If a player wished to commit suicide in the game, they could do so at any time. One attribute (muscle, vision, agility, dexterity, intuition, or stamina) would be completely zeroed.|$|R

6000|$|... "For you see, Nigel," [...] {{the captain}} had said, [...] "it's all very well to use breech-loaders when you've got towns and {{railways}} and suchlike to supply you wi' cartridges, but when you've got to cruise in out-o'-the-way waters, there's nothin' like the old style. It's not difficult to carry a few thousand percussion-caps an' a bullet-mould about wi' you wherever you go. As to powder, why, you'll come across that 'most everywhere, an' lead too; and, for the matter o' that, if your {{life depended on it}} you could shove a handful of gravel or a pen-knife or tooth-pick into your gun an' blaze away, but with a breech-loader, if <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> o' cartridges, where are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did not cry out, because I {{had already}} {{made up my mind}} that it was better not to arouse you from sleep {{whatever}} happened, as, had <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out,</b> you might have been killed, and I thought it likely that their object would be, if you offered no resistance, to take you a prisoner, in which case I trusted that I might later on hope to free you. As my lord knows, I am a good swimmer. I let myself sink, and when well below the surface soon got rid of the rope which bound me, and which was, indeed, but hastily twisted round my arms. I came up to the surface as noiselessly as possible, and after taking a long breath dived and swam under water as far as I could. When I came up the ship was so far away that there was little fear of their seeing me; however, I dived again and again until in perfect safety.|$|E
6000|$|... [Here the lightning-rod man sent {{up another}} call for me. I {{went down in}} a state of mind {{bordering}} on impatience. He said he would rather have died than interrupt me, but when he was employed to do a job, and that job was expected to be done in a clean, workmanlike manner, and when it was finished and fatigue urged him to seek the rest and recreation he stood so much in need of, and he was about to do it, but looked up and saw at a glance that all the calculations had been a little out, and if a thunder-storm were to come up, and that house, which he felt a personal interest in, stood there with nothing on earth to protect it but sixteen lightning-rods--"Let us have peace!" [...] I shrieked. [...] "Put up a hundred and fifty! Put some on the kitchen! Put a dozen on the barn! Put a couple on the cow! Put one on the cook!--scatter them all over the persecuted place till it looks like a zinc-plated, spiral-twisted, silver-mounted canebrake! Move! Use up all the material you can get your hands on, and when <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of lightning-rods put up ramrods, cam-rods, stair-rods, piston-rods--anything that will pander to your dismal appetite for artificial scenery, and bring respite to my raging brain and healing to my lacerated soul!" [...] Wholly unmoved--further than to smile sweetly--this iron being simply turned back his wrist-bands daintily, and said he would now proceed to hump himself. Well, all that was nearly three hours ago. It is questionable whether I am calm enough yet to write on the noble theme of political economy, but I cannot resist the desire to try, for it is the one subject that is nearest to my heart and dearest to my brain of all this world's philosophy.] ...|$|E

5000|$|Seventeen years later, an ad {{appeared}} in the Los Angeles Times classifieds which {{caught the attention of}} the Graham family as well as KFI disc jockey Geoff Edwards, who read it on the air: [...] "DEAREST ROBIN <b>You</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of gas on the Hollywood Frwy. A man in a Corvette pulled over to help. You've not been seen of since. It's been 17 years, but it's always just yesterday. Still looking for you (signed) THE ECHO PARK DUCKS." [...] It turned out that Al Medrano, a friend still living in the neighborhood, simply wanted to express that Graham had not been forgotten.|$|R

2500|$|The Associated Press {{quoted the}} National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as saying it had [...] "...received 148 {{complaints}} regarding Pontiac Fieros catching fire including reports of six injuries....

David Hudgens, a GM spokesman in Detroit... said, 'If <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of oil, and then that coupled with some aggressive driving, perhaps, and maybe not changing the oil very often, {{you end up with a}} broken rod, and that's where the connecting rod came in; it is still the owner's responsibility to check the oil.'
