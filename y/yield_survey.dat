EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2005, Washington field enumerators successfully showed that handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers could be utilized for the Agricultural Resource Management Survey Phase II and for the June Area Survey. Next, the Washington Field Office and the Research and Development Division investigated if GPS receivers could assist field enumerators with the Wheat Objective <b>Yield</b> <b>Survey.</b> Currently, Wheat Objective <b>Yield</b> <b>Survey</b> field enumerators go to specified areas of the sampled wheat fields, lay out two objective yield units and record various crop counts. Every month until the fields are harvested, the enumerator returns to the same units and records crop counts. Sometimes a field enumerator has difficulty finding the same location again or a different field enumerator may need to enumerate the field and is unable to find the same location. This costs NASS in field enumeration time, and in those instances where the units were unable to be found, the data quality suffers...|$|E

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In the fall of 2003, the North Carolina Field Office (NC FO) and the Research and Development Division studied the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) for the 2004 Cotton Objective <b>Yield</b> <b>Survey</b> (COY). The NC field enumerators were provided with PDAs to record COY data on them instead of on paper forms. The goals {{of the study were}} to develop a user-friendly data collection instrument to operate on a PDA which field enumerators could successfully record COY data into and securely transmit the data to the NC FO. This project also investigated if using PDAs would improve the data collection process, provide the collected data to the office staff quicker, improve data quality, and be cost effective. The NC FO developed a process for field enumerators to collect COY data using PDAs. Each NC FO field enumerator team (composed of two people) was supplied with a PDA. Training went fairly smoothly, {{despite the fact that the}} majority of field enumerators had never used a computer prior to the training session. Data collection was virtually problem-free. Data transmission, however, had some problems. If PDA data collection use continues, the data transmission process will require streamlining, while at the same time maintaining NASS security standards. After the data collection phase, field enumerators stated that they would prefer a device that could handle dirt and rain. Overall, the field enumerators were able to record the data onto the PDA and securely transmit the data to the field office for processing.

The rubber seed <b>yield</b> <b>survey</b> was then used as a predictor for potential rubber seed oil production, both locally and regionally, and calculates the potential biodiesel production from the rubber seed oil. The results indicate that rubber seed yield is directly linked with tree age and size, and that elevation does not affect rubber seed yield within this region. Seed yield varied greatly (3 -fold) between the two cultivars studied.

40|$|AbstractEarly warning {{information}} on crop yield and production are very crucial for both farmers and decision-makers. In this study, we assess {{the skill and}} {{the reliability of the}} Integrated Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (ICCYF), a regional crop yield forecasting tool, at different temporal (i. e. 1 – 3 months before harvest) and spatial (i. e. census agricultural region – CAR, provincial and national) scales across Canada. A distinct feature of the ICCYF is that it generates in-season yield forecasts well {{before the end of the}} growing season and provides a probability distribution of the forecasted yields. The ICCYF integrates climate, remote sensing derived vegetation indices, soil and crop information through a physical process-based soil water budget model and statistical algorithms. The model was evaluated against <b>yield</b> <b>survey</b> data of spring wheat, barley and canola during the 1987 – 2012 period. Our results showed that the ICCYF performance exhibited a strong spatial pattern at both CAR and provincial scales. Model performance was better from regions with a good coverage of climate stations and a high percentage of cropped area. On average, the model coefficient of determination at CAR level was 66 %, 51 % and 67 %, for spring wheat, barley and canola, respectively. Skilful forecasts (i. e. model efficiency index> 0) were achieved in 70 % of the CARs for spring wheat and canola, and 43 % for barley (low values observed in CAR with small harvested area). At the provincial scale, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of the September forecasts ranged from 7 % to 16 %, 7 % to 14 %, and 6 % to 14 % for spring wheat, barley and canola, respectively. For forecasts at the national scale, MAPE values (i. e. 8 %, 5 % and 9 % for the three respective crops) were considerably smaller than the corresponding historical coefficients of variation (i. e. 17 %, 10 % and 17 % for the three crops). Overall, the ICCYF performed better for spring wheat than for canola and barley at all the three spatial scales. Skilful forecasts were achieved by mid-August, giving a lead time of about 1 month before harvest and about 3 – 4 months before the final release of official survey results. As such, the ICCYF could be used as a complementary tool for the traditional survey method, especially in areas where it is not practical to conduct such surveys...|$|E

The broader objective includes improving farm resilience and profitability in the U. S. Corn Belt region by transforming existing climate/weather data into usable knowledge and tools for the agricultural community. ^ The specific tasks of this research are: (1) Build a high-resolution (4 km, daily) agro-climatic dataset using a Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS). (2) Estimate regional corn yield across the Corn Belt with crop models and the agro-climatic dataset. (3) Evaluate the impacts of climate variability due to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on corn yield in the Corn Belt. ^ Accordingly, a high-resolution (4 km, 1979 - 2012, daily) agro-climatic dataset across the U. S. Corn Belt has been built using the North America Land Data Assimilation System version 2 (NLDAS 2) product. This newly developed dataset includes daily maximum/minimum temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, soil moisture, and soil temperature at four soil depths (0 - 10 cm, 10 - 40 cm, 40 - 100 cm, and 100 - 200 cm). Validations indicate strong agreement between this dataset and field measurements. The agro-climatic dataset was then used with a Hybrid-Maize crop model to estimate regional corn yield at grid scale. The crop model was first validated at the field and county scale and found to consistently overestimate yields at the county scale. This was attributed to the optimum field conditions considered in the model and the overall uncertainties. Comparison with NASS <b>yield</b> <b>survey</b> data indicates a 0. 6 multiplicative factor provides good agreement with actual yields, and is recommended for county-scale simulations. ^ Following the field/county scale model tests, a modeling framework was developed to simulate gridded crop yields. Results indicate that integrating spatial climatic information improved the regional performance of the Hybrid Maize model and this agro-climatic dataset shows good potential for developing agro-meteorological related applications. Finally, the impacts of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on observed and simulated corn yields were examined. As a result, La Niña shows a significant negative impact on corn yield in the Corn Belt while the impact from El Niño is insignificant. It also has been found that La Niña correlates with relatively late planting dates in the Corn Belt. Based on a crop model study, the results indicate that for some counties, under optimal conditions, late planting dates can mitigate the negative impacts from the La Niña phase. ^ Based on the studies above, reliable performance of the Hybrid Maize crop model and superior data ability of the new agro-climatic dataset have good potential to simulate regional corn yield with climate projections. The significant impacts of ENSO on corn yield indicate that advance ENSO warning may benefit field management in the Corn Belt. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} methodological {{lessons from}} experience in estimating yield and incremental production {{benefits from the}} Malawi Farm Input Subsidy Programme (FISP). Critical issues raised concern difficulties in obtaining reliable estimates of smallholder maize production, areas and yields with and without fertiliser. Comparison of methods and findings across {{a number of studies}} suggests that there is a significant upward bias (or overestimate) in area estimates obtained by relying on information from farmers on the areas of their crops. Use of GPS technology appears to provide an affordable but more reliable alternative method for measurement of plot areas, but further investigation is advisable regarding its accuracy and possible bias in measuring small plot areas. Estimates of yield from information on total plot harvests are affected by bias in area measurement and, for given estimates of production per plot, over-estimates of area lead to under-estimates of yield. However these yield estimates are also dependent upon the accuracy of farmer estimates of plot production, and these are potentially prone to (a) errors in farmer estimates of production and harvest, (b) unwillingness of farmers to reveal total harvest, and (c) errors in reporting harvests in standard units. While (b) is likely to lead to under-estimates of harvest and yield, (a) and (c) might lead to over- or under- estimates of harvest. It is not clear what overall bias this might lead to. The main alternative method of yield estimation (enumerators harvesting yield sub plots) is costly and widely considered to lead to over-estimates of yield. Estimates of crop yield response to fertiliser application are not affected by bias in plot area estimation if yield is estimated from reported whole plot harvest. However fertiliser responses are over- (under-) estimated if whole plot harvest is over-(under-) estimated by farmers. Fertiliser responses are also over-estimated if yield sub plots over-estimate yield, and this is exacerbated if plot areas are over-estimated, as this leads to an under-estimate of fertiliser application rate. Over-estimates of fertiliser yield responses are also likely if analysis does not allow for the effects of early planting, plant density, seed type, number of weedings and early weeding: these management practices raise yields but tend to be correlated with fertiliser use. Analysis of subsidy impacts needs to separate out the effects of these practices and also estimate how far management practices are changed by receipt of subsidised inputs. The following recommendations are highlighted regarding area and <b>yield</b> <b>survey</b> methods: •	IHS 2 estimates of crop areas and yields should be treated with caution as they are likely to have over-estimated areas and under-estimated yields •	Further work is needed to investigate the accuracy of GPS area measurement for small plots, but GPS methods are preferable to farmer estimates of plot areas •	Continued work is needed to develop accurate methods for estimating plot yields •	Investigation of fertiliser yield responses may need to rely on formal trials to address problems of multi-collinearity across management practices •	Due attention should be paid to both inter cropped and pure stands in analysis and reporting of yield and area estimates...|$|E

The model parameters are estimated using data on nominal Treasury <b>yields,</b> <b>survey</b> forecasts of inflation, and inflation swap rates.

Our simulation study shows that when design variables {{are not related to}} nonresponse, the cross-classified method <b>yields</b> <b>survey</b> estimates that have bias and root mean squared error similar to the estimates weighted by reciprocals of the response propensities and the response propensity stratification method.

Greater crop production {{will be required}} to support both an increase in biofuel use and a forecasted doubling of global food demand by 2050. An improved understanding of yield potential and realistic estimates of the magnitude and spatial variability of the gap between actual yield and yield potentials are critical to achieving maximum crop production. This study examines near-term yield potentials and gaps of maize (Zea mays L.) yield data over the years of 2006 to 2011 from two sources: university crop variety trials and the United States Department of Agriculture <b>yield</b> <b>surveys.</b> <b>Yield</b> potentials are analyzed across 32 states through a compiled database of 129, 499 trial maize hybrid entries. From the database, 1, 102 direct, irrigation-specific, year-to-year, county-to-county yield comparisons are made across 27 states. These 32 and 27 states comprise nearly all United States maize production— 99 % and 97 %, respectively. Trial yield is calculated as the 90 th percentile of hybrid yields in a given county in a given year, and farm yield is the USDA-reported county-level yield in that same trial-performing county in that same year. Analysis of the median yield gap values in each state shows a yield gap of 13 % to 53 % in rainfed maize and a yield gap of 16 % to 39 % in irrigated maize. The magnitude of these differences between farming and trial yields indicates that maize yields in the United States, particularly rainfed, have considerable room for improvement. Additionally, the 40 % range of median rainfed yield gap values and the 23 % range of median irrigated yield gap values suggest that the yield gap varies greatly between states. The results of this study are expected to support the production of more accurate biofuel crop projections and identify where yields might be increased, thereby avoiding further land conversion to cropland while reaching the goal of increasing biofuel production and sustaining ample food production...|$|R

Data collected were analyzed using simple statistics and the Tobit model. Results revealed a partial adoption of improved management practices {{such as the use}} of quality seeds, modern farmers' farm implements, plant density, rate and time of fertilizer application and herbicides...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the UK {{interest rate}} term structure {{over the period}} since October 1992, when the United Kingdom adopted an explicit inflation target, using an affine term structure model estimated using both government bond <b>yields</b> and <b>survey</b> data. The model imposes no-arbitrage restrictions across nominal and real yields, which enables interest rates to be decomposed into expected real policy rates, expected inflation, real term premia and inflation risk premia. The model is used to shed light on major developments over the period, including the impact of Bank of England independence and the low real bond yield 'conundrum'. Inflation expectations Inflation risk premia Affine term structure model...|$|R
