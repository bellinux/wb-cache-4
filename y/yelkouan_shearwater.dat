50|$|The <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater,</b> Levantine shearwater or Mediterranean shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan) is a {{medium-sized}} shearwater in the seabird family Procellariidae.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} a nesting {{site of the}} European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae), Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), and the <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> (Puffinus yelkouan).|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} the Minorcan colony {{concluded}} that at least in these westernmost birds, genetic variation was extremely low, suggesting that the <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> may have suffered a marked population decline historically and thus, while not threatened judging from its absolute numbers, it could be vulnerable to adverse effects of inbreeding.|$|E

50|$|<b>Yelkouan</b> <b>shearwaters</b> breed on {{islands and}} coastal cliffs {{in the eastern}} and central Mediterranean. Most winter in that sea, but small numbers enter the Atlantic in late summer. This species nests in burrows which are only visited at night to avoid {{predation}} by large gulls.|$|R
50|$|Puffinus nestori is an extinct seabird in the petrel family. Its fossil remains, {{dating from}} the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene, {{were found on the}} island of Ibiza of the Balearic {{archipelago}} in the western Mediterranean. It was speculated that it was the direct ancestor of the Mediterranean shearwater (now split into Balearic and <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwaters).</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> {{has a more}} contrasted {{appearance}} {{than the}} Balearic shearwater with which its winter range overlaps, since the latter species is brown above and dirty white below. It {{is very similar to}} the black-and-white Manx shearwater of the Atlantic, and stray birds out of their usual range are very difficult to identify with certainty.|$|E
50|$|Syrna (Σύρνα) or Sirna is a {{small island}} about 4 km2 in area to the {{south-east}} of Astypalaia in the Dodecanese group of Greek islands near the south-west coast of Turkey. It is mostly covered with juniper and garrigue scrub. The few inhabitants raise stock, catch fish and practice arable agriculture. The island is important for migrant and breeding seabirds and raptors, including Cory's shearwater, <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> and Eleonora's falcon.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} less contrasted plumage, this species {{is very similar}} to the Atlantic Manx shearwater and the <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> found {{elsewhere}} in the Mediterranean. There exists at least one mixed breeding colony of Balearic and yelkouan shearwaters, on Minorca, and the species winter ranges overlap in the Central Mediterranean; for scientific purposes at least, a combination of morphological characteristics and DNA sequence data is suggested to identify the species (Genovart et al. 2005).|$|E
50|$|The {{island has}} a karst {{landscape}} supporting sclerophyllous shrubland. Some limited afforestation with pine trees {{has been carried}} out. The sand-dunes at Santa Maria bay retain some native vegetation, including Vitex and Tamarix trees. The island {{has been identified as}} an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports 50-80 breeding pairs of <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwaters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The iċ-Ċnus to tal-Bardan Cliffs Important Bird Area {{comprises}} a 19 ha linear {{strip of}} cliffed coastline at Munxar and Sannat, {{on the southern}} coast of the island of Gozo, in the Maltese archipelago of the Mediterranean Sea. Its steep and rugged cliffs rise from sea level to a height of 128 m. It was identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports 30 breeding pairs of <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwaters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rdum tal-Madonna Important Bird Area {{comprises}} a 4 ha linear {{strip of}} cliffed coastline about 200 m long near L-Aħrax tal-Mellieħa, at the north-western {{end of the}} island of Malta, in the Maltese archipelago of the Mediterranean Sea. Its rugged cliffs rise from sea level, where there is much rock debris, to a height of 25 m. It was identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports 500 breeding pairs of <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwaters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The shearwaters {{form part}} of the Procellariidae family, a {{widespread}} group containing nearly 100 species of medium to large seabirds. They have long, narrow wings and the characteristic “tubenose”. The large genus Puffinus includes several species formerly considered to be subspecies of the Manx shearwater, including the <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater,</b> Balearic shearwater, Hutton's shearwater, black-vented shearwater, fluttering shearwater, Townsend's shearwater and the Hawaiian shearwater. [...] Of these, the Hawaiian and possibly Townsend's shearwaters seem to be most {{closely related to the}} Manx shearwater.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was long}} {{regarded}} a subspecies of the Manx shearwater (see there {{for more on}} the Puffinus puffinus superspecies); following an initial split it was held to be a subspecies of the [...] "Mediterranean shearwater" [...] (Sibley & Monroe 1990) for nearly ten more years, until it was resolved to be a distinct species, separate from the <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> (Wink et al. 1993, Heidrich et al. 1998, Sangster et al. 2002). It is the last taxon of the puffinus complex that was recognized as a separate entity.|$|E
50|$|This is a gregarious species, {{which can}} be seen in large numbers from boats or headlands, {{especially}} in autumn. The <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> feeds on fish and molluscs. It follows fishing ships when offal is being thrown. It is under some threat from the development of holiday resorts near its breeding sites, and also from animals such as rats and cats. On Le Levant Island, one of its major breeding locations, cats kill thousands of birds each year and it is estimated that this may lead to local extinction in several decades.|$|E
50|$|Ta' Ċenċ Cliffs is a 20 ha linear {{strip of}} cliffed {{coastline}} at Sannat, {{on the southern}} coast of the island of Gozo, Malta, in the Mediterranean Sea. The area consists of garrigue and steep and rugged cliffs, which rise from sea level to a height of 120 m. The cliffs are identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support 800-1000 breeding pairs of Cory's shearwaters and 150-300 pairs of <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwaters.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> {{appears to}} belong to a group of Mediterranean and {{adjacent}} Atlantic shearwaters which includes the Balearic shearwater and one to three prehistorically extinct taxa, Hole's and possibly also lava shearwater as well as an undescribed population of uncertain distinctness from Menorca. The two living Mediterranean lineages had probably separated {{before the end of the}} Pliocene (c. 2 million years ago), as indicated by molecular differences and the putative direct ancestor of the Balearic shearwater, the Ibizan fossil Puffinus nestori from the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene.|$|E
50|$|It {{appears to}} belong to a group of Mediterranean and {{adjacent}} Atlantic species which includes the <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> (Austin 1996) and one to three prehistorically extinct taxa, Holes and possibly also Olsons shearwater and an undescribed form of unclear distinctness from Menorca (Alcover 2001). Holes shearwater may be the closest known relative of P. mauretanicus. The two living Mediterranean lineages had probably separated {{before the end of the}} Pliocene (c. 2 mya), as indicated by molecular differences and the Ibizan fossil Puffinus nestori from the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene, which may have been the direct ancestor of the present species (Heidrich et al. 1998).|$|E
5000|$|The {{conditions}} that restricted {{the establishment of}} human settlements on Montecristo have favoured the preservation of its flora and fauna. Animals and plants once found throughout the Mediterranean still live on the island. Of particular interest are the giant heather formations covering the valley floors and several thousand-year-old oaks that manage to survive at the highest altitudes. Also interesting are the Montecristo viper (Vipera aspis hugyi, a subspecies also present in southern Italy, and today considered introduced by humans) and Discoglossus sardus, an amphibian found only {{in a couple of}} islands in Tuscany and Sardinia. An endemic subspecies of lizard, Podarcis muralis calabresiae, thrives on the island. Montecristo is also a resting place for thousands of migratory birds and is home to large colonies of seabirds (particularly relevant the <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater,</b> [...] critically endangered on the island). The island also hosts the only Italian population of wild goats. The sea environment is quite rich: there are seagrass meadows, sea anemones, sea fans, corals and moonfishes. Until the 1970s the Mediterranean monk seal was also to be found, a critically endangered species that has become extremely rare in Italian waters. Endemic species include the plant Limonium Montis-christi, the invertebrate Oxychilus oglasicola (snail of Monte Cristo), also present on the islet of Scola, near Pianosa, and the reptile Podarcis muralis calabresiae.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Yelkouan</b> <b>shearwaters</b> are 30-38 cm long, with a 76-89 cm wingspan. It has the {{typically}} [...] "shearing" [...] {{flight of}} the genus, dipping {{from side to side}} on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. This bird looks like a flying cross, with its wing held at right angles to the body, and it changes from very dark brown to white as the dark upperparts and paler undersides are alternately exposed as it travels low over the sea.|$|R

40|$|International audienceDomestic {{cats are}} one of the most {{widespread}} predators on islands worldwide and are responsible for numerous reductions and extinctions of species on islands. The three main islands of the Hyères Archipelago house one of the largest colonies of the Mediterranean endemic <b>Yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> Puffinus yelkouan that has recently been up-listed by the IUCN to ‘vulnerable’. The main objectives of this study were to assess the diet of cats and to study the effect of cat predation on <b>Yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> populations at the archipelago scale. The diet of cats was studied using scat analyses according to years and seasons for each island. Simultaneously, <b>Yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> breeding success was monitored during a period of 8 years on Port-Cros and Porquerolles, and 3 years on Le Levant. Descriptive analyses and GLM were used to compare data gathered on each island. At the archipelago scale, cats preyed strongly upon introduced mammals and shearwaters. Surprisingly, large differences appeared in cats’ diet according to the island considered. The <b>Yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> was the primary prey of cats on Le Levant, but secondary on Port-Cros and Porquerolles. Cat predation was mainly concentrated during the shearwater prospecting period, when birds arrive at the colonies and look for a mate (if they are not already paired) and a burrow before breeding. Consequently cat impact was low on shearwater breeding success. However, this study demonstrates that the cat management conducted on Port-Cros was positive for fledging success. The successful cat eradication on Port-Cros supports the need to continue working for <b>Yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> conservation with Le Levant as a priority, because this is where the colonies are largest and predation on Yelkouan shearwaters is very hig...|$|E
40|$|The {{ship rat}} (Rattus rattus) was {{introduced}} 1, 500 {{years ago to}} the Zembra Archipelago (Tunisia) and was eradicated in October-November 2009 on two of its islands, Zembretta and Zembrettina. This eradication was performed 2 years after {{the discovery of a}} small colony of Yelkouan shearwaters (Puffinus yelkouan), a species recently up-listed to the vulnerable IUCN extinction risk category. For 2 years before and 3 years after rat eradication, the Zembretta <b>Yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> breeding colony was checked yearly {{at the end of the}} breeding season. The number of recorded breeding pairs reaching 176 and 145, respectively, increases of 10. 4 and 8. 5 -fold two and 3 years after rat eradication. This experiment shows that eradication of an ancient introduced ship rat population has dramatically improved the Zembretta <b>Yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> breeding population very quickly. This result suggests that managing even long-introduced populations might well be fruitful...|$|E
50|$|The Xlendi Bay to Wardija Point Cliffs Important Bird Area {{comprises}} a 32 ha, linear {{strip of}} cliffed coastline {{on the southern}} coast of the island of Gozo in the Maltese archipelago of the Mediterranean Sea. It extends from Wardija Point in the west for about 3 km to Xlendi Bay in the east, with the steep and rugged cliffs rising from sea level to a height of 105 m. It was identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports 350-500 breeding pairs of Cory's shearwaters and 30-50 pairs of vulnerable <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwaters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Malta-Gozo Channel Important Bird Area {{lies in the}} Maltese {{archipelago}} of the Mediterranean Sea. It encompasses some 123 km2 of the Gozo Channel, {{between the}} islands of Malta and Gozo, {{as well as the}} waters up to 7 km offshore from Rdum Tal-Madonna in Malta to the east and immediately offshore from Ta' Ċenċ Cliffs in Gozo to the west. It was identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports about 1300 breeding pairs of Cory's shearwaters and 600-1000 pairs of <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> as well as up to 1000 ferruginous ducks on passage during the migration season.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is under}} severe {{threat from the}} {{development}} of holiday resorts near its breeding sites, which can destroy or alter their natural breeding habitat (e.g. producing light pollution around nesting colonies [...] ), and also from introduced animals such as cats and rats. The discovery of <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwaters</b> in the Minorcan colony suggests that hybridization may also pose a problem (Genovart et al. 2005); the Balearic shearwater is considered critically endangered with extinction by the IUCN. Recent models estimate a mean decrease of 7.4% per year and a mean extinction time of 40.4 years. This equates to an ongoing decline of more than 80% {{over the next three}} generations (54 years).|$|R
40|$|Introduced predators on {{islands are}} {{responsible}} for numerous native species extirpations and extinctions. Predation by cats is particularly detrimental to seabirds and cat control or eradication is generally the best option to reduce their negative impacts on native fauna. However, potential cascading effects, such as mesopredator release effect, need to be monitored after cat removal. In Port-Cros Island, a cat control campaign was undertaken to eliminate the strong and recurrent threat from feral cat predation to the small <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> Puffinus yelkouan population, without harming a neutered domestic cat population. To evaluate the conservation value of this campaign for an island endemic and endangered species, the diet and impact of the remaining domestic cats were studied through scat analysis and trap success. Moreover, to evaluate {{the recovery of the}} seabird population and detect any potential mesopredator release effect, shearwater and rat populations were monitored before, alongside and after the cat control. Only live traps were used, and most cats were trapped {{in the first year of}} cat eradication. The last incidence of cat predation on the <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> occurred the following year. The recovery of the shearwater population, occurring the first year of cat control, was mainly attributable to the settlement of new breeders in the colony. Rat population dynamics fluctuated widely but, even though the interactions between rats and shearwaters at breeding cavities increased, no evidence of rat predation on shearwaters was recorded. Thus, cat control on Port-Cros Island was a success for native species conservation, proving that such management strategy can induce an increase in the population of the endemic species, here the <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater,</b> without any evidence of a mesopredator release effect...|$|E
40|$|Mortality in {{long line}} {{fisheries}} {{is a global}} threat {{to a number of}} bird species. In Malta, indications point to Cory’s Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) and <b>Yelkouan</b> <b>Shearwater</b> (Puffinus yelkouan) as the main seabird by-catch species. This study was conducted as part of the EU LIFE <b>Yelkouan</b> <b>Shearwater</b> Project {{to assess the impact of}} the Maltese fishery on seabird populations. A questionnaire was designed to evaluate the awareness of the Maltese fishers about the project and to undertake a preliminary assessment of seabird by-catch by the fishers. A total of 146 fishers were interviewed. The fishing activity responsible for the highest seabird by-catch was found to be bottom long lining, with each fisher who uses this gear catching an average of 1. 41 Calonectris diomedea annually with minimal catches of Puffinus yelkouan. As these results are based on questionnaires and not direct data, they need to be considered with caution. However it does suggest that the issue of by-catch could have a significant effect on mortality rates of shearwaters, particularly C. diomedea and this should be further investigated.

40|$|Nest and mate {{choice is}} {{important}} in seabirds, influencing reproductive performance as both nest:site and partner quality varies. The <b>Yelkouan</b> <b>Shearwater</b> Puffinus yelkouan nests mainly in pre-existing cavities {{and to a lesser}} extent in cavities it excavates. We have monitored breeding colonies of the <b>Yelkouan</b> <b>Shearwater</b> on two islands of the Hyeres archipelago, south-east of France, for nine years to analyse nest-cavity and mate selection, to evaluate nest-cavity and mate fidelity, and to investigate their relationships with reproductive performance. Yelkouan Shearwaters selected nest-cavities providing a high degree of concealment and protection. Reproductive performance and fidelity to cavity were highest in deep cavities with a winding tunnel and a steep slope around the entrance. Mating was assortative for bill and tarsus measurements. High rates of return to the same cavity (94. 7 %) and mate (95. 5 %) were recorded. Fidelity to nest-cavity was highest when breeding succeeded the previous year (fidelity rate: 97. 3 % in successful breeders vs. 87. 8 % in unsuccessful breeders) and was most likely to result in successful breeding the same year (breeding success: 67. 5 % in faithful breeders vs. 43. 8 % in movers). The rate of divorce was low (4. 5 %), did not differ between islands and was not associated with breeding performance. However, breeding success increased by 22. 2 +/- 9. 9 % after mate change following a divorce or the absence of a previous mate. Such high rates of nest-cavity and mate fidelity could indicate a good population status with breeding habitat, food resource and mates of good quality...|$|E
40|$|Correct species {{identification}} {{is a crucial}} issue in systematics with key implications for prioritising conservation effort. However, it can be particularly challenging in recently diverged species due to their strong similarity and relatedness. In such cases, species identification requires multiple and integrative approaches. In this study we used multiple criteria, namely plumage colouration, biometric measurements, geometric morphometrics, stable isotopes analysis (SIA) and genetics (mtDNA), to identify the species of 107 bycatch birds from two closely related seabird species, the Balearic (Puffinus mauretanicus) and <b>Yelkouan</b> (P. <b>yelkouan)</b> <b>shearwaters.</b> Biometric measurements, stable isotopes and genetic data produced two stable clusters of bycatch birds matching the two study species, as indicated by reference birds of known origin. Geometric morphometrics was excluded as a species identification criterion since the two clusters were not stable. The combination of plumage colouration, linear biometrics, stable isotope and genetic criteria was crucial to infer the species of 103 of the bycatch specimens. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContrasting to {{the overall}} {{oligotrophic}} Mediterranean Sea, the north-western basin is characterised by high productivity and marked by seasonality, which induces spatiotemporal heterogeneity of habitat. Cetaceans and seabirds are expected to perceive this repetition of the seasonal cycle and to anticipate the recurrent variability of their environment. Because phenology imposes strong constraints over marine predators, especially through reproduction, we expected them to exhibit variations in their habitat preferences over seasons. Indeed, during reproductive period, marine predators have to face their own needs and those of their young, while out of this period, they can focus on maximising their own survival only. We therefore hypothesised that some species would change their habitat preferences to exploit the most favourable habitat during each season, while other species might accommodate the same habitat all year-round, for example thanks {{to the use of}} an habitat favourable all the year. To explore these hypotheses, we used aerial surveys data conducted over north-western Mediterranean Sea during winter 2011 – 2012 and summer 2012. Generalised Additive Models were used to link the species density to a set of 12 physiographic and oceanographic predictors describing their environment. Habitat models resulted in deviances from 12 to 47 %. Our results provided the first assessment of habitat preferences for the winter season for most of our studied species. Small-sized delphinids (mostly stripped dolphins), fin whales, Globicephalinae (long-finned pilot whales and Risso׳s dolphins) and small-sized <b>shearwaters</b> (<b>Yelkouan</b> and Balearic <b>shearwaters)</b> exhibited no habitat variations between seasons, although for the first two, abundances were lower in winter. On the contrary, bottlenose dolphins switched from coastal habitat in summer to pelagic habitat in winter, while Cory׳s shearwaters and storm petrels exhibited the largest habitat variations between seasons with a complete absence during winter...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMarine Protected Areas (MPAs) {{are being}} {{established}} across all marine regions but their validity {{for the conservation}} of highly mobile marine vertebrates has been questioned. We tested the hypothesis that French coastal MPAs primarily designed for coastal and benthic biota are also beneficial {{for the conservation of}} a pelagic seabird, the Vulnerable <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater</b> (Puffinus yelkouan), an endemic species to the Mediterranean Sea. We used a vast spectrum of electronic devices (GPS, temperature-depth-recorders, satellite transmitters and geolocators) and stable isotopic analyses to study the year-round movements and the trophic status of yelkouan shearwaters from the Hyères archipelago (France). Inaddition we conducted large-scale ship and aircrafts observation surveys to investigate spatio-temporal density patterns of shearwaters (genus Puffinus) in the western Mediterranean Sea. This extensive investigation permitted the first comprehensive study of the at-sea ecology of yelkouan shearwaters showing strikingly coastal habits, partial migration, unsuspected diving capabilities (max dive depth of 30 m), and a broad diet ranging from zooplankton to small pelagic fish. Importantly, 31 % of yelkouan shearwaters GPS positions associated with foraging, 38 % of diving positions, and 27 % of resting positions were within the three French MPAs during the breeding season. These high scores confirmed by year-round distributionderived from GLS, PTTs, at-sea and aerial observations, validated our hypothesis of the major importance of coastal MPAs for the conservation of <b>yelkouan</b> <b>shearwater.</b> Our case-study is therefore a major contribution to research efforts aiming at linking the spatial ecology of highly mobile marine vertebrates with effective conservation of marine biodiversity...|$|E
