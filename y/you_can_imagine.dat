5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

25|$|It's {{a complex}} {{question}} to answer, really. As musicians {{you try to}} find a name for your band that represents you and you never really do, because, basically, names for bands lose their meaning after a while.

The most important thing for a name is that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> forty-thousand people screaming it in unison.|$|E
25|$|George Peppard's screen {{presence}} {{has some}} agreeable anomalies. He is tough, assured and insolent – {{in a way}} that recalls late Dick Powell rather than early Bogart; but his bright blue eyes and blond hair, his boyish face suggest the all-American athlete, perhaps going to seed. The sophistication is surface deep: <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> him in Times Square on a Saturday night, sulky, defiant, out of his depth, not quite certain how he wants to spend the evening.|$|E

The crew of the USS Bainbridge, the Arleigh Burke–class guided-missile destroyer that participated in the rescue of Richard Phillips from Maersk Alabama, contacted the South Park creators to commend them on the episode. Ensign Jonathan Sieg, the Bainbridge public relations officer, wrote, [...] "Pretty much everyone onboard our ship—from Captain to seaman—is {{a huge fan of}} South Park, and when we heard about the episode 'Fatbeard', as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine,</b> we were thrilled and very interested to watch." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the day it}} was shown, [...] "Last Gasp" [...] was {{selected}} as comedy [...] "pick of the day" [...] in the Daily Express, but, the following day, an extremely critical review of the episode by Virginia Blackburn was published in the newspaper. She felt that the episode was disappointing and wasted the talent of the actors, and that the concept was [...] "the sort of idea <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> two students coming up with after the sixth pint ... and then feeling slightly embarrassed about it when they wake up the next morning". She summed up the episode by saying that it was neither funny nor clever, and [...] "is so utterly, irredeemably, naffly silly that it ends up being incredibly irritating and nothing else".|$|E
500|$|Agnew was {{involved}} in a minor controversy regarding an appearance by Lily Allen on Test Match Special in 2009. The Daily Telegraph reported that [...] "the cricket-loving Allen struck up an instant rapport with Agnew, and the BBC received largely positive feedback for the 30-minute interview", but Will Buckley, writing for The Observer, described Agnew's [...] "amorous ambitions" [...] as [...] "positioned... firmly on the pervy side of things". Agnew was furious, noting he [...] "gave... Will Buckley 24hrs to apologise for calling me a pervert, and he has declined... As <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine,</b> I have taken being called a pervert quite badly." [...] Allen herself supported Agnew: [...] " [...] really think this Will Buckley guy should apologise to... he was nothing but kind and gentlemanly to me during our interview. I don't know 1 person that agrees with The Observer on this one." [...] Buckley eventually apologised.|$|E

500|$|In May 2000, Aronofsky {{was briefly}} {{attached}} {{to make an}} adaptation of David Wiesner's 1999 children's book Sector 7 for Nickelodeon Movies, the project remains unmade. In mid-2000, Warner Bros. hired Aronofsky to write and direct Batman: Year One, {{which was to be}} the fifth film in the Batman franchise. Aronofsky, who collaborated with Frank Miller on an unproduced script for Ronin, brought Miller to co-write Year One with him, intending to reboot the series. [...] "It's somewhat based on the comic book", Aronofsky later said. [...] "Toss out everything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> about Batman! Everything! We're starting completely anew". Regular Aronofsky collaborator Matthew Libatique was set as cinematographer, and Aronofsky had also approached Christian Bale for the role of Batman. Bale later would be cast in the role for Batman Begins. After that project failed to develop, Aronofsky declined the opportunity to direct an entry in the Batman franchise.|$|E

Melua revealed during an interview with The Guardian that her partnership with Mike Batt had come to an end after her last album, as it was a six-album deal with Batt's Dramatico records. [...] "It was a six-album deal,” she explains, “so when the sixth one was done, you know – it was finished and it was time for us to part ways.....It was maybe a bit more mutual on one side than the other.

500|$|American {{environmentalist}} {{and writer}} Bill McKibben lamented the {{film on the}} Climate Progress website, where he wrote [...] "The climate skeptics can crow. It's the kind of stupidity that hurts our side, reinforcing in people's minds a series of preconceived notions, {{not the least of}} which is that we're out-of-control and out of touch—not to mention off the wall, and also with completely misplaced sense of humor". McKibben added [...] "There's no question that crap like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over our efforts and everyone else who's working on global warming. McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10. When The Daily Caller asked about the film, environmental organisation Greenpeace spokeswoman Jane Kochersperger stated that [...] "as an organisation committed to non-violence, I think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> how Greenpeace views this material. At this time, the only people promoting the material are climate skeptics and think tanks funded by corporations known for lobbying against climate change legislation".

500|$|On 15 October 2004, New Line Cinema {{announced}} that it had bought a three-year option on the film rights to Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell. Clarke received an undisclosed [...] "seven-figure sum", making the deal [...] "one of the biggest acquisitions of film rights for a book in recent years". New Line chose Christopher Hampton, whose adaptation of Dangerous Liaisons won an Academy Award, to write it; New Line executives Mark Ordesky and Ileen Maisel were overseeing the production. On 7 November 2005, The Daily Telegraph reported that Hampton had finished the first draft: [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine,</b> it took {{a fair amount of}} time to work out some way to encapsulate that enormous book in a film of sensible length...ut it was lots of fun– and very unlike anything I have ever done before." [...] At that time, no director or cast had yet been chosen. As of June 2006, Hampton was still working on the screenplay. Julian Fellowes then took over writing duties before the collapse of New Line Cinema.|$|E
500|$|Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Downs {{music is}} rooted in Americana and draws {{on a number of}} styles, {{including}} blues, folk, ragtime, norteño, rock, and country music. For the songs, Cooder adapted musical language from historical sources and incorporated styles from both North and South American traditions. In his interview on Marketplace, he explained his stylistic approach for Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, stating [...] "to me, these musical styles and sounds are narratives as well. I mean everything about them — if it's an accordion, horns, the banda horns for the immigrant tunes — they all are part of the story. And you can see it then, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> the Arizona border that's hot, 120 degrees in the shade, dusty. The banda horns are coming from some truck over there."
