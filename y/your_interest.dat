25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E

500|$|A {{writer for}} PR Newswire praised the album, {{describing}} it as [...] "showcasing" [...] Jackson's vocal talent and viewed The Stripped Mixes as shining a [...] "bright, fresh light" [...] on Jackson's early career {{as both a}} solo artist and with his brothers in The Jackson 5. Natalie Salvo of TheDwarf.com.au commented that the mix of [...] "Ain't No Sunshine" [...] made the album [...] "personally" [...] worth buying. She added that [...] "the music does what it's supposed to do", which was [...] "evoking the right mood but not being overly showy." [...] Despite the praise, she did state that the album could be clinically looked at as an [...] "element of bad taste" [...] from a [...] "greedy record company" [...] and noted that it was [...] "difficult" [...] to [...] "stop yourself being overcome with cynicism towards this album". Jeff Dorgay of Tone Publications described all of the album's tracks as being [...] "quite strong" [...] and added that [...] "regardless of <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> in Michael Jackson" [...] The Stripped Mixes is a disc [...] "you should have in your collection" [...] because it offers a [...] "rare look" [...] at [...] "classic" [...] material by Jackson {{when he was just}} beginning his career.|$|E

[...] Sen also added that although the film has been impressively produced, it has been let down by the over-the-top acting by Khan, while other actors were underused and were given nothing much to do." [...] Rajeev Masand gave the film two out of five stars, calling it [...] "spectacularly boring", and wrote [...] "Don 2 is nicely shot, and there are moments where Shah Rukh Khan is riveting. But that’s not enough to hold <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> for well over two hours…even the actor’s most loyal fans will find themselves yawning." [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify also gave 2.5 out of 5, feeling that the original film was better as compared to the sequel but praised the action sequences, writing [...] "The car chases are superb and will have you at the edge of your seat. For the rest of the film though, you'll be slouching on that very seat, waiting for the thrills that the Don series promises." [...] Writing for Hindustan Times, Mayank Shekhar was disappointed with the film, calling it [...] "never ending" [...] and criticised the stretched storyline.|$|E
