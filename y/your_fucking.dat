25|$|FitzGerald's {{government}} {{lasted until}} January 1982 when it collapsed {{due to a}} controversial budget which proposed the application of Value Added Tax to children's shoes, previously exempt. FitzGerald, no longer having {{a majority in the}} Dáil, went to Áras an Uachtaráin to advise President Hillery to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. However, the night the government collapsed the Fianna Fáil Front Bench issued a statement encouraging the President not to grant the dissolution and to allow Fianna Fáil to form a government. Phone calls were also made to the President by Brian Lenihan. Haughey, on attempting to contact his former colleague the President, and on failing to be put through to him, was reported to have threatened the President's aide de camp by telling him that he would be Taoiseach one day and when that happened, I intend to roast <b>your</b> <b>fucking</b> arse if you don't put me through immediately. Hillery considered such pressure to be gross misconduct, and granted the dissolution.|$|E

The horse dies after a heart attack, and Peter disposes of it at Mort's pharmacy. In order to pay for the damage, Peter decides to participate in a series of medical drug testing including one that makes him gay. He enters a relationship with another gay man called Scott, leaving his wife Lois and rest of the family heartbroken. After Stewie and Brian enroll Peter in straight camp, Lois breaks Peter out, deciding that Peter's happiness is more important than his sexuality. Almost immediately afterwards, the gay gene wears off and Peter moves back in with his family. The episode ends when Mort throws the horse out the window yelling, [...] "Take back <b>your</b> <b>fucking</b> horse!" ...|$|E

[...] Doctors told Curbishley that if he had not intervened, Moon would have bled to death.

500|$|Clark {{returned}} to SHAPE following the summit and briefed the press on the continued bombing operations. A reporter from the Los Angeles Times {{asked a question}} about the effect of bombings on Serbian forces, and Clark noted that merely counting the number of opposing troops did not show Milošević's true losses because he was bringing in reinforcements. Many American news organizations capitalized on the remark in a way Clark said [...] "distorted the comment" [...] with headlines such as [...] "NATO Chief Admits Bombs Fail to Stem Serb Operations" [...] in The New York Times. Clark later defended his remarks, saying this was a [...] "complete misunderstanding of my statement and of the facts," [...] and President Clinton agreed that Clark's remarks were misconstrued. Regardless, Clark received a call the following evening from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton, who said he had been told by Secretary Cohen to deliver a piece of guidance verbatim: [...] "Get <b>your</b> <b>fucking</b> face off the TV. No more briefings, period. That's it." ...|$|E

Daniel Ricciardo issued apologies to the Australian fans after what he felt was a [...] "boring" [...] race. Red Bull quarreled with their engine manufacturer Renault and lamented the dominance of their rivals, calling for the FIA {{to step in and}} apply rule changes to level the field, fearing that the public would lose interest in the sport if nothing happened. Mercedes chief Toto Wolff reacted furiously, telling his rivals to [...] "get <b>your</b> <b>fucking</b> head down and work to sort it out", but later {{made it clear that he}} [...] "didn't mean the f-word in relation to him" [...] regarding the comments by Christian Horner. Nico Rosberg voiced hopes that their rivals would get closer over the course of the season, saying during the post-race press conference: [...] "I hope we can have a good fight. That would be awesome." [...] This statement caused amusement from Sebastian Vettel, who replied: [...] "Be honest. Do you really hope so? Seriously? You finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it's going to be closer? So you hope you slow down? Is that what you're saying?" ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1990, Ice {{began an}} eight-month {{relationship}} with Madonna, and appeared in photographs for her book, Sex. In {{the height of}} Ice's popularity, SBK licensed a 12" [...] doll which was made by THQ. In January 1991, he was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live. Ice branched out into the film industry with an appearance in the film , which he later called [...] "one of the coolest experiences" [...] of his career. Ice was very secretive about his personal life, {{with the intention of}} protecting his family. When a Dallas Morning News reporter asked Ice what his mother's profession was, he replied, [...] "None of <b>your</b> <b>fucking</b> business." [...] In an attempt to rectify this, his former label wrote a fake biography in his name and tried to pass it off as his official life story without his knowledge. While on tour in 1991, Ice found out that SBK had instigated the publication of the biography which detailed false biographical information, including claims that he had attended school with Luther Campbell and exaggerating his living conditions in Miami, which Ice later had to debunk by himself.|$|E
500|$|Erlewine {{commented that}} the [...] "Steven Meisel-shot cover... was as key to her reinvention as {{the music of the}} album itself." [...] William McKeen, author of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology, felt that the image was another trigger and {{testament}} to the fact that Madonna was the last word on fashion for women and young girls of that era, the epitome of cool. Costume designer Arianne Phillips commented of the Like a Virgin look: [...] "This {{was one of the most}} shocking, liberating and influential moments in pop culture/fashion history... Fashion has never been the same." [...] Madonna herself declared: [...] "I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to be—the Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. I wanted to see if I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome. But if you wanna be a whore, it's <b>your</b> <b>fucking</b> right to be so." ...|$|E
500|$|Conceived and {{intended}} as cover artwork for a self-published pamphlet version of Rimbaud's Christ's Reality Asylum, the Crass logo was {{an amalgam of}} several [...] "icons of authority" [...] including the Christian cross, the swastika, the Union Jack and a two-headed Ouroboros (symbolising the idea that power will eventually destroy itself). Using such deliberately mixed messages was part of Crass' strategy of presenting themselves as a [...] "barrage of contradictions", challenging audiences to (in Rimbaud's words) [...] "make <b>your</b> own <b>fucking</b> minds up". This included using loud, aggressive music to promote a pacifist message, a reference to their Dadaist, performance-art backgrounds and situationist ideas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album cover}} is an {{electronically}} processed {{image of a}} burned corpse in the Leipzig-Thekla subcamp of Buchenwald. Jourgensen {{took a picture of}} the holocaust from a documentary on television and distorted the image himself. According to Jourgensen, it was originally rejected by the record label but they later changed their mind after Jourgensen presented a head of a roadkilled deer he had found on the road; he cut off the head, put it in his truck, drove from Austin to Los Angeles, went into the Sire Records building, threw the deer on the desk of the head of the art department and said, [...] "here's <b>your</b> new <b>fucking</b> album cover." ...|$|R

Frantz does his best to prepare the new soldiers for combat. [...] "I'm tired of filling body bags with <b>your</b> dumb <b>fucking</b> mistakes," [...] he says before the VC deserter silently penetrates a barbed wire barrier and aims a rocket launcher at them.|$|R
500|$|The {{shooting}} script features {{a scene in}} Angela's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a [...] "big scene on a freeway" [...] in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, {{but only if the}} scene could retain a line of Ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: [...] "When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back." [...] Jane asks: [...] "And what do you see?" [...] Ricky: [...] "Beauty." [...] Ball said, [...] "They wanted to cut that scene. They said it's not important. I said, 'You're out of <b>your</b> <b>fucking</b> mind. It's {{one of the most important}} scenes in the movie!' If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie, that is the line." [...] Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence; set in a schoolyard, it presents a [...] "turning point" [...] for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela. By the end of filming, the script had been through 10 drafts.|$|E
500|$|Various {{scenes in}} the episode were changed or removed because of {{broadcast}} censors. Originally, just after Peter hands Brian his test results from the MacArthur Program, Peter was to ask [...] "Would a retarded person have peed in their pants?", then urinate in his trousers. However, because broadcasting standards prohibited this, it was changed to [...] "Well, would a mentally retarded guy have hired a bulldozer with a drunk driver to level half of his house in celebration of his fantastic test results?". Brian stating to Peter [...] "In <b>your</b> <b>fucking</b> face, Fuckwad" [...] after Peter performs poorly on the test was censored from television broadcasting and on the censored track on the DVD, but can be heard uncensored on the uncensored audio track. This {{marks the first time}} that the word [...] "fuck" [...] has been heard uncensored in a Family Guy episode. The Family Guy orchestra sung and recorded a song for a sequence which showed several Quahog citizens learning and talking about Peter being declared as retarded. However, this was removed from the episode because broadcasting standards believed it used the word [...] "retarded" [...] too many times. After Peter loses custody of the kids, Chris was originally to stay with Mort Goldman, Stewie with Cleveland and Meg with Quagmire. During this original sequence, Mort was to tell Chris that he has two anuses, causing Quagmire to force Meg to lock him in a safe room as he could not trust himself around Meg's friends, but the series was prohibited from broadcasting it by an unknown authority, presumably broadcasting standards.|$|E
500|$|Salt Lake City police placed Bundy on 24-hour surveillance, and Thompson flew to Seattle {{with two}} other detectives to {{interview}} Kloepfer. She told them that in the year prior to Bundy's move to Utah she had discovered objects she [...] "couldn't understand" [...] in her house and in Bundy's apartment: a set of crutches; a bag of plaster of Paris that he admitted stealing from a medical supply house; a meat cleaver, never used for cooking, that he packed {{when he moved to}} Utah; surgical gloves; an Oriental knife in a wooden case that he kept in his glove compartment; and a sack full of women's clothing. Bundy was perpetually in debt, and Kloepfer suspected he had stolen almost everything of significant value that he owned. Once, when she confronted him over a new TV and stereo, he warned her, [...] "If you tell anyone, I'll break <b>your</b> <b>fucking</b> neck." [...] She said Bundy became [...] "very upset" [...] whenever she considered cutting her hair, which was long and parted in the middle. She would sometimes awaken {{in the middle of the}} night to find him under the bed covers with a flashlight, examining her body. He kept a lug wrench, taped halfway up the handle, in the trunk of her car—another Volkswagen Beetle, which he often borrowed—"for protection". The detectives confirmed that Bundy had not been with Kloepfer on any of the nights during which the Pacific Northwest victims had vanished, nor on the day Ott and Naslund were abducted. Shortly thereafter, Kloepfer was interviewed by Seattle homicide detective Kathy McChesney, and learned of the existence of Stephanie Brooks and her brief engagement to Bundy around Christmas 1973.|$|E

[...] Jordan Zakarin of The Huffington Post commented the track [...] "has enough star power to dwarf our own sun" [...] and added that it [...] "puts enough of a spin on the original version to make it worth a spin on its own." [...] Samesame.com.au stated that Minaj's rap was [...] "fantastic", and that although Kesha's verse was [...] "a little strange", it also [...] "works, but ... further emphasises what a poor choice for single Till The World Ends was in the first place, as the song sounds even more like a B-side to Ke$ha’s Cannibal EP." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice highlighted the breakdown and Minaj [...] "who seems particularly energized here, stretching and bending her voice like it's a Plasticman doll." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "like most remixes, we’ll stick with the original".
