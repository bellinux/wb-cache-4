5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> {{the wrong side of}} the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.|$|E

He {{grew up in the}} borough's Manhattan Beach neighborhood, where he was [...] "raised culturally Jewish, but there was very little spiritual attendance in temple. It was a cultural thing—celebrating the holidays, knowing where <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>from,</b> knowing your history, having respect for what your people have been through." [...] He graduated from Edward R. Murrow High School. He has one sister, Patti, who attended a professional ballet school through high school. His parents would often take him to Broadway theater performances, which sparked his keen interest in show business.|$|E

The title track holds a [...] "convinced relativism", according to Robert Christgau, while [...] "Main Thing", {{a cover of}} Shot's 1986 single, explores deep house, disco and funk genres. The ninth track, [...] "Giving You Back", is a piano ballad that addresses Robyn's abortion as she sings [...] "I'm giving you back to where <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> but I'm not forgetting who you are". David Schmader of The Stranger opined that it features a directness that is [...] "unprecedented in pop", and compared its piano elements {{to those found in}} Braxton's work. The following track, [...] "88 Days", lyrically reflects on the abortion while showcasing a pop and R sound. The thirteenth and final track, [...] "Universal Woman", for which Robyn received sole writing credit, exhibits both intelligence and emotional authority, according to Bjurman.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has {{often called the}} album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, [...] "I would think all day, for days and days, [...] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in {{different}} ways. I don’t know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it." [...] Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is <b>You,</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, [...] "We named it that because ... It's me, looking in the mirror, saying, 'I am my own worst [...] I do the worst damage to myself — {{more than anybody else}} can to do me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV in 2006, vocalist Taylor said that Come What(ever) May was {{a return to the}} roots of the band, stating it is [...] "a lot more from the spirit of what the band started with in 1992". He noted that some songs were [...] "very atmospheric" [...] while others maintained [...] "the hard rock and the heavy stuff". Jon Wiederhorn of MTV said that [...] "for every thrash riff there's a tunefully grungy passage, for every flailing guitar line there's a rock-radio hook." [...] When talking about the track [...] "30/30-150", he said parts are [...] "bludgeoning, barbed and heavy" [...] while others are [...] "soaring and triumphant" [...] with the production of Raskulinecz helping to balance the album's heaviness with its radio-accessibility. Come What(ever) Mays lyrics include themes of [...] "pain, pleasure, happiness, and grief". The diversity in subjects is evident throughout the album; songs including [...] "Come What(ever) May" [...] were politically influenced while the track [...] "Socio" [...] is about [...] "social anxiety attacks" [...] that Taylor suffered. [...] "Zzyzx Rd" [...] is a love song written to Taylor's wife for helping him in his struggles against alcoholism and contemplation of suicide. [...] "I've never written anything like that before, but it was very important for me to tell the world not only how much she saved me, but how much she means to me," [...] said Taylor. Taylor said there is a common thread with the lyrics throughout the album, saying that they are [...] "about never forgetting where <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>from,</b> who you are and why you do this." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{representative}} for Jive Records stated that although Spears {{was working in}} the studio, [...] "no album is scheduled at the moment" [...] and [...] "there are no plans to service 'Mona Lisa' to radio." [...] "Mona Lisa" [...] was released in a bonus CD included with the video of [...] (2005). Spears gave birth to her first son, Sean Preston, on September 14, 2005. In an interview with People in February 2006, Spears explained that she was anxious to resume her career, commenting she missed [...] "traveling [...] the road, seeing different places and being with the dancers and having fun. That feeling of being on the stage, knowing it's your best – I love that. I needed a break. I needed to be hungry again." [...] When asked about her next album, she said she had been experimenting in her home studio with live musicians, stripping down her sound and playing the piano. Spears wanted the album to represent her Louisiana roots, explaining that she grew up listening to blues. [...] "When I was little, I would listen to myself [...] But the record label signs you, and you're just thankful to get a hit song. You can't really show off your voice and where <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>from.</b> I would like to try to have more influences of that sound. Not that I'm going to be like frickin' Tina Turner. But you never know", she stated. She also said that she hoped the album would reinvigorate the current pop scene, adding that [...] "It's been boring. Nothing's been wow to me." [...] On May 9, 2006, Spears announced she was pregnant with her second child. A few days later, producers such as J. R. Rotem and Sean Garrett told MTV News they were working with Spears. On September 12, 2006, Spears gave birth to her second son, Jayden James. She filed for divorce from Federline on November 7, 2006, citing irreconcilable differences. After the divorce, her partying and public behaviour drew attention from the worldwide media, and ended with two separate stints at Promises Malibu Alcohol and Drug Rehab Treatment Facility in February 2007. Her manager Larry Rudolph released a statement on March 20, 2007, saying that she [...] "successfully complet their program." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the October 1959 church general conference, apostle Spencer W. Kimball stated: [...] "Millions of {{you have}} blood {{relatively}} unmixed with Gentiles. Columbus called you 'Indians,' thinking he had reached the East Indies. ... The Lord calls you 'Lamanites,' a name which has a pleasant ring, {{for many of the}} grandest people ever to live upon the earth were so called. In a limited sense, the name signifies the descendants of Laman and Lemuel, sons of your first American parent, Lehi; but you undoubtedly possess also the blood of the other sons, Sam, Nephi, and Jacob. And you likely have some Jewish blood from Mulek, son of Zedekiah, king of Judah (Hel. 6:10). ... <b>You</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> Jerusalem in its days of tribulation. You are of royal blood, a loved people of the Lord. In your veins flows the blood of prophets and statesmen". Similarly, at a 1971 Lamanite Youth Conference, Kimball stated: [...] "With pride I tell those who come to my office that a Lamanite is a descendant of one Lehi who left Jerusalem six hundred years before Christ and with his family crossed the mighty deep and landed in America. And Lehi and his family became the ancestors of all of the Indian and Mestizo tribes in North and South and Central America and in the islands of the sea". Ted E. Brewerton, a general authority of the LDS Church, stated in 1995: [...] "Many migratory groups came to the Americas, but none was as important as the three mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The blood of these people flows in the veins of the Blackfoot and the Blood Indians of Alberta, Canada; in the Navajo and the Apache of the American Southwest; the Inca of western South America; the Aztec of Mexico; the Maya of Guatemala; and in other native American groups in the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific islands".|$|E
