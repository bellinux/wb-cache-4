5|$|On the {{geographical}} division level, the Delegation had local offices, dividing Polish territories into 16 voivodeships, each under an underground voivode, further divided into powiats headed by starostas, and with separate municipal bodies. In early 1944, the Delegation employed some 15,000 people in its administration; those were primarily older people, as the <b>younger</b> <b>ones</b> were recruited {{for the military}} side of the operations.|$|E
5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and <b>younger</b> <b>ones</b> and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E
5|$|As {{the trade}} {{deadline}} approached, it was {{speculated that the}} Phillies would surrender older players to obtain <b>younger</b> <b>ones.</b> They made two deals, neither involving key components of the team. In August they had their best month of the season: a 14–13 record, thanks to strong pitching and adequate hitting. Although the Phillies began September with four pitchers combining for a no-hitter, their month deteriorated from there. The squad had an 11–15 record, finishing the season with 73 wins and 89 losses. Significant personnel changes {{on the field and}} in the front office were expected during the offseason.|$|E

5|$|Males sing {{constantly}} as {{the breeding}} period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In {{the presence of}} a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance, apparently attempting to entice the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than <b>younger</b> <b>ones.</b> Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater reproductive success than others. Females appear to prefer mates with more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.|$|E
5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a syrinx, their vocal display is limited to grunts and hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the <b>younger</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E
5|$|Touching is an {{important}} form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline <b>younger</b> <b>ones.</b> Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching {{is especially important for}} mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.|$|E

5|$|With the {{commencement}} of the New Order in 1965, Indonesia's economy developed and opened to foreign investment. In Toraja, a coffee plantation and factory was established by Key Coffee of Japan, and Torajan coffee regained a reputation for quality within the growing international specialty coffee sector Multinational oil and mining companies opened new operations in Indonesia during the 1970s and 1980s. Torajans, particularly <b>younger</b> <b>ones,</b> relocated {{to work for the}} foreign companies—to Kalimantan for timber and oil, to Papua for mining, to the cities of Sulawesi and Java, and many went to Malaysia. The out-migration of Torajans was steady until 1985. and has continued since, with remittances sent back by emigre Torajans performing an important role within the contemporary economy.|$|E
5|$|Succession {{was largely}} governed by male-preference cognatic primogeniture, under which sons inherit before daughters, and elder {{children}} inherit before <b>younger</b> <b>ones</b> {{of the same}} gender. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, announced at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011 that all 16 Commonwealth realms, including the United Kingdom, had agreed to abolish the gender-preference rule for anyone born after {{the date of the}} meeting, 28 October 2011. They also agreed that future monarchs would no longer be prohibited from marrying a Roman Catholic – a law which dated from the Act of Settlement 1701. However, since the monarch is also the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the law which prohibits a Roman Catholic from acceding to the throne remains. The necessary UK legislation making the changes received the royal assent on 25 April 2013 and was brought into force in March 2015 after the equivalent legislation was approved in all the other Commonwealth realms.|$|E
