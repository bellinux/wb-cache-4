25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E

500|$|Structural {{problems}} with the undercroft of the garden were discovered in the early 21st century and the garden was closed and fenced off in 2004. The memorial remained fenced off for seven years and fell into disrepair as the city council lacked the funds {{to carry out the}} necessary repairs, though access was granted to representatives of the Royal British Legion to lay wreaths during Remembrance Sunday services. The journalist Martin Bell remarked on the condition of the memorial in 2007: [...] "to find a war memorial in a state like that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go to Iraq".|$|E
500|$|The {{scenes with}} Sansa Stark were also noted. According to Elio Garcia from westeros.org, [...] "Sophie Turner really shines in her scenes. There {{are a lot}} of people out there who judge Sansa very harshly, but <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have a heart of stone not to sympathize with her plight in this episode." [...] Many reviewers agreed with this sentiment, commenting on the {{transition}} from a [...] "spoiled brat" [...] to a young, confused, but courageous teenager were noted by several reviewers positively. Times reviewer James Poniewozik emphasized the growth of Robb Stark's character, praising both Martin's writing and Richard Madden's acting. Maureen Ryan highlighted the scene where Syrio Forel confronts the Lannister men to allow Arya's escape, which she considered masterfully staged.|$|E

Returning, {{with more}} {{assurance}} than before, to entertaining the troops, he so far departed from his classical style as to join Lillie and Michael Wilding singing a comic trio. His 1943 revival of William Congreve's Love for Love on tour {{and then in}} London received high praise from reviewers. In 1944 he was approached by Ralph Richardson, who had been asked by the governors of the Old Vic {{to form a new}} company. Unwilling to take sole charge, Richardson proposed a managing triumvirate of Gielgud, Olivier and himself. Gielgud declined: [...] "It would be a disaster, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{the book}} Lone Survivor chronicles Marcus Luttrell's 1999 {{enlistment}} and training, {{as well as}} his 2005 deployment to Afghanistan, Berg decided that the film adaptation would focus mainly on the events of the failed United States Navy SEALs mission Operation Red Wings, as well as the bonding and camaraderie of Luttrell and his fallen teammates. Prior to writing the screenplay, Berg met with the families of the deceased. [...] "My research started with meeting the families of the SEAL teammates who were killed", he said. [...] "I went to New York and met the Murphys. I went to Colorado and met the Dietzes, and I went to Northern California and met the Axelsons. After spending time with them, you realize that these kids were the best and the brightest; they were the stars of the families. The grief and the wounds are still very raw. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be inhuman to not feel the responsibility when that kind of grief gets shared with you." [...] Berg also expressed that he was motivated by the families to make the story as realistic as possible; his goal was [...] "to put [...] into the experience of what these guys went through. And it was obviously a traumatic and violent and exhausting experience".|$|E

500|$|Paramount faced two {{obstacles}} {{in promoting the}} film: the unfamiliarity of the [...] "MySpace generation" [...] with the franchise and the relatively weak international performance of the previous films. Six months before the film's release, Abrams toured Europe and North America with 25 minutes of footage. Abrams noted the large-scale campaign started unusually early, but this was because the release delay allowed him to show more completed scenes than normal. The director preferred promoting his projects quietly, but concurred Paramount needed to remove Star Treks stigma. Abrams would exaggerate his preference for other shows to Star Trek as a child to the press, with statements like [...] "I'm not a Star Trek fan" [...] and [...] "this movie is not made for Star Trek fans necessarily". Orci compared Abrams' approach to The Next Generation episode [...] "A Matter of Honor", where William Riker is stationed aboard a Klingon vessel. [...] "On that ship when someone talks back to you, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> beat them down or you lose the respect of your crew, which is protocol, whereas on a Federation ship {{that would be a}} crime. So we have to give [...] a little bit of leeway, when he is traveling the 'galaxy' over there where they don't know Trek, to say the {{things that need to be}} said in order to get people onto our side." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Carry Out" [...] is one {{of twelve}} songs written and {{produced}} by Timbaland and J-Roc for Timbaland's third studio album Shock Value II (2009). Justin Timberlake, Attitude and Jim Beanz, notable collaborators with Timbaland, also assisted {{in the writing of}} the song. Timbaland, in an interview with MTV's Shaheem Reed and Gil Kaufman, stated that he favored this song over other recordings because the process for creating the song was similar to those of other collaborations they have done. Timberlake would come into the studio and listen to the track. Afterwards, he would then compose the lyrics in his head. Upon explaining their method of making music, Timbaland stated that: [...] "We got a chemistry that cannot be described. People ask, 'Well, what are you and Justin like?' Can't tell you what it's like — it's a chemistry that can't be described. Something <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> see for yourself and be, like, 'Them two got magic'." [...] Timbaland stated that the song resembles a [...] "2010 version" [...] of Snoop Dogg's [...] "Drop It Like It's Hot", produced by The Neptunes. He also revealed that the intention of the song was to provide a different slang for women: [...] "Instead of 'Your phat butt' or 'Your big breasts,' we say, 'Oh, I need you. Can I be your carry out? Be my carry out. I want you to be my dinner, my leftovers, my everything.' It's a different slang. We're grown men, I wanna be subliminal to females. Like, 'Oooh, carry out? That's kinda sexy'." ...|$|E

Dennis DeYoung has denied the accusation as well, joking on the In the Studio with Redbeard program [...] "we had enough trouble to make the music sound right forward."

2500|$|The user-creation of graphics, animations, levels, and minigames {{which are}} seen in the Mario Artist series and F-Zero X Expansion Kit are {{revisited}} in later console generations.

[...] Certain minigames literally originated there, as explained by Goro Abe of Nintendo R's so-called Wario Ware All-Star Team: [...] "In Polygon Studio you could create 3D models and animate them in the game, {{but there was also a}} side game included inside.

2500|$|In 1991, {{professor}} and New York Times writer Jay Dolan critiqued Generations for not talking more about class, race and sex, to which Neil Howe replied that they [...] "are probably generalizations not even {{as effective as}} a generation {{to say something about}} how people think and behave. One of the things to understand is that most historians never look at history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you look at the way America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullient and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- I think <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> agree that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Lynch {{moved with}} his wife and {{daughter}} to Los Angeles, where he began studying filmmaking at the AFI Conservatory, a place that he would later describe as being [...] "completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great... you quickly learned that {{if you were going to}} get something done, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing." [...] He began writing a script for a proposed work titled Gardenback, which had [...] "unfolded from this painting I'd done". In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, something that he reluctantly agreed to do. Nonetheless, with all the interference on his Gardenback project, he became fed up with the Conservatory and quit after returning to start the second year and being put in first year classes. Dean of the AFI, Frank Daniel, asked Lynch to reconsider, believing that he was one of the school's best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create his own project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that Gardenback was [...] "wrecked", he instead set about on a new film, which he called Eraserhead.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1974, Benny {{cancelled}} {{a performance}} in Dallas {{after suffering a}} dizzy spell, coupled with numbness in his arms. Despite a battery of tests, Benny's ailment could not be determined. When he complained of stomach pains in early December, a first test showed nothing, but a subsequent one showed he had inoperable pancreatic cancer. Benny went into a coma at home on December 22, 1974. While in a coma, he was visited by close friends including George Burns, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Carson and John Rowles. He died on December 26, 1974 at age 80.
