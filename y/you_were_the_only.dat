500|$|Sir George Edward Wade, CBE (20 September 1869– 29 November 1954), known professionally as George Robey, was an English comedian, {{singer and}} actor in musical theatre, who {{became known as}} one of the {{greatest}} music hall performers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a comedian, Robey mixed everyday situations and observations with comic absurdity. Apart from his music hall acts, he was a popular Christmas pantomime performer in the English provinces, where he excelled in the dame roles. He scored notable successes in musical revues during and after the First World War, particularly with the song [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>the</b> <b>Only</b> Girl (In the World)", which he performed with Violet Loraine in the revue The Bing Boys Are Here (1916). One of his best-known original characters in his six-decade long career was the Prime Minister of Mirth.|$|E
500|$|By the First World War, {{music hall}} {{entertainment}} {{had fallen out}} of favour with audiences. Theatrical historians blame the music hall's decline on the increasing salaries of performers and the halls' inability to present profitably the twenty or thirty acts that the audiences expected to see. [...] Revue appealed to wartime audiences, and Robey decided to capitalise on the medium's popularity. Stoll offered Robey a lucrative contract in 1916 to appear in the new revue The Bing Boys Are Here at the Alhambra Theatre, London. Dividing his time between three or four music halls a night had become unappealing to the comedian, and he relished the opportunity to appear in a single theatre. He was cast as Lucius Bing opposite Violet Loraine, who played his love interest Emma, and the couple duetted in the show's signature song [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>the</b> <b>Only</b> Girl (In the World)", which became an international success.|$|E

More than that, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one toward whom she has a {{positive}} objection. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one who <b>is</b> an intimate friend of her uncle, and who would be likely, by means of that intimate friendship, to bring her into connection with the woman she hates, {{as well as with}} a relative she despises on account of his intended marriage with that woman." ...|$|R
500|$|In June 1951, now aged 81, Robey {{starred in}} a midnight gala {{performance}} at the London Palladium in aid {{of the family of}} Sid Field who had died that year. For the finale, Robey performed [...] "I Stopped, I Looked, I Listened" [...] and [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>the</b> <b>Only</b> Girl in the World"; the rest of the three-hour performance featured celebrities from the radio, television and film mediums. The American comedian Danny Kaye, who was also engaged for the performance, called Robey a [...] "great, great artist". The same month, Robey returned to Birmingham, where he opened a garden party at St. Mary and St. Ambrose Church, a venue in which he had appeared {{at the beginning of his}} career. [...] On 25 September he appeared for the BBC on an edition of the radio series Desert Island Discs for which he chose among others [...] "Mondo ladro", Falstaff's rueful complaint about the wicked world in Verdi's opera Falstaff. [...] For the rest of the year Robey made a number of personal appearances opening fetes and attending charity events.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} months of 1919, Robey {{completed}} a book of memoirs, My Rest Cure, which was published later that year. During the run of Joy Bells he was awarded the Legion of Honour for raising £14,000 for the French Red Cross. He declined a knighthood that same year because, according to Cotes, he was worried that the title would distance him from his working-class audiences; he was appointed a CBE by George V at Buckingham Palace instead. On the morning of the penultimate Joy Bells performance, Robey was invited to Stoll's London office, where he was offered a role in a new revue at the Alhambra Theatre. On the journey, he met the theatre impresario Sir Alfred Butt, who agreed to pay him £100 more, but out of loyalty to Stoll, he declined the offer and resumed his £600 a week contract at the Alhambra. On 28 July 1919, Robey took part in his second Royal Command Performance, at the London Coliseum. [...] He and Loraine sang [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>the</b> <b>Only</b> Girl (In the World)".|$|E

He {{recorded}} duets with female singers, for example with Denise Orme in [...] "The Kissing Duet" [...] from The Geisha, {{and with the}} music-hall star Florrie Forde in [...] "Would You Like to Change With Me?", both in 1906.

2500|$|Furtwängler's {{name was}} {{included}} on the Gottbegnadeten list ("God-gifted List") of September 1944, but was removed on December 7, 1944 because of his relationships with German resistance. Furtwängler had strong links to the German resistance which organized the 20 July plot. He stated during his denazification trial that he knew an attack was being organized against Hitler, {{although he did not}} participate in its organization. He knew Claus von Stauffenberg very well and his doctor, Johannes Ludwig Schmitt, who wrote him many false health prescriptions to bypass official requirements, {{was a member of the}} Kreisau Circle. Furtwängler's concerts were sometimes chosen by the members of the German resistance as a meeting point. Rudolf Pechel, a member of the resistance group which organized the 20 July plot said to Furtwängler after the war: [...] "In the circle of our resistance movement it was an accepted fact that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one in the whole of our musical world who really resisted, and you were one of us." [...] Graf Kaunitz, also a member of that circle, stated: [...] "In Furtwängler's concerts we were one big family of the resistance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hip hop {{culture has}} spread to both urban and {{suburban}} communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world. These elements were adapted and developed considerably, particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades. Even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms, including hip hop theater and hip hop film, the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hip hop culture. [...] Hip hop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon; the importance of sampling tracks, beats and basslines from old records [...] to the art form means {{that much of the}} culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings, attitudes, and experiences for modern audiences. Sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called [...] "flipping" [...] in hip hop culture. Hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier African-American-rooted musical genres such as blues, jazz, rag-time, funk, and disco {{to become one of the}} most practiced genres worldwide. It is the language of urban environments and the youth around the world, many who do not know what Hip Hop (the consciousness which makes up the collective culture of Hip Hop) is or what it means to [...] "Be Hip Hop" [...] , have recently begun to attribute being Hip Hop with being black, however that is race , not culture and not consciousness. as KRS-One says [...] "Hip Hop is the only place where you see Martin Luther King Jr. s; 'I have a dream speech' in real life" [...] and [...] "To be Hip Hop you have to have the courage to be you and be Hip Hop all the time not just when it's popular or convenient, and have repped it when it wasn't and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one repping it." [...] He also notes that Hip Hop is beyond something as simple minded as race or gender or nationality, it belongs to the world.|$|E
