A large bubble forms around them, transporting them to the centre of the pool and ascending into a large grotto, from where they proceed on foot through a series of adjoining caverns. Sally tells Olivero that this is the country she and her brother left 30years ago. Soon they encounter her people, to whom Sally, or Siloēn as she is properly known, explains that many <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>she</b> wandered off and became lost, but that she has now returned with one who [...] "was lost too, and now wishes to dwell among us".

500|$|In 1933 Major became {{executive}} director of a health center on Lenox Avenue in Harlem that was operated by the United Health Association.

In 1936 she passed civil service examinations and oral interviews to become a publicity assistant in the New York Bureau of Health Education and Information, a job she continued to perform until 1946. A news report on Major's appointment said her performance on written and oral civil service examinations and her prior experience resulted in her selection and noted that she was the first African American to be hired into the position. It said, [...] "Her extraordinarily clever style of writing plus the advantage of a wide circle of friends in the elite circles wherever she went, placed her {{at the top of the}} society writers in short order. As Society Editor of the Interstate Tattler, prior to its discontinuing several <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>she</b> held a unique position similar to that of an arbiter over the local social set and it was during that time that her fame, both as a writer and hostess, is said to have reached its peak." ...|$|E
500|$|Carey Mulligan {{plays the}} narrator, Kathy, an introverted, observant {{character}} who projects both innocence and knowingness, and who {{over the course}} of the story develops from a passionate, optimistic child to a wise and accepting young woman. Prior to her casting, Mulligan had already read the novel a few times, considering it to be a favourite of hers. She recalled that from when she first read the book three <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>she</b> had wanted to play Kathy. The young actress said that she could not [...] "bear the idea of anyone else" [...] portraying Kathy, although she acknowledged that she thought other people would be able to do a better performance. She was certain that someone would make a film adaptation of the novel and had hoped that they would wait until she would be old enough to play the character. Romanek told The Los Angeles Times that he originally was having difficulty finding the right actress to play Kathy; a tight filming deadline loomed prior to Mulligan's casting. Peter Rice, the head of Fox Searchlight (the company financing the film) was watching An Education at the Sundance Film Festival in January. He wrote Romanek a four-word text message: [...] "Hire the genius Mulligan." [...] When later asked why the message was so abrupt, he explained that he was still in the middle of viewing the film. Rice exhibited what was described as a [...] "rare foresight" [...] in greenlighting a film with an almost unknown lead actress. [...] "He just knew that she was it", said Romanek.|$|E

[...] The New York Times hailed her as [...] "becoming {{one of the most interesting}} of our screen actresses." [...] She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for the role, but commented that it was belated recognition for Of Human Bondage, calling the award a [...] "consolation prize". For the rest of her life, Davis maintained that she gave the statue its familiar name of [...] "Oscar" [...] because its posterior resembled that of her husband, whose middle name was Oscar, although, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences officially makes reference to another story.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1996, Jemison filed a {{complaint}} against a Texas police officer, accusing him of police brutality during a traffic stop that ended in her arrest. She was pulled over by Nassau Bay, Texas officer Henry Hughes for allegedly making an illegal U-turn and arrested after Hughes learned of an outstanding warrant on Jemison for a speeding ticket. In the process of arresting her, the officer twisted her wrist and forced her to the ground. In her complaint, Jemison said the officer physically and emotionally mistreated her. Jemison's attorney said she believed she'd already paid the speeding ticket <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>She</b> spent several hours in jail and was treated at an area hospital after release for deep bruises and a head injury. Jemison said in a televised interview that the incident has altered her feelings about police there.

2500|$|The {{two main}} characters, [...] "Guy et Sylvie", are {{named after the}} actors who play them. Guy likes to tease Sylvie {{on a variety of}} subjects, and hates her mother. His father is {{remarried}} to a young, good-looking stripper, Mélanie, played by Mahée Paiement, and had a child with her. The attention the child receives makes Guy jealous, his father having spent little time with him when he was a child. Unlike Guy, Sylvie dreams of having a baby. She is jealous of Geneviève, Guy's sexy, and promiscuous, office colleague with whom he had a one-time affair <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>She</b> is also obsessed with cleanliness and resents Guy for being untidy. A curious running gag from the show involves Guy surprising Sylvie by grabbing her breasts from behind while shouting [...] "Road Runner!", followed by the cartoon character's emblematic honking [...] "beeb beeb" [...] sound. While she ostensibly loves it, she pretended the exact opposite when it was obliquely brought up by Guy in front of her mother. This joke was developed on the set by the two actors. The last season saw notable developments: a marriage, and a trip to Vietnam to adopt a little girl.|$|E

I know the audience loved Michelle Fowler so much, and even though she hasn’t been on our screen for 20 years, she’s very much in the fans’ psyche. When I used to watch EastEnders all those <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>she</b> was one of my favourite characters. I’m extremely excited for what is in store for Michelle." [...] Executive producer Sean O'Connor said he is [...] "thrilled to have secured Jenna Russell to play Michelle Fowler, one of the show’s most celebrated characters" [...] and [...] "the Square really has missed her over the past twenty years." [...] O'Connor added, [...] "Jenna was always in mind when I [...] first started planning for Michelle’s return". O'Connor also said Michelle is [...] "still flawed, complicated and infuriating after two decades away, but still loveable all the same. It’s going to be appointment TV watching Michelle’s car crash of a life unravel all over again." ...|$|E
2500|$|For a {{year before}} her death, she was {{assistant}} editor of the Californian Illustrated Magazine, who offered the following tribute to her memory: [...] "The Pacific Coast world of letters has suffered a loss {{in the past month}} in the death of Emily Tracy (Swett) Parkhurst. Parkhurst was connected with the Californian as an assistant editor, was a contibutor to its columns, and wrote its literary reviews. She was a woman of rare promise, possessed of great talent, which, combined with executive ability, made her a prominent figure in many assemblies. Her especial work was the formation of the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association. A few <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>she</b> traveled through the state and made the personal acquaintance of all the Pacific Coast writers, her object being to advance the interests of women writers — bring them out and aid them in obtaining a field for their work. In this she was extremely successful. She gathered about her hundreds of contributors to the literary press of the day, and finally organized the Press Association, of which she became secretary. The work thus accomplished did much in encouraging women to make a fight for themselves, and by her means many are now self-supporting who, previous to the movement, realized little or nothing from their literary work. Parkhurst combined rare executive ability with literary discernment and taste, and was a brilliant organizer. At the time of her death, she had plans laid out for work that would have appalled many. One was a thorough investigation of the possibility of woman's work in horticulture and agriculture in this state. This was not theory, as the plan included a system by which women could enter the lists with men in farming and marketing their products. Few women had so large an acquaintance; few will be missed by so great a number; and so a well-spent, bright life is ended, apparently cut short, yet leaving a rich heritage, a rare example to those who are left behind." ...|$|E
