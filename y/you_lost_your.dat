5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and <b>you</b> <b>lost</b> <b>your</b> balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E

2500|$|O'Neal's comedy {{has been}} {{described}} as conversational. He was a provocateur, often inciting audience members to call out, or even leave the club. [...] "I've seen him give people money to leave," [...] recalls Gregg [...] "Opie" [...] Hughes. At times he would encourage people to call out to the stage in order to set up a punchline. [...] "Ladies, how would you keep your man if <b>you</b> <b>lost</b> <b>your</b> vagina?," [...] O'Neal would ask of his audience. When the women would invariably reference oral and anal sex, the comedian would respond, [...] "See, I gave you the chance to talk and you qualified yourself as a series of holes."
