50|$|Medicago falcata is a {{plant species}} of the genus Medicago. It is native to the Mediterranean basin, but is found {{throughout}} the world. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, which is capable of nitrogen fixation. Its common names include yellow lucerne, sickle alfalfa, yellow-flowered alfalfa, <b>yellow</b> <b>alfalfa,</b> sickle medick and yellow medick.|$|E
40|$|Monitoring the {{seasonal}} flights of the <b>yellow</b> <b>alfalfa</b> geometrid, Isturgia arenacearia (Denis and Schiffermuller, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), was made using home made sticky delta traps baited with pheromone caps purchased from “CSALOMON®” (Plant Protection Institute, Hungary, Budapest). The monitoring {{was conducted in}} alfalfa fields in Plovdiv, Pazardjik and Sofia regions in Bulgaria during 2007 – 2009. The flight of I. arenacearia at the investigated sites started during April and lasted {{until the end of}} August — middle of September. Two relatively well-defined peaks indicating two generations were recorded in Sofia region. Thus the flight period of the pest was defined more accurately than previously recorded and proved to be significantly longer than was known for this country. Pheromone baits, products of “CSALOMON®” (Plant Protection Institute, Hungary, Budapest), are potent and very species specific tool for detecting the presence of, and seasonal monitoring of I. arenacearia...|$|E
40|$|Two {{formulations}} of Velpar® (DF, L) were evaluated over multiple alfalfa varieties {{to compare the}} potential phytotoxic effects this product. Treatments were made April 15, with yield and stem data collected on May 10. Both Velpar® formulations resulted in <b>yellowed</b> <b>alfalfa</b> within three days of application, with symptoms disappearing by 21 days post treatment. Yield data indicated increased yields from alfalfa treated with Velpar®, due to increased numbers of stems. The reason for the stem increase associated with Velpar® usage is unknown...|$|R
40|$|There is {{relatively}} little {{information on the}} utilization of vitamin A of different sources by weanling pigs. In this test, three sources of vitamin A were used: (1) a gelatin-stabilized vitamin A product, (2) carotene as supplied by high-quality alfalfa meal, and (3) carotene and cryptoxanthin as supplied by <b>yellow</b> corn. <b>Alfalfa</b> and <b>yellow</b> corn were analyzed for carotene and crude cryptoxanthin and units of vitamin A calculated by multiplying micrograms of these carotenoid pigments by 1. 6 and 0. 8, respectively...|$|R

Effect of ethoxyquin on carotenoid HYPERTONIC carbonated and non-carbonated citrate extenders have given highest fertility in storage experi-ments with semen {{of the chicken}} (Hobbs and Harris, 1963 a,b) and turkey (Harris et al., 1963). Turkey semen stored in a C 02 citrate extender with a freezing point de-pression of — 0. 91 °C. gave highest fertil-ity. The average fertility for semen stored for 6 hours at 2 °C. in this extender was 86 %, 72 %, 71 %,, and 44 % for weeks 1 to 4 after a single insemination, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Potato {{leafhopper}} (PLH) is {{the most}} damaging alfalfa pest in the Northeast (NE). Forage grasses mixed with alfalfa can cause PLH to emigrate but may reduce forage quality. Some alfalfa cultivars have PLH-resistance, yet are not immune to PLH damage. The objectives are to compare PLH populations and densities, and forage yield and quality of a conventional alfalfa cultivar and a PLH-resistant cultivar both in monoculture and intercropped with grass, to conduct an economic analysis, and to share results in extension outreach. The PLH populations and forage growth were disappointingly low in 2007, {{in part due to}} drought conditions. In spite of this, PLH damage scores indicated that the PLH-resistant cultivars have less leaflet yellowing than the conventional alfalfa cultivars, and the alfalfa-grass mixtures have less leaflet <b>yellowing</b> than the <b>alfalfa</b> monocultures. However, at low PLH populations, these small but statistically significant differences did not translate into differences in yield between the PLH-resistant and conventional cultivars. The alfalfa-grass mixtures were significantly higher in yield than the alfalfa monocultures. Thus, results from one production year at one location, have shown that without insecticide treatment, PLH-resistant alfalfa planted with a forage grass could provide the highest forage yield...|$|R

40|$|When varying {{amounts of}} {{phosphorus}} from inorganic sources {{were added to}} a basal ration of ground yellow corn, wheat middlings and dry skimmilk, in which the amount of calcium in the various rations was held practically constant, the incidence of slipped tendon increased as the phosphorus increased. Though the trend was very definite, {{the relation between the}} amount of phosphorus in the ration and the percentage of slipped tendon was not exactly linear, indicating that factors other than the amount of phosphorus in the ration may have been operating to influence the incidence of slipped tendon. Two groups of chicks fed on the same ration at different times gave very similar growth responses, and though the incidence of slipped tendon was not of the same magnitude, the relation between the numbers of slipped tendon on the various rations remained the same. The lowest amount of phosphorus in this ration which produced slipped tendon was 0. 9 percent. When the amount of phosphorus in the ration was held practically constant at about 1. 4 percent and the calcium was fed at levels of 0. 34 percent, 1. 40 percent and 2. 26 percent there were fewer slipped tendons on the low level of calcium than on the medium and high levels. The percentage of slipped tendon on the medium and high levels of calcium was practically the same. When a basal ration of ground <b>yellow</b> corn, <b>alfalfa</b> leaf meal, dry skimmilk and ground oyster shell was fed about 24 percent of the chicks developed slipped tendon, though the phosphorus content of the ration was only 0. 43 percent. With this base, when the phosphorus content of the ration was increased to 1. 33 percent by the addition of inorganic phosphorus, the incidence of slipped tendon increased 78 percent. With nearly the same amount of phosphorus, 1. 43 percent, a ration containing 20 percent of wheat middlings in place of the alfalfa leaf meal and part of the corn in the above base produced only about 45 percent of slipped tendon. A ration in which the wheat middlings were replaced by rice bran produced no slipped tendon at all. The percentage of ash in the dry, fat-free femurs, tibiae and metatarsi of chicks afflicted with slipped tendon did not differ significantly from that of the corresponding bones of chicks of the same age on a control ration. The ash of femurs of chicks 10 weeks of age on a ration containing only 0. 36 percent of calcium and 0. 59 percent of phosphorus was significantly lower than that of chicks of the same age on a control ration, but was not as low as the figures generally given for the ash content of the bones of rachitic chicks. The percentage of ash in the femurs of chicks which received a ration containing 3 percent of magnesium carbonate was significantly lower than than of chicks on the same ration without the magnesium carbonate...|$|R
