60|$|But <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> {{that the}} little sinners must stand by until the great ones have {{received}} their grace, and that is discouraging! I answer, there are two sorts of little sinners--such as are so, and such as feign themselves so. There are those that feign themselves so, that I intended there, and not those that are, indeed, comparatively so. Such as feign themselves so, may wait long enough before they obtain forgiveness.|$|E

6000|$|... "Certainly, lad; {{but this}} is a horrible business. If it had been merely an {{ordinary}} quarrel the colonel would have interfered to stop it, but after what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> us all, and with strangers present too, I am afraid it must go on. You must be mad, lad. I have not seen you shoot since that first evening when we went down, and two or three times shortly afterwards. Woodall told me that you were getting on well; but however well you may have got on, you can be no match with a pistol for a man like Marshall; and you may be sure he won't spare you after so public an affront." ...|$|E
6000|$|I found presently, {{that whether}} I was a whore or a wife, I was to {{pass for a}} whore here, so I let that go. I {{told her it was}} true, as she said, but that, however, if I must tell her my case, I must tell it her as it was; so I related it to her as short as I could, and I {{concluded}} it to her thus. 'I trouble you with all this, madam,' said I, 'not that, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> it is much to the purpose in your affair, but this is to the purpose, namely, that I am not in any pain about being seen, or being public or concealed, for 'tis perfectly indifferent to me; but my difficulty is, that I have no acquaintance {{in this part of the}} nation.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said I, [...] "I am {{not such}} a fool but I know pretty well what I have to look for. Let the worst come to the worst, it's little I care. I've seen too many die since I fell in with you. But there's {{a thing or two}} I have to tell you," [...] I said, and by this time I was quite excited; [...] "and the first is this: here you are, in a bad way: ship lost, {{treasure}} lost, men lost; your whole business gone to wreck; {{and if you want to}} know who did it--it was I! I was in the apple-barrel the night we sighted land, and I heard you, John, and you, Dick Johnson, and Hands, who is now at the bottom of the sea, and told every word <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> the hour was out. And as for the schooner, it was I who cut her cable, and it was I that killed the men you had aboard of her, and it was I who brought her where you'll never see her more, not one of you. The laugh's on my side; I've had the top of this business from the first; I no more fear you than I fear a fly. Kill me, if you please, or spare me. But one thing I'll say, and no more: if you spare me, bygones are bygones, and when you fellows are in court for piracy, I'll save you all I can. It is for you to choose. Kill another and do yourselves no good, or spare me and keep a witness to save you from the gallows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like you}} for that answer," [...] she said. [...] "Yes; more than for all <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> because I {{know that it is}} true. Indeed, you are an honourable knight, and I am proud--very proud--that you should love me, though perhaps {{it would have been better}} otherwise." [...] And ever so little she bent the knee to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, now {{you mention}} it, {{it does look}} a little odd from here," [...] he said; [...] "naked, rather. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> so <b>before,</b> <b>you</b> remember, and I told them to plant the shrubs; but while I was away they let {{every one of the}} poor things die. I will ask my architect, Jenkins, if he can't do anything; it might be pulled down, perhaps." ...|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from these}} {{perceived}} moral failings of the Reformers, Erasmus also dreaded {{any change in}} doctrine, citing {{the long history of}} the Church as a bulwark against innovation. In book I of his Hyperaspistes he puts the matter bluntly to Luther:We are dealing with this: Would a stable mind depart from the opinion handed down by so many men famous for holiness and miracles, depart from the decisions of the Church, and commit our souls to the faith of someone like you who has sprung up just now with a few followers, although the leading men of your flock do not agree either with you or among themselves - indeed though you do not even agree with yourself, since in this same Assertion you say one thing in the beginning and something else later on, recanting what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This moves {{onto another}} track called [...] "They Don't Give" [...] a [...] "sultry" [...] Babyface {{produced}} ballad that is [...] "reminiscent of any early â€™90s track that had Babyface behind the pen". Lyrically {{it talks about}} a being in a relationship and not caring what anyone from the outside has to say, even though no body else understands [...] "They Don't Give an eff about us", They don't know anything about their love. Eighth in the album, is the adult contemporary-influenced, [...] "Left.... Right?". Crada produced the vibey record, which centres on a conversation of a lover asking the other all these questions, expecting an answer but not getting the answer they want. [...] "I'll find {{my way back to}} you / That's what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> you left....right? / I was the one you'd run to / The only one that you had left....right?".|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't <b>you</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>before,</b> it was I," [...] {{returned}} Hans, [...] "but we {{must make}} allowance for your state of mind. And now, as we're nearing the camp, what is it to be--silence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right!" [...] was {{the cool}} answer. [...] "I expect the game's up, and I'm {{quite ready to}} buy them of you. By the way, partner, you helped your boss to pull me out, didn't <b>you?</b> As I <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> I'm not great on swimming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. <b>You</b> have <b>said</b> that <b>before.</b> But do you {{not think}} {{that you would be}} far wiser, instead of {{directing}} your undivided attention to my unworthy self, to turn your thoughts a little to one whom, believe me, you have far greater cause to fear?" ...|$|R

Miss Dorothy Six 8 Brookside AvePelham, 65 New York [Transcription begins]:STEWART FIELDNEWBURGH, NEW YORK Monday 2015 My Dearest Dottie, Hello, how are you? It seems I havenâ€™t {{seen you}} in months, darling, and itâ€™s only been about twenty-eight hours. Every one seems to get longer and longer. Did you get to bed early Sunday night, young lady? Youâ€™d better have, {{you must have been}} tired, I know I was. Iâ€™m going to hit the sack right after I mail this. I feel like the wreck of the Hesperus. Did you have any snow down thar in New York? We had our first snow squall today, and man, is it cold. I was flying the first period this morning, and I could see the storm coming in from the North West like a huge white curtain. It was the first time I ever saw a snow storm from the air. It didnâ€™t stick though, but it was snow. I knew {{something}} important had to happen this week. Iâ€™ve been looking over the financial situation, hon, and allowing for everything, a small amount of recreation included, I ought to have $ 4. 38 saved by March if I budget myself very carefully. Not bad for me, eh? But seriously, angel, itâ€™s not as bad as all that. Iâ€™ve got some pretty good ideas as to how to raise some money, and I was talking to a fellow here that just bought an engagement and a wedding ring, and theyâ€™re not too expensive, at least not $ 500. But as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> you donâ€™t get married every day, so by God weâ€™re going to have the best. But most of all, darling, I want you to be happy. If there is ever any doubt in your mind, just let me know. Weâ€™ve still got {{a lot of things to}} settle, hon. I want to have a long talk with you this weekend. Oh by the way, have you told your father yet? I wonder what heâ€™ll have to say. Maybe I better send him another carton of cigarettes. Well hon, the sergeant just finished drawing my bath, I donâ€™t want to keep him waiting. Give my best to your family. Your mother is really marvelous. I love you. Take care of yourself and get some sleep. I think of you always honey, and miss you terribly. All my loveJudd[Transcription ends...|$|E
