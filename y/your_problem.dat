500|$|Dinklage has {{a form of}} dwarfism, achondroplasia, {{which affects}} bone growth. As a result, he is [...] tall, with a typical-sized head and torso but short limbs. While Dinklage has come to accept his condition, he {{sometimes}} found it challenging when growing up. In 2003, he {{said that when he}} was younger he was often angry and bitter about his condition, but as he got older, he realized that he [...] "just ha {{to have a sense of}} humor", to know [...] "that it's not <b>your</b> <b>problem.</b> It's theirs." [...] When asked in 2012 whether he saw himself as [...] "a spokesman for the rights of little people", Dinklage responded: [...] "I don't know what I would say. Everyone's different. Every person my size has a different life, a different history. Different ways of dealing with it. Just because I'm seemingly okay with it, I can't preach how to be okay with it." [...] Dinklage has been viewed as a role model for people sharing his condition.|$|E
500|$|As {{the exact}} nature of Poison's status as gender-variant has been left {{deliberately}} ambiguous by Capcom, the topic has remained a popular subject for debate among fans and gaming media alike. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Eric L. Patterson described her as being a significant character to the trans community, and a perfect example of how it is [...] "so awkward when it comes to knowing how to deal with characters who aren't white, male, and heterosexual" [...] in video games. Complex pointed her out as an example of stereotypical depiction of trans hookers, listing Poison among The 15 Most Stereotypical Characters in Video Games. GamesRadar commented [...] "Poison holds a distinction as one of gaming’s first trans characters, which began as a strange choice in localization but has {{become a part of the}} character that she wears with pride. If you take issue with it, that’s <b>your</b> <b>problem,</b> not hers. It's that kind of confidence that makes her so appealing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perkins {{plays the}} protagonist Sara, a {{veterinarian}} {{who has not}} told her parents she is gay. The comedian told Lockyer that while viewers would assume that the character is based on herself, she only used [...] "trace elements" [...] of her own story for Sara. Perkins said [...] "She's a professional, grown-up woman, with a responsible job as a vet. She has a great bunch of friends, most of them heterosexual, {{and all of them}} are saying, 'What's <b>your</b> <b>problem?</b> No one cares! Tell your bloody parents.'" [...] Heading Out marks Perkins' acting debut.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{into their}} tenure at XM, they held Assault on the Media {{promotions}} {{led by the}} Pests, a group of fans of the show that helped to give the show additional exposure. One such incident took place on May 19, 2005, when show intern Nathaniel disrupted a news report by Arthur Chi'en on live television, making risque gestures while holding an Opie and Anthony sign, which caused Chi'en to shout [...] "What the fuck is <b>your</b> <b>problem,</b> man?" [...] on the air. Chi'en made a live apology, but was fired a few hours later. The incident brought the show nationwide press. Hughes and Cumia announced the campaign's end in December 2005, after a fan disrupted a live report by Anthony Johnson with an air horn and a show sign. The two claimed the campaign had gone too far, and had run its course.|$|E
2500|$|Kricfalusi {{originally}} voiced Ren in {{a manner}} that he describes as [...] "a bad imitation of Peter Lorre." [...] Billy West said that he auditioned to play Ren; the creators of the series believed that having West—who was also voicing the title character in fellow charter Nicktoon Doug at the time—voice both Ren and Stimpy would give him too large of a workload. West voiced Ren after Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi; Kricfalusi would return for the Spike TV episodes and unaired episodes of The Ren & Stimpy Show. Chris Edgerly would voice the character in the game Nicktoons MLB though. In the pilot episode, Pierre Decelles provided Ren's signature diabolical laughter, while West performed Ren's laugh in the series. His catchphrase is [...] "You eediot", and he also uses variations of [...] "What is <b>your</b> <b>problem,</b> you sick little monkey?", which is similar to a quote by Lorre in The Maltese Falcon: [...] "You... you imbecile. You bloated idiot. You stupid fat-head, you." ...|$|E

One thing was unfortunate: 'the able Mr. Moor [meritorious Captain of Foot, who, by accident, had spent some study on his business], the one real Engineer we had,' got killed in that Boca-Chica struggle: an end to poor Moor! So that the Siege of Carthagena {{will have to go}} on WITHOUT Engineer science henceforth. May be important, that,--who knows? Another thing was still more palpably important: Sea-General Vernon had an undisguised contempt for Land-General Wentworth. 'A mere blockhead, whose Brother has a Borough,' thinks Vernon (himself an Opposition Member, of high-sniffing, angry, not too magnanimous turn);--and withdraws now to his Ships; intimating: 'Do <b>your</b> <b>Problem,</b> then; I have set you down beside it, which was my part of the affair!'--Let us give the attack of Fort Lazar, and end this sad business.|$|E

6000|$|A great drift at {{the foot}} of the cliff saved me. I picked myself up, fearfully bruised but with nothing broken, found my rifle and limped away four miles through the woods to the road, {{thinking}} as I went that I was well served for having delivered the deer [...] "from the power of the dog," [...] only to take advantage of their long run to secure a head that my skill had failed to win. I wondered, with an extra twinge in my limp, whether I had saved Old Wally by taking the chase out of his hands unceremoniously. Above all, I wondered--and here I would gladly follow another trail over the same ground--whether the noble beast, grown weary with running, his splendid strength failing for the first time, and his little, long-tended flock ready to give in and have the tragedy over, knew just what he was doing in mincing along the cliff's edge with his heedless enemy close behind. What did he think and feel, looking back from his hiding, and what did his loud whistle mean? But that is always the despair of studying the wild things. When <b>your</b> <b>problem</b> is almost solved, night comes and the trail ends.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{spoke of}} the whole church of Christ on earth," [...] he went on. [...] "These things, these Victorias and Edwards and so on, are {{temporary}} accidents--just as the severance of an Anglican from a Roman communion and a Greek orthodox communion are temporary accidents. You will remark that wise men in all ages {{have been able to}} surmount the difficulty of these things. Why? Because they knew that in spite of all these splits and irregularities and defacements--like the cracks and crannies and lichens on a cathedral wall--the building held good, that it was shelter and security. There is no other shelter and security. And so I come to <b>your</b> <b>problem.</b> Suppose it is true that you have this incidental vision of the militant aspect of God, and he isn't, as you see him now that is,--he isn't like the Trinity, he isn't like the Creed, he doesn't seem {{to be related to the}} Church, then comes the question, are you going out for that? And whither do you go if you do go out? The Church remains. We alter doctrines not by changing the words but by shifting the accent. We can under-accentuate below the threshold of consciousness." ...|$|E
6000|$|I will suppose, therefore, {{that all}} the {{habitable}} part of this globe--the dry land, amounting to about 51,000,000 square miles,--I will suppose that the whole of that dry land has the same climate, {{and that it is}} composed of the same kind of rock or soil, so that there will be the same station everywhere; we thus get rid of the peculiar influence of different climates and stations. I will then imagine that there shall be but one organic being in the world, and that shall be a plant. In this we start fair. Its food is to be carbonic acid, water and ammonia, and the saline matters in the soil, which are, by the supposition, everywhere alike. We take one single plant, with no opponents, no helpers, and no rivals; {{it is to be a}} [...] "fair field, and no favour". Now, I will ask you to imagine further that it shall be a plant which shall produce every year fifty seeds, which is a very moderate number for a plant to produce; and that, by the action of the winds and currents, these seeds shall be equally and gradually distributed over the whole surface of the land. I want you now to trace out what will occur, and you will observe that I am not talking fallaciously any more than a mathematician does when he expounds his problem. If you show that the conditions of <b>your</b> <b>problem</b> are such as may actually occur in nature and do not transgress any of the known laws of nature in working out your proposition, then you are as safe in the conclusion you arrive at as is the mathematician in arriving at the solution of his problem. In science, the only way of getting rid of the complications with which a subject of this kind is environed, is to work in this deductive method. What will be the result, then? I will suppose that every plant requires one square foot of ground to live upon; and the result will be that, in the course of nine years, the plant will have occupied every single available spot in the whole globe! I have chalked upon the blackboard the figures by which I arrive at the result:-- ...|$|E
