So you would actually get a tax cut on that part. If your revenue is above 250, then from 250 down, <b>your</b> <b>taxes</b> {{are going to stay}} the same. It is true that, say for 250 up— from 250 to 300 or so, so for that additional amount, you'd go from 36 to 39 percent, which is what it was under Bill Clinton." ...|$|E

[...] (He is a member of the advisory board of the Marijuana Policy Project.) Elsewhere, he has stated, [...] "My feeling is this whole country is founded on the principle of 'If you are not hurting anyone, and you're not fucking with someone else's shit, and you are paying <b>your</b> <b>taxes,</b> you should be able to just do what you want to do.' It's the freedom and the independence." [...] In an interview with Reason TV, Carolla described his views as libertarian.|$|E

6000|$|Whatever you {{may think}} about politics, you must at least, in justice to his Majesty's Government, {{recognise}} that their position is perfectly plain and clear. Some of you may say to me, [...] "Your course, your policy may be clear enough, but you are burdening wealth too heavily by <b>your</b> <b>taxes</b> and by your speeches." [...] Those shocking speeches! [...] "You are driving capital out of the country." [...] Let us look at these points one at a time. The capital wealth of Britain is increasing rapidly. Sir Robert Giffen estimated some {{years ago that the}} addition to the capital wealth of the nation was at least between two hundred and three hundred millions a year. I notice that the paid-up capital of registered companies alone, which was 1,013 millions sterling in 1893, has grown naturally and healthily to 2,123 millions sterling in 1908. And, most remarkable of all, the figures I shall submit to you, the gross amount of income which comes under the view of the Treasury Commissioners who are charged with the collection of income-tax, was in the year 1898-9 762 millions, and it had risen from that figure to 980 millions sterling in the year 1908-9: that is to say, that it had risen by 218 millions in the course of ten years.|$|E
60|$|Well, then, {{it is said}} <b>your</b> <b>taxes</b> fall {{too heavily}} upon the {{agricultural}} landowner and the country gentleman. Now, there is no grosser misrepresentation of the Budget than that it hits the agricultural landowner, and I think few greater disservices {{can be done to}} the agricultural landowner, whose property has in the last thirty years in many cases declined in value, than to confuse him with the ground landlord in a great city, who has netted enormous sums through the growth and the needs {{of the population of the}} city. None of the new land taxes touch agricultural land, while it remains agricultural land. No cost of the system of valuation which we are going to carry into effect will fall at all upon the individual owner of landed property. He will not be burdened in any way by these proposals. On the contrary, now that an amendment has been accepted permitting death duties to be paid in land in certain circumstances, the owner of a landed estate, instead of encumbering his estate by raising the money to pay off the death duties, can cut a portion from his estate; and this in many cases will be a sensible relief. Secondly, we have given to agricultural landowners a substantial concession in regard to the deductions which they are permitted to make from income-tax assessment on account of the money which they spend as good landlords upon the upkeep of their properties, and we have raised the limit of deduction from 12½ per cent. to 25 per cent. Thirdly, there is the Development Bill--that flagrant Socialistic measure which passed a second reading in the House of Lords unanimously--which will help all the countryside and all classes of agriculturists, and which will help the landlord in the country among the rest. So much for that charge.|$|E
