500|$|The critics {{seem to be}} full {{of praise}} for your style and ability to draw word {{pictures}} but the decent ones always regret that you should use such great gifts in perpetuating the lives and habits of so degraded a strata of humanity.... It is a doubtful honor to produce one of the filthiest books of the year.... What is the matter? Have you ceased to be interested in nobility, honor and fineness in life?.... Surely <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> words in your vocabulary than [...] "damn" [...] and [...] "bitch"â€”Every page fills me with a sick loathing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah--now--if I could {{but have}} had more--but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> engagements--I could not ask it--or even to come again to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I would not, sir; once {{will suffice}} {{for such an}} explanation; still am I persuaded <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> reasons for your words." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} known she was false to me," [...] she said bitterly, [...] "and that you would wheedle her soul away as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>others.</b> Well, she betrayed me! For what?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't think that! I {{know what}} an effort {{it was to}} you to answer me at all. Yes, indeed! I wonder whether I may ask something. The sorrow <b>you</b> <b>have</b> just told me of {{is not the only}} one--is it? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> troubles?" ...|$|R
25|$|<b>You</b> <b>have</b> no <b>other</b> choice, <b>you</b> must go on.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} Jerry and I {{will be able}} to get hold of him, and we will go back at once, unless <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> work for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellent!" [...] he remarked. [...] "Pray do not {{trouble to}} stay with me, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> matters to attend to. I have both time and {{patience}} to spare." ...|$|E
6000|$|Seeing her troubled face, he added, [...] "There, I don't ask you {{to decide}} right here. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> claims to adjust. Take time to think it over." ...|$|E
30|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any <b>other</b> {{comments}} for the course? Please be specific.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see how it}} was done," [...] Miller repeated. [...] "Certainly she did {{not rise}} from her chair, not for an instant, and yet {{to believe that she}} did not have a hand in what took place is to admit the impossible. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> {{sittings}} with her, haven't you? You believe in her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Enough," [...] said Colonel Singleton, with dignity. [...] "You {{have the}} noble {{acknowledgment}} of a gentleman, {{what more can}} you obtain from this slave?--Captain Wharton, you perceive the unfortunate impression against <b>you.</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>other</b> testimony to adduce?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Emily smiled. [...] "I doubt it, {{while he}} is in this house," [...] she said. [...] "You are as rich as Francine--and don't forget that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> attractions as well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} think so," [...] she murmured, {{with a very}} sweet {{answering}} light in her eyes, [...] "but I am hoping that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> things to tell me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are lots}} of things I can't do, and it's not your fault that you were raised back in the old country, where <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> folks to put the patches on to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} {{in a very short}} time Spanish ships may arrive at your ports, and will open trade with your people. I wonder that they have not, long since, found their way here. Trade would be beneficent to both. They have many {{commodities}} that would be most useful to <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>others</b> that they would prize greatly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In that respect, she {{had nothing}} to {{complain}} of. Of course, you did not notice it, as <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> things to think of, but it was handsomely furnished. There was a bed in an alcove, some flowers on the table, some books, and even a harpsichord--evidently it was intended that her imprisonment should be made as light as might be.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no {{understanding}} you, Laura," [...] said Mr. Kennedy, angrily. [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> quite <b>other</b> hopes about Miss Effingham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's not my fault. I didn't {{make the}} universe," [...] said Alvina. [...] "If {{you have to}} be torn to pieces by forces, well, <b>you</b> <b>have.</b> <b>Other</b> forces will put you {{together}} again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "your {{life must}} not be the life of our dear friend. The service on which the Church employs Penrose is not the fit service for you. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> claims on us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> views {{for your}} son," [...] said Dr. Woodford, [...] "and I trust that my niece {{has too much}} {{discretion}} and sense of propriety {{to think that they}} can be interfered with on her account." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not wish}} you to feel it, nor would you do so long if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> people around <b>you.</b> With me it is different. I am an old man, and cannot look for new pleasures in society. It has been the fault {{of my life to}} be too much alone. I {{do not want to see}} my {{children}} follow me in that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were all}} {{thinking}} {{of going to}} the lake this morning," [...] said Laura. [...] "But if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any <b>other</b> arrangement to propose----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what about}} yourself?" [...] Trent asked. [...] "I imagine <b>you</b> <b>have</b> some <b>other</b> purpose in taking this voyage than just {{to argue with}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY K.--Yes, as I find it, when I come to {{take care}} of my departed, angel's children, Mrs. Bonnington--[pointing to picture]--of THAT dear seraph's orphans, Mrs. Bonnington. YOU cannot. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> duties--other children--a husband at home in {{delicate}} health, who-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is beside}} the question," [...] {{she said at}} last with indifference. [...] "I can defend myself, but I refuse to do any dirty work for you--or for France. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> means at your disposal; you must use them, my friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me," [...] said Major Bellenden, taking Claverhouse by the arm, {{and turning}} {{him away from}} the ladies, [...] "but I am anxious for my friends; I fear <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> and more {{important}} loss. I observe another officer carries your nephew's standard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am most {{flattered by}} your {{interest}} in me," [...] she declared. [...] "Pray consider Mr. Englehall disposed of. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> some <b>other</b> plans, perhaps?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Apart {{from the}} fact of his {{acquaintance}} with Anna--Annabel," [...] Lady Ferringhall said quickly, [...] "may I ask if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any <b>other</b> objection to Mr. Ennison?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} ask it then," [...] he said. [...] "I thought that <b>you</b> might <b>have</b> <b>other</b> {{business}} in the neighbourhood. Preaching off, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{not like}} that in England; I was at the Company's office," [...] Don Ramon agreed. [...] "All was in stern order, but in this country <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> rules. Well, it is not important. To-night you join your steamer; I will tell you your duties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She never {{ought to}} have gone there," [...] Miss Amory answered. [...] "She won't go again. It was very foolish: very wrong: it was only play. Besides, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> consolations at home," [...] she added, looking him full in the face an instant, and {{dropping}} her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|The consul looked {{steadily}} {{at him for}} a moment. Such stupidity was by {{no means}} phenomenal, nor at all inconsistent with his appearance. [...] "And," [...] continued the consul gravely, [...] "I must tell you that, unless <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> proofs than you have shown, it will be my duty to give you up to the authorities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no <b>other</b> plans, {{will you}} come and stay with me? We are very quiet people, but <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> an {{opportunity}} of understanding something {{of the kind of}} life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There seems little {{necessity}} for bloodshed," [...] I answered [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the <b>other</b> pistol, {{do not use}} it unnecessarily; we may want it for the boat----" ...|$|R
5000|$|To keep an ocean's economy going, most items age. When {{a certain}} amount of time passes, the item will have [...] "aged" [...] and it [...] "crumbles to dust", disappearing completely. As an exception, tops and pants turn into rags if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no <b>other</b> {{clothing}} of that type, and swords will turn into a stick if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no <b>other</b> sword. Sticks do not age, although rags do. To sell a stick, <b>you</b> must <b>have</b> another sword besides a stick.(Few people in the general market will actually buy a stick.) The conditions, in order from newest to oldest is: New, good, old.|$|R
