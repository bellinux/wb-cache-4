5|$|Published posthumously, The Autobiography of MalcolmX is {{an account}} of the life of MalcolmX, born Malcolm Little (1925–1965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book {{describes}} Malcolm's childhood in Michigan, {{the death of his father}} under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her commitment to a psychiatric hospital. Little's <b>young</b> <b>adulthood</b> in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in organized crime. This led to his arrest and subsequent eight- to ten-year prison sentence, of which he served six-and-a-half years (1946–1952). The book addresses his ministry with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam (1952–1963) and his emergence as the organization's national spokesman. It documents his disillusionment with and departure from the Nation of Islam in March 1964, his pilgrimage to Mecca, which catalyzed his conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam, and his travels in Africa. MalcolmX was assassinated in New York's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965, before they finished the book. His co-author, journalist Alex Haley, summarizes the last days of MalcolmX's life, and describes in detail their working agreement, including Haley's personal views on his subject, in the Autobiography's epilogue.|$|E

40|$|Background: Emotional {{intelligence}} (EI) is {{the ability}} to perceive, integrate, understand and regulate emotions and has the potential for serving as a theoretical basis for understanding how to enhance task performance (TP) through the role of emotions. Previous research highlights countless benefits of EI, specifically in relation to performance outcomes. Objective: The aim of the current study was to explore potential interaction effects of EI, Mental Workload (MWL) and age on performance outcomes of a cognitive task and whether EI or age influenced the perception of MWL. Method: A 3 (Emotional Intelligence: low, average, and high) x 3 (Mental Workload: easy, medium, and hard) x 3 (Age: <b>younger</b> <b>adulthood,</b> middle adulthood, and older adulthood) mixed design was employed where EI and age were between-subjects’ variables and MWL was the within subjects’ variable. Results: A significant effect of MWL, which finds performance decreases as MWL increases. A significant effect of age was found, whereby errors made increased with age. There was a significant interaction between MWL and age revealing that older adulthood consistently made more errors than <b>younger</b> <b>adulthood</b> across all levels of MWL. A significant effect of EI, whereby participants high in EI made the most errors. A significant interaction between EI and age and a significant effect of EI on subjective MWL which finds perceptions of workload decreases as EI increases. Conclusions: Two major novel findings emerged from this study. First, performance outcomes were worse for those highest in EI. Second, <b>younger</b> <b>adulthood</b> with average EI made the least amount of errors on the task. These findings are not consistent with the body of literature regarding EI and performance...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVEdCarbohydrate {{nutrition}} {{during periods}} of physiological insulin resistance such as puberty may affect future risk of type 2 diabetes. This study examined whether the amount or the quality (dietary glycemic index [GI], glycemic load [GL], and added sugar, fiber, and whole-grain intake) of carbohydrates during puberty is associated with riskmarkers of type 2 diabetes in <b>younger</b> <b>adulthood.</b> RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdThe analysis was based on 226 participants (121 girls and 105 boys) from the Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed Study (DONALD) {{with an average of}} five 3 -day weighed dietary records (range 2 – 6) during puberty (girls, age 9 – 14 years; boys, age 10 – 15 years) and fasting blood samples in <b>younger</b> <b>adulthood</b> (age 18 – 36 years) (average duration of follow-up 12. 6 years).

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} alternative investment {{policies and}} their {{consequences for the}} evolution of human capital in Europe based on a model of age dependent skill formation where the life span depends on investments during childhood. What makes the approach special is the analysis of the returns to education of alternative educational policies targeted at certain ages, countries, or productivity levels for two counterfactual policy regimes, one regime assuming the actual state of diversity and the other a unified Europe. Our results indicate that investments need to be directed more generally to people of younger ages in Europe. If equality is important enough additional investment should specifically be directed to disadvantaged individuals during childhood. Furthermore, high levels of life cycle income inequality and a high skill level increase the optimal amount of investments during <b>younger</b> <b>adulthood.</b> In a unified Europe, the effectiveness of policies to reduce inequality would be higher.
