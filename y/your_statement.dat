2500|$|Haneef's {{legal team}} lodged an appeal against this {{decision}} with the Federal Court. In the preliminary hearing, Justice Spender described as [...] "absolutely astounding" [...] the government's argument that mere association with a suspected criminal means a non-citizen fails the character {{test for the}} purposes of his visa, stating that even he could not pass the character test as he had represented murderers in the past: “Unfortunately, I would fail the character test on <b>your</b> <b>statement</b> because I have been associated with persons suspected of criminal conduct,” adding ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the confirmation hearings, an FBI interview with Anita Hill was leaked and the confirmation hearings were reopened. Hill, a black attorney, had worked for Thomas at the Department of Education and had subsequently moved with Thomas to the EEOC. After the leak, Hill was called to testify at Thomas's confirmation hearings. She testified that Thomas had subjected her to comments of a sexual nature, which she felt constituted sexual harassment or at least [...] "behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will {{be a member of the}} Court.""Q: Professor Hill, there's a big difference between your articulating your version of events, contrasted with <b>your</b> <b>statement</b> that Judge Thomas sexually harassed you. And in the transcript of your October 7 interview, you responded to a question saying that it was sexual harassment.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the fighting, the division was used as political bargaining chip (among other arguments) during a series of back and forth telegrams between Churchill and Prime Minister of Australia John Curtin, discussing the possibility of diverting Australian troops to Burma rather than being allowed to return home. On 20 February, Churchill sent a telegram in which, he stated [...] "...your message of January 23, in which you said that the evacuation of Singapore would be 'an inexcusable betrayal'. Agreeably with your point of view, we therefore put the 18th Division ... into Singapore instead of diverting them to Burma, and ordered them to fight it out to the end. They were lost at Singapore and did not save it, whereas they could almost certainly have saved Rangoon. I take full responsibility with my colleagues on the Defence Committe for this decision; but you also bear a heavy share on account of your telegram." [...] Two days later, Curtin retorted [...] "In regard to <b>your</b> <b>statement</b> that the 18th Division was diverted from Burma to Singapore because of our message, it is pointed out that the date of the latter was January 23, whereas in your telegram of January 14 you informed me that one brigade of this division was due on January 13 and the remainder on January 27." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prisoner, you {{can either}} go into the witness box and make <b>your</b> <b>statement</b> on oath, {{in which case you}} may be cross-examined on it; or you can make <b>your</b> <b>statement</b> there from the dock, in which case you will not be cross-examined.

6000|$|... "I am sure <b>your</b> <b>statements</b> are justified, Mr. Merrick." [...] Yet Hedrik Von Taer's face, usually unexpressive, denoted blank mystification. What {{connection}} could {{these girls}} {{have with the}} favor to be demanded? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Burch left us the {{property}} {{you know all}} about, since you stole the deeds to it. Louis Vorlange, you are playing a deep part but you cannot make me swallow <b>your</b> <b>statements</b> about my father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miriam!" [...] exclaimed Ralph, [...] "you astonish me by {{the force}} of <b>your</b> <b>statements.</b> Wait here one moment," [...] and he ran into the hall through which he had seen Cicely passing, and {{presently}} reappeared with her.|$|R

6000|$|... "If I believed," [...] he said, [...] "that {{there was}} any chance of <b>your</b> <b>statements</b> being accepted, I am afraid I should be compelled, in all our interests, to ask Doctor Sarson to pursue just a step further that {{experiment}} into the anatomy of your brain with which he has already trifled." ...|$|R
5000|$|Represent {{yourself}} in <b>your</b> <b>statements,</b> saying [...] "I", not [...] "we" [...] or [...] "one".
