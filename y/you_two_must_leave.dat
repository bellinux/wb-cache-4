6000|$|... "Dear me," [...] {{said the}} old gentleman, [...] "we {{began to think that}} <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> have been out canoeing and got yourselves drowned in good earnest this time. What have you been doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mustn't go yet," [...] said Mrs. Walshingham, {{rising and}} taking his hand. [...] "I'm sure <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> have heaps {{to say to}} each other," [...] and so she escaped towards the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we'll {{still find}} him at Le Portel--I shall {{know how to}} lay hands on him; but <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> get aboard the Day-Dream at once, for Ffoulkes and I can always look after ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I will dance this one," [...] said Mrs. Peagrim surprisingly. [...] "I'm sure <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> {{have ever}} {{so much to}} talk about. Why don't you take Sir Derek {{and give him a}} cup of coffee?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What?' said Mrs. Vansuythen, with a hysterical little laugh. 'Kurrell! Oh, it can't be! <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> {{have made}} some horrible mistake. Perhaps you you lost your temper, or misunderstood, or something. Things can't be as wrong as you say.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And while we're here {{together}} in this room <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> sit over near the window," [...] he concluded. [...] "You've tried to kill the boy once to-night; but you're {{not going to try}} it again--I'm taking care of him now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What?" [...] said Mrs. Vansuythen, with an hysterical little laugh. [...] "Kurrell! Oh, it can't be. <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> {{have made}} some horrible mistake. Perhaps you--you lost your temper, or misunderstood, or something. Things can't be as wrong as you say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, by Heaven, {{he speaks}} well!" [...] said the black cavalier; [...] "one of <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> go carry {{the news to}} Lord Seyton and Lord Arbroath, that they hasten not their {{horsemen}} on before the foot, but advance more regularly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Before {{they reached}} it Mrs. Travers {{appeared}} to them. [...] "Still {{looking at the}} roses?" [...] {{she said with a}} laugh. [...] "How fond of flowers <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> be! Can <b>you</b> spare us another ten minutes before keeping your appointment, Captain Horton, and sing us one of your songs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Standing up.) I've {{had enough}} of this. The thing must be settled, and I leave it to you, Knox. Go on with your love-making. But I won't be a witness to it. Perhaps I--er--retard the--er--the flame process. <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> make up your minds, {{and you can do}} it better without me. I am going to get a drink and settle my nerves. I'll be back in a minute.|$|R
6000|$|It was Melbury's. He had {{returned}} sooner than they expected, and now {{came up to}} them. Grace's hand had been withdrawn like lightning on her hearing the second command. [...] "I don't blame you--I don't blame you," [...] he said, in the weary cadence of one broken down with scourgings. [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> walk together no more--I have been surprised--I have been cruelly deceived--Giles, don't say anything to me; but go away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The giant's castle {{is not far}} now,' he said, 'but when {{we reach}} it <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> remain outside while I go and fetch the princess. Directly I bring her out you must both catch hold of her tight, and get away {{as fast as you}} can; while I return to the castle and talk to the giants--for there are many of them--so that they may not notice the escape of the princess.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 15th century two {{legitimate}} sons of Hector Odhar, then Lord of Duart Castle on the Isle of Mull, {{and of the}} Kingdom of the Western Isles, fought against their father in battle and lost. It is said that Clan Law prescribed that these <b>two</b> <b>must</b> <b>leave</b> the Isles, and be denounced from the Clan. This involved the dropping of the [...] "Mac" [...] from their name (Meaning [...] "son of") and getting as far away, from possible later retribution, as was possible. One son {{was supposed to have}} {{made his way to the}} East, i.e. Edinburgh or Glasgow, whilst the other was said to have [...] "left a trail a mile wide" [...] and traveled as far south as it was possible to go - to Cornwall.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come,' {{cried the}} cheerful voice of Synesius, 'come, Aben-Ezra; you have knelt for Augustine's blessing already, {{and now you}} must enter into the {{fruition}} of it. Come, <b>you</b> <b>two</b> philosophers <b>must</b> know each other. Most holy, I entreat you to preach to this friend of mine, at once the wisest and the foolishest of men.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Brian {{tries to}} kill Paula, Dwight, and a math {{teacher in the}} school, and the janitor happens to be around at the time. Every {{classroom}} they run into, Brian starts talking to Paula and the math teacher through the PA in the principal's office. Paula still thinks that Dwight is the killer, and she is still running from him. Soon Brian goes into the classroom after hacking the math teacher to death. Dwight enters and gets Brian off of Paula, and they run out to the shop class and hide after Brian exclaims, [...] "YOU'RE A YANKEE DOODLE DANDY TOO; <b>YOU</b> <b>TWO</b> <b>MUST</b> KILL OR DIE!" [...] Brian knows they are in there, so he follows them while locking them in and turning on all the equipment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dr. and Mrs. Grantly {{will have}} gone {{in a couple of}} days, and then we must get you down here. Miss Grantly is to remain for Christmas, and <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>must</b> become bosom friends." [...] Lucy smiled, and tried to look pleased, but she felt that she and Griselda Grantly could never be bosom friends--could never have {{anything}} in common between them. She felt sure that Griselda despised her, little, brown, plain, and unimportant as she was. She herself could not despise Griselda in turn; indeed she could not but admire Miss Grantly's great beauty and dignity of demeanour; but she knew that she could never love her. It is hardly possible that the proud-hearted should love those who despise them; and Lucy Robarts was very proud-hearted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind that. I {{must start}} for England almost immediately. I haven't above {{an hour or}} <b>two.</b> <b>You</b> <b>must</b> see that man, O'Hara, without me." ...|$|R
5000|$|The show is {{presented}} by Aidan Power and Baz Ashmawy and the judges are Bibi Baskin, Dublin restaurateur Derry Clarke and Castle Leslie hotelier Sammy Leslie. Each night the public {{are invited to}} vote for the contestant they would like to stay in the show. At {{the end of the show}} one of the contestants must [...] "check out". The presenters tell each of the contestants individually if they are [...] "safe" [...] and if so are ordered [...] "back to work". The three remaining contestants are then marched into the Oliver Plunkett Suite to face the judges, one of whom sends one of the contestants back to work before all three cast their votes on which of the remaining <b>two</b> <b>must</b> <b>leave</b> the show. The evicted celebrity is then interviewed by the presenters, with best bits shown as well. Created by Adare Productions, it was available to watch online on the RTÉ Player for up to two weeks after being broadcast. John Creedon won on 17 August.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{it costs}} <b>two,</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> do it." [...] Mrs. Proudie's anger {{was still very}} hot, or {{she would not have}} spoken of an unremunerative outlay of money in such {{language}} as that.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} very pleasant," [...] said the nurse-maid, [...] "but I do not see how {{you are going to}} manage it. My stay here will soon come to an end, for if Mrs. Cristie does not return to the city in a week or <b>two,</b> I <b>must</b> <b>leave</b> her. I am a teacher, you know, and {{before the end of the}} summer vacation, I must go and make my {{arrangements}} for the next term, and then you can easily see for yourself that when I am engaged in a school I cannot do very much studying with you." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{threaded}} {{a sufficient}} number of loops, trying the length over the edge. Then I said to Elsie, who sat cowering, propped against the crag, 'You must come and look over, and do as I wave to you. Mind, dear, <b>you</b> <b>must!</b> <b>Two</b> lives depend upon it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After {{a week or}} <b>two,</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> stain your face, arms, and legs, and go {{out with}} Rajbullub in the evening. You must keep your eyes open, and watch {{everything}} that passes, and do as you see others do. When Rajbullub thinks that you can pass muster, you will take to going out {{with him in the}} daylight, and so you will come, in time, to reach a point that it will be safe for you to begin your attempt.|$|R
6000|$|... "My white friend warns me that, {{for a day}} or <b>two,</b> we <b>must</b> not <b>leave</b> the town. It may be {{that the}} enemy have halted {{near the edge of the}} forest, in the hope of taking us unawares. This, however, can only be {{for a day or}} two, at most; for I have no doubt that the {{provisions}} they brought with them are, by now, exhausted and, if they stop in the forest, they will perish from hunger; therefore let no one go beyond the town, for two days. A watch shall be kept on the roof of my house and, if any of the enemy make their appearance in the forest, a horn will summon all to retire within the walls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{a week or}} <b>two</b> I <b>must.</b> I {{have been}} warned that a {{difficulty}} has arisen, about which I need not trouble you.

6000|$|At last Ægeus took Æthra to {{a lonely}} glen in the woods, where, beside a little {{mountain}} stream, lay a great moss-grown boulder that an earthquake, long ago, had shaken from the rocky cliff above. 'The time is coming,' said Ægeus 'when you and I must part, {{and only the}} gods can tell when we shall meet again! It may be that you will bear a child, and, if he be a boy, when {{he has come to}} his strength you must lead him to this great stone, and let no man or woman be there but <b>you</b> <b>two</b> only. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> then bid him roll away the stone, and, if he has no strength to raise it, so must it be. But if he can roll it away, then let him take such things as he finds there, and let him consider them well, and do what the gods put into his heart.' ...|$|R
