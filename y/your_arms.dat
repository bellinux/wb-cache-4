[...] The focus {{is more than}} erotic as it symbolises Marie's fight for corporeality. The film includes Rivette's first ever sex scenes, one of them arranged by Béart. The five candid and emotionally charged sex scenes focus on their upper bodies and faces, and on their erotic monologues that employ elements of fairy tale, horror, and sadomasochism.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics {{were written}} in five minutes and are derived from U2's {{experience}} in Shinjuku. Bono has compared the lyrics to those in U2's 1991 song [...] "Tryin' to Throw <b>Your</b> <b>Arms</b> Around the World", as both depict the nightlife of a city. Lyrics were also inspired {{by the presence of}} the yakuza in Shinjuku; the group saw gang members with amputated fingers as punishment for their misbehaviour, which Bono has described as a [...] "very, very surreal" [...] experience. He has said that [...] "Slug" [...] was about avoiding harmful mistakes, stating [...] "we all play with things we shouldn't play with".|$|E

[...] Captain Parker told his men instead to disperse and go home, but, because of the confusion, the yelling all around, and due to the raspiness of Parker's tubercular voice, some did not hear him, some left very slowly, and none laid down their arms. Both Parker and Pitcairn ordered their men to hold fire, but a shot was fired from an unknown source.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to discuss the {{influence}} of the deference on the task instructions to the feeling of Dohsa-experience and Dohsa-performance in application of Dohsa-hou. One instruction is “Please raise <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> and down <b>your</b> <b>arm.</b> (Movement instruction) ” and another instruction is “Please raise <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> and down <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> with relaxation of your body. (Relaxation instruction) ”. During the movement, the experimenter saw how long it takes for that. After that, subjects checked the scale of feeling of Dohsa-experience. As a result, in the movement instruction condition, subjects feel “change of their body”, “refresh”, “active”, “attention to the body”, “self attitude of active trial and error”, “self attitude of concentration” more than another. In the movement instruction, subjects feel “vague” and “confusion” more than another. In addition, it takes more long time for relaxation condition than another. This result means that clear instruction of relaxation made subjects experience actual feelings. In addition, because subjects were not used to relaxation activity, they experience new feelings. So, therapists should consider the features of instruction in the therapy of application of Dohsa-hou...|$|R
500|$|U2 biographer Bill Flanagan credits Bono's {{habit of}} keeping his lyrics [...] "in flux {{until the last}} minute" [...] with {{providing}} a narrative coherence to the album. Flanagan interpreted Achtung Baby as using the moon {{as a metaphor for}} a dark woman seducing the singer away from his virtuous love, the sun; he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home. For Flanagan, [...] "Tryin' to Throw <b>Your</b> <b>Arms</b> Around the World" [...] on the album's latter third describes the character stumbling home in a drunken state, and the final three songs—"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)", [...] "Acrobat", and [...] "Love Is Blindness"—are about how the couple deal with the suffering they have forced on each other.|$|E
500|$|An {{observer}} in {{an accelerated}} reference frame must introduce what physicists call fictitious forces {{to account for}} the acceleration experienced by himself and objects around him. One example, the force pressing the driver of an accelerating car into his or her seat, has already been mentioned; another is the force you can feel pulling <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> up and out if you attempt to spin around like a top. [...] Einstein's master insight was that the constant, familiar pull of the Earth's gravitational field is fundamentally the same as these fictitious forces. [...] The apparent magnitude of the fictitious forces always appears to be proportional to the mass of any object on which they act – for instance, the driver's seat exerts just enough force to accelerate the driver {{at the same rate as}} the car. [...] By analogy, Einstein proposed that an object in a gravitational field should feel a gravitational force proportional to its mass, as embodied in Newton's law of gravitation.|$|E

[...] "One" [...] was accompanied by the title word shown in many languages, as well as Mark Pellington-directed video clips of buffalos leading to a still image of David Wojnarowicz's [...] "Falling Buffalo" [...] photograph. For [...] "Until the End of the World", Bono often played with a camera, kissing the lens and thrusting it into his crotch, a stark contrast from his more earnest stage behaviour of the past. Beginning with [...] "Outside Broadcast", the band began playing [...] "New Year's Day" [...] afterwards. During [...] "Tryin' to Throw <b>Your</b> <b>Arms</b> Around the World", Bono danced with a young female fan from the crowd (a ritual he had done more solemnly on past tours), shared camcorder video filming duties with her, and sprayed champagne. At {{this point in the}} show, Mullen sometimes sang a solo performance of [...] "Dirty Old Town".|$|E

500|$|Jeff Gerstmann, {{co-founder of}} Giant Bomb, felt that while Forza Motorsport 4 was a [...] "fantastic driving game" [...] it merely {{felt like an}} {{incremental}} improvement on its predecessor. [...] "I found myself getting a very 'annual sports game update' vibe off of it," [...] stated Gerstmann. Justin Calvert of GameSpot agreed; he said that Forza Motorsport 4 refines upon its predecessor, [...] "but also feels {{just a little too}} familiar". X-Plays Jason D'Aprile also felt that Forza Motorsport 4 an improvement over Forza Motorsport 3, [...] "making it the absolute king of the road." [...] He cited the game's audio and visuals, the number of cars and tracks, the online play and variable skill level all as high points. However, D'Aprile felt that the Kinect implementation was [...] "a gimmick" [...] and expressed disappointment that there was not more content involving Top Gear. Matthew Kato, reviewer for Game Informer, was unimpressed by Forzas Kinect integration as well.

[...] At closing time, he would lead patrons in singing [...] "God Save Us Nelly Queens" [...] {{to the tune of}} [...] "God Save the Queen". Sometimes he would take the crowd outside to sing the final verse to the men across the street in jail, who had been arrested in raids earlier in the night. Speaking of this ritual in the film [...] (1977), gay journalist George Mendenhall said: [...] "It sounds silly, but if you lived at that time and had the oppression coming down from the police department and from society, there was nowhere to turn...and {{to be able to put}} <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> around other gay men and to be able to stand up and sing 'God Save Us Nelly Queens'...we were really not saying 'God Save Us Nelly Queens.'

None of these were played during the first four legs of the tour. Willie Williams stated in his 27 June 2009 tour diary entry on U2.com that the band [...] "really wants [...] to work and it sounds great", {{but the rest of the}} setlist struggled due to the song's [...] "beautiful melancholy". In his 24 July 2009 entry, Williams noted that [...] "October" [...] and [...] "White as Snow" [...] were also being considered. [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] and [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] were rehearsed in an acoustic style, but performances during the tour were done by the full band.
