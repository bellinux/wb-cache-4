5000|$|Rose Troche, a Latina {{director}} {{teamed up}} with her then partner and co-writer to finance on their own an experimental lesbian feature. It was the first film {{to be sold to}} a distributor during the Sundance Film Festival. With the small amount of approximately $8000, started their road to a Samuel Goldwyn $450,000 sale. Help along the way with Vachon's company Killer Films who contributed $5000 when funds ran out and John Pierson bankrolled the remaining $53,000. “Troche’s Latina identity was (problematically) written out of the marketing campaign and the film was promoted on the basis of her gender and sexuality.” The film was released during gay pride month in June 1994 and eventually grossed $2.4 million. Go Fish proved the marketability of lesbian issues for the film industry. Troche mentioned that during the filming of Go Fish (1994), at one point she didn’t have money to pay her phone and electric bills. The film also put a label on her and critics considered her [...] "a professional queer", a fact that she sometimes hated: [...] "Go Fish made me such a card-carrying member. It is, like, boring.
