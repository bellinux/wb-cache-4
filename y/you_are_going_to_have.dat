Colorado {{needs to be able}} to compete with our neighboring states. We do not want to take anything away from them. We do not want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways {{are going to}} be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.|$|E
500|$|The song {{contains}} a [...] "rolling" [...] synth bassline and [...] "truncated" [...] percussion, {{that according to}} Zuel, comes across as both [...] "alluring and ever-so-slightly sinister". It contains [...] "slow breaks", that according to Jamil Ahmad of musicOMH, [...] "wrap this record round you like walking into an exclusive club with a million dollar sound system – you know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> one of those nights". The pace of the song changes with its chorus, which Mikey MiGo cited as being [...] "a bit off setting".|$|E
500|$|General Bradley {{reviewing}} Allied {{troops in}} England training for D-Day, promised the soldiers that the Germans {{on the beach}} would be blasted with naval gunfire before the landing. [...] "You men should consider yourself lucky. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> ringside seats for the greatest show on earth," [...] he said, referring to the naval bombardment. However, Rear Admiral Hall strongly disapproved of what he {{considered to be the}} small amount of air and naval bombardment used, saying [...] "It's a crime to send me on the biggest amphibious attack in history with such inadequate naval gunfire support." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Bernard, laughing, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coarse and flattering, I collapse. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> titillate my vanity, I succumb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poff," [...] {{she said}} suddenly, [...] "has it ever {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do afterwards. Do <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite well off?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The man {{is growing}} {{stronger}} and better every day. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make him recover, after all. I was afraid"--he corrected himself--"I thought"--the word <b>was</b> the truer--"that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> poison him." ...|$|R
500|$|Hoxha {{delivered}} {{his speech to}} the Conference on November 16; he [...] "spoke of the tremendous Soviet pressures to which the Albanian party and government had been subjected after the Bucharest meeting... The only crime his régime had committed, the Albanian leader added, was {{that it did not}} agree that the Chinese communist party should be summarily and unjustly condemned. For this it had been treated in a manner that was shabby, anti-Marxist and uncomradely. Hoxha's speech had a shattering effect on the Moscow gathering." [...] Amongst other things Hoxha said that, according to Khrushchev, the Party of Labour and Albania itself [...] "should merely applaud and approve, but express no opinion of its own. But this is neither Marxist nor acceptable. Marxism-Leninism has granted us the right to have our say, and no one can take this from us, either by means of political and economic pressure, or by means of threats and names they might call us." [...] According to Alia, Khrushchev [...] "tried to appear calm" [...] when first replying, reading his written text [...] "almost mechanically" [...] in regards to China but as soon as he began to reply to Hoxha's speech [...] "he lost his head and began to shout, scream and splutter." [...] Khrushchev was said to have angrily remarked, [...] "Comrade Hoxha, you have poured a bucket of filth over me: <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to wash it off again." [...] Jon Halliday states that, [...] "On this occasion Hoxha truly succeeded in putting himself and Albania on the world map. His denunciation of Khrushchev made headlines round the world and even his harshest critics usually concede that Hoxha turned in an able performance and showed personal courage." [...] In retirement Khrushchev later recalled the Conference and said that Hoxha [...] "bared his fangs at us even more menacingly than the Chinese themselves. After his speech, comrade Dolores Ibarruri, an old revolutionary and a devoted worker in the Communist movement, got up indignantly and said, very much to the point, that Hoxha was like a dog who bites the hand that feeds it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Testimony from a {{survivor}} of the Kalinovik camp, where roughly 100 women had been detained and subjected to MPR, said that the rapists continually told their victims, [...] "You {{are going to have}} our children. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> our little Chetniks", and that the reason for their being raped was to [...] "plant the seed of Serbs in Bosnia". Women were forced to go full term with their pregnancies and give birth. Many of the reports of the abuses illustrated the ethnic dimension of the rapes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow," [...] he went on, {{speaking}} with decision, [...] "so {{long as you}} feel like that, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new gown--or two--and a new hat, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> them at once. They {{are going to be}} bought with your brother's money, mind. Shall I come shopping with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{quite know}} what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say," [...] {{retorted}} Peter hotly. [...] "I can see it by your chin. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take their part--and suggest their acting undutifully towards their parents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are going," [...] Pritchard replied, [...] "on {{an errand}} of chivalry. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> become once more a rescuer of woman in distress. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{save the life}} of your {{beautiful}} friend Elizabeth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> allow yourself, then, to be {{the prey}} of these morbid fancies? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> treat this {{creature}} {{as a human being}} of your own order? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let him work upon your imagination?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see very}} clearly," [...] remarked the Scarecrow, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> trouble in conquering those Horners--unless we help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, you awful despot," [...] he said, [...] "do {{you mean}} to tell me that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no regard for the will of the people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, when I go in {{for myself}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an interest," [...] replied Andy, and his tone showed that he meant what he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say. Well, {{perhaps it is}} rash. But when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> foreign courts, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to do? If you have got those sort of things you must wear them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{tell the}} truth as you have just told it," [...] replied Fisher. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> placard this town with the wickedness done <b>to</b> old Wilkins. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fill the {{newspapers}} with the infamous story of Mrs. Biddle. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> denounce Verner from a public platform, naming {{him for what he}} did and naming the poacher he did it <b>to.</b> And you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find out by what trade this man made the money with which he bought the estate; and when you know the truth, as I said before, of course <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell it. Upon those terms I come under the old flag, as you call it, and haul down my little pennon." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The bioscope," [...] Louise decided firmly, [...] "I {{refuse to}} have {{anything}} to do with. You have had all the entertainment <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this evening, Mr. Countryman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that was}} your considerateness. You didn't want to give trouble, {{even if you had}} to {{sacrifice}} your principles. But it's all right now. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> your vegetables." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not now," [...] she {{interrupted}} hastily. [...] "Do you know, I fancy {{that we must}} {{be getting}} too confidential. That odious man with the eyeglass keeps staring at us.

I have learned the truth, and know what you meant now by a life for a life. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{sacrifice}} yourself for me. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take upon yourself a crime which you never committed to clear me. You went to York to declare yourself the murderer of Mulready, in case I had <b>been</b> found guilty. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> emigrate to America to send home a written confession." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{objected to}} the sea trip strongly. A sea trip does you good when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a couple of months}} of it, but, for a week, it is wicked.|$|E

6000|$|... "And now, {{will you}} {{let me know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{thinking}} of doing?
