5|$|Operation Badr was {{the opening}} {{battle of the}} <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War in the Sinai, and the first major Arab victory against the Israelis in years.|$|E
5|$|Israel {{captured}} BM-24 MRLs {{during the}} Six-Day War (1967), used them in two battalions during the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War (1973) and the 1982 Lebanon War, and later developed the MAR-240 launcher {{for the same}} rockets, based on a Sherman tank chassis.|$|E
5|$|Koufax is also {{remembered as}} one of the {{outstanding}} Jewish athletes in American sports. His decision not to pitch Game 1 of the 1965 World Series because it fell on <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> garnered national attention as an example of conflict between professional pressures and personal beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Dylan has {{supported}} the Chabad Lubavitch movement, and has privately participated in Jewish religious events, including the Bar Mitzvahs of his sons and attending Hadar Hatorah, a Chabad Lubavitch yeshiva. In September 1989 and September 1991, he appeared on the Chabad telethon. On <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> in 2007 he attended Congregation Beth Tefillah, in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was called to the Torah for the sixth aliyah.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed Have Blue {{was born}} out of a {{requirement}} to evade radar detection. During the Vietnam War, radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) posed a significant threat to US aircraft. As such, strike aircraft during the war often required support aircraft to perform combat air patrols and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The 1973 <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War again highlighted the vulnerability of aircraft to SAMs – the Israeli Air Force lost 109 aircraft in 18 days. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union developed an integrated defense network, central to which were medium- to long-range surveillance radars. SAMs and AAAs would be set up around key locations to defend them from incoming enemy aircraft. If the loss ratio of Israel during the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War was experienced by NATO forces during a military confrontation with the Warsaw Pact, NATO aircraft numbers would be depleted within two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The M9 {{served for}} a {{significant}} amount of time. 3,500 were produced by the end of World War II. It was used during World War II, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Vietnam War, the Six-Day War, and the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War. It had been used by eleven different countries by the end of its service.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{had been}} supportive of gays {{since at least}} the early 1990s, and following the late 2006 decision by the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards to allow same-sex commitment ceremonies, in 2007 Baith Israel Anshei Emes voted to follow suit. The day before <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur,</b> 2009, the synagogue was picketed by members of the Westboro Baptist Church, who shouted antisemitic and anti-gay slogans.|$|E
5|$|The second Egyptian {{attempt was}} the last; the Port Said Sector did not launch another attack {{to capture the}} fort. Thus Budapest {{remained}} the only Israeli fortification of the Bar Lev Line to remain under Israeli control. Four months after the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War, Captain Motti Ashkenazi, the commander of Fort Budapest, led the protests against the Israeli government's handling of the war.|$|E
5|$|Two months later, in November 1973 (just {{after the}} <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War in October), the ANO hijacked KLM Flight 861, this time {{using the name}} Arab Nationalist Youth Organization. Fatah had been {{discussing}} convening a peace conference in Geneva; the hijacking was intended to warn them not {{to go ahead with}} it. In response, in March or July 1974, Arafat expelled Abu Nidal from Fatah.|$|E
5|$|In early May 1971 Qandil {{left the}} ABSU after refusing {{to launch a}} {{disciplinary}} investigation of the technical team that recorded the Labor Day speech given by Anwar Sadat, who became president following Nasser's death in 1970. He left {{at a time when}} numerous broadcasters and media personalities were removed from their positions during Sadat's Corrective Revolution. However, he briefly returned to television in 1973 to announce Egypt's claimed victory in the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War with Israel in October of that year.|$|E
5|$|More Jews {{came from}} Bukhara, Persia, and, {{following}} the Farhud pogrom in Iraq in 1941, many more immigrants shifted to Bombay. They all used to assemble in the Knesset Eliyahoo synagogue {{in large numbers}} during festival days and on Rosh Hashana and <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur.</b> On many such occasions, {{in view of the}} large crowd of devotees, overflow prayer services were held in the neighbouring Cawasjee Jehangir Public Hall.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Ismailia {{took place}} between the Egyptian Army and the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) during the last stages of the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War during October 18–22, 1973, {{south of the city}} of Ismailia, on {{the west bank of the}} Suez Canal in Egypt. The battle itself took place as part of the larger IDF-launched Operation Abiray-Lev, in an attempt to seize Ismailia and thereby sever the {{logistical}} and supply lines of most of Egypt's Second Field Army across the Suez Canal.|$|E
5|$|The Black Hebrews {{believe they}} are descended {{from members of the}} Tribe of Judah who were exiled from the Land of Israel after the Romans {{destroyed}} the Second Temple in 70 CE. The group incorporates elements of African-American culture into their interpretation of the Bible. They do not recognize rabbinical Jewish interpretations such as the Talmud. The Black Hebrews observe Shabbat and biblically ordained Jewish holidays such as <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> and Passover.|$|E
5|$|The IAF {{began working}} on a SAM {{suppression}} operation {{since the end of}} the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War. Rising tensions between Israel and Syria over Lebanon escalated in the early 1980s and culminated in Syria deploying the SAM batteries in the Beqaa Valley. On June 6, 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon, and on the third day of the war, with clashes going on between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Syrian Army, Israel decided to launch the operation.|$|E
5|$|After {{events in}} Munich, Jennings {{continued}} {{to report on}} Middle East issues. In 1973, he covered the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War, and the following year, he served as chief correspondent and co-producer of Sadat: Action Biography, a profile of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat that would win him his first of two George Foster Peabody Awards. The documentary established Jennings as Sadat's favorite correspondent. That summer, Jennings married {{for the second time}} to Anouchka Malouf, a Lebanese photographer. His first wife was childhood sweetheart Valerie Godsoe.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{established}} a separate maintenance facility for all six trainsets in the Brighton Park neighborhood of Chicago, {{on the site}} of a former Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad coach yard. This facility closed in 1981 after the withdrawal of the RTGs from service; according to Amtrak, the trainsets were too expensive to operate compared to conventional equipment. The trainsets were mothballed at Amtrak's main maintenance facility in Beech Grove, Indiana. A contributing factor to the withdrawal was the spike in fuel prices after the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War.|$|E
5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil embargo against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War. Because the United States imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, the embargo had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began demanding {{a solution to the}} problem, and President Richard Nixon began lobbying for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least a part of the answer.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter saw combat {{service in}} a range of {{conflicts}} with several operators, including the Suez Crisis, the Aden Emergency, the Sino-Indian War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Rhodesian Bush War, the Second Congo War, the Six-Day War, the War of Attrition, the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War, and the 2007 Lebanon conflict. Overall, 1,972 Hunters were manufactured by Hawker Aircraft and its successor, Hawker Siddeley, as well as being produced under licence overseas. In British service, the Hunter was replaced in its principal roles by the Lightning, the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of Fort Lahtzanit was Lieutenant Muli Malhov, {{who had served}} on the canal before. During the week {{leading up to the}} <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War, Israeli patrols between Lahtzanit and Orkal discovered footprints coming from the canal and moving inwards, almost on a daily basis, indicating that the Egyptians were possibly sending men on long-range intelligence missions, or to act as artillery observers. Two days before the outbreak of the war, Malhov expressed concern to his superior officer of the observations being made on the canal line, and that the forts would not stand a chance if they were attacked.|$|E
5|$|Myths {{continued}} to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem {{from the fact that}} in early 1974, shortly after the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim {{for which there is no}} evidence.|$|E
5|$|Experienced and well-trained, 69 Squadron {{nevertheless}} {{entered the}} <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War unready for the challenges {{brought about by}} start of the war. Prior to the outbreak of war, the IAF had been preparing for a pre-emptive strike against Egyptian and Syrian positions, but this {{was rejected by the}} Israeli government. 69 Squadron aircraft {{were in the process of}} re-armament to the air-to-air role when hostilities began at 14:00 on October 6, 1973. The aircraft were scrambled to perform CAPs, some having to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean, yet no aerial opposition was encountered. The squadron flew 37 sorties on the first day of the war, of which only 4 were strike missions, while two aircraft suffered damage from SA-7s over the Golan Heights.|$|E
5|$|In September 1973, he {{returned}} to Algiers to attend the Fourth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's attendance, claiming that Cuba was aligned to the Warsaw Pact and therefore should not be at the conference. At the conference he publicly broke off relations with Israel, citing its government's {{close relationship with the}} U.S. and its treatment of Palestinians during the Israel–Palestine conflict. This earned Castro respect throughout the Arab world, in particular from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who became his friend and ally. As the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War broke out in October 1973 between Israel and an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, Cuba sent 4,000 troops to defend Syrian territory from Israeli incursions. Leaving Algiers, Castro visited Iraq and North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} term, Nixon ordered an airlift to {{resupply}} Israeli {{losses in the}} <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War, resulting in the restart of the Middle East peace process and an oil crisis at home. The Nixon administration supported a coup in Chile that ousted the government of Salvador Allende and propelled Augusto Pinochet to power. By late 1973, the Watergate scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support. On August 9, 1974, he resigned {{in the face of}} almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he was issued a pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford. In 20 years of retirement, Nixon wrote nine books and undertook many foreign trips, helping to rehabilitate his image into that of elder statesman. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994 and died four days later at the age of 81.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Chinese Farm {{took place}} during October 15 to October 17, 1973 between the Egyptian Army and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), {{as part of the}} <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War. It was fought in the Sinai Peninsula, north of the Great Bitter Lake and just east of the Suez Canal, near an Egyptian {{agricultural}} research station. The farm featured specialized Japanese-made machinery; Israeli soldiers mistook Japanese characters on this equipment for Chinese, leading to the area being labeled 'Chinese Farm' on Israeli military maps. The battle began when the IDF launched Operation Abiray-Lev ("Stouthearted Men"), attempting to establish a corridor to the canal and allow bridges to be laid for a crossing. Accordingly, the Israelis attacked Egyptian forces in and around the Chinese Farm.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 1973, an Arab {{coalition}} led by Egypt and Syria, supported {{with arms}} and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking {{personal responsibility for}} any response by Arab nations. More than a week later, {{by the time the}} U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3, placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.|$|E
5|$|Quneitra {{was founded}} in the Ottoman era as a way station on the caravan route to Damascus and {{subsequently}} became a garrison town of some 20,000 people. In 1946, it {{became part of the}} independent Syrian Republic within the Riff Dimashq Governorate and in 1964 became the capital of the split Quneitra Governorate. On 10 June 1967, {{the last day of the}} Six-Day War, Quneitra came under Israeli control. It was briefly recaptured by Syria during the 1973 <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War, but Israel regained control in its subsequent counter-offensive. The city was almost completely destroyed before the Israeli withdrawal in June 1974. Syria had refused to rebuild the city and actively discouraged resettlement in the area. Israel was heavily criticized by the United Nations for the city's destruction, while Israel has also criticized Syria for not rebuilding Quneitra. During the Syrian civil war, Quneitra became a clash point between rebel forces and Syrian Arab Army. , it became controlled by the Syrian opposition.|$|E
5|$|Public schools allow {{religious}} education, {{in cooperation}} with religious communities that have agreements with the government, but attendance is not mandatory. The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the religious education classes. Public holidays in Croatia also include the religious festivals of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The religious festival public holidays {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right not to work on those dates. This includes Christians who celebrate Christmas on 7 January per the Julian calendar, Muslims on the days of Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews on the days of Rosh Hashanah and <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur.</b> Marriages performed by the religious communities having agreements with the state are officially recognized, eliminating the need to register the marriages in a registrar office.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War {{ended on}} October 24. 69 Squadron had flown 789 sorties, had lost 9 aircraft, and had shot down 10 enemy aircraft. Four airmen {{had been killed}} and eight had become prisoners of war. The end of the war, however, did not spell {{an end to the}} fighting. On December 6, a mixed 69 and 119 squadrons combat air patrol over the Gulf of Suez engaged a flight of MiG-21s to score one kill, {{possibly}} two. The kill was credited to 69's Yiftach Shadmi and Meir Gur, with the MiG-21s revealed {{to be a part of}} a North Korean contingent that had deployed to Egypt during the war. With the arrival of spring fighting also resumed in the north, where Israel and Syria had yet to sign a disengagement agreement. On April 8, 1974, while on patrol against low flying Syrian helicopters, the squadron lost one of its aircraft, probably to a shoulder-launched SA-7. The crew, Shadmi and Rafaeli, were interned in Lebanon for a month. Three weeks later, on April 29, the squadron scored two aerial kills against Syrian MiG-21s, the squadron's final victories to date. Fighting only ceased on May 31.|$|E
5|$|The postwar {{years were}} spent {{implementing}} {{the lessons of}} the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War. SEAD tactics were improved, training was stepped up and innovative technologies introduced. The Hammers cooperated with Rafael, Israel's weapon systems development authority, in the introduction of the Tadmit electro-optical fire-and-forget guided bomb, {{a modified version of the}} AGM-62 Walleye II. At the same time, the Phantom's air-to-air role was diminished with the introduction into service of the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The squadron was, nonetheless, the first IAF squadron to introduce Rafael's Python 3 into service in March 1977. Air-to-air training continued and on December 29, 1977, during combat against a pair of F-15s, two squadron aircraft collided. Squadron leader Avsha Friedman and navigator Avihu Ikar were killed. The remains of their aircraft, Kurnass 305, stand as a memorial to the two pilots on the Acre-Carmiel road. On January 20, 1981, the squadron lost another pilot in similar circumstances, when Kurnass 222 collided with F-16 222. Squadron leader Eliezer Adar ejected, but Dani Weiss was killed, as was the F-16 pilot, Uri Ben-Amitai.|$|E
5|$|In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, {{consisting}} of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil embargo against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War. A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and bond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.|$|E
5|$|When 27 August, fifteen {{days before}} 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, {{it was clear}} no {{offensive}} would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified October 6 as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, {{it was only in}} September, less than a month before the attack, that the date October 6 was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). October 6 was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, and for most of the night there was a full moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur,</b> the Jewish Day of Atonement. This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack; observant Jews fast on that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised. October also coincided with the month of Ramadan in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634. Opting for something more inspirational than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.|$|E
25|$|In the Hebrew calendar, {{the ninth}} day of Tishri {{is known as}} Erev <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> (<b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> eve). <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> itself begins around sunset on that day and {{continues}} into the next day until nightfall, and therefore lasts about 25 hours.|$|E
25|$|The Sigd {{began as}} an {{evolution}} of the observance of <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> by the Beta Israel (Ethiopian) community. Currently that community now observes it in addition to Yom Kippur; its date is 29 Heshvan, 49 days after <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur.</b> It shares some features of <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur,</b> Shavuot, and other holidays.|$|E
25|$|Virtually all Jewish {{holidays}} involve meals, {{but since}} <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> involves fasting, Jewish law requires one {{to eat a}} large and festive meal on the afternoon before <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur,</b> after the Mincha (afternoon) prayer.|$|E
25|$|At the {{innovation}} of the sages, the calendar was arranged {{to ensure that}} <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> would not fall on a Friday or Sunday, and Hoshana Rabbah would not fall on Shabbat. These rules have been instituted because Shabbat restrictions also apply to <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur,</b> so that if <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> were to fall on Friday, {{it would not be}} possible to make necessary preparations for Shabbat (such as candle lighting). Similarly, if <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> fell on a Sunday, it would not be possible to make preparations for <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> because the preceding day is Shabbat. Additionally, the laws of Shabbat override those of Hoshana Rabbah, so that if Hoshana Rabbah were to fall on Shabbat certain rituals that {{are a part of the}} Hoshana Rabbah service (such as carrying willows, which is a form of work) could not be performed.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, an {{air raid}} siren was sounded on the {{afternoon}} of <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> and radio broadcasts were resumed to alert the public to the surprise attack on Israel by Egypt and Syria that launched the <b>Yom</b> <b>Kippur</b> War.|$|E
