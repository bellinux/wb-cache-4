Research has found that children and even teenagers are mostly influenced by their peers and family—namely, parents and siblings—when making decisions about using alcohol (Windle, 2000). For example, researchers have learned that teens ' drinking and substance use behavior was highly influenced by sibling behavior (Windle, 2000). Also, teens that {{spent a lot of time}} around parents who drink are more likely to drink themselves (Yu, 2003). However, this same study showed that parents who set firm limits on underage drinking tend to have teens who are less likely to drink. What does this mean for parents who want to educate their children about alcohol use? It's a good idea to start early by creating an environment where children feel comfortable about asking questions and discussing feelings. Be realistic when talking about alcohol; exaggerating the dangers is not effective. Discuss the facts about alcohol use as well as your values. Know your teen's daily schedule and set clear limits on underage drinking. Monitor who <b>your</b> <b>teen</b> becomes friends with, and get to know their parents.

The study was published in Nature’s Neuropsychopharmacology. Researchers from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) found that cannabis use during adolescence* can interact with a gene, called the COMT gene, to cause physical changes in the brain such as changes in cell size, density and protein levels. The COMT gene provides instructions for making enzymes which breakdown a specific chemical messenger called dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps conduct signals from one nerve cell to another, particularly in the brains reward and pleasure centres. Adolescent cannabis use and its interaction with particular forms of the COMT gene {{have been shown to}} cause physical changes in the brain as well as increasing the risk of developing schizophrenia.

40|$|Presentation made at Latinos in the Heartland (10 th : 2012 : Kansas City, Mo.) and {{published}} in the annual conference proceedings. Attendees will learn about the educational challenges and opportunities of Latino youth. They will be introduced to the program Juntos para una Mejor Educación/Together for a Better Education: an experiential program that provides Latino parents and youth with knowledge and resources to prevent students from dropping out and to encourage families {{to work together to}} gain access to postsecondary education. This workshop will share the free curriculum with participants and allow them to experience the research and some of the activities that make Juntos Program effective. The educational challenges of Latino youth are popularly associated with language and cultural differences while research has shown that there are many other factors involved. The Juntos Program was created three years ago to address the educational challenges of Latino youth while providing Latino parents and youth in the 8 th through 12 th grades with knowledge and resources to prevent students from dropping out and to encourage families to work together to gain access to postsecondary education. The program brings together families with partners from schools, local community agencies, college-age mentors, and Cooperative Extension staff to make graduation a reality. Juntos also uses success coaches and college-age mentors to provide weekly afterschool clubs and activities with the target students before and after the 6 -week program. The 2 -hour workshops meet once a week for six weeks and focus on experiential activities that help the parents and youth work towards their educational goals. Weekly topics covered are: making education a family goal, communicating with teachers and guidance counselors, knowing how to succeed in the current school system, financing college and money matters, getting ready for the college application process, and being an advocate for <b>your</b> <b>teen.</b> The program has been held in 30 schools around North Carolina and is being piloted in ten schools in Nevada. Juntos has served over 700 Latino parents and youth and pre- and post-test evaluation data from Latino youth and parents that have completed the program showed significant increases in learning, attitudes, and skills gained. Results from these evaluations using a Wilcoxon sign test have revealed significant mean differences from pre- to post-tests. Parents and youth reported an increased understanding of NC graduation requirements, classes needed, higher education options, financial aid options, and necessary tests. Parents report a significant increase in their monitoring their child’s homework, meeting with school staff, and increased skills and knowledge about the college application process. Youth reported significant increase in their planning for after high school and sharing those goals with their parents. In addition to statistics, 92 % of parents increased confidence in working with their child’s school and 93 % of parents reported that they felt they had the information they needed to help their teenager successfully complete high school. In addition, 72 % of participants attended all of the workshop sessions, and more than 60 % of the families had a father present. We will share our models for funding and expanding the outreach of this program. We also will discuss how we have incorporated 4 -H and the Youth and Families with Promise (YFP) mentoring program to serve younger elementary and middle school Latino students and their families...|$|E
