He clearly suffered major trauma to his body. The lack of oxygen to his brain has to have consequences because that’s how it is in real life. We wanted there to be a price. Basically, he in his own Fitz way had professed his love for her, and then he came out of that. How do <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of that experience without any physical damage, there would still be probably a change to their relationship because the feelings are out in the open. But, of course, being the people that we are, we wanted to make it even more painful and compound it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club, a film {{adaptation}} of Chuck Palahniuk's {{novel of the}} same name, directed by David Fincher. Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling. To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended. While promoting Fight Club, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to [...] "have an experience, take a punch more and see how <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> on the other end." [...] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival. Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, Pitt's performance was widely praised. Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film, while Variety remarked upon Pitt's ability to be [...] "cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than... his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise". In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.|$|E

Playing before festival audiences who were not guaranteed to be fans of his music was largely new to Springsteen, but after a slow start the show captured {{over most of the}} Bonnaroo audience. [...] The following night, Springsteen joined the recently reunited and headlining Phish for three songs, [...] "Mustang Sally", [...] "Bobby Jean", and [...] "Glory Days". [...] Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio said later, [...] "I got to play with Bruce. That's my hero."

[...] Springsteen subsequently reflected, [...] "We played festivals {{for the very first time}} on this tour, and that was one of the greatest experiences of all of them. That was an eye-opener. When we played Glastonbury [...] <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> and there's like 100,000 kids in their 20s and under.

There's always a positive to those negative times because throughout it <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> so much stronger and wiser". During the Justin Timberlake & Friends benefit showheld by Justin Timberlake on October 24, 2010 in Las Vegas, NevadaAguilera was invited to perform several of her hits, including [...] "Beautiful", [...] "Fighter" [...] and [...] "Ain't No Other Man".

500|$|Jaws 3-D had two 3D consultants: the {{production}} started with Chris Condon, president of StereoVision, and Stan Loth was later {{added to the}} team for the Arrivision 3D. Production began using the StereoVision, but this was dropped after {{a week for the}} Arrivision system, [...] "which Alves believed was a superior system because it has a wider variety of lenses". According to Alves, inferior systems lead to ghosting and blurring, leaving audiences with headaches. He says that [...] "the left and right images [...] are very well-matched, and the photography is very clean; it's restful to the eye, and though we do have the occasional effects where things do emerge toward the audience from the plane of projection, <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the film without a headache." [...] Historian R. M. Hayes says that the film was shot using both the Arrivision and StereoVision single strip-over-and-under units. Both cameras were used in conjunction with each other. This is a means of shooting 3D movies in normal color with a single camera and single strip of film: the Arrivision 3D technique uses a special twin-lens adapter fitted to the film camera, and divides the 35mm film frame in half along the middle, capturing the left-eye image in the upper half of the frame and the right-eye image in the lower half – this is known as [...] "over/under". This allows filming to proceed as for any standard 2D film, without the considerable additional expense of having to double up on cameras and film stock for every shot. When the resultant film is projected through a normal projector (albeit one requiring a special lens that combines the upper and lower images), a true polarised 3D image is produced. This system allows 3D films to be shown in almost any cinema since it does not require two projectors running simultaneously through the presentation – something most cinemas are not equipped to handle. What is required of the theatre is both the special projection lens and a reflective [...] "silver" [...] screen to enable the polarized images to reflect back to the viewer with the appropriate filter on each eye blocking out the wrong image, thus leaving the viewer to see the film from two angles as the eyes naturally see the world. According to the company that built the underwater camera housings for Jaws 3-D, the underwater sequences were shot using an Arriflex 35–3 camera with Arrivision 18mm over/under 3D lens.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Perkins {{told her}} agent, Debi Allen, {{about the idea}} and a meeting with a BBC comedy {{commissioner}} followed shortly after.

After the first episode was commissioned, a table-read was organised for December 2011. In April 2012, Perkins was filming World's Most Dangerous Roads in Laos, when she was told her sitcom had been commissioned for a full series. From April to July, Perkins wrote the remaining episodes.
