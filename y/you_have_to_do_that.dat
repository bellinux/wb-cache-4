It's never boring here. ...

5000|$|Writer Jan McVerry {{explained}} {{that there were}} tough decisions to be made and {{that many of the}} secondary characters had to be omitted from the series. [...] "We were concentrating on the strongest stories," [...] she said [...] "We went through the novels and decided which episodes were going into the script and which weren't. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with any adaptation: you can't represent every incidental character or you'd go on for thousands of hours and bore everyone to death.

Otherwise, they’re going to continue to find a way to get it for free. The position that we want people to buy CDs is wrong. Sure, I’d like people to buy CDs, but if that's not what they want to buy, we have to figure out how to give them what they want." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} Finn's {{character}} traits, Boyega replied, I think {{the element of}} having {{to step up to}} a bigger calling, when your circumstances don't particularly reflect that.

I feel like it's the same kind of journey that Finn has when he leaves the First Order. He leaves a curriculum, he leaves a system and embarks on his own journey. He also noted that initially [...] "most of his decisions are based on adrenaline. Like, 'Okay, you know what? I'm just going to get this blaster and run away.'&thinsp;" [...] Boyega further noted that [...] "not only is the character in over his head and someone who is just dropped into an extraordinary circumstance, the scenes and the script prove that and it's not a problem that can just be erased." ...|$|E
