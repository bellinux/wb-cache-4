25|$|While {{recovering}} in {{the hospital}} from gunshot wounds he incurred in late 2001, Game told his brother {{to go out and}} buy all of the classic hip-hop albums. Over the course of five months, he studied all of the various influential rap albums and developed a strategy to turn himself into a rapper. With the help of his older brother Big Fase, they founded the label. It originally featured such artists as Glasses Malone, Vita, and Nu Jerzey Devil, along with Game himself. His stage name was coined by his grandmother, who was a huge fan of the 1997 blockbuster, The Game. Game first gained prominence when he attended a hip-hop summit hosted by Russell Simmons and Louis Farrakhan. After he had fully recovered, Game and Big Fase made a mixtape together. He released his first mixtape <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>It</b> <b>Is</b> Vol. 1 in 2002, and landed a record deal with the independent label Get Low Recordz owned by JT the Bigga Figga.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2006, Game {{extended}} {{a peace treaty}} to 50 Cent, which was not immediately replied to.

2500|$|In {{his papers}} of 1935, Istrati {{presents}} himself exclusively {{as an enemy}} of [...] "the Jewish bourgeoisie", a class he describes as [...] "corrupt, pseudo-humanitarian, pseudo-democratic" [...] and accuses of stirring up scandal. Istrati's articles in Cruciada Românismului are more adamantly philosemitic. One of them, [...] "A Letter to Love", led {{to a series of}} articles on the subject, from Stelescu and other Crusade people. In his own articles, Talex answered for the Stelist movement: [...] "Panait Istrati, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> we need? A fist... The Crusade of Romanianism will attempt to become that fist... Our antisemitism? Just the same as yours: a humane one. But it is also combative, {{for as long as the}} Judaic element shall attempt to set up a state within our own state, sabotaging us with any opportunity it gets". Stelescu's newspaper was noted for its obstinate claim that Jews were a rootless, disloyal race.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{performance}} at Summer Jam, Game {{responded with a}} song titled [...] "300 Barz and Running'", an extended [...] "diss" [...] aimed at G-Unit as well as members of Roc-A-Fella Records on the mixtape <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>It</b> <b>Is</b> Vol. 3. The track is unique {{in that it is}} nearly 14 minutes long, in which Game criticizes all members of G-Unit, amongst many others. 50 Cent responded through his [...] "Piggy Bank" [...] music video, which features Game as a Mr. Potato Head doll and also parodies other rivals. Since then, both groups continued to attack each other. Game released two more mixtapes, Ghost Unit and a mixtape/DVD called Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin. 50 Cent's rebuttal was [...] "Not Rich, Still Lyin'" [...] where he mocks Game. In addition, G-Unit started to respond on numerous mixtapes and then-new G-Unit member Spider Loc began dissing Game. Game responded with [...] "240 Bars (Spider Joke)", a song mainly aimed at Spider Loc, but also addressing Tony Yayo and rap group M.O.P., and on the song [...] "The Funeral 100 Bars".|$|E
