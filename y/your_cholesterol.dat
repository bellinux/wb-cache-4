40|$|What is cholesterol, and whatdoes {{it have to}} do withdisease of {{the blood}} vessels and heart? Cholesterol is a fatty sub-stance that is present in all the cells in <b>your</b> body. <b>Cholesterol</b> travels in <b>your</b> blood in {{particles}} called lipoproteins. Three of the common lipoproteins are low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Medical {{studies have shown that}} ele-vated levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of developing blockages in the coronary arteries, whereas elevated levels of HDL cholesterol reduce that risk. Thus, doctors sometimes refer to LDL as “bad cholesterol ” and to HDL as “good cholesterol. ” Cholesterol comes from 2 sources. Your body makes some cholesterol, and you also get cholesterol in foods that come from an animal (meat, milk, eggs, or anything made from these). Eating too much of these foods may increase the total amount of cholester-ol in your body. <b>Your</b> body needs <b>cholesterol</b> to work properly. However, excess cho-lesterol can deposit in your arteries and promote formation of a deposit known as a plaque, which can grow larger over time; this process is called athero-sclerosis. A piece of the plaque may break off and a blood clot may form on the exposed surface of the plaque. These blood clots may block or de-crease the blood flow and oxygen sup-ply to your heart, brain, and other body parts. If the blockage is significant, you may have a heart attack or stroke, need a procedure performed on your heart to improve the supply of blood to your heart muscle (bypass surgery, angioplasty, or stent placement), or die prematurely from cardiovascular dis-ease. One {{of the best ways to}} decrease your risk of having a heart attack or stroke is to control the amount of <b>cholesterol</b> in <b>your</b> blood...|$|R
50|$|The {{evaluation}} for VBI {{starts with}} a history and physical exam, with great emphasis on the cardiovascular and neurologic exam. It also includes a work-up to exclude benign conditions (such as labyrinthitis, vestibular neuronitis, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) that have overlapping signs and symptoms. However, the exact work-up largely depends on the patient’s age and known risk factors. For middle-aged patients, a cardiovascular risk factor evaluation is important. This often includes a cholesterol level, lipid profile (see this http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=183 to determine what <b>your</b> <b>cholesterol</b> level means), ECG, and echocardiogram. If a person with VBI is under age 45 and has no evidence for atherosclerosis, a work-up for hypercoagulable states (Lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, is indicated. Screening for protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III deficiency is sometimes recommended but these are more usually responsible for venous thrombosis than arterial problems.|$|E

50|$|Medications {{like the}} Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) {{are widely used}} to control blood {{pressure}} in diabetics. These medications not only control blood pressure but also delay or prevent the development of kidney disease in diabetes. Many {{studies have shown that}} ACEI should be the drugs of first choice in diabetics with high blood pressure. Other medications used to treat high blood pressure include water pills. Sometimes, a combination of medications is used to treat high blood pressure. All diabetics should quit smoking. The combination of diabetes and smoking usually leads to amputations of the toes and feet.Measure your blood sugars regularly, and make sure that they are well balanced as the majority of complications of diabetes can be prevented by ensuring such blood sugars stay within normal limits.It is also recommended to eat a healthy diet and avoid sugary foods and limit the intake of salt.

40|$|High blood {{cholesterol}} can affect anyone. It’s a serious condition {{that increases the}} risk for heart disease, the number one killer of Americans—women and men. The higher <b>your</b> blood <b>cholesterol</b> level, the greater your risk. Fortunately, if you have high {{blood cholesterol}}, there are {{steps you can take}} to lower it and protect your health. This booklet will show you how to take action by following the “TLC Program” for reducing high blood cholesterol. TLC stands for Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes, a three-part program that uses diet, physical activity, and weight management. Sometimes, drug treatment also is needed to lower blood cholesterol enough. But even then, the TLC Program should be followed. The booklet has four main sections: It explains why cholesterol matters and helps you find your heart disease risk; describes the TLC Program; talks about a condition called the metabolic syndrome that can also be treated with TLC; and offers advice on how to make heart healthy lifestyle changes. Within the sections you’ll find tips on such topics as how to: communicate better with your doctor and other health care professionals, read food labels, make and stick with lifestyle changes, plan heart healthy menus for the whole family, and make heart healthy choices when you eat out. Anyone can develop high blood cholesterol—everyone can take steps to lower it...|$|R
40|$|Of all {{the various}} kinds of foods, an egg is special for its {{combination}} of all essential food nutrients in one item. However {{for much of the}} past 40 years, the public has been warned away from eggs because of concerns that they increase the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke and a claim that they raise the blood pressure by causing vasoconstriction. In Tanzania, up to date there are some cultures that forbid women in general or pregnant women in particular from eating eggs due to a belief that they will get bald babies or have problems during delivery. Several studies over the years have examined egg intake and its relationship with coronary outcome. When dietary confounders were considered, no association was seen between egg consumption and the risk of coronary heart disease in non-diabetic men and women. Recent researches have not only linked eggs with biological functions beyond basic nutrition but to a huge potential in the medical field. Eggs are now linked to fetal brain development and boosting of the immune system thus consequently lowering the risk of getting breast cancer, colon and lung cancer. For already developed cancer, eggs show potential for the development ofpromising anticancer drugs through the production of Monoclonal antibodies. They are also proven to prevent cataract and macular degeneration and protect against heart attacks and strokes by preventing rteriosclerosis and facilitating fat metabolism. Moreover researchers now not only prove eggs do not increase <b>your</b> blood <b>cholesterol,</b> but also link eggs to lowering high blood pressure by acting like an antihypertensive through an ACEI like inhibiting mechanism. Components in eggs were also found to be active as anti-adhesives, microbiocidals and as chelators in metal poisoning. Good news to egg lovers again...|$|R
40|$|AIM: The 'labelling hypothesis' was {{introduced}} {{on the basis}} of the observation that labelling subjects with blood pressure elevation as hypertensive was associated with an increase in sickness absence. In the Belstress I study this hypothesis was analysed in the same way for the possible influence on sick leave of labelling persons with elevated cholesterol as hypercholesterolaemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Belstress I cohort concerns a sample of more than 16, 000 men and 5, 000 women at work in 24 Belgian industries in various sectors. Baseline data were collected by questionnaire and clinical examination. Awareness was defined as answering positively to the question 'did a physician ever tell you that <b>your</b> blood pressure/serum <b>cholesterol</b> was too high?' Sick leave data were independently and objectively recorded during 1 year following the screening. Sick leave was treated in a dichotomous way whereby the event was defined as being in the highest quartile of the annual number of days of sick leave (10 days or more for men and 15 days or more for women) or as being in the highest quartile of the annual number of spells of sick leave (two spells or more for both sexes). Gender-specific logistic regression analyses were performed, with adjustment for a large set of covariates. A positive association was observed between both awareness of hypertension and awareness of hypercholesterolaemia and the various definitions of sick leave, in both sexes and after adjustment for different covariates. When dividing up aware subjects into treated versus untreated, we observed in men the highest sick leave incidence in aware and treated hypertensive patients as well as in aware and treated hypercholesterolaemic patients. In women findings were less consistent, probably due to the smaller sample size. When looking at cumulative effects by examining participants with both hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia and their level of awareness for one or both risk factors, a statistically significant gradient was noticed in men, with the highest sick leave incidence, whatever the definition, in men aware for both risk factors, followed by men aware for one. In women the same trends were observed, but no level of statistical significance was reached. CONCLUSION: Without being able to test the effect of 'labelling' as such, our study provides support for the association between awareness of two different coronary risk factors and incidence of sick leave. Probably a common mechanism is at the base of these findings. Further research is needed, in order to reduce potential negative effects of screening on human wellbeing as well as on productivity.

40|$|Kale {{can provide}} you with some special {{cholesterol-lowering}} benefits if you will cook it by steaming. The fiber-related components in kale {{do a better job}} of binding together with bile acids in your digestive tract when they've been steamed. When this binding process takes place, it's easier for bile acids to be excreted, and the result is a lowering of <b>your</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels. Raw kale still has cholesterol-lowering ability- just not as much. Kale's risk-lowering benefits for cancer have recently been extended to at least five different types of cancer. These types include cancer of the bladder, breast, colon, ovary, and prostate. Isothiocyanates (ITCs) made from glucosinolates in kale play a primary role in achieving these risk-lowering benefits. Kale is now recognized as providing comprehensive support for the body's detoxification system. New research has shown that the ITCs made from kale's glucosinolates can help regulate detox at a genetic level. Researchers can now identify over 45 different flavonoids in kale. With kaempferol and quercetin heading the list, kale's flavonoids combine both antioxidant an...|$|E
40|$|Having {{high blood}} {{cholesterol}} puts you {{at risk of}} heart disease, {{the leading cause of}} death in the United States. People with high cholesterol have about twice the risk of heart disease as people with lower levels. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance. Your body needs some cholesterol, but it can build up on the walls of your arteries and lead to heart disease and stroke when you have too much in your blood. 71 million American adults (33. 5 %) have high low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad, ” cholesterol. 1 Only 1 out of every 3 adults with high LDL cholesterol has the condition under control. 1 Less than half of adults with high LDL cholesterol get treatment. 1 Lowering <b>your</b> <b>cholesterol</b> can reduce your risk of having a heart attack, needing heart bypass surgery or angioplasty, and dying of heart disease. Exercising, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking will help you prevent high cholesterol and reduce your levels. High cholesterol has no symptoms, so many people don’t know that their cholesterol is too high. Your doctor can do a simple blood test to check your levels. The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends that adults get their cholesterol checked every five years.
