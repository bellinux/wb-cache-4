2500|$|Cassius Dio {{also claimed}} that [...] "Many Romans, moreover, perished in this war. Therefore, Hadrian, in {{writing to the}} Senate, did not employ the opening phrase {{commonly}} affected by the emperors: 'If you and <b>your</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> in health, it is well; I and the army are in health.'" [...] XXII Deiotariana was disbanded after serious losses. In addition, some historians argue that Legio IX Hispana disbandment in the mid-2nd century could also have been {{a result of this}} war. While previously it had generally been accepted that the Ninth disappearance was after 108 CE (thus possibly suffering a demise in Britain according to Mommsen), with the 2015 Nijmegen archaeological findings dated to 121 CE and the known inscriptions of two senior officers, who were deputy commanders of the Ninth in 120 CE, and lived on for several decades to lead distinguished public careers, it was concluded that the Legion was disbanded between 120 and 197 CE - either {{as a result of the}} Bar-Kokhba revolt (132-6) or Cappadocia (161) or at the Danube (162).|$|E

[...] We read no such words; God made no conditions with Noah and his sons. Whether they forgot the covenant or not, God would remember it. It was a covenant of free grace, even as all God's covenants are. Not a bargain, but a promise. [...] "By Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, that I will not fail David." [...] By Himself He sware to Abraham: [...] "Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee." [...] That is the form of God's covenants. God swears by Himself--by God who cannot change. If God can change, then His covenant can change. If God can fail Himself, then can He fail His covenant to which He has sworn by Himself. If {{it had been a}} mere bargain, like men's bargains, and not a promise out of His absolute love, His free grace, His boundless mercy, would He have sworn by Himself? Nay, rather, He would have sworn by Abraham: [...] "By thy obedience or disobedience I swear to bless thee or curse thee." [...] But He swore by Himself, the absolute, the unchangeable, the Giver whose name is Love.|$|E

Logan replied, ‘If I had all the land between the Orient and the Occident, I would sell the same, and, if I could not get money for it, I would give it to good fellows.’ On another occasion Logan said to Bower, ‘I am for no land, I told you before and will tell you again.

Suppose they see quite clearly that all these pretensions of an inviolate superiority of birth and breeding vanish at the touch of a Whitaker Wright, soften to a glowing cordiality before the sunny promises of a Hooley.

60|$|What {{has been}} said thus far relates {{obviously}} to cases where the mother is at the commencement of her work of training. This {{is the way to}} begin; but you can not begin unless you are at the beginning. If <b>your</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> partly grown, and you find that they are not under your command, the difficulty is much greater. The principles which should govern the management are the same, but they can not be applied by means so gentle. The prison, it may be, must now be somewhat more real, the terms of imprisonment somewhat longer, and there may be cases of insubordination so decided as to require the offender to be carried to it by force, on account of his refusal to go of his own accord, and perhaps to be held there, or even to be tied. Cases requiring treatment so decisive as this must be very rare with children under ten years of age; and when they occur, the mother has reason to feel great self-condemnation--or at least great self-abasement--at finding that she has failed so entirely in the first great moral duty of the mother, which is to train her children to complete submission to her authority from the beginning.|$|E
