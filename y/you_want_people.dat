In an interview with Digital Spy, Shearsmith said that this surprised him, saying [...] "I was upset, I did {{think it was a}} shame that it's not been recognised. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> to have seen it and to have recognised the work, and innovation, but I think people are doing that. I get told that every day on Twitter, or in meetings." [...] A number of journalists expressed surprise that Inside No. 9 had received no BAFTA nominations, with Julia Raeside, of The Guardian, describing [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as [...] "one of the most inspired pieces of mute theatre I've seen on television".|$|E
500|$|Based on the premiere, Merrill Barr of Forbes {{felt that}} the show [...] "has grown up a lot since its first year, and with the start of season three, it's hard to imagine what {{complaints}} any fans could possibly still have. If you want overall continuity, you got it. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> with super powers going crazy, it's there. If you want an ensemble cast that brings the broadcast television corner of the MCU to life, then look no further. The point is, with the new season of S.H.I.E.L.D., it's everything one could ask from the show." [...] Vulture's Scott Meslow stated that the premiere was [...] "riddled with [...] visual signifiers, highlighting the ways Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has gradually become sharper, sleeker, and more reliant on the bones of its comic-book source material." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the joint}} album leaked on February 22, 2002 it caused the label, Roc-A-Fella, {{to push the}} album's release date up from the initial date, March 26, to March 19. Jay-Z {{expressed}} his frustration about the album leak to MTV News: [...] "It's the gift and the curse. It's an honor that everybody wants your music fast, {{but on the other}} hand, it's another thing when the music gets out before you [...] Because that's your art. You feel attached to it. You feel a certain way and <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> to go out and support it. The time that you take, it's like a piece of your life. You take parts of your life and you put it on these records and then for it to just be traded and moved around [...]|$|E

2500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Eddie Trunk, Chad Smith {{said he had}} discussions with Flea about how much longer the band could continue touring. [...] "I was like, 'I don't know!' I want to make records, I still love making records, but the touring part... I don't know if we can continue. I mean, three of us are 54 years old – Anthony, me and Flea. Josh is 38 or 39, so he's a young man. But I don't know if {{we can continue to}} do the long tours – the year, year-and-a-half we normally do. That's a good question. We all have families and different things, your priorities shift a little bit. You kinda see that what's gonna work for you maybe doesn't necessarily work for other bands. But again, we're just so grateful that people want to come and see us play, and we love to perform. I don't know in the future how that's gonna look. We pride ourselves in putting out a really amazing performance. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> to just walk away and be like, 'Wow, I haven't seen anything like that!' and when you can't do that anymore, you gotta really stop and go, 'We're not gonna be sitting on stools up there playing our songs.'"On July 18, 2017 in an {{interview with}} TMZ, Flea said of the band possibly retiring [...] "that's just silly talk. We never look past the immediate future but um, were on tour right now, we're rockin' out, we're feeling the spirit, letting the music move us and to be honest since the day we started this band nearly 35 years ago, i've never ever known what's next or what's around the corner or anything and I think that the power of the band lies in that kinda just staying in the moment and staying with the energy that's moving.|$|E

You know they're only men dressed up, for money. I can't see why you should encourage it. I don't hold with idle show-people, parading round, I don't, myself. I like to go to the cinema once a week. It's instruction, you take it all in at a glance, all you need to know, and it lasts you for a week. You can get to know everything about people's actual lives from the cinema. I don't see why <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> dressing up and showing off." ...|$|E

60|$|Now let me pass to {{my second}} point, {{which is the}} {{development}} of technical skill. Everybody here is aware that at this present moment there is hardly a branch of trade or of commerce which does not depend, more or less directly, upon some department or other of physical science, which does not involve, for its successful pursuit, reasoning from scientific data. Our machinery, our chemical processes or dyeworks, and a thousand operations which {{it is not necessary to}} mention, are all directly and immediately connected with science. You have to look among your workmen and foremen for persons who shall intelligently grasp the modifications, based upon science, which are constantly being introduced into these industrial processes. I do not mean that you want professional chemists, or physicists, or mathematicians, or the like, but <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> sufficiently familiar with the broad principles which underlie industrial operations to be able to adapt themselves to new conditions. Such qualifications can only be secured by a sort of scientific instruction which occupies a midway place between those primary notions given in the elementary schools and those more advanced studies which would be carried out in the technical schools.|$|E

500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|R
