500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Alfred Publishing on Musicnotes.com, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] {{is an alternative}} metal, gothic rock and post-grunge song set in a common time and performed in slow tempo of 48 beats per minute. Although the original Lacrimosa sequence was performed in D-minor, it was transposed into E-minor by Lee and Terry Balsamo. The instrumentation in the song is provided by piano, guitar, violins and drums. Lee's vocal range from the low note of B3 to the high note of E5; the SATB choir vocals range from the low note of B2 to the high note of E4. According to Gauntlet writer Claire Colette, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] has a [...] "violin intro, synth worth of a Nine Inch Nails album, and Omen-esque choral sections that are very haunting." [...] It then goes on with a pinon-themed melody before the [...] "power guitar section" [...] joins in. Lyrically, the song speaks about a break-up, as illustrated in the verse [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> it on me / Just set your guilt free, honey / I don't want to hold you back now love".|$|E
2500|$|The {{historical}} text Han Jin Chunqiu {{mentioned that}} Cao Rui had all along {{been aware of}} his mother's fate, and he was angry and sad about it. After he became emperor, his stepmother Guo Nüwang became the empress dowager. When he asked her about how his mother died, Guo replied, [...] "The Late Emperor {{was the one who}} ordered her death, so why are you asking me? You're your father's son so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> your dead father. Are you going to kill your stepmother for your real mother?" [...] Cao Rui turned furious and forced Empress Dowager Guo to commit suicide. He had her buried with the funeral rites befitting that of an empress, but also ordered her dead body to be treated {{in the same manner as}} she did to his mother – hair covering face, mouth stuffed with rice husks. However, the historical text Weilüe stated that after Empress Dowager Guo died of illness in 235, Cao Pi's concubine Lady Li (李夫人) told Cao Rui about the fate of his mother. Cao Rui was deeply grieved and he ordered Guo's dead body to be treated in the same manner as she did to his mother.|$|E

[...] "The point where trouble arises is, of course, over {{the division of the}} yield.

Anyway, you were glad to get it, and I never struck a farm where they fixed the hired man better than Leland of Prospect and his wife do.

And, what's more, I don't think feminine loveliness means much to Fillmore, or he'd never have picked on me. Still, it is calculated to give a girl a jar, you must admit, when {{she picks up a}} magazine and reads an advertisement of a face-cream beginning, 'Your husband is growing cold to <b>you.</b> <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> him? Have you really tried to cure those unsightly blemishes?'--meaning what I've got. Still, I haven't noticed Fillmore growing cold to me, so maybe it's all right." ...|$|R

"Yes," [...] said Erskine, trembling, [...] "and I {{thought he}} meant in earnest in loving <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>blame</b> me for that: I {{was in love}} myself; and love is blind and jealous.

'Don't be fools,' {{he said to}} them; 'what's {{the good}} of {{beginning}} to fight among ourselves, when it is so necessary for {{the three of us}} to work together and get the upper hand over the king of this country.

You see, he wants land, and will have it. Had you paid off what you owed him, he would have purchased the Crown property; and now, it seems young Gresham has bid against him, and is to have it. This has riled him, and I may as well tell you fairly, that {{he is determined to}} have either money or marbles." ...|$|E

And didn't he wreck the concert {{in the most}} sportsmanlike way with that encore of his? Think the Old Man {{is going to take}} that grinning? Not much! Fenn made a ripping fifty against Kent in the holidays--I saw him do it--but they don't count that. It's a wonder they didn't ask him to leave. Of course, I think it's jolly rough on Fenn, but I don't see that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> them. Not the Old Man, at any rate. He couldn't do {{anything}} else. It's all Kay's fault that all this has happened, of course. I'm awfully sorry for you having to go into that beastly hole, but from Kay's point of view it's a jolly sound move.

6000|$|Was she to {{be blamed}} for {{thinking}} so meanly of Tommy? <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> her with that tear in her eye if you choose; but I can think only of the gladness that came afterwards when {{she knew she had}} been unjust to him. [...] "Thank you, thank you, thank you!" [...] the bird sang to its Creator when the sun came out after rain, and it was Grizel's song as she listened to Corp's story of heroic Tommy. There was no room in her exultant heart for remorse. It would have shown littleness to be able to think of herself at all when she could think so gloriously of him. She was more than beautiful now; she was radiant; and it was because Tommy was the man she wanted him to be. As those who are cold hold out their hands to the fire did she warm her heart at what Corp had to tell, and the great joy that was lit within her made her radiant. Now the baby was in her lap, smiling back to her. He thought he had done it all. [...] "So you thought you could resist me!" [...] the baby crowed.|$|E

Many people were looking for excuses because we had done badly in the Euros but I certainly don't think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> that on the fact that I sat in Thierry Henry's seat."

5000|$|A June 2011 bill to defund U.S. {{operations}} in Libya {{was written by}} Rooney, but defeated {{on the floor of}} the House because 89 Republicans voted against it. Rooney accepted responsibility for defeat of the bill, which was in competition with a non-binding resolution to deny President Barack Obama authority to wage war against Libya, saying [...] "It was my bill. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> me.

5000|$|According to Kyuss tribute Blog Hugo Garcia, the {{producer}} of this album, said [...] "In 2005 I released a Kyuss Tribute album called [...] "Listen Without Distraction". It was a CD full of 16 Kyuss cover songs done by 16 bands from my country, Argentina. As you can guess, I did that tribute CD to show my love for Kyuss, a band that was not very well known in my country. Time has passed and Kyuss popularity has grown a lot in my country... I guess <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> it on the internet".|$|E
5000|$|Javid defended {{media freedom}} {{and the right of}} the press to {{investigate}} wrongdoing by politicians and officials in his first appearance as culture secretary on BBC's Question Time programme. [...] "The public were right to judge her on how she responded, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that," [...] he said. [...] "And the media … I don't think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> this on Leveson or the media or something. The media are a cornerstone of our democracy, their freedom is very important and if they want to investigate wrongdoing by politicians or any other public official they should do that and nothing should stop them from doing that." [...] It was reported in May 2015 that in March Javid had opposed plans by Theresa May to give Ofcom [...] "counter-extremism powers" [...] to vet British television programmes before they were broadcast. In a letter to David Cameron he commented that countries which had similar arrangements [...] "are not known for their compliance with rights related to freedom of expression and the Government may not wish to be associated with such regimes".|$|E

Yet somehow, Liam Neeson growls through this just-acceptable action sequel with his dignity intact, his wallet bigger and his movie family oblivious to all that occurred in 2009's Taken." [...] Neil Smith of Total Film also gave the film 4 stars out of 5, concluding, What are you going to do?' wails Maggie. 'What I do best!' growls Liam. Yet while it's fun to watch him take out the Eurotrash, we've seen him do it better." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film 4 stars out of 4, writing, [...] "You can't blame Liam Neeson, or the Taken producers, for trying to catch lightning in a bottle again. What <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> them for is Taken 2, a sequel every bit as clumsy, ham-handed, outlandish and laughable as the original was sleek, tough and efficient." ...|$|E
