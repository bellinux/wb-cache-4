500|$|In 2013, Tony Benn reiterated his {{previous}} opposition to European integration. Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by [...] "UKIP and Tory backbenchers", he said:I took {{the view that}} having fought [...] that we should now work with them, and co-operate, {{and that was my}} first thought about it. Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> on their terms, they will tell you what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ... I think they're building an empire there, they want us {{to be a part of}} their empire and I don't want that.|$|E
500|$|On 27 October 1659 three QuakersMarmaduke Stevenson, William Robinson and Mary Dyerwere {{led to the}} Boston gallows {{from the}} prison {{where they had been}} {{recently}} held for their Quaker evangelism, against which Massachusetts had enacted very strict laws. [...] Wilson, now nearly 70, as pastor of the Boston church was on hand as the supervising minister. As the two Quaker men first approached the gallows, wearing hats, Wilson said to Robinson, [...] "Shall such jacks as <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> before authority with your hats on?" [...] Ignoring the barb, Robinson then let forth a barrage of words, to which Wilson angrily responded, [...] "Hold thy tongue, be silent; thou art going to die with a lie in your mouth." [...] The two Quaker men were then hanged, after which it was Dyer's turn to ascend the ladder. [...] As the noose was fastened about her neck, and her face covered, a young man came running and shouting, wielding a document which he waved before the authorities. Governor Endecott had stayed her execution. [...] After the two executions had taken place, Wilson was said to have written a ballad about the event, which was sung by young men around Boston.|$|E

2500|$|The NBL and the {{international}} UCI uses the [...] "Olympic" [...] or Moto System of advancing to the Main. In the Moto System, you must race all three times to make the main or if the race is a large one semi finals. It is a formula combining how well you do with all the registered participant riders in your class racing all three times. It cumulatively determines who will race in the finals. The higher your points total, {{the more likely you}} will advance. For instance if <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> 1st, 1st and 1st, 40+50+60, which is 150 points, you are a virtual certainty to race in the Main (or in large races you are merely transferred to the quarter/semi-finals) barring disqualification for some reason. If <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> Last, Last, First, which in a race with eight men in your class translates to 0+0+60 or 60 points, you MIGHT race in the main (or in larger races the 1/8/quarter/semi finals) determining how well the others did. The person who came in 3rd place in all three motos or 30+40+50=120p would have a much better shot at making the Main than you. Even the person who came in 2nd+6th+6th or 35+25+35=95 would have a better shot even if you won the final moto.|$|E

2500|$|Jazz {{historian}} and commentator Ira Gitler declared that Tatum's [...] "left hand was {{the equal of}} his right." [...] When Bud Powell was opening for Tatum at Birdland around 1950, {{the end of an}} era when musicians engaged in overt competition and so-called cutting sessions, Powell reportedly said to Tatum, [...] "Man, I'm going to really show you about tempo and playing fast. [...] Anytime you're ready." [...] Tatum laughed and replied, [...] "Look, <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> here tomorrow, and anything you do with your right hand, I'll do with my left." [...] Powell never took up the challenge. Of note was Tatum's double-time stride playing, where his left hand alternated between playing bass notes (or tenth intervals) and mid-range chords at high speed, a device he used in showcase recordings like [...] "I Wish I Were Twins", [...] "The Shout", and [...] "Elegy".|$|E

You whack in at your bomber. It {{was never meant to}} be a dogfighter, {{it was meant to be}} a destroyer of bombers... The great problem with it was it did not have dive brakes. For example, if you want to fight and destroy a B-17, <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> on a dive. The 30mm cannon were not so accurate beyond 600 metres. So you normally came in at 600 yards and would open fire on your B-17. And your closing speed was still high and since you had to break away at 200 meters to avoid a collision, you only had two seconds firing time. Now, in two seconds, you can't sight. You can fire randomly and hope for the best. If you want to sight and fire, you need to double that time to four seconds. And with dive brakes, you could have done that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Seeking to musically express Raekwon's {{blend of}} Five Percenter creed and inner-city experience, {{producer}} RZA worked intensively on a polished sound, slower and more layered {{than that of}} Wu-Tang's previous efforts, using strings, piano loops and vocal samples from Kung Fu movies, and Mafia films. Due to Raekwon's storytelling, mobster-minded approach, the producer set up Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... to play like scenes in a crime movie. RZA has cited soul musician Isaac Hayes as an influence on his orchestral approach to several of the album's tracks. He also later revealed {{that several of the}} album's beats, such as [...] "Incarcerated Scarfaces," [...] were originally intended for Wu-Tang member GZA's Liquid Swords album, but because of Raekwon's timely writing approach, were used last minute for Cuban Linx. In regard to this, Raekwon clarified [...] "RZA's house was more or less like a candy store. <b>You</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and have all kinds of shit to choose from. I would take stuff that I felt would suit my album correctly; others would take their own beats too. The beats were like a grab bag. If I came in and heard a beat that someone already claimed, then I just had to fall back. We almost never fought over beats or nothing. I'd tell RZA if I liked a certain beat, and he'd see if it would fit me or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Gregg [...] "Opie" [...] Hughes was {{the host}} of The Nighttime Attitude, a late night music radio show on WBAB on Long Island, New York. In an effort to {{capitalize}} on the extensive media coverage of the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, Hughes held a song parody contest for listeners to submit entries based on the trial. Among the thirty or so submissions that he received, one of them was [...] "Gonna Electric Shock O.J." [...] to the tune of [...] "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay" [...] by Otis Redding, performed by Rotgut, a local band featuring Anthony Cumia, a construction worker, on vocals and his brother Joe. The latter travelled to the station while Hughes was doing his show to submit a cassette tape of the parody, and only allowed Hughes to take it. The parody became a hit with the audience, who asked for the song to be played each night. As a result, Hughes invited the Cumias to perform the song live in the studio. Recalled Hughes, [...] "Ant and I instantly had each other the rest of the show. I was like, 'Holy shit, dude. That went pretty well. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> next week?' Slowly but surely, he started coming in every week". Using the little funds available at the radio station, Hughes secured a small budget for Cumia to be paid for his appearances, though to Cumia, the money was not an issue as he [...] "just wanted to get a foot in the door" [...] in radio.|$|E
