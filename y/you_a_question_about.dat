40|$|As a civil {{engineer}} (or one who works closely with {{civil engineer}}s) you know that when you’re designing <b>an</b> intersection and <b>you</b> have <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> sight distance, <b>you</b> can look in the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, {{also known as the}} AASHTO Green Book, for an answer. Similarly, when <b>you</b> have <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> signs, pavement markings and signals for the same intersection, you know you will find all the answers in your copy of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, or MUTCD. But where do you look when <b>you</b> have <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> traffic safety? For example, what is the safest method for handling left turn movements at a four-way signalized intersection? Until recently, you would have had to sift through multiple sources of information (including, probably, the AASHTO Green Book, the MUTCD, and published research reports) to find an answer to such <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> But there was no guarantee that <b>you</b> would find <b>a</b> defini...|$|R

40|$|While {{the tone}} {{of this paper is}} {{informal}} and tongue-incheek, we believe we raise two important issues in robotics and multi-modal interface research; namely, how crucial integration of multiple modes of communication are for adjustable autonomy, which in turn is crucial for having dinner with R 2 D 2. Furthermore, we discuss how our multimodal interface to autonomous robots addresses these issues by tracking goals, allowing for both natural and mechanical modes of input, and how our robotic system adjusts itself to ensure that goals are achieved, despite interruptions.

An egroup is a web-based {{listserv}}. What, you may ask, is a listserv and what can it do for its members? Well, if you belong, you can send one message to a large group of people or receive an email that is sent to the entire egroup. For example, say <b>you</b> have <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> when the upcoming NCGE Annual Convention will be held. If <b>you</b> are <b>a</b> member of the MAGE egroup, you could send one email message to “mage@egroups. com” and all MAGE egroup members would receive your message. In lightening speed, <b>you</b> should receive <b>an</b> answer – or possibly several answers. Or, maybe you want to share a newly discovered resource! This has unlimited opportunities for opening the lines of communication between geography educators. Truly, this is a fantastic way for anyone in Minnesota interested in promoting geographic education to To join the MAGE egroup, follow these simple instructions 6 HQG DQ H PDLO WR &UDLJ +DWWDP D...|$|R
