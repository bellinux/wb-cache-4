The rest of what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> is opera, {{and nothing}} but opera. Before many bars have been played, Siegfried and the wakened Brynhild, newly become tenor and soprano, will sing a concerted cadenza; plunge on from that to a {{magnificent}} love duet...The work which follows, entitled Night Falls on the Gods , is a thorough grand opera.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of July 15, 1974, Chubbuck {{confused}} co-workers by claiming she had to read a newscast to open Suncoast Digest, something she had never done before. That morning's talk show guest waited across the studio while Chubbuck sat at the news anchor's desk. During the first eight minutes of her program, Chubbuck covered three national news stories and then a shooting from the previous day at local restaurant Beef & Bottle, at the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport. The film reel of the restaurant shooting had jammed and would not run, so Chubbuck shrugged it off and said on-camera, [...] "In keeping with Channel 40's policy of bringing you the latest in 'blood and guts', and in living color, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> another first—attempted suicide." [...] She drew the revolver and shot herself behind her right ear. Chubbuck fell forward violently and the technical director faded the broadcast rapidly to black.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Bernard, laughing, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coarse and flattering, I collapse. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> titillate my vanity, I succumb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poff," [...] {{she said}} suddenly, [...] "has it ever {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do afterwards. Do <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite well off?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The man {{is growing}} {{stronger}} and better every day. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make him recover, after all. I was afraid"--he corrected himself--"I thought"--the word <b>was</b> the truer--"that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> poison him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Groom your horse, {{wash your}} shirt, clean your weapons, find your inn, fight your enemies, cheat your friends,--anything and everything. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world. I am going with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those are {{not your}} friends," [...] she said. [...] "You {{know very well that}} they never could be. You can go and wish them good night. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Likely enough. 'Gad! the {{performance}} {{is going to}} commence," [...] Arthur exclaimed, quickly. [...] "Paul, {{you are going to}} have a new sensation. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the most beautiful woman in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{quite know}} what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say," [...] {{retorted}} Peter hotly. [...] "I can see it by your chin. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take their part--and suggest their acting undutifully towards their parents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are going," [...] Pritchard replied, [...] "on {{an errand}} of chivalry. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> become once more a rescuer of woman in distress. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{save the life}} of your {{beautiful}} friend Elizabeth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> allow yourself, then, to be {{the prey}} of these morbid fancies? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> treat this {{creature}} {{as a human being}} of your own order? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let him work upon your imagination?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fellows <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> are Navahoes, {{though not}} good {{specimens}} of the tribe, {{or they would}} not be down here to sell ponies. Still, they are a very different sort from those you have seen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{was well}} done!' panted Bella, {{slackening}} {{in the next}} street, and subsiding into a walk. 'If I had left myself any breath to cry with, I should have cried again. Now poor dear darling little Pa, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> your lovely woman unexpectedly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aha! What! you {{recollect}} my skirmishes with Rosa, do you?' {{he exclaimed}} {{with a quick}} look. 'Confound the girl, I am half afraid of her. She's like a goblin to me. But never mind her. Now {{what are you going}} to do? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> your nurse, I suppose?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say. Well, {{perhaps it is}} rash. But when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> foreign courts, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to do? If you have got those sort of things you must wear them." ...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{character}} team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each {{character is a}} pastiche of a superhero, Tischman insisted the concept was much broader than that: [...] "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the really cute one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the quiet one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the spiritual one and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the goofy one. That’s the case from every group from Justice League to 'N Sync" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{tell the}} truth as you have just told it," [...] replied Fisher. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> placard this town with the wickedness done <b>to</b> old Wilkins. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fill the {{newspapers}} with the infamous story of Mrs. Biddle. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> denounce Verner from a public platform, naming {{him for what he}} did and naming the poacher he did it <b>to.</b> And you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find out by what trade this man made the money with which he bought the estate; and when you know the truth, as I said before, of course <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell it. Upon those terms I come under the old flag, as you call it, and haul down my little pennon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most likely {{from the}} north or northwest. At least that's the quarter it's likely to settle into; but there ain't no saying which way it may take us. I thought things {{had been going on}} too smooth to last. Now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what a storm is, my lad. You thought it was blowing when we went down the Channel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How unfortunate! Uncle, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the fortress; we don't {{care for}} it; but I {{want you to}} take these gloves and inquire for Baron Sigismund Palsdorf. He will be there with a party of gentlemen. You can easily manage it, men are so free and easy. Mind what he is like, and come home in time to tell me all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{very nice}} excuse {{to get rid}} of me," [...] she said, [...] "but I daresay you are right, and I want to see about the garden. There, good-bye, and mind you are not late, for I want to have a nice drive round to the Castle. Not that there is much need to warn you to be in time when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Miss de la Molle, is there? Good-bye, good-bye." ...|$|E
50|$|Groucho: <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{convicted of}} murder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not now," [...] she {{interrupted}} hastily. [...] "Do you know, I fancy {{that we must}} {{be getting}} too confidential. That odious man with the eyeglass keeps staring at us. Tell me what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do when <b>you</b> leave here. You can ask me--what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to,</b> afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'When <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> settle {{yourself}} in some Christian sort of place, Liz? I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{do it before}} now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her {{whether you}} like or not, my dear boy, so {{make up your mind}} to that. You know how you used to chaff me about my whims. Well, I've got a whim now, and I'll have my way as usual. I am going to see you to-morrow, and if you won't see me under my {{conditions}} in London, I shall call at Woking in the evening. Oh my goodness, what a bombshell! But you know that I am always as good as my word. So look out! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{now is the}} Descent {{from the}} Cross; it is after Rubens, one of the {{greatest}} masters that ever lived, if you ever heard of such a person,' he added, in a grumbling voice, and then turning to Sidonia, he said, 'This crucifixion is the only thing which these savages seem at all to understand; but I should like you, sir, as you are an artist, to see the children in some Greek or Roman story: Pygmalion, or the Death of Agrippina. I think you would be pleased.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you think, Master Cyril, {{if you go}} {{with the}} Fleet, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> much of what goes on. It will be worse for you {{than it was for}} me, for there was I, labouring and toiling like a dumb beast, with my mind intent upon working the gun, and paying no heed to the roar and {{confusion}} around, scarce even noticing when one beside me was struck down. You will be up on the poop, having naught to do but to stand with your hand on your sword hilt, and waiting to board an enemy or to drive back one who tries to board you. You will find that you will be well-nigh dazed and stupid with the din and uproar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow," [...] he went on, {{speaking}} with decision, [...] "so {{long as you}} feel like that, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have a new gown--or two--and a new hat, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have them at once. They <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bought with your brother's money, mind. Shall I come shopping with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Luke, old friend," [...] Ned said earnestly, {{putting his}} hand on the cropper's shoulder, [...] "don't be angry with Polly, she has done me a great service. I have learned the truth, and know what you meant now by a life for a life. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{sacrifice}} yourself for me. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take upon yourself a crime which you never committed to clear me. You went to York to declare yourself the murderer of Mulready, in case I had <b>been</b> found guilty. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> emigrate to America to send home a written confession." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, {{will you}} {{let me know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{thinking}} of doing? I told the general what service you had rendered me, and he asked me what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do. I told him that, as yet, I did not know whether <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay here, or go back again." ...|$|R
60|$|And now, O Nibelungen Spectator, pluck up; for all allegories {{come to an}} end somewhere; and {{the hour}} of your release from these {{explanations}} is at hand. The rest of what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> is opera, and nothing but opera. Before many bars have been played, Siegfried and the wakened Brynhild, newly become tenor and soprano, will sing a concerted cadenza; plunge on from that to a magnificent love duet; and end with a precipitous allegro a capella, driven headlong to its end by the impetuous semiquaver triplets of the famous finales to the first act of Don Giovanni or the coda to the Leonore overture, with a specifically contrapuntal theme, points d'orgue, and a high C for the soprano all complete.|$|E
6000|$|... "Assuredly," [...] he answered, benignly. [...] "You {{have managed}} to please everybody, Mr. Parr included,--and {{some of us are}} not easy to please. I thought I'd tell you this, as a friend, as your first friend in the parish. Your {{achievement}} has been all the more remarkable, following, as you did, Dr. Gilman. Now it would greatly distress me to see that state of things disturbed, both for your sake and others. I thought I would just give you a hint, as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Mr. Parr, that he is in rather a nervous state. These so-called political reformers have upset the market and started a lot of legal complications that's why I'm here to-night. Go easy with him. I know you won't do anything foolish." ...|$|E
60|$|BRASSBOUND. Ay, on {{the track}} of the railway from the Cape to Cairo. Who are you, that a nation should go to war for you? If you are missing, what will your {{newspapers}} say? A foolhardy tourist. What will your learned friends at the bar say? That {{it was time for}} you to make room for younger and better men. YOU a national hero! You had better find a goldfield in the Atlas Mountains. Then all the governments of Europe will rush to your rescue. Until then, take care of yourself; for <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at last the hypocrisy in the sanctimonious speech of the judge who is sentencing you, instead of the despair in the white face of the wretch you are recommending to the mercy of your God.|$|E

"I {{know exactly}} what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, Fan," [...] she spoke, [...] "for <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{perfectly}} transparent, and I can read you like a book. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write one of your very simple candid letters {{to tell him what}} I have said, and then finish by asking him to come down with Mr. Eden." ...|$|R
