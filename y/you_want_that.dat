500|$|Friedell {{recommended}} that {{in view of}} the scope of the Manhattan Project, a more senior officer be placed in charge. In October, Groves penned a letter to the Surgeon General of the United States Army, Major General Norman T. Kirk, requesting that he cooperate with the Manhattan Project in furnishing medical supplies, providing funds for medical care of military personnel, and directly commissioning Warren and other doctors at specified ranks. This letter was signed by Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell and delivered in person by Colonel Kenneth D. Nichols, who had replaced Marshall as the district engineer. Kirk was furious at what he saw as usurpation of his statutory responsibilities as Surgeon General. When told that Warren was the man the district had in mind to commission as a colonel, and apparently familiar with Warren's work only from his use of radiation to treat venereal disease asked [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>that</b> clap doctor?" ...|$|E
500|$|Before the 1966 season began, Koufax and Drysdale met {{separately}} with Dodger GM Buzzie Bavasi {{to negotiate}} their contracts {{for the upcoming}} year. After Koufax's meeting, he met Drysdale for dinner and complained that Bavasi was using Drysdale against him in the negotiations, asking, [...] "How come <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>that</b> much when Drysdale only wants this much?" [...] Drysdale responded that Bavasi {{did the same thing}} with him, using Koufax against him. Drysdale's first wife, Ginger Drysdale, suggested that they negotiate together to get what they wanted. They demanded $1 million ($ today), divided equally over the next three years, or $167,000 ($ today) each for each of the next three seasons. Both players were represented by an entertainment lawyer, J. William Hayes, which was unusual during an era when players were not represented by agents. At the time, Willie Mays was Major League Baseball's highest paid player at $125,000 ($ today) per year and multi-year contracts were very unusual.|$|E
500|$|The song {{starts with}} an {{electric}} guitar riff comparable {{to the music of}} English alternative rock band Oasis. The chords harmonize with each other, continuing for 22 seconds. The techno melody then begins, consisting of a main synth sound oscillating on the primary musical note, with the EQ moving between the bass and the treble. The [...] "restless" [...] beat is accompanied by a rock-inspired chord riff, with Madonna's pitch being higher than the other tracks from the album. While recording, Orbit kept [...] "Ray of Light" [...] a semitone higher than the singer's limit, resulting in a strain added to the vocals. [...] "She got frustrated when we were recording but <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>that</b> bit of edge with singers, that thing of reaching. You can't fake it, and you can hear it when she cracks it on the record," [...] he recalled. Before the final chorus there is a synth solo again, reminiscent of a 1970s pro-rock record. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, this was a link to the origin of the song from [...] "Sepheryn".|$|E

500|$|For the 30th {{anniversary of}} The Joshua Tree, U2 staged a 2017 concert tour in North America, Europe, and Latin America, {{on which the}} album was played in its {{entirety}} at each show. It {{was the first time}} the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue, rather than a new release. As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Trees subject matter. He said that in looking at the record's anniversary, [...] "things have kind of come full circle, if <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> <b>That</b> record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest. Thatcher was in the throes of trying to put down the miners' strike; there was all kinds of shenanigans going on in Central America. It feels like we're right back there in a way. I don't think any of our work has ever come full circle to that extent. It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago.'" ...|$|E

Regarding his nominations, Nelly commented: [...] "It's always good to be nominated, especially for something {{as big as the}} Grammys. Just the recognition itself is an award. But <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>that</b> little gold record player. You just want to take it home."
