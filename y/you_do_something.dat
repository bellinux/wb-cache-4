25|$|INTERVIEWER: Suppose {{someone called}} {{you and said}} there was a kid, {{nineteen}} or twenty years old, who has been a very good boy, {{but all of a sudden}} this week he started walking around the neighborhood carrying a large cross. The neighbors are upset and the family's upset, and would <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it. How would you think about that as a problem? Some kind of bizarre behavior like that.|$|E
500|$|Championship runner-up Fernando Alonso {{expressed}} {{pride for}} his team, {{going so far}} as to call the 2012 season [...] "the best season of my career". During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously we lost the championship now, but I don't think, as you said, that we lost here in Brazil, we lost in some races where we were a little bit unlucky. But this is a sport, but when <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> with your heart, when <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of your team, happy for them, and we will try next year." [...] The press later pointed out Alonso's [...] "grace after the race", contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition's [...] "dirty tricks" [...] during his post-race press conference.|$|E
500|$|Eisenberg {{is also a}} {{cast member}} with Theater of War, a {{performing}} arts non-profit that presents readings of Sophocles's Ajax and Philoctetes to military and civilian communities across the United States and Europe. [...] "As an actor, sometimes you feel limited by the role you're in; stories without much meaning. [...] allows <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that has more substance and benefits people... It's a greater purpose than just entertainment," [...] Eisenberg said of the organization.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Syme," [...] he said, [...] "this evening <b>you</b> {{succeeded in}} <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> rather remarkable. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> {{to me that}} no man born of woman has ever succeeded in doing before." ...|$|R

500|$|In the single, LaBelle teases the {{listener}} with the lyrics: [...] "Am I {{the aim of}} your fascination? / Am I the eye of your storm?". During the chorus, LaBelle is described as crooning the following lyrics: [...] "Baby, I was born to make <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> you've never done / You'll be forever young / I'm your Lolita." [...] LaBelle continues to seduce {{the listener}} by singing: [...] "Leave your pinstripes and your 9 to 5 in my Lolita eyes tonight / Come on, let's dirty up your mind." [...] A writer from Singersroom described LaBelle as sounding [...] "ready to pleasure her man" [...] {{over the course of}} the song.|$|E
500|$|The school {{treated the}} {{incident}} seriously and called police {{to the school}} {{in the days after}} the noose incident. The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, [...] "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me before <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E
500|$|Grohl {{declared}} that [...] "making this record revitalized this band", particularly the acoustic songs, as they [...] "showed ourselves what we're capable of doing" [...] and [...] " [...] things scary again. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that you've never done, {{and it makes}} you feel like a bigger band." [...] The frontman also stated the mellower acoustic disc was an opportunity to use [...] "the acoustic tracks we wrote in the past eight or nine years, but never put on albums because they never seemed to fit", particularly because Grohl felt that [...] "it's hard to put an acoustic song {{in the middle of a}} rock record, because sometimes it mucks up the sequence." [...] The tracks include Grohl's first composition [...] "Friend of a Friend" [...] – done in 1990, and previously recorded under the pseudonym 'Late!' on the cassette Pocketwatch; [...] "Razor", which Grohl wrote for a benefit concert at the Wiltern Theatre; and drummer Taylor Hawkins' composition [...] "Cold Day in the Sun", which after an attempt to do an electric version became an unplugged track, featuring Hawkins on vocals and tambourine and Grohl in the drums.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2006, former {{majority}} leader Trent Lott stated [...] "What are people worried about? What is the problem? Are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> you're not supposed to?" ...|$|R

500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E
2500|$|Brooks {{felt that}} a sketch show would best suit her assets (acting, singing, and dancing). [...] "Why would <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> with Tracey playing a single {{character}} on TV when her talent requires variety? You can’t categorize Tracey, so it's silly {{to come up with}} a show that attempted to." ...|$|E
2500|$|As children, {{the three}} Emanuel {{brothers}} shared a bedroom and spent summers together in Israel. All three brothers took ballet lessons in their childhood, which Emanuel says [...] "hardened us and {{taught us that}} if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> unusual, people will take potshots at you." [...] Emanuel and his brother Rahm frequently argue about healthcare policy. Emanuel mimics his brother's end of the conversation: [...] "You {{want to change the}} whole healthcare system, and I can’t even get SCHIP [...] passed with dedicated funding? What kind of idiot are you?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "A machine classifies {{a person}} as an offender, and you can't confront your accuser {{because there is no}} accuser... can it be wise to {{establish}} a principle that when a machine says <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> illegal, <b>you</b> are presumed guilty?" ...|$|R

2500|$|In a {{movie theater}} in 1989 Minneapolis, Minnesota, a young Emma is {{watching}} The Sword in the Stone. She steals a woman's candy bar, and is approached by an usher, who tells Emma [...] "Don't do it". She expects him to reprimand her, but he instead offers her advice by saying, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that you're not supposed to do, even if you're {{doing it for the}} right reason, bad things will happen". He also mentions that she {{will have the opportunity to}} remove Excalibur from its stone and warns her not to touch it, just before he disappears.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Chan {{was named}} an [...] "anti-drug ambassador" [...] by the Chinese government, {{actively}} {{taking part in}} anti-drug campaigns and supporting President Xi Jinping's declaration that illegal drugs should be eradicated, and their users punished severely. In 2014, when his own son Jaycee was arrested for cannabis use, {{he said that he}} was [...] "angry", [...] "shocked", [...] "heartbroken" [...] and [...] "ashamed" [...] of his son. He also remarked, [...] "I hope all young people will learn a lesson from Jaycee and stay far from the harm of drugs. I say to Jaycee that you have to accept the consequences when <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Warhol was {{an early}} adopter of the silk screen printmaking process as a {{technique}} for making paintings. While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his [...] "blotted line" [...] technique, [...] applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a printmaking process on the most rudimentary scale. His use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme, a method that prefigures his 1960s silk-screen canvas. In his book , Warhol writes, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> exactly wrong, you always turn up something." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2016, {{her name}} {{appeared}} in the Panama Papers as registered owner of five companies in the British Virgin Islands. She commented, [...] "I didn't even know[...] [...] It is not relevant. It is not because {{you are in the}} Panama list that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> wrong. <b>You</b> are the one informing me about that. You can't assume everyone with a BVI company has <b>done</b> <b>something</b> wrong".|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{want the}} money, Daly," [...] said he: [...] "I couldn't get afloat unless I {{had more than}} that: I couldn't pay your bill, you know, unless I got a higher figure down than that. Come, Daly, <b>you</b> must <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for me; <b>you</b> must <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> <b>you</b> know, to earn the fees," [...] {{and he tried to}} look facetious, by giving a wretched ghastly grin.|$|R
2500|$|On August 8, 2007, Boston Celtics {{general manager}} Danny Ainge and head coach Doc Rivers {{discussed}} {{with him about}} joining their revamped roster including Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, and longtime Celtic Paul Pierce in a reserve role. [...] On August 12, his former coach Rick Carlisle {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "we (Miller and I) talked about it and agreed that it was something that deserved careful consideration." [...] On August 24, 2007, his 42nd birthday, Miller decided against any comeback, stating: [...] "Physically, I know I could have done it. But mentally, when <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> like this, you've either got to be all in or all out. And I've decided I'm all out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Reisner, {{who headed}} the International Legal Division of the Israeli Military Advocate General's Office from 1994 to 2005, has stated that {{although}} targeted killing is illegal under previous understanding of international law, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for long enough, the world will accept it. The whole of international law is now based {{on the notion that}} an act that is forbidden today becomes permissible if executed by enough countries." [...] Reisner continues, [...] "International law progresses through violations. We invented the targeted assassination thesis and we had to push it. At first there were protrusions that made it hard to insert easily into the legal moulds. Eight years later it is {{in the center of the}} bounds of legitimacy." [...] This view is disputed by George Bisharat of the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, who contends that assassination is not widely regarded as legal.|$|E
2500|$|Laker was {{the first}} player to take all 10 wickets in a Test match innings, ten for 53 in the Australians' 2nd innings of the 4th Ashes Test at Old Trafford in 1956 (the only other bowler to take all 10 wickets is Anil Kumble of India in 1999). Having also taken 9 for 37 in the first innings, Laker's match bowling figures were 19 for 90: no other bowler has taken more than {{seventeen}} wickets in a first-class match. [...] Laker was married to an Austrian who did not know much about cricket. On the day of his achievement when he arrived home, his wife asked him, [...] "Jim, did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> good today?" [...] after she had taken hundreds of congratulatory telephone calls. Remarkably, Laker had also taken all 10 wickets in an innings for Surrey against the same Australians earlier in the season, the first time a bowler had taken all ten against the Australians since Ted Barratt did so in 1878.|$|E
