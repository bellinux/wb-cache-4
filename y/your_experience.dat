You may attempt through various stylistic conventions and devices to reconstitute for the reader <b>your</b> <b>experience</b> of hearing face to face the man's words. The sound of the man's narration may be represented by vocabulary, syntax, imagery, graphic devices of various sorts—quotation marks, punctuation, line breaks, visual patterning of white space and black space, markers that encode print analogs to speech—vernacular interjections, parentheses, ellipses, asterisks, footnotes, italics, dashes....|$|E
25|$|The true reason, then, why Hegelism {{can give}} {{no reason for}} the Time-process, i.e. {{for the fact that}} the world is 'in time,' and changes continuously, is that it was {{constructed}} to give an account of the world irrespective of time and change. If you insist on having a system of eternal and immutable 'truth,' you can get it only by abstracting from those characteristics of reality, which we try to express by the terms individuality, time, and change. But you must pay the price for a formula that will enable you to make assertions that hold good far beyond the limits of <b>your</b> <b>experience.</b> And it is part of the price that you will in the end be unable to give a rational explanation of those very characteristics, which you dismissed at the outset as irrelevant to a rational explanation.|$|E

2500|$|Happiness in {{its broad}} sense is the label {{for a family}} of {{pleasant}} emotional states, such as joy, amusement, satisfaction, gratification, euphoria, and triumph. For example, happiness comes from [...] "encountering unexpected positive events", [...] "seeing a significant other", and [...] "basking in the acceptance and praise of others". More narrowly, it refers to experiential and evaluative well-being. Experiential well-being, or [...] "objective happiness", is happiness measured in the moment via questions such as [...] "How good or bad is <b>your</b> <b>experience</b> now?". In contrast, evaluative well-being asks questions such as [...] "How good was your vacation?" [...] and measures one's subjective thoughts and feelings about happiness in the past. Experiential well-being is less prone to errors in reconstructive memory, but the majority of literature on happiness refers to evaluative well-being. The two measures of happiness can be related by heuristics such as the peak-end rule.|$|E
2500|$|Peirce treats symbols as habits or {{norms of}} {{reference}} and meaning. Symbols can be natural, cultural, or abstract and logical. They depend as signs {{on how they}} will be interpreted, and lack or have lost dependence on resemblance and actual, indexical connection to their represented objects, though the symbol's individual embodiment is an index to <b>your</b> <b>experience</b> of its represented object. Symbols are instantiated by specialized indexical sinsigns. A proposition, considered apart from its expression in a particular language, is already a symbol, but many symbols draw from what is socially accepted and culturally agreed upon. Conventional symbols such as [...] "horse" [...] and >caballo, which prescribe qualities of sound or appearance for their instances (for example, individual instances of the word [...] "horse" [...] on the page) are based on what amounts to arbitrary stipulation. Such a symbol uses what is already known and accepted within our society to give meaning. This can be both in spoken and written language.|$|E

2500|$|I am very {{sensible}} {{that you}} are let into {{the knowledge of the}} intrigues of the compter, particularly with relation to the securing of pocket books. But <b>your</b> <b>experience</b> is inferior to mine... I can put you in a far better method than you are acquainted with... But I must first tell you that you'll spoil the trade of thief-taking in advancing greater rewards than are necessary. I give but half a crown a book... And when the thieves and pickpockets see us confederate they'll submit to our terms.Thus their partnership started taking Hitchen and his assistant first to Temple Bar, westernmost limit of his area of Jurisdiction. There marshal was revered with different [...] "fine" [...] drinks at different taverns, to which he only gave a brief sign asking for information on stolen goods. He was verbose, though, in his [...] "promises of protection" [...] to female visitors of those establishments:"I'll give you my word...you shall be detected, unless you deliver all the pocket books you from time to time meet with to me...If you at any time for the future, refuse to yield... either to me or my servant, you may be assured of being all sent to Bridewell... Wild gives an example of marshal's treatment of well-dressed women too. Once he seized a baillif's wife in the street in Ludgate Hill for talking to a man and accused her of being [...] "lewd". He took her to Cheapside and made her wait till he dined and pay for his meal. Pickpockets, or [...] "mathematicians" [...] as Hitchen called them affectionately", appear with a noteworthy incident in this period. On their regular night walks near St.Paul's, Hitchen and Wild saw the boys running away. Hitchen, having information on a stolen book, saw the reason of their hiding. He caught and arrested one, whose name was James Jones, the same juvenile who stole Lord Barnard's bills. The boy gave the address of his friends next morning before the justice and Hitchen took Wild to Barbican to attack their house during the night. The uninvited guests were welcomed with unfriendly 'damn ye', upon which the assistant Wild was left inside with the company while the marshal fled for bringing more constables. The gang of around 12 year-olds was taken and tried at Kingston assizes as their robbery was committed in Surrey. To the great disappointment and fury of marshal, court acquitted the boys upon their parents' complaint on marshal forcing their children to commit crime. He could not claim usual 40 pounds for their dead or alive heads. Moreover, was reprimanded by the court for the base interest. Wild gives very interesting account of the other side of Hitchen's relation to pickpockets we will mention below.|$|E
