25|$|It's true to {{say these}} {{programmes}} {{about climate change}} are different, in that previously I have made programmes about natural history, and now <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> I have an engaged stance. The first is {{about the fact that}} there is climate change and that it is human-induced. So I'm glad that the BBC wanted some clear statement of the evidence as to why these two things are the case.|$|E
25|$|The book, co-authored with Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, reprints Shannon's 1948 {{article and}} Weaver's popularization of it, which is {{accessible}} to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver {{pointed out that the}} word information in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say.</b> That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 2016, Eisley {{revealed}} {{that they had}} begun the process of recording their fifth studio record {{with the assistance of}} producer Will Yip at the band's own studio in Tyler {{at the beginning of the}} month. DuPree-Bemis spoke of the new album in the band's press release, mentioning that, “Musically, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> it’s classic Eisley, in the sense that it’s melodic, moody pop and is written from the heart. Lyrically, it’s very whimsical; it has a vibe that will take you into its own world and let you escape your normal life for a few minutes. I like to cloak things in a little mystery and romance; I think it’s part of what makes all of Eisley’s songs sound like they’re from the same world. Every record is like opening and reading a book in a series.” Tracking for the album concluded in early July, with mention of plans to release the record in early 2017.|$|E

25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
500|$|In {{the press}} statement, Mikael Åkerfeldt {{explained}} the decision, saying, [...] "Mendez, Axe and Fredrik and I {{came to the}} decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album, and this {{came as no surprise}} to Per. He had, in turn, been thinking about leaving, so <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> it was a mutual decision. There's no bad blood, just a relationship that came to an end, and that's that." ...|$|E

[...] He also said of her [...] "I guess <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> she was a family pet. I used to rider her out to the pastures to round up other mares, things like that."

500|$|In the 21st century, {{the song}} {{continued}} to draw commentary from listeners. [...] By now Kaukonen was offering {{the view that}} the [...] "blood-stained banders" [...] of the lyric was an allusion to the Ku Klux Klan. He continued to find meaning in performing [...] "Good Shepherd" [...] and other songs like it that celebrated religion in one context or another without preaching, saying such material gave him a doorway into scripture: [...] "I guess <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> I loved the Bible without even knowing it.

500|$|Stratford Caldecott also {{interpreted}} the Ring in theological terms: [...] "The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark {{magic of the}} corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God. It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly [...] "thin" [...] and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard {{to give up and}} corrupting in the long run".|$|E
500|$|After {{their first}} couple of seasons in New York City, team {{ownership}} infrequently invested in new players. The ownership group of Farrell and Devery spent their money on personal pursuits such as gambling, leaving them with little to put into the team. New York's star player, Chase, consorted frequently with gamblers. Author Jim Reisler dubbed him [...] "the most crooked player to ever play the game" [...] because of reports that he took part in game fixing. The club also had difficulty drawing fans to Hilltop Park. Appel wrote that [...] "maybe the best thing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> about the ballpark was that it never burned down." [...] By {{the end of the}} 1912 season, Farrell was searching for a site to build a new stadium on.|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{sought to}} capture the nostalgic feel of the 1950s. In this effort, he used several themes {{associated}} with the time period, including alien invasion movies, nuclear threats, Cold War paranoia, and optimism in the future. About the time period, Anderson said [...] "it seemed like {{this was a time}} when <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> with a straight face, 'I'm fighting for truth, justice and the American way.'" [...] For the characters Anderson was picturing George Reeves's Superman and Noel Neill's Lois Lane as portrayed in the 1950s television series Adventures of Superman. One reviewer noted that Anderson's portrayal of Lex Luthor is that of the post-Crisis on Infinite Earths amoral businessman and Batman was more reminiscent of a 1930s-style or a [...] ""-style Batman where he is actively pursued by the police.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Secret Speech" [...] {{proved to}} be an utter misnomer. While the {{attendees}} at the Speech were all Soviet, Eastern European delegates were allowed to hear it the following night, read slowly to allow them to take notes. By 5 March, copies were being mailed throughout the Soviet Union, marked [...] "not for the press" [...] rather than [...] "top secret". An official translation appeared within a month in Poland; the Poles printed 12,000 extra copies, one of which soon reached the West. Khrushchev's son, Sergei, later wrote, [...] "learly, Father tried to ensure it would reach as many ears as possible. It was soon read at Komsomol meetings; that meant another eighteen million listeners. If you include their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that the entire country became familiar with the speech... Spring had barely begun when the speech began circulating around the world." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} behind Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{came from}} Yash Chopra's Kabhi Kabhie (1976). On being {{inspired by the}} classic, Karan quoted, [...] "What appealed to me {{was the fact that}} the love story stretched out across generations. It began with youth and went on as the people grew older. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that Kabhi Kabhie is the starting point for my new film, that I am inspired by it. But the film, I am sure, will be very different. It will look different, feel different." [...] Similarly, Karan added an extra [...] "e" [...] to the second Kabhi in the title of his film, due to numerological reasons. In an interview with The Times of India, Karan dispelled comparisons with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and said that while his debut film was [...] "frothy and bubble-gummish", this one was [...] "more classy and sophisticated". He added that there would be [...] "plenty of drama" [...] in this film too, but handled more maturely.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green in her {{review for}} TrekNation called the storyline [...] "absurdly flimsy" [...] {{and that the}} episode [...] "just felt lazy on every level".

In {{the list of the}} five worst Star Trek: The Next Generation compiled by TechRepublic writer Jay Garmon, [...] "Shades of Gray" [...] was listed as the worst. Garmon described it a [...] "travesty" [...] and that the [...] "nicest" [...] thing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> about the episode was that {{it was the last time}} there was a flashback episode in the series and the last appearance of Pulaski. It was also the original choice of worst episode by Empire magazine, but it was decided that it didn't count as it was a clip show – so [...] "" [...] was chosen instead.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, FDR's son Elliott {{published}} An Untold Story: The Roosevelts of Hyde Park, {{in which}} he recalled seeing LeHand in his father's lap and alleged that she [...] "shared a familiar life in all its aspects with father". His eldest brother Jimmy disagreed, arguing that FDR's illness had made sexual function too {{difficult for him to}} have a physical affair. [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> they came to love one another", he wrote, [...] "but it was not a physical love." [...] Kathryn Smith, the author of the only biography of LeHand, could come to no conclusion, but wrote, [...] "As far as evidence goes, {{there is not a single}} written account of anyone seeing them in a compromising position, despite the hundreds of Secret Service agents, staff members, political cronies, family members and friends who traipsed through FDR's bedrooms—which he used as an auxiliary office—during their twenty-one years together."

500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E
