40|$|ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I {{would like}} to express an {{incredible}} amount of gratitude for those who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a part of this thesis writing journey with me, whether they always realized it or not. Successfully completing and defending my thesis <b>has</b> <b>been</b> an incredibly rewarding opportunity, one I <b>am</b> blessed to <b>have</b> had, but I certainly could not have gotten through this alone. The level of dedication and commitment that the chair of my committee, Dr. Dimitra Jackson, has shown me over {{the past year and a}} half <b>has</b> <b>been</b> astounding. Your guidance, support, empathy, encouragement, and the challenges that you put before me pushed me into becoming a better researcher and a better practitioner within the field of Higher Education and Student Affairs. I would be lost without you. Thank you for allowing me to learn far more through this process than I could have ever imagined – about qualitative research, this area of focus, and myself. I am thankful for Dr. Philip Craig Morton and absolutely everything that you bring to the table. Your assistance, suggestions, and knowledge <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so helpful in allowing this research to have a clinical influence. <b>Your</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> pivotal, and I do hope to proceed further with this research. Thank you for that encouragement and belief that I can. Stacy Jacob, thank you for encouraging me to explore qualitative research and to not be afraid to challenge the process or the system. You have an incredible way with teaching, even from afar. I <b>am</b> grateful to <b>have</b> learned from and been inspired by you...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the place}} to express my thanks to all the people who have {{supported}} me {{over the last couple of}} months. However, I would like to single out a few names. For example, there is Marc Ruef with whom I touched base on the initial idea for this thesis during a lunch discussion. We share a similar experience on security testing and found out that we were both not fully satisfied with the way the results are provided to the client. Another thank you goes to Jan Monsch, the creator of DAVIX. He was able to draw my attention to the subject of visualization when we worked together as security analysts. Quite a few items of his personal library moved to my place for the duration of this thesis. I would also like to thank William Rothwell for becoming my project supervisor and for his ongoing support. He received the first status report in October last year and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> providing valuable <b>feedback</b> since. Few people have read the project report as many times as he did. Bruno, <b>your</b> tough <b>feedback</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> very much appreciated. Now I know why you <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so successful in your job over the last couple of years. You <b>have</b> <b>been</b> officially elected to be on the reviewer’s list for the next one. Greg surprised me again with his speed an...|$|R
40|$|The {{sustaining}} fiber (SF) {{stage of}} the crayfish visual system converts analog stimulus repre-sentations to spike train signals. A recent theory quantifies a system’s information processing ca-pabilities and relates to statistical signal processing. To analyze SF responses to light stimuli, we extend a wavelet-based algorithm for separating analog input signals and spike output waveforms in composite intracellular recordings. We also present a time-varying RC circuit model to capture nonstationary membrane noise spectral characteristics. In our SF anlysis, information transfer ra-tios are generally {{on the order of}} 10 − 4. The SF information processing dynamics show transient peaks followed by decay to steady-state values. A simple theoretical spike generator is analyzed analytically and shows general dynamic and steady-state properties similar to SFs. The informa-tion transfer ratios increase with spike rate and dynamic properties are due to direct spike generator dependence on input changes. Acknowledgments I would like to thank Dr. Raymon Glantz and Dr. Rob Nowak {{for taking the time to}} serve on my thesis committee. <b>Your</b> comments and <b>feedback</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very helpful and caused me to consider many issues I would have neglected otherwise.

Over the past three years I have learned much under your supervision which has prepared me for my future endeavours. I {{would also like to thank}} Maurice Feldman and Becky Ward for being a part of my thesis committee. <b>Your</b> <b>feedback</b> and encouragement <b>has</b> <b>been</b> immensely appreciated. The CBT sessions and data analyses conducted in this study would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> possible without the assistance of Nicole Neil and Lisa Lam, who dedicated much time and energy into this pilot study. A big thanks goes out to the two families who participated in this study. Your efforts and determination to beat OCD taught me a lot and it was nothing short of a pleasure to work with you. I would also like to thank my. amazing mother and boyfriend, Darcy Weir, who have continually supported me while I pursued my M. A. degree. Words will never be able to express the gratitude I have for the two of you. Last, but certainly not least, I {{would like to}} thank my loyal study buddy, Chloe.

40|$|ABSTRACT. One can use {{a number}} of {{techniques}} (e. g., from videotaping to computer enhancement of the environment) to augment the feedback that a subject usually receives during training on a motor task. Although some forms of augmented <b>feedback</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shown to enhance performance on isolated isometric tasks during training, when the <b>feedback</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> removed subjects <b>have</b> sometimes not <b>been</b> able to perform {{as well in the}} "realworld" task as controls. Indeed, for realistic, nonisometric motor tasks, improved skill acquisition because of augmented <b>feedback</b> <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> demonstrated. In the present experiments, subjects (Experiment 1, N = 42; Experiment 2, N = 21) performed with a system that was designed for teaching a difficult multijoint movement in a table tennis environment. The system was a fairly realistic computer animation of the environment and included paddles for the teacher and subject, as well as a virtual ball. Each subjec...|$|R
