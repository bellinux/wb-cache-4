5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the <b>yield</b> <b>and</b> cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year.|$|E
5|$|Crossbreeding {{increases}} {{production efficiency}} because of hybrid vigour, and allows complementary traits of {{parents to be}} combined to produce progeny better suited to different environments or markets.

5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{refused to}} <b>yield,</b> <b>and</b> Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity.

This response came as a surprise to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented its demands and, upon seeing the British government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to improve {{understanding}} of the adaptive capacity of European agriculture to climate change. Extensive data on farm characteristics of individual farms from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) have been combined with climatic and socio-economic data to analyze the influence of climate and management on crop <b>yields</b> <b>and</b> income and to identify factors that determine adaptive capacity. A multilevel analysis was performed to account for regional differences in the studied relationships. Our results suggest that socio-economic conditions and farm characteristics should be considered when analyzing effects of climate conditions on farm <b>yields</b> <b>and</b> income. Next to climate, input intensity, economic size and the type of land use were identified as important factors influencing spatial variability in crop <b>yields</b> <b>and</b> income. Generally, crop <b>yields</b> <b>and</b> income are increasing with farm size and farm intensity. However, effects differed among crops <b>and</b> high crop <b>yields</b> were not always related to high incomes, suggesting that impacts of climate and management differ by impact variable. As farm characteristics influence climate impacts on crop <b>yields</b> <b>and</b> income, they are good indicators of adaptive capacity at farm level and should be considered in impact assessment models. Different farm types with different management strategies will adapt differently...|$|R

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{investigation of}} fertilization {{began at the}} Rothamsted Experimental Station in 1843 by John Bennet Lawes. He investigated the impact of inorganic and organic fertilizers on crop <b>yield</b> <b>and</b> founded {{one of the first}} artificial fertilizer manufacturing factories in 1842. Fertilizer, in the shape of sodium nitrate deposits in Chile, was imported to Britain by John Thomas North as well as guano (birds droppings). The first commercial process for fertilizer production was the obtaining of phosphate from the dissolution of coprolites in sulphuric acid.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of plant virus, but often they cause only a loss of <b>yield,</b> <b>and</b> it is not {{economically}} viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by organisms, known as vectors. These are normally insects, but some fungi, nematode worms, and single-celled organisms {{have been shown to}} be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical, for perennial fruits, for example, efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds. Plant viruses cannot infect humans and other animals because they can reproduce only in living plant cells.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Cultivars vary in their <b>yield</b> <b>and</b> the {{ultimate}} size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock.

The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection.

Cavity spot, caused by the oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.|$|E
5|$|This {{period of}} calm {{came to an}} end when the British consul in Rio de Janeiro nearly sparked a war between Great Britain and Brazil.

The Brazilian government refused to <b>yield,</b> <b>and</b> the consul issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil prepared itself for the imminent conflict, and coastal defenses were given permission to fire upon any British warship that tried to capture Brazilian merchant ships.

The Lackfis, {{the master of the}} {{treasury}} Nicholas Zámbó and the judge royal Nicholas Szécsi openly opposed it and renounced their allegiance to the queen dowager in August, which resulted in her depriving them of all their offices and replacing them with Garai's partisans. The kingdom {{was on the verge of}} a civil war when Charles decided to invade, encouraged by John Horvat and his brother Paul, Bishop of Zagreb.

5|$|Several {{designs for}} the exact method of {{destroying}} the target were suggested. One of these {{was to have the}} satellite carry out a kamikaze attack on the target, while another was to coat it with black paint, blocking its ability to see or transmit, rendering it inoperable. Yet another was for it to use a laser to disable reconnaissance or optical sensors of the target. Another suggestion was for the satellite to carry a nuclear missile, of up to one megaton <b>yield,</b> <b>and</b> launch it at the satellite. However, in July 1959, Joseph V. Charyk directed that all technical efforts were to be focused on developing the inspection function, rather than the kill function, effectively ending its role as a satellite interceptor, and shifting the project {{to the development of a}} satellite inspector.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{results were}} supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, {{as it was}} hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of <b>yield</b> <b>and</b> was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding rocks at depths of 300–600 meters. Drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.|$|E
