500|$|In early 2004, Usher {{broke up}} with Chilli due to [...] "irreconcilable {{differences}} and because they found {{it almost impossible to}} make compromises." [...] Usher said in an interview: [...] "It's unfortunate when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> a situation go because it's not working", which added reference to the breakup. It was later revealed that Chilli in fact {{broke up with}} Usher because of cheating, and the media said otherwise because of the lyrics in the song, which was not based on their relationship. Dupri, however, confessed that his personal life is the real story of the album. Usher said he took inspiration collectively by looking at his friends' personal situations.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} officially {{canceled}} by ABC on May 13, 2010. In {{an interview with}} New York Magazine, Victor Fresco, the show's creator, was asked why he thought the show didn't catch on. He responded, [...] "I think not enough people knew about it. It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of people watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is you spend a lot of money advertising and promoting, or <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it. And I don’t think we got either of that". Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there for it, because I know that the people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2004, Bloc Party convened at Deltalab Studios in Copenhagen to make Silent Alarm with Paul Epworth. The {{band had}} already written demo songs to record, but Okereke {{has noted that}} [...] "it is a {{creative}} process and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> yourself be inspired while you're in the studio as well". The Deltalab set-up posed problems, because it included bare mains cables and dated, malfunctioning equipment from the 1960s and 1970s. Bloc Party took three sessions to get acquainted with Epworth's methodology. The producer has called the recording time a [...] "growing process" [...] because Okereke was not wholly comfortable singing in front of people, especially after tonsil problems. Although the band members had preliminary ideas about a track's rhythm, {{they did not know}} how songs were going to start or end. Okereke often asked Tong to play something on the drums, which inspired him to mould a track by adding guitar chords to the beat.|$|E

60|$|Hank was not {{the sort}} of man who makes {{universal}} appeal. Also, he was no ladies' man. He was long and lean and hard-bitten, and his supply of conventional small talk was practically non-existent. To get the best out of Hank, as <b>has</b> been said, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him take his coat off and put his feet up {{on the back of a}} second chair and reconcile yourself to the pestiferous brand of tobacco which he affected.|$|R
500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} knew we were recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Paul I was {{a friend}} to the Muslim people and as Patriarch of Venice said to Catholics that {{faithful}} Muslims had the [...] "right to build a mosque" [...] to practice {{their faith in the}} archdiocese. In November 1964 he explained the declaration of Dignitatis humanae: [...] "There are 4,000 Muslims in Rome: {{they have the right to}} build a mosque. There is nothing to say: <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them do it".|$|E
2500|$|The director, Luc Jacquet, has {{condemned}} such {{comparisons between}} penguins and humans. Asked by the San Diego Union Tribune {{to comment on}} the documentary's use as [...] "a metaphor for family values – the devotion to a mate, devotion to offspring, monogamy, self-denial", Jaquet responded: [...] "I condemn this position. I find it intellectually dishonest to impose this viewpoint on something that's part of nature. It's amusing, but if you take the monogamy argument, from one season to the next, the divorce rate, if you will, is between 80 to 90 percent... the monogamy only lasts for the duration of one reproductive cycle. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> penguins be penguins and humans be humans." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 29, 2007, Márquez {{announced}} that he would defend his title in a rematch with Pacquiao. On March 15, 2008, Márquez lost his Super Featherweight title to Pacquiao via split decision. Márquez suffered a knockdown in the third round that proved to be the difference, as the remaining rounds were scored dead even. Compubox scoring had Márquez landing 42 of 201 (21%) jabs to Pacquiao's 43 of 314 (14%) and landing 130 of 310 (42%) power punches to Pacquiao's 114 of 305 (37%). Richard Schaefer, Golden Boy Promotions CEO, offered a $6 million guarantee to Pacquiao for a rematch. Pacquiao's promoter, Bob Arum, said, [...] "I'm not saying they'll never fight again, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it bake for a while." [...] Pacquiao said: [...] "I don't think so, this business is over" [...] as he planned to move up to the lightweight division.|$|E
2500|$|I was {{operated}} on that afternoon. As soon as I woke the surgeon, John Bartlett, {{was sitting on}} the end of my bed to tell me the bi-op was malignant... John found it hard to tell me and I found it hard to accept... I had to ring Mum and Dad in Deniliquin to tell them there was some bad news. Somehow you float through it even though you are scared s---less... The hardest part is the initial part, once you know what's in front of you it gets better. I don't want to trivialise cancer in any way. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... I never asked if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was amazing what I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the [...] "how in the hell did I get it?" [...] moments. No one knows, it could have been getting hit in a footy game or a cricket ball 10 years earlier.|$|E
2500|$|On November 3, 2006, Martínez {{stated that}} if he could not return to full strength, he might end up {{retiring}} after the 2007 season. [...] "It's getting better, and progress is above all what is hoped for", Martínez told the Associated Press. [...] "To go back, I have to recover, I have to be healthy. But if God doesn't want that, then I would have to think about giving it all up." [...] Martínez added, [...] "It's going to be a bitter winter because I am {{going to have to do}} a lot of work. The pain I feel was one of the worst I have felt with any injury in my career." [...] But by December 30, 2006, Martínez was more optimistic: [...] "The progress has been excellent. I don't have problems anymore with my reach or flexibility, and so far everything is going very well. The problem has to do with the calcification of the bone that was broken with the tear, and that had to be operated on. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it run its course." [...] Martínez also reported bulking up as part of his recuperative regimen: [...] "I've put on about 10 pounds of muscle, because that's one of our strategies." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{begins with}} Perry, {{sitting on the}} ground while mouthing the lyrics and staring at the camera. As she {{finishes}} the verse, the camera shifts to the ballroom, in which the dancers start to dance. The song's chorus kicks in, and she is now found in the ballroom, {{in the middle of all}} the dancers. As the second verse begins and she has an owl on her arm, which she lets go and flies. The bird represents [...] "something strong, free [...] powerful". Bonacorso added: [...] "She lets it go into the world and that literally letting this force within her go wild. That's an important part of love is that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it go." [...] The video also shows Perry, with a golden dress and cross-shaped earrings, with flames on her body. By the second repetition of the chorus, a bed gets lit on fire, which the director included to refer to love that [...] "can burn you like an inferno". As the song reaches its climax, Perry gets hit by a car, with tiny broken debris from it shattering behind her, while she remains stationary and unharmed. This scene symbolizes the experience of true love, that changes [...] "your world" [...] and [...] "hits you out of the blue". This scene cuts to the ballroom, where Perry is surrounded by a similar explosion of [...] "colorful" [...] flowers, which is used to contrast the more violent nature of falling in love and the softer part of it, the [...] "joyful and wonderful" [...] feelings.|$|E
