40|$|By “tax {{collection}} controversies,” I mean {{cases in}} which it has been established that the taxpayer owes additional taxes, those taxes remain unpaid, and the IRS is attempting to enforce collection out of the taxpayer’s assets. Such cases are numerous and involve attorneys in general legal practice as well as tax specialists. For example, the taxpayer may be <b>your</b> <b>client</b> for non-tax matters, and may expect you to handle her tax collection controversy as well. Or, <b>your</b> <b>client</b> may not be the taxpayer herself, but instead someone who co-owns property with the taxpayer. <b>Your</b> <b>client</b> expects you to make sure that his interest is not impermissibly infringed if the IRS tries to effect collection out of the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s interest in the jointly owned property. Or, the taxpayer owes money to <b>your</b> <b>client</b> {{as well as to the}} IRS, such that <b>your</b> <b>client</b> and the IRS are competing for assets that, typically, are insufficient to satisfy all the claims against or debts of the taxpayer. Or, <b>your</b> <b>client</b> may be a financial institution or other party holding assets of the taxpayer, and the IRS has served a notice of levy on <b>your</b> <b>client</b> to satisfy tax liabilities out of those assets. In short, attorneys in general practice as well as tax specialists often need to understand the rules governing tax collection by the IRS. The IRS can effect enforced collection only out of assets to which its tax lien attaches.

40|$|The {{basic idea}} of federal {{preemption}} is easily stated: It is a constitutionally mandated principle that demands that federal law trumps state law {{when the two}} conflict or in the rare instances when a federal law is so comprehensive that there’s no role left for state law to fill. But in practice, courts have often had difficulty applying the principle. For plaintiff lawyers, preemption is an ever-present worry. When <b>your</b> <b>client</b> has been injured by a defective car, truck, medical device, boat, tobacco product, pesticide, or mislabeled drug, or has been victimized by a bank or other lending institution, the defendant will probably assert that federal law preempts <b>your</b> <b>client’s</b> state law damages claim. You can expect this argument no matter how weak the federal regulatory scheme or how attenuated the connection between that scheme and the harms <b>your</b> <b>client</b> suffered or the state law duties under which <b>your</b> <b>client</b> seeks a remedy. But defendants’ and tort “reformers’” pro-preemption arguments do not reflect current preemption doctrine as established by the courts. A common—and false—argument for preemption, for example, is that state tort law necessarily interferes with federal regulatory objectives. Moreover, preemption of state tort law is a bad idea. Immunizing the makers of products that cause injury simply because, for instance, these products have been approved for marketing by a federal agency harms both the injured people and society generally...|$|R

I am not to examine into the charges that are daily made on the administration of Ireland. I am not qualified to say how much in them is cold truth, and how much rhetorical exaggeration. Allowing some foundation to the complaint, it is to no purpose that these people allege that their government is a job in its administration. I am sure it is a job in its constitution; nor is it possible a scheme of polity, which, in total exclusion of the body of the community, confines (with little or no regard to their rank or condition in life) to a certain set of favored citizens the rights which formerly belonged to the whole, should not, by the operation of the same selfish and narrow principles, teach the persons who administer in that government to prefer their own particular, but well-understood, private interest to the false and ill-calculated private interest of the monopolizing company they belong to. Eminent characters, to be sure, overrule places and circumstances. I have nothing to say to that virtue which shoots up in full force by the native vigor of the seminal principle, in spite of the adverse soil and climate that it grows in. But speaking of things in their ordinary course, in a country of monopoly there can be no patriotism. There may be a party spirit, but public spirit there can be none. As to a spirit of liberty, still less can it exist, or anything like it. A liberty made up of penalties! a liberty made up of incapacities! a liberty made up of exclusion and proscription, continued for ages, of four fifths, perhaps, of the inhabitants of all ranks and fortunes In what does such liberty differ from the description of the most shocking kind of servitude? ...|$|E
