500|$|Initially, Garland was {{enrolled}} at Delaware Valley Charter School, which was located {{only half a}} mile from his future college, La Salle University. However, his cousin Donnel Feaster, an alumnus of John Bartram High School, recommended that Garland attend his alma mater. The team's head coach, James Brown, said, [...] "I'm always telling my ex-players, 'If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> good ones, send them my way'...Not that they listen. Don did, though. That's how I got Ty".|$|E
6000|$|... `Yes, yes. But WAS he like her, Miss Sinnet? That {{was really}} very, very extraordinary. Did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> {{likeness}} in his face?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye. If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> runaway niggers you {{get help}} and nab them, {{and you can}} make some money by it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I must ask. Tell me, child, what things? Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> one? Had letters, or been annoyed {{in any way}} about--anything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, I reckon {{a preacher}} ain't agoin' to lie. Hev <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> Injun Christians round here?" [...] asked Girty, waving a heavy sledge-hammer.|$|R

6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] ejaculated her father, as if {{convinced}} of the uselessness of trying to understand a woman. [...] "Say, did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> strange horse tracks?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One more {{question}} and I have done," [...] said the captain. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> particular objection to practicing a pious fraud on Mrs. Lecount?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Sam, 'you've been a-prophecyin' avay about wot'll {{happen to}} the gov'ner if he's left alone. Don't <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> way o' takin' care on him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Bill. Be careful how you answer, for {{a mistake}} may cost you your place. Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> one pass down the lane?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{know where}} Striped Chipmunk lives, and I don't care; it's {{none of my}} business," [...] replied Jimmy Skunk. [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> beetles this morning?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{know what}} rifles are like," [...] I said indignantly. [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> in our hands? Moreover, I {{give you my}} word that we have none." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely.--Take care of it, Jessie," [...] said Stanley, {{throwing}} {{it to his}} wife; [...] "it may be explained some day.--Well, Massan, did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> other animals?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, Sammy Jay, have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> {{one pass}} this way?" [...] asked Happy Jack. [...] "Some one has stolen a store of nuts from the hollow {{in the old}} {{chestnut}} tree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} {{looks as}} if somebody had set this fire," [...] mused Senator Morr. [...] "Perhaps a tramp. Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> such fellows around here?" [...] he asked, looking at the others.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{remains to}} be found out," [...] {{answered}} Ben. [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> of them {{during the last two}} hours? I and one of my men became separated from them in the cane-brakes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well?" [...] said Wyndham. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> object for our {{returning}} the stuff? For that matter, I don't know {{to whom it}} ought to be returned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> reason," [...] {{continued}} Mr. George, [...] "why {{they should}} place the Tower {{at the lower}} end, {{rather than at the}} upper end, of the city?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, don't {{you know}} Oliver?" [...] said Jonas. [...] "He is the farmer's son. He came with me, and I left him {{here to the}} care of the sleigh. Haven't <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> thing of him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You sail so nigh the wind, friend Joram," [...] coolly {{interrupted}} the old man, [...] "as to keep every thing shaking. Just bethink you of a plain answer: Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> thing {{wrong about the}} slaver?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> {{resemblance}} {{between her and}} this Mildred Dutton? It is in the expression {{rather than in the}} features--but, it is the expression which alone denotes the character." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{do you do}} when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> literal {{mistakes}} in my letters? how do you set them right? for I never read them over to correct them. Farewell, again.|$|E

6000|$|... "Corn, nice ripe yellow corn, {{and seeds}} and acorns and chestnuts," [...] {{answered}} Striped Chipmunk. [...] "And now I'm {{looking for some}} big, fat hickory nuts," [...] he added, and his bright eyes twinkled. [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any,</b> Happy Jack?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> papers lately?" [...] Carroll inquired. [...] "I've been up in {{the bush}} and I'm {{interested}} in the Clermont mine. It looked as if {{there might be some}} changes in the company's prospects when I went away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here {{is where}} we shall find the first signs, {{if there is any}} oil around here. Follow me, and sing out when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> greasy-looking water in these little pools." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> house, or {{any place}} where we can pass the night," [...] she said, [...] "you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{decided on}} the title long ago. I call it AVERIL'S ATONEMENT. Doesn't that sound nice and alliterative? Now, Diana, tell me candidly, do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> faults in my story?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{soon as the}} {{magistrate}} had concluded his talk with Mr. Henderson, and the latter had gone off {{to carry out the}} arrangements, Colonel Chambers turned to the captain and said, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> of the London papers, Downes?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "They are {{the best}} I've ever had; but do you know, Paddy, I suspect {{that they may be}} one of the reasons I am hunted so," [...] replied Lightfoot a little sadly.
