5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E

25|$|After being {{introduced}} by a college friend in 1965 to {{the producers of}} Take 30 an afternoon variety show run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Clarkson {{was hired by the}} Crown corporation as a freelance book reviewer. This marked the start of her nearly 30-year career with the CBC, as, after less than a year in her initial position, Clarkson was promoted to co-host, thus becoming one of the first members of a visible minority to obtain a prominent position on Canadian television. She remained with Take Thirty for a decade, while also branching into print journalism by becoming a regular contributor to such publications as Maclean's and Chatelaine. Similarly, Clarkson wrote and published her own romantic fiction novels: A Lover More Condoling in 1968, and Hunger Trace in 1970. Beyond these, her non-fiction book True to <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Fashion: A Woman Talks to Men About Marriage a collection of interviews with men on the subject of divorce was published in 1971, during which time her first marriage had hit a hard patch.|$|E

500|$|The {{next day}} Presley {{recorded}} [...] "I'm Moving On" [...] and [...] "Gentle on My Mind", leaving the studio {{while working on}} the latter to rest his throat. The following night, he did not appear, as his cold worsened, and on January 15 and 16 the house band recorded backing tracks for subsequent sessions. Presley returned on January 20, recording [...] "In the Ghetto" [...] in 23 takes and finishing the vocal track for [...] "Gentle on My Mind". On January 22, he recorded Eddy Arnold's [...] "I'll Hold <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart (Till I Can Hold <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Arms)" [...] and the non-album single [...] "Suspicious Minds". Presley then took a break from recording for a vacation trip to Aspen, Colorado to celebrate his daughter Lisa Marie's first birthday.|$|E
500|$|The twelve {{tracks on}} the album were {{selected}} from thirty-one which were recorded in the American Sound sessions. The first song, [...] "Wearin' That Loved On Look" [...] features an electric-bass lead {{for the first time}} in a Presley recording. The second is [...] "Only the Strong Survive", with Presley backed by bass and drums. He plays piano on the third track, the country song [...] "I Hold <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart ('Till I Can Hold <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Arms)". Presley's voice is roughened by a cold on the fourth song, the country-rhythm-and-blues [...] "Long Black Limousine" [...] featuring a trumpet solo. The fifth song, Johnny Tillotson's traditional country-western [...] "It Keeps Right on A-Hurtin'", was arranged to sound more like Memphis soul. Side one ends with a version of Hank Snow's country-western [...] "I'm Moving On" [...] with a strong bass line and driving rhythm.|$|E
500|$|The {{equality}} {{of their marriage}} was dramatically underscored {{towards the end of}} 2004, when Den, as a sign of faith and in an effort to win back her sympathies, revealed to Chrissie his plans to reclaim The Queen Victoria public house by scamming the rival Mitchell family: [...] "If you ever needed proof that we're in this together or how badly I need <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, this is it. I wasn't going to show this to another soul, but I'm showing you because you're my wife; because it's me and you together." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics address {{aspects of}} a bad relationship, but also {{reference}} fashion in the line, [...] "Walk, walk fashion baby, Work it move that bitch crazy." [...] In an interview, Gaga pointed {{out that in the}} verse, [...] "I want your psycho, your vertigo shtick, Want <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Rear Window, Baby, you're sick", she was listing Alfred Hitchcock films; she said, [...] "What I'm really trying to say is I want the deepest, darkest, sickest parts of you that you are afraid to share with anyone because I love you that much." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own way, and feel that if I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Rapper Kid Cudi, who {{had signed}} onto West's G.O.O.D. Music label, contributed {{to two of}} the album's songs. Young Jeezy contributed a rap verse on the track [...] "Amazing" [...] while [...] "See <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Nightmares" [...] is a duet with Lil Wayne. Singer-songwriter Esthero {{provided}} the few female vocals found on the album; credited under birth name Jenny-Bea Englishman, she co-wrote three tracks. When [...] "RoboCop" [...] appeared on the Internet, West disclaimed responsibility and was upset that the leak had occurred as the track was an unfinished version. Mike Dean had previously stated that the track was expected to receive additional treatment by Herbie Hancock before the album's release.|$|E

500|$|Presley's {{singing to}} his own [...] "necessarily limited, both rhythmically and melodically," [...] piano accompaniment, such as can be heard on the 1967 {{recording}} of [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone", for Guralnick are always special occasions, because [...] "it was always a measure of his engagement {{when he sat down}} at the keyboard to play." [...] Describing his piano technique as [...] "staccato style," [...] Jorgensen finds that on [...] "Without Love" [...] from the 1969 sessions, [...] "his gospel-flavored treatment took it to a level of spirituality rarely matched in his career." [...] Presley also played the instrument on the [...] "impassioned version" [...] of the sessions' next song, [...] "I'll Hold <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart," [...] of which Guralnick writes that [...] "there is something magical about the moment that only the most inspired singing can bring about, as Elvis loses himself in the music, words no longer lend themselves to literal translation, and singer and listener both are left emotionally wrung out by the time the song finally limps to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Light Up" [...] {{features}} loud synth {{drums and}} plaintive piano strings. The Jay-Z-collaboration is a critique on the hip hop industry, its detrimental effects, and {{the trappings of}} being an artist: [...] "While all my closest friends out partyin'/ I'm just here makin' the music that they party to," [...] while Jay-Z gives advice: [...] "Drake, here's how they gonna come at you / with silly rap feuds, trying to distract you." [...] Jay-Z expands on the album's overarching theme of self-doubt: [...] "And since no good deed go unpunished / I'm not as cool with niggaz as I once was / I once was cool as the Fonz was / But these bright lights turned me to a monster." [...] "Miss Me" [...] has Lil Wayne rapping jokes, including a crude punch line about sucking [...] "the brown" [...] off his penis and subsequently groaning, [...] "Ewwww, that's nasty." [...] "Cece's Interlude" [...] has a Prince-like LinnDrum and transparent lyrics addressing a girl: [...] "I wish I / Wasn't famous / I wish I / Was still in school / So that I could have <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> dorm room / I would put it on you crazy." [...] The pop song [...] "Find Your Love" [...] was produced by Kanye West and bears similarity to his 2008 song [...] "Heartless".|$|E
500|$|Edward VI died on 6 July 1553. The {{next morning}} Northumberland sent his son Robert into Hertfordshire with 300 men {{to secure the}} person of Mary Tudor. Aware of her half-brother's condition, the Princess had only days before moved to East Anglia, where she was the {{greatest}} landowner. She began to assemble an armed following and {{sent a letter to}} the Council, demanding to be recognised as queen. It arrived on 10 July, the day Jane Grey was proclaimed as queen. The Duke of Northumberland's oration, held before Jane the previous day, did not move her to accept the Crown—her parents' assistance was required for that. Dudley had not prepared for resolute action on Mary's part and needed a week to build up a larger force. He was in a dilemma over who should lead the troops. He was the most experienced general in the kingdom, but he did not want to leave the government in the hands of his colleagues, in some of whom he had little confidence. Queen Jane decided the issue by demanding that her father, the Duke of Suffolk, should remain with her and the Council. On 14 July Northumberland headed for Cambridge with 1,500 troops and some artillery, having reminded his colleagues of the gravity of the cause, [...] "what chance of variance soever might grow amongst <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> absence".|$|E
