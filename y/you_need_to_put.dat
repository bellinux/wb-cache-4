To find the cause of an effect, we have ascertained that the causal question, which you implicitly ask before your examination of the cause, has a great impact on which direction and shape the causal field will have, and therefor which cause you end up with. The causal fields are furthermore the reason that you can have multiple causes to the same effect, why Bauman and Goldhagen can´t agree on a definitive cause of the Holocaust.
