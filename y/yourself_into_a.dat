500|$|There are {{multiple}} features {{omitted from the}} game that the team considered typical of most video games, such as boss fights. A traditional cover system was excluded for the game as the team wanted players to constantly move around. The team also attempted to cause players to {{feel as though they}} are lacking, particularly in the supplies that they collect. [...] "You're not building <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tank," [...] said Straley. This also motivated many of the design decisions of the gameplay, such as the weightlessness of the animations, and the melee combat mechanic. To further add to the realism, the team developed the game's combat mechanic in a way that forces players to spend more time planning. They also wanted players to be forced to retreat from combat after alerting the Infected, despite their belief that retreating is the [...] "anti-video game play mechanic". The combat mechanic was developed to feel intense, intentionally moving the camera closer to players, {{in order for them to}} [...] "feel every strike". The team felt that the game forces players to make difficult choices, in terms of combat, stealth and resource management, allowing them to understand the decisions made by the characters.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with IGN in June 2013, [...] Blomkamp said, [...] "I {{really want to make}} a District 9 sequel. I genuinely do. The problem is I have a bunch of ideas and stuff that I want to make. I'm relatively new to this â€“ I'm about to make my third film, and now the pattern that I'm starting to realise is very true is that you lock <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> film beyond the film you're currently working on. But it just doesn't work for me." [...] Referring to a potential sequel, Blomkamp said [...] " [...] want to make District 10 at some point".|$|E
2500|$|Want to {{know how}} to {{discipline}} your school buddy, your math teacher, your cat, and the housefly? How to educate your family members--your little brother, your uncle, your grandma? How to turn your Dachshund into a pit bull and <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> top-of-the-class student? No problem! Just read the 50+ humorous guidance and playful instructions in this book that will tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. As the author suggests, [...] "When I was a kid, everybody believed that disciplining a child will create miracles. And sometimes it does. This book is about the fact that everything and everyone can be disciplined. (Except, of course, ourselves, because our personality is as sturdy as the icebergs at the North Pole. When I wrote the first instructions on how to discipline our family members, I suddenly realized: I can discipline anyone from a UFO to the police and the ghost in the attic. And I did, with no mercy!" ...|$|E
50|$|Mark Strauss, Davenport, Iowa. This {{question}} is for Ron Paul. Mr. Paul, I think {{we both know that}} the Republican party is never {{going to give you the}} nomination. But I'm hoping that you're crazy like a fox like that and you're using this exposure to propel <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> independent run. My {{question is}} for Ron Paul: Mr. Paul, are you going to let America down by not running as an independent? Thank you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense!' cried Catherine in a passion. 'Foolish, silly boy! And there! he trembles: as if I {{were really}} going to touch him! You needn't bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your service. Get off! I shall return home: it is folly {{dragging}} you from the hearth-stone, and pretending--what do we pretend? Let go my frock! If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should spurn such pity. Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is. Rise, and don't degrade <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> abject reptile--don't!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Calthea," [...] said Mrs. Petter, [...] "don't work <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> such <b>a</b> terrible stew. You know Stephen doesn't {{like to have}} Lanigan pitched into; I'm {{sorry for}} even what I said. But that about his grave was enough to rouse a saint." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'My dear Maria,' {{said her}} mother, soothingly, 'you have worked <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> such <b>a</b> state, that you don't {{know what you}} are saying.

6000|$|... "You {{are really}} too outspoken, Miss Covington, {{and you will}} get <b>{{yourself}}</b> <b>into</b> trouble. <b>As</b> it is, you have clearly laid yourself open to an action for libel for having practically called the man a murderer. We may think what we like, but we are {{in no position to}} prove it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Ah, Mr. Murgatroyd! what's {{all this}} about {{striking}} with double force?' said {{the object of}} the above remark, as he entered. 'I never excuse <b>a</b> man's getting <b>into</b> <b>a</b> rage during winter, even when he's seated so close to the fire as you are. It is very injudicious to put <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> such <b>a</b> perspiration. What is the cause of this extreme physical and mental excitement, sir?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't say I blame you, Wingfield; but I tell you, {{you might}} have got <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> awful mess if the Jacksons had chosen to take it up. You know how hot the feeling is at present, {{and it is a}} serious matter at any time to {{interfere}} between a master and his slaves in the Southern States. Of course among us our feelings would be all against Jackson; but among the poorer class of whites, who have been tremendously excited by the speeches, both in the North and here, the cry of Abolitionist at the present moment is like a red rag to a bull. However, I understand now the fellow's enmity to you.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} {{any of those}} things. Come, dear, let's just talk it over sensibly, as we might talk over any other of the great crises of life. You've been {{brooding}} over it and let <b>yourself</b> drift <b>into</b> <b>a</b> morbid view of it. You {{know you have a}} little tendency to do that about everything that goes wrong, and you promised me that you would fight against it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Ethel, you {{are working}} <b>yourself</b> up <b>into</b> <b>a</b> state of foolish prejudice. You and papa have taken a dislike to him; and you are {{overlooking}} {{a great deal of}} good safe sense and right thinking. I know his opinions are sound, and his motives right.

50|$|Kotyonochkin disliked subtext {{and tried}} to create very simple, {{straightforward}} scenarios. The main idea of the series was simple; don't hurt the little guy or you will <b>yourself</b> get <b>into</b> <b>a</b> foolish situation. Because the series was so popular, however, it was often a subject for critical discussion and speculation - namely, that the series represented the struggle between the intelligentsia (Hare) and the working class (Wolf). Aleksey Kotyonochkin dismisses these interpretations as groundless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, is it? You'll see. Mr. Camperdown says so. All {{the world}} will say so. If you don't take care, you'll find <b>yourself</b> brought <b>into</b> <b>a</b> court of law, my dear, and a jury will say so. That's what it will come to. What good will they do you? You can't sell them;--and as a widow you can't wear 'em. If you marry again, you wouldn't disgrace your husband by going about showing off the Eustace diamonds! But you don't know {{anything}} about 'proper feelings.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{seem to be}} in a bad case, old Ben," [...] said Bonnet, {{gazing down}} upon him, [...] "but you throw <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> needless trouble. <b>As</b> soon as I lay hold of some craft which I am willing shall go away with a sound hull, I will put you on board of her and let {{you go back to the}} farm.

60|$|Thus {{have they}} a salve for every sore, cheat {{you to your}} face, and insult you into the bargain; nor can you help {{yourself}} without exposing yourself, or putting <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> passion.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{first thing}} {{requisite}} {{is to get}} <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> such <b>a</b> scrape as no one ever got into before. The oven, for instance,--that was a good hit. But {{if you have no}} oven or big bell, at hand, and if you cannot conveniently tumble out of a balloon, or be swallowed up in an earthquake, or get stuck fast in a chimney, you will have to be contented with simply imagining some similar misadventure. I should prefer, however, that you have the actual fact to bear you out. Nothing so well assists the fancy, as an experimental knowledge of the matter in hand. 'Truth is strange,' you know, 'stranger than fiction'--besides being more to the purpose." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Cola" [...] {{was written}} by Elizabeth Grant and Rick Nowels, with Grant writing lyrics for the song. When Del Rey {{was asked about the}} origin of the lyrics, she explained: [...] "My boyfriend O'Neill is Scottish, he deems American girls very exotic. He once told me: [...] "You American girls walk around as if your pussies tasted like Pepsi-Cola, as if you'd wrap <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> American flag to sleep." [...] He deems us all very patriotic." [...] It was {{produced}} by Nowels, with co-production handled by the production group DK. The arrangement consists of drum machines programmed by Kieron Menzies, who was also recording engineer, real drums performed by Devrim Karaoglu and Nowels, keyboards, Juno bass and acoustic guitar also played by Nowels, slide guitar performed by Tim Pierce, and strings, glockenspiel, brass, organ, electric guitar, piano and synthesizers played by Patrick Warren. The song was recorded at The Green Building in Santa Monica, with Chris Garcia and Jordan Stilwell doing additional recording. John Davis finally mastering the track at Metropolis Mastering in London. The song was at one stage referred to under the title of [...] "Pussy" [...] according to registrations at the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and Harry Fox Agency.|$|R

"I didn't {{intend to}} mention it--you'll {{keep it to}} <b>yourself.</b> I'd got <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bit of a mess shortly before I was hurt at the ravine, and Harding paid up the money-lender I'd gone to in Winnipeg. What's more, he beat the fellow down, so that I only had to account for what I {{actually}} got." ...|$|R
