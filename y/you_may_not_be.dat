[...] He found that watching Age 13 with Graveyard Mountain Home as the soundtrack enhanced the film: [...] "Age 13 is not necessarily an enjoyable film to watch... but viewing it with the Chroma Key soundtrack makes an odd experience even odder yet wholly compelling, with a mysterious filmstrip allure that freezes a bygone era." [...] Conversely, Jablonski considered Age 13 as an enhancement to the music. [...] "Listening to the album stand alone for the first time <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> much impressed," [...] she said. [...] "The music is solemn and somewhat confusing as the tracks run from one to another without much build and in seemingly senseless patterns... Having previously seen or simultaneously watching Age 13 most definitely would help the listener along." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1988, Cosmopolitan {{magazine}} {{published an}} article by Robert E. Gould, a psychiatrist, entitled [...] "Reassuring News About AIDS: A Doctor Tells Why <b>You</b> <b>May</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Be</b> At Risk." [...] The main contention of the article was that in unprotected vaginal sex {{between a man and}} a woman who both had [...] "healthy genitals" [...] the risk of HIV transmission was negligible, even if the male partner was infected. Women from ACT UP who had been having informal [...] "dyke dinners" [...] met with Dr. Gould in person, questioning him about several misleading facts (that penis to vagina transmission is impossible, for example) and questionable journalistic methods (no peer review, bibliographic information, failing to disclose that he was a psychiatrist and not a practitioner of internal medicine), and demanded a retraction and apology. When he refused, in the words of Maria Maggenti, they decided that they [...] "had to shut down Cosmo." [...] According to those who were involved in organizing the action, it was significant in that it was the first time the women in ACT UP organized separately from the main body of the group. Additionally, filming the action itself, the preparation and the aftermath were all consciously planned and resulted in a video short directed by Jean Carlomusto and Maria Maggenti, titled, [...] "Doctor, Liars, and Women: AIDS Activists Say No To Cosmo." [...] The action consisted of approximately 150 activists protesting in front of the Hearst building (parent company of Cosmopolitan) chanting [...] "Say no to Cosmo!" [...] and holding signs with slogans such as [...] "Yes, the Cosmo Girl CAN get AIDS!" [...] Although the action did not result in any arrests, it brought significant television media attention to the controversy surrounding the article. Phil Donahue, Nightline, and a local talk show called [...] "People Are Talking" [...] all hosted discussions of the article. On the latter, two women, Chris Norwood and Denise Ribble took the stage after the host, Richard Bey, cut Norwood off during an exchange about whether heterosexual women are at risk from AIDS. Footage from all of these media appearances was edited into [...] "Doctors, Liars, and Women." [...] Cosmopolitan eventually issued a partial retraction of the contents of the article.|$|E
