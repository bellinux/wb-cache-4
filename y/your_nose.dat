500|$|Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} 3 out of 4; he said: [...] "Woodley...balances grace with gravity, wit with heart." [...] A. O. Scott writing for The New York Times said: [...] "The film sets out to make you weepnot just sniffle or choke up a little, but sob until <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> runs and your face turns blotchy. It succeeds." [...] The Boston Globe's Ty Burr gave the film a rating of 2.5 out 4 and said: [...] "If Elgort's Gus is glibly charming and {{ultimately}} affecting, The Fault in Our Stars belongs to Woodley, a performer who {{always seems to be}} backing warily into her own movies." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Moth" [...] {{aired on}} November 3, 2004. The episode was {{directed}} by Jack Bender and written by Jennifer Johnson and Paul Dini. The church scene with Charlie and Liam at the church in Manchester was actually filmed on Honolulu, where the scenes on the Island are filmed. Monaghan says that he feels Charlie's black hoodie {{is a sort of}} [...] "security blanket" [...] that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels [...] "lost." [...] The [...] "heroin" [...] that Charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar. Monaghan revealed this in an interview with Stuff magazine in October 2005, saying, [...] " [...] brown sugar. You get some really sweet boogers. You have {{to be careful not to}} snort too much of it, but it's happened a few times. You just find dessert up <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> couple of hours later." ...|$|E

500|$|Salinger was {{assigned}} to a counter-intelligence division, for which he used his proficiency in French and German to interrogate prisoners of war. In April 1945 he entered a liberated concentration camp, probably one of Dachau's sub-camps. Salinger earned the rank of Staff Sergeant and served in five campaigns. Salinger's experiences in the war affected him emotionally. He was hospitalized {{for a few weeks}} for combat stress reaction after Germany was defeated, and he later told his daughter: [...] "You never really get the smell of burning flesh out of <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> entirely, no matter how long you live." [...] Both of his biographers speculate that Salinger drew upon his wartime experiences in several stories, such as [...] "For Esmé—with Love and Squalor", which is narrated by a traumatized soldier. Salinger continued to write while serving in the army, publishing several stories in slick magazines such as Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post. He also continued to submit stories to The New Yorker, but with little success; it rejected all of his submissions from 1944 to 1946, a group of 15poems in 1945 alone.|$|E
500|$|The Sword of Shannara {{has drawn}} {{extensive}} criticism from critics {{who believe that}} Brooks derived too much of his novel from Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. In 1978, American fantasy editor Lin Carter denounced The Sword of Shannara as [...] "the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read". Elaborating on his disapproval of the book, Carter wrote that [...] "Terry Brooks wasn't trying to imitate Tolkien's prose, just steal his story line and complete cast of characters, and [...] did it with such clumsiness and so heavy-handedly, that he virtually rubbed <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> in it." [...] Roger C. Schlobin was kinder in his assessment, though he still thought that The Sword of Shannara was a disappointment because of its similarities to The Lord of the Rings. Brian Attebery accused The Sword of Shannara of being [...] "undigested Tolkien" [...] which was [...] "especially blatant in its point-for-point correspondence" [...] with The Lord of the Rings. In an educational article on writing, author Orson Scott Card cited The Sword of Shannara as a cautionary example of overly derivative writing, finding the work [...] "artistically displeasing" [...] for this reason.|$|E
500|$|Producer Oren Koules told horror news website ShockTilYouDrop.com {{that there}} are eleven traps in the film, the most ever in the franchise. [...] There is one [...] "trap" [...] scene in the film that {{producers}} would not allow in previous Saw films that they described as [...] "too violent", [...] "too disgusting", and [...] "just wrong". [...] Melton later confirmed that was the [...] "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a [...] "chain reaction" [...] with other characters. Gabby West {{was part of the}} trap. She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> so you can breathe. It was so scary! They put so much of it on, you can't see and they put it in your ears so you can barely hear anything. That was part of the prep for the film, which was really cool, to have a dummy made of yourself. But scary." [...] Over 25 gallons of fake blood was used in the film, which was two and half times more than Saw II.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{struggled}} with Yorke's change of direction.

[...] His brother Colin feared [...] "some awful art-rock nonsense just {{for its own sake}} so that it looks like you're cutting <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> off to spite your face." [...] According to Yorke, Godrich [...] "didn't understand why, if we had such a strength in one thing, we would want to do something else.

2500|$|Nick Bryan of Dork Adore {{found that}} the tension was built well enough, but found himself [...] "wishing for more scale and heart-stopping drama in the finale." [...] Furthermore, Bryan {{believed}} that the series nine finale {{would have made a}} more fitting end to the series. Christopher Hootan stated [...] "it was with great trepidation that I sat down to watch the show's finale, which promised to put you so far on the edge of your seat as to find <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> touching the TV screen. And it did not disappoint." [...] Hootan added [...] "as ever this was suitably peril-ridden with plenty of last minute airstrikes and time-sensitive interrogations, but the real tension lay with the fate of everyone's favourite po-faced head of operations, Harry Pearce." [...] With the Harry and Ruth storyline, the reviewer noted that the non-happy ending [...] "will annoy some," [...] but found Ruth's death [...] "a captivating bit of TV as Harry was left with the deaths of two past loves on his conscience." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the film, {{the camera}} moves slowly towards a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, {{revealed}} to include Jack Torrance seen at the middle of a 1921 party. In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick overtly declared that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel. Still, this has not stopped interpreters from developing alternative readings, such as that Jack has been [...] "absorbed" [...] into the Overlook Hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wroteAs the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it? After all, it's right {{at the center of the}} central picture on the wall, and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn-out winter of mind-numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place. Is it just that, like Poe's purloined letter, the thing in plain sight is the last thing you see? When you do see it, the effect is so unsettling because you realise the unthinkable was there under <b>your</b> <b>nose</b> – overlooked – the whole time.|$|E

2500|$|The mournful Soliquisto, a once {{great music}} hall artiste, {{believes}} {{he has come to}} the end of his career.

[...] His act has always consisted of trained animals: a singing parakeet (Parakeet to Meet You), and two all-dancing, all-singing catsone male, Stinkfoot, and one female, Persian Moll. [...] Each of these were creations of true brilliance, but all he has left now is Moll, his ventriloquist's dummy Screwy, and his eager nephew and assistant Buster. [...] He and his company ("Soliquisto & His Not So Dumb Friends") have returned for a week’s engagement at the very end-of-the-pier venue where nine years before he had mysteriously lost his famous songbird and his most precious creation, the even more famous Stinkfoot. [...] Buster works with him, acting in all capacities: props, costumes, manager, and even as a ludicrous stand-in for the lost Stinkfoot. [...] Buster is ambitious, and knows his uncle was once the best. [...] He is convinced there’s a secret to being a true artist and if only Solisquisto would tell him that secret, Buster too could be a great artist.
