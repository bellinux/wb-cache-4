He interpreted it as a “revealed sign” to build his hermitage here. The hermitage mostly consists of caves with fascia {{at the entrance to the}} caves.

5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ <b>Yes,</b> <b>I</b> can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E

These will always rank with the coolest things I’ve ever been fortunate enough to do in my entire life.|$|E
25|$|Fields met {{the comedian}} and {{impresario}} Archie Pitt {{and they began}} working together. Pitt gave Fields champagne on her 18th birthday, and wrote in an autograph book {{to her that he}} would make her a star. Pitt began to manage her career and they began a relationship; they married in 1923 at Clapham Register Office. Their first revue was called <b>Yes</b> <b>I</b> Think So in 1915 and the two continued to tour Britain together until 1924. That year they appeared in the revue Mr Tower of London, with other shows By Request, It's A Bargain and The Show's The Thing, during the following years.|$|E

25|$|<b>Yes,</b> <b>I</b> suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and {{people need to be}} ready for it. What you make for others is first of all what you make for yourself. If I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure of what we call civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E
25|$|The curious {{personal}} {{character of}} La Fontaine, {{like that of}} some other men of letters, has been enshrined {{in a kind of}} legend by literary tradition. At an early age his absence of mind and indifference to business gave a subject to Gédéon Tallemant des Réaux. His later contemporaries helped to swell the tale, and the 18th century finally accepted it, including the anecdotes of his meeting his son, being told who he was, and remarking, Ah, <b>yes,</b> <b>I</b> thought I had seen him somewhere!, of his insisting on fighting a duel with a supposed admirer of his wife, and then imploring him to visit at his house just as before; of his going into company with his stockings wrong side out, , with, for a contrast, those of his awkwardness and silence, if not positive rudeness in company.|$|E

500|$|The album's next {{track is}} {{a version of}} the Chris Montez song [...] "Let's Dance". The song {{features}} Leon playing Radio City's large Wurlitzer pipe organ. The 13th track on the record, [...] "I Don't Want to Walk Around with You", consists of two lyric lines and three major chords. It is one of the group's earliest compositions. [...] It is the first song on their first demo tape, written at the beginning of 1974. [...] "I Don't Wanna Walk Around with You" [...] fades into the album's final track, [...] "Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World", a song that refers to a Hitler Youth member. Seymour Stein complained about the song's original lyrics—"I'm a Nazi, baby, I'm a Nazi, <b>yes</b> <b>I</b> am. I'm a Nazi Schatze, y'know I fight for the Fatherland"—insisting that the track was offensive. When Stein threatened to completely remove the track from the album the band put together alternate lyrics: [...] "I'm a shock trooper in a stupor, <b>yes</b> <b>I</b> am. I'm a Nazi Schatze, y'know I fight for the Fatherland." [...] Stein accepted the revision and it was published in the album.|$|E
