25|$|Thomson {{has said}} that his {{painting}} {{was the idea that}} Stella Vine used for her painting of Princess Diana, Hi Paul Can <b>You</b> <b>Come</b> <b>Over,</b> that launched her to fame when it was bought by Charles Saatchi in 2004. Three years before, she {{had been a member of}} the Stuckist group and also briefly married to Thomson, who said that she was aware of the media appeal of the idea, as he had shown her press cuttings of the painting.|$|E
2500|$|At 3:40 a.m., a {{text was}} sent from Hedgepeth's phone {{to that of}} Brandon Edwards, a former boyfriend of hers, saying [...] "Hey b. Can <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> here please. Rosario needs you more aha. You know. Please let her know you care." [...] Three minutes later, another text was sent from Hedgepeth's phone to Edwards' with the single word [...] "than", {{believed}} to be a correction for the [...] "aha" [...] in the previous text. That was the last evidence of activity from her phone; at 4:16 Edwards sent a return text asking who the previous text was from.|$|E
2500|$|At {{one point}} Vine was [...] "on {{the verge of}} giving up because I wasn't making any money." [...] She had not paid any {{business}} rates on the gallery for a year, and was expecting the arrival of bailiffs. The proceeds of Charles Saatchi's 2004 purchase of Vine's painting Hi Paul Can <b>You</b> <b>Come</b> <b>Over</b> went to the council bailiff. Islington London Borough Council gave Rosy Wilde an additional month's grace to pay the outstanding debts after they {{had heard of the}} Saatchi's purchase. Vine was [...] "bombarded" [...] with phone calls from galleries wanting to show her work and from art collectors seeking {{to cash in on the}} [...] "Saatchi effect"; within a week she had sold six paintings. Saatchi also bought more work from her. Vine said, [...] "I can paint and pay the bills. I don’t need any more than that." ...|$|E
6000|$|When <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> {{the top of}} {{the world}} [...] In the great day on the Downs, [...] The air was crisp and the clouds were curled, [...] When <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> {{the top of the}} world, [...] And under your feet were spire and street [...] And seven English towns.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're no fool! You {{feel that}} you {{undertook}} {{to look after the}} shareholders' interests when <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over,</b> and <b>you</b> have to make good?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chap who {{was going}} to cut it for me got shot yesterday," [...] he grumbled. [...] "Anything doing as <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> the ridge, Major?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sir,' said he, {{with tears}} {{starting}} to his weather-beaten face, which, with his trembling lips, was ashy pale, 'will <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> yonder?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> on the Atlantic, Mr. Crocker?" [...] she said. [...] "Surely not? We crossed on her ourselves. We {{should have}} met." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll have to." [...] Mr. Joyce {{paused for}} a moment. [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> to my office this afternoon, about three o'clock?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must {{excuse the}} bluntness which I feel is needful. <b>You</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> {{to see my}} uncle and I'm afraid you were {{disappointed}} in finding me instead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. I take it {{that that}} was why <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> here, because <b>you</b> {{realised}} how you were wasting your life and wanted a chance of making good in my office." ...|$|R
6000|$|Grace made {{no direct}} response, and he grew visibly uncomfortable under the cold {{abstraction}} of the gaze {{with which she}} seemed to look through him. [...] "Mrs. Maynard tells me <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> with her from Europe." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY WINDERMERE. Put it there, Parker. That will do. [Wipes {{her hands}} with her pocket-handkerchief, goes to tea-table, and sits down.] Won't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over,</b> Lord Darlington? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With {{reference}} to our conversation {{last week about}} your daughter [...] and G., can <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> and have a quiet chat with me this [...] afternoon? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, thank you, Wells," [...] she said, happily. [...] "It's {{just what}} I wanted. Won't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> to Cactus to-morrow {{and go to}} church with me?" ...|$|E
50|$|I double dare <b>you</b> to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> here.|$|R
6000|$|Maisie {{knew it was}} fearfully awkward; she {{had known}} this now, she felt, for some time, and there was {{something}} else it more pressingly concerned her to learn. [...] "What is it <b>you</b> meant <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> to ask me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You want a story," [...] {{finished}} Grandfather Frog for him. [...] "You can't fool me, Peter Rabbit. <b>You</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> {{here just}} to ask me for a story. I know you, Peter! I know you! Well, what is it this time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyway," [...] he resumed, [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> {{you must}} stay with me. I'm sorry we'll have to part company to-morrow. I start east {{by the first}} train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Mr. Cossey,--Will <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> {{and see me}} this {{afternoon}} [...] about three o'clock? I shall /expect/ you, so I am sure you will [...] not disappoint me.--B.Q." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the place!--I {{stopped there}} too. FULL of Americans, WASN'T it? It always is--always is. That's what they say. Everybody says that. What ship did <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What Jack {{said was}} true," [...] put in Fred quickly. [...] "I {{was on the}} back of our bobsled and watched you nearly all the time. <b>You</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> on our side of the road at least three {{different}} times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'm interested," [...] she declared. She {{felt that}} he {{would find a way}} out, though it might not be the easiest one. [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> to Canada, I suppose you must have found the smooth life you led grow monotonous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Unquestionably. For I don't {{know why}} <b>you</b> ever <b>came</b> here; though it's not such an unusual case, I {{am sorry to}} say, that we need go any farther into that. You don't know that the ship in which <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> with our friend General Fladdock, is in port, of course?' ...|$|R
6000|$|His look of eager {{intensity}} embarrassed her. After {{a little}} pause, he remarked: [...] "I am holding {{you to your}} promise. Can't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> to my studio this afternoon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> {{some time}} and stay {{a few days or}} a week with me, and I'll give you the best time hunting I can," [...] {{answered}} Barney Stevenson.|$|E
6000|$|She {{continued}} the conversation without feeling the slightest interest in it, but {{simply because it}} was an escape--a temporary escape--from her thoughts. [...] "What did <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> for?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|Only you I {{have not}} {{forgotten}} [...] For {{wreck of the}} world’s renown, [...] Rending and ending of things gone rotten, [...] Only the face of you unforgotten: [...] And your head upthrown in the skies alone [...] As <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> the down.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not a {{patch on}} you," [...] said Mr. Hills, edging his way by slow degrees into the parlour. [...] "I don't take young ladies to the Empire. Were {{you telling me}} <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> here to get married, or did I dream it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, two of <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over.</b> His reverence {{is our own}} {{homemade}} article. You {{had known}} Ralph Smith in South Africa. You had reason to believe he would not live long. You found out that his niece would inherit his fortune. How's that--eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well! We {{do seem to}} be gittin' along!" [...] He laughed again. [...] "I reckon <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> {{here because}} it seemed kind o' lonesome. Goin' to stay all night with Uncle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mrs. Sloane, won't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> to {{our house}} at once?" [...] he gasped. [...] "The baby, he's got colic, and ma's just wild, and he's all black in the face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! There's {{nothing more}} coming, Mr. Jones. Only don't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> {{in any of}} your fits of jealousy, or you'll have to be sent back again. You're not my lord and master--yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over,</b> {{the two of}} you, and hunted up the girl. The {{idea was}} that one of you was to marry her, and the other have {{a share of the}} plunder. For some reason, Woodley was chosen as the husband. Why was that?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Presently Muriel {{gave him}} a {{careless}} glance. [...] "Helen told me she met you in the hills and <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> to the hall where she and Alison Jardine stopped. Now you have had an opportunity of correcting your first impression, {{what do you think}} of her?" ...|$|R
