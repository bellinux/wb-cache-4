2500|$|U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy indicted Ginzburg for distributing obscene {{literature}} {{through the}} mails, {{in violation of}} federal anti-obscenity laws. The indictment, although full of counts, really comprised three allegations of obscenity: First, publication of Volume I, No. 4, of Eros; second, publication of his newsletter Liaison; and third, that although The Housewife's Handbook on Selective Promiscuity, published by Ginzburg, was not itself obscene because of its inherent artistic value, Ginzburg has mailed advertisements for the book which accentuated the erotic content of the book {{in such a way}} as to appeal to [...] "prurient interests". The advertising emphasized their sexual imagery, and included a guarantee of a full refund [...] "if the book fails to reach <b>you</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> U.S. Post Office censorship interference." ...|$|E

For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does." [...] As “one flesh,” {{the husband and wife}} share this right and privilege; the New Testament does not portray intimacy as something held in reserve by each spouse to be shared on condition. [...] "Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again lest Satan tempt <b>you</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> your lack of self-control." [...] A stated reason for maintaining marital relations is to reduce the temptation to adultery.|$|E
2500|$|Blackman is {{a rarity}} {{as a female}} jazz percussionist. [...] "In the past, {{there were a lot}} of stigmas {{attached}} to women playing certain instruments", Blackman says. [...] "I think a lot of women stick to particular instruments, like piano, that are acceptable, so that lessens the playing field in terms of how many women are out there. And let's face it, boys' clubs still exist. But I care nothing about that at all. I'm going to do what I'm going to do musically anyway." [...] However Blackman draws on the role models of her mother who played violin in an orchestra and her grandmother who was a classical pianist and does not let stereotypes deter her. [...] "God forbid I should be limited to only play my drums in my basement; but if that's all I had, that's what I would do", says Blackman. [...] "Any woman, or anyone facing race prejudice, weight prejudice, hair prejudice ... if you let somebody stop <b>you</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their opinions, then the only thing you're doing is hurting yourself. I don't want to give somebody that power over me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fairuz's son, Ziad Rahbani, sparked {{controversy}} in December 2013 {{during an interview}} with the Al-Ahed website when asked whether his mother shared his supportive stance on the political vision of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, a dominant but highly controversial political and military force in Lebanon. Ziad replied: [...] "Fairuz is very fond of Sayyed Hassan , although she will be displeased with me, as she was after my last television interview, when I revealed some personal information and she quickly interrupted me". There were strong reactions to this statement, which went viral on social media, and the country's different media outlets did not deviate from their political stances when reacting to Ziad's words. Politicians and celebrities stepped in as well, some of whom objected to affiliating Fairuz to one side of Lebanon's political divide over another, including Druze leader Walid Jumblatt who said: [...] "Fairuz is too great to be criticized, {{and at the same time}} too great to be classified as belonging to this or that political camp". [...] "Let us keep her in her supreme position, and not push her to something she has nothing to do with," [...] Jumblatt added. Ziad, who claims to speak on his mother's behalf [...] "because she prefers to remain silent", responded to his critics by saying: [...] "Apparently it isn’t allowed in the age of strife for the princess of classy Arab art to voice love for the master of resistance". Nasrallah, commenting on the issue during a speech, stated: [...] "An educated highly respected thinker and artist, who maybe espoused different ideologies, might disagree with you on political matters, but personally have [...] fondness for <b>you,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> your character, conduct, sacrifices and so on.

After the season conclusion, Angelo parted {{with many of the}} team's defensive coaches, and hired Rod Marinelli. He also commented on the team's need to acquire a stable quarterback, dismissing rumors that Kyle Orton was the franchise's long-term solution. In an interview in January 2009, he stated, “It’s all about the quarterback... <b>You</b> don’t win <b>because</b> <b>of</b> wide receivers. <b>You</b> don’t win <b>because</b> <b>of</b> running backs. <b>You</b> win <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the quarterback.
