2500|$|After {{his change}} of life, Darius has {{accepted}} his violent past, because [...] "to deny what I was is to deny what I am." [...] He still enjoys martial pastimes such as chess and recreating famous battles such as Gettysburg. In [...] "Saving Grace", MacLeod tells him, [...] "You {{may be a}} priest, but <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> like a warrior." [...] Darius considers that [...] "war, in the abstract, is a great intellectual puzzle, but in reality it's all blood and tears." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{spoke to}} the other men. [...] Finally they all spoke to First Man. [...] First Man called across the river to First Woman, and asked, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> you can live alone?" [...] "I no longer believe I can," [...] she responded. [...] "I am sorry I let the things you said make me angry," [...] First Man said. [...] And then the men sent a raft to the women's {{side of the river}} to bring the women across. [...] The men and women bathed and dried their bodies with corn meal, and {{remained}} apart until nightfall. [...] Then they would resume their lives together.|$|E
6000|$|... “That {{man will}} never tell her—or speak {{a word to}} clear <b>you.</b> <b>Still,</b> I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can do without friends of that kind. You have good ones in this country.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] she said, {{with an air}} of playful reproach, [...] "everybody plays cards nowadays, and I suppose {{one must}} not be too hard on <b>you.</b> <b>Still,</b> I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> know what my views are upon that subject." ...|$|R
6000|$|Zul. Add to the rest, {{this one}} {{reflection}} more: When she is married, and <b>you</b> <b>still</b> adore, <b>Think</b> then,--and think what comfort it will bring,-- She had been mine, Had I but only dared to be a king! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes. I {{know how}} much more than kind, how honourable {{you have been in}} all this matter. <b>You</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that the will is hidden?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Benicia {{knew what}} was coming, but she smiled. [...] "You are sure of that?" [...] she said. [...] "I mean, <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it is your business?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly {{he stepped}} up to Professor Chadd's elbow, and said, in a loud {{familiar}} voice, [...] "Well, my boy, do <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> the Zulus our inferiors?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{paint in}} gloomy colors, Captain Ludlow," [...] said the free-trader, drawing a heavy breath, {{in spite of}} all his resolution. [...] "My {{experience}} tells me you are right, though my wishes would fain contradict <b>you.</b> <b>Still,</b> I <b>think</b> we have the promise of a tranquil night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Carrie, [...] "that was {{not meant}} to be conciliatory. It rather emphasises the {{distinction}} <b>you</b> mention. <b>Still,</b> I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> had not finished." ...|$|R
6000|$|Grace nodded. [...] "No," [...] she said, [...] "perhaps it isn't. You {{rather like}} opposition, don't <b>you?</b> <b>Still,</b> I <b>think</b> one could {{leave it to}} your good sense, while I would {{especially}} like to see all quiet this winter in the Green River valley. That, however, could, of course, scarcely be thought a reason at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Russ, I've {{been sick}} myself--in bed for three days," [...] she said. [...] "I'm better now. I hope you are. You look so pale. Do <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think,</b> brood about that fight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Her fingers {{stopped for}} the first time, as she {{retorted}} rather angrily, [...] "What have I told you? Do <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think,</b> in spite of it, that I do not mean what I say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{girl was}} on her feet in a moment. [...] "My uncle, you cannot be in earnest," [...] she said. [...] "I declare before God I will stab myself rather than be forced on that young man. The heart rises at it; God forbids such marriages; you dishonour your white hair. Oh, my uncle, pity me! There is not a woman {{in all the world}} but would prefer death to such a nuptial. Is it {{possible}}," [...] she added, faltering--"is it possible that you do not believe me--that <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> this"--and she pointed at Denis with a tremor of anger and contempt--"that <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> this to be the man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not. <b>Still,</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{there would}} be no harm in my writing to Marian to say that her {{behavior}} has attracted your notice, and----" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} met with mixed to {{positive}} reviews from critics. AllMusic's Chris Nickson felt that, although the instrumentation occasionally overpowers the lyrics, the album {{as a whole is}} artistically successful, concluding that [...] "once again, pop meets politics and, as has to be the case with any good anarchist collective, the politics win -- but <b>you</b> can <b>still</b> <b>think</b> and dance while you listen." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Still</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{that there}} is more {{interest}} taken in the intellectual development of the working classes in foreign countries than in England?--I think so, but I do not trust my own opinion.|$|R
6000|$|We {{were both}} silent, {{just as the}} {{characters}} are in a novel till the author can think what to make them say next. Then we asked, [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> {{he had been in}} the penitentiary?" ...|$|E
6000|$|POULDER. [Seeing red] Ho! Because {{you had the}} {{privilege}} of fightin' for your country <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> you can put it on, do you? Take up your wine! 'Pon my word, you fellers have got no nerve left! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't know, Stephen,' {{his mother}} said meaningly, 'whe'r <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> about Miss Elfride, but if I were you I wouldn't concern about her. They say that none of old Mrs. Swancourt's money will come to her step-daughter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, sir, I am in a {{position}} to set your mind at rest. I have {{known for a long time}} that he died of the Plague, but I have kept it from you, thinking that it was best <b>you</b> should <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that he might be living. He fell dead beside me on the very day that I sickened of the Plague, and, indeed, it was from him that I took it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is, I fancy, no sorrow {{which a man}} cannot forget; that is, as far as {{the memory}} of {{it is likely to be}} painful to him. You will not {{absolutely}} cease to remember Castle Richmond and all its circumstances; <b>you</b> will <b>still</b> <b>think</b> of the place and all the people whom you knew there; but you will learn to do so without the pain which of course you now suffer. That is what I mean by forgetting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing is {{farther from}} my mind," [...] {{declared}} Andrew, smiling. [...] "It's unpleasant to feel beaten; and I'm {{partly responsible for}} our failure by confiding in Mappin. If <b>you</b> and Carnally <b>still</b> <b>think</b> I'm to be trusted as a partner, we'll come back again, though I'd prefer waiting until the ice breaks up in the spring." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{girl was}} on her feet in a moment. [...] "My uncle, you cannot be in earnest," [...] she said. [...] "I declare before God I will stab myself rather than be forced on that young man. The heart rises at it; God forbids such marriages; you dishonour your white hair. Oh, my uncle, pity me! There is not a woman {{in all the world}} but would prefer death to such a nuptial.

6000|$|Capell smiled. [...] "It is no reproach, Greystoke," [...] he said; [...] "and, by Jove, {{it would}} be a mark of {{distinction}} if a fellow could act the part. And now how about your plan? Do <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> you can empty the trench opposite our sector?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 4. [...] "Well, but," [...] <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> within yourselves, [...] "it is {{not right}} that {{architecture}} should be interesting. It is a very grand thing, this architecture, but essentially unentertaining. It is its duty to be dull, it is monotonous by law: it cannot be correct and yet amusing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True. You speak, if {{not like}} a physician, yet like a metaphysician; so you will not laugh at me, and compel the weak old man and his fancy to take refuge with a girl--who is not weak.--Grace, darling, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>still</b> that he is coming?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Ingleby. [...] "That is it exactly. Of course, I know I'm {{taking an}} unwarranted liberty, but if I had felt that Hetty {{could have had}} any liking for him I should not have {{mentioned}} it to <b>you.</b> <b>Still,</b> don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{it might be better}} if she didn't see so much of him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|That, old mare, {{at sight}} whereof your wise eyes widen till {{they are ready}} to burst, and your ears are first shot forward towards your nose, and then laid back with vicious intent. Stand still, old woman! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>still,</b> after fifteen winters, that you can catch a fox? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you {{say that}} <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> I am beautiful," [...] she went on, [...] "and I am sure my clothes are perfect--they came {{straight}} from Paris. I hope you appreciate this lace," [...] she added, drawing it through her fingers. [...] "My figure is just as good, too, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We’ll {{have the}} moon up in ten minutes,” said Harper, as the “Ventura” swung up on a {{frothing}} sea. “That would suit {{us if we}} were in the bay, but I’m not certain where we’re heading for just now. <b>You</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that was Sparto Point we saw at dusk, Rosendo?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You women haven't risen yet--it's an {{evidence}} of the backwardness of your sex--to a conception of the Bismarck idea in diplomacy. If a man praises one woman, <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> he's in love with another. Do you mean that because Tom didn't praise the elder sister so much, he HAS spoken to HER?" ...|$|E
60|$|If <b>still</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> me mad, {{you will}} think so no longer when I {{describe}} the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I {{cut off the}} head and the arms and the legs.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} not my brother----" [...] I began, then checked myself, for I was by nature easy-tempered, and went on: [...] "It is true, Ragnar, I am not so fond of hunting as <b>you</b> are. <b>Still,</b> I <b>think</b> {{that there will be}} time to fight this bear and kill or be killed by it, before it grows dark, and if not I will return alone to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Peter, shadows {{are such}} pretty things. The orchard {{is full of}} them this very minute. Sometimes they are so <b>still</b> <b>you</b> would <b>think</b> them asleep. Then they go {{laughing}} and skipping. Outside, in the oat field, they are always chasing each other. They are the wild shadows. The shadows in the orchard are the tame shadows.|$|R
