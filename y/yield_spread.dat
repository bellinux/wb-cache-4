2500|$|For any {{residential}} mortgage loan, no mortgage originator {{may receive}} compensation that varies {{based on the}} term of the loan, other than the principal amount. In general, the mortgage originator can only receive payment from the consumer, except as provided in rules that may be established by the Board. Additionally, the mortgage originator must verify the consumer's ability to pay. A violation of the [...] "ability to repay" [...] standard, or a mortgage that has excessive fees or abusive terms, may be raised as a foreclosure defense by a borrower against a lender without regard to any statute of limitations.

50|$|<b>Yield</b> <b>spread</b> {{can also}} be an {{indicator}} of profitability for a lender providing a loan to an individual borrower. For consumer loans, particularly home mortgages, an important <b>yield</b> <b>spread</b> {{is the difference between}} the interest rate actually paid by the borrower on a particular loan and the (lower) interest rate that the borrower's credit would allow that borrower to pay. For example, if a borrower's credit is good enough to qualify for a loan at 5% interest rate but accepts a loan at 6%, then the extra 1% <b>yield</b> <b>spread</b> (with the same credit risk) translates into additional profit for the lender. As a business strategy, lenders typically offer <b>yield</b> <b>spread</b> premiums to brokers who identify borrowers willing to pay higher yield spreads.|$|E
50|$|A company {{desiring}} {{to enter}} the mortgage business often chooses to be a mortgage banker vs. a mortgage broker primarily to earn <b>yield</b> <b>spread</b> premiums.

A new phenomenon has developed since the mortgage crisis of 2008 in which more compensation is paid to the mortgage brokers for 'targeted' interest rates. For example, the <b>Yield</b> <b>Spread</b> Premium on a 30-year fixed rate of 5.50% might be 1.7%, while the YSP for 5.625% on the same loan may be 0.625%, and 5.25% might cost the borrower 1%.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{economic}} fundamentals and a common risk factor that is not accounted for by Euro area fundamentals on Euro area <b>yield</b> <b>spreads.</b> In particular, it seeks to disentangle {{the effects of}} changes in risk aversion and the common risk factor. For this purpose, I use a multi-country macro-finance model of the term structure, where changes in risk-aversion are captured by one single variable. This risk aversion variable is identified from restrictions on the pricing kernel to be the single source of time variation in the prices of risk. The model is applied to yield data of French, German, Italian and Spanish government bonds and the estimation is conducted using Bayesian estimation techniques. The results show that although economic fundamentals were the most dominant driver of Euro area <b>yield</b> <b>spreads,</b> the common risk factor accounts for a non-negligible part in Euro area <b>yield</b> <b>spreads.</b> Notably, the contribution of common risk factor shocks to the <b>yield</b> <b>spreads</b> increased from 2012 onwards.

5000|$|Lenders {{that fund}} loans and then sell them after closing {{do not need}} to {{disclose}} the amount of the <b>yield</b> <b>spread</b> premium they make. This is a HUD rule (RESPA 1974). On the other hand, brokers are forced to disclose the amount of <b>yield</b> <b>spread</b> they get from the bank. HUD's stated rationale is that Institutional lenders sell their loans in a true [...] "Secondary Market Transaction" [...] sometime after the loan is closed. This means that the loan is sold at a later time and their true [...] "Yield Spread" [...] or additional revenue is not yet known.

Furthermore, most lending agreements with brokers restrict Early Pay Off (EPO) of the mortgage loan. For example, if the borrower refinances or sells the property within the EPO time period, usually 60 to 120 days, the lender contractually can and usually will demand reimbursement of the <b>yield</b> <b>spread</b> premium paid, while the broker has no recourse toward the borrower.|$|E

I find that the Black-Cox model can explain 45 % of the cross-sectional variation in observed <b>yield</b> <b>spreads.</b> The unexplained variation cannot be attributed solely to non-credit components. Specifically, unexplained <b>yield</b> <b>spreads</b> are related to credit risk proxies such as recent equity volatility, ratings, and option expensiveness, suggesting that the model does not fully capture credit risk in the cross-section.

Based on the relation of unexplained <b>yield</b> <b>spreads</b> with option expensiveness and recent equity volatility, I then calibrate a jump diffusion model and a stochastic volatility model, finding that the jump diffusion model weakly improves cross-sectional explanatory power while the stochastic volatility model does not. As the jump diffusion model relies on jump risk premia estimates from equity options, {{this suggests that the}} corporate bond and equity option markets price a common risk.
