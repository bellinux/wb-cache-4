Expressions for the direction {{dependence of the}} <b>Young's</b> modulus in the polypropylene film have been drived and have been applied to the drawing polypropylene film. The followiing results were obtained; 1. The dynamic <b>Young's</b> modulus and <b>Young's</b> modulus of the monoaxial drawing polypropylene film show strongly direction dependence. 2. The dyanamic <b>Young's</b> modulus and <b>Young's</b> modulus of the simultaneous biaxial drawing polypropylene film appear slightly direction dependence. 3. The expression for the direction dependence of the <b>Young's</b> modulus of the drawing polypropylene film may be expressed as Eθ=E 11 cos 2 θ+E 12 sinθcosθ+E 22 sin 2 θ where Eθ is the <b>Young's</b> modulus of θ direction to the drawind direction, E 11 is the <b>Young's</b> modulus of the drawing direction, E 22 is the <b>Young's</b> modulus of the perpendicular direction to the drawing direction and E 12 is the mixed <b>Young's</b> modulus.

5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{challenged}} Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric <b>Young),</b> {{who were}} accompanied by Coach D'Amore, for the NWA World Tag Team Championship in the seventh match.

Later, <b>Young</b> went to grab a chair from Devine who had his back turned to the ring. This caused Devine to panic and hit <b>Young</b> in the head with the chair. Storm immediately followed by grabbing <b>Young</b> and pinning his shoulders to the mat with a school boy type pin attempt for the victory.|$|E
5|$|By 1182 <b>Young</b> Henry reiterated his {{previous}} demands: {{he wanted to}} be granted lands, for example the Duchy of Normandy, which would allow him to support himself and his household with dignity. Henry refused, but agreed to increase his son's allowance, but this was not enough to placate <b>Young</b> Henry. With trouble clearly brewing, Henry attempted to defuse the situation by insisting that Richard and Geoffrey give homage to <b>Young</b> Henry for their lands. Richard did not believe that <b>Young</b> Henry had any claim over Aquitaine and refused to give homage; when Henry forced Richard to give homage, <b>Young</b> Henry angrily refused to accept it. <b>Young</b> Henry formed an alliance with some of the disgruntled barons of the Aquitaine who were unhappy with Richard's rule, and Geoffrey sided with him, raising a mercenary army in Brittany to threaten Poitou. Open war broke out in 1183 and Henry and Richard led a joint campaign into Aquitaine: before they could conclude it, however, <b>Young</b> Henry caught a fever and died, bringing a sudden end to the rebellion.|$|E

Though he {{defeated}} {{him to become}} the new champion, a week later the decision was reversed and <b>Young</b> was forced to relinquish the title belt to Bashir due to a controversial ending to their match. <b>Young</b> and Bashir fought for the championship once again at Final Resolution, with referee Shane Sewell interfering in the bout like he had done in the previous encounter, which allowed <b>Young</b> to gain the victory. Afterwards, Management Director Jim Cornette stripped <b>Young</b> of the championship. This set up a tournament for the title, ending at Genesis where Alex Shelley defeated Chris Sabin to become the new champion.|$|E
