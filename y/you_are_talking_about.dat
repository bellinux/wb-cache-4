500|$|Basically, I {{like any}} music that remains simple and I {{feel this is}} the formula that makes [...] "soul music" [...] successful. When any music form becomes {{cluttered}} and/or complicated you lose the average listener's ear. There is nothing more beautiful than a simple blues tune. There is beauty in simplicity whether <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> architecture, art or music.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Mosley {{agreed with}} Balestre that the Frenchman would stand down as {{president}} of the FIA in Mosley's favour, in return for the new role of President of the FIA Senate, to be created after Mosley's election. As well as motorsport, the FIA's remit includes the interests of motorists worldwide, an area in which Mosley wanted to involve himself: [...] "That is what really interested me: [...] you maybe save one life every five years, whereas [...] road safety <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> thousands of lives". A challenge to Mosley's election by Jeffrey Rose, chairman of the British Royal Automobile Club, was withdrawn {{when it became clear that}} the majority of voters were already committed to Mosley. The FISA was then merged into the FIA as its sporting arm.|$|E

[...] But today I walked over that same block covered with beautiful buildings and a veritable hive of medical activity. I have not completed my inspection yet, but I am almost certain as to the kind of a report I will make; and I am sure you will be satisfied with it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rice {{said in a}} CNN {{interview}} about Pelosi's leadership, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> a company that was posting losing numbers, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> any sports team that was losing time and time again, changes would be made, right? The CEO out. The coach would be out {{and there would be}} a new strategy put in place." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We want to {{add value}} through skills acquisition. But in doing this, we have {{found out that the}} main problem is getting finance at {{affordable}} interest rates. The Federal Government talks about this and the banks also talk about it. But I want to state here that the banks have not been helpful. They always say money is available. Where is the money? There is no small scale industrialist who walks into a bank and gets a loan. It is difficult for SMEs to get loans from banks because they always demand for collaterals. The collateral they ask for is over and above the worth of the loan. So, the banks are not keen on lending to small scale businesses at all. They say this sub-sector is risk infested. They may claim that they have given some amount of money as loans to the SMEs; but you will find out that this is not true. For instance, what can a loan that is given to 2,000 people in a nation of about 167 million people do? The last statistics conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that there were about 17 million small scale industrialists in Nigeria and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> empowering 2,000 people with loans. What is that? So, the banks are paying lip service to funding SMEs." ...|$|E
