60|$|So, on {{the other}} hand, if Germany sends 15 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen to England, and finding the {{relative}} value of the two articles in that country determined by the English costs of production, is enabled to purchase with 35 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen 10 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> cloth; Germany now gains 5 yards, just as England did before,--for with 15 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen she purchases 10 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> cloth, when to produce these 10 yards she must have employed as much labour as would have enabled her to produce 20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen.

5|$|At Ditmas Avenue, the Culver Ramp {{ends and}} the {{underground}} line becomes elevated. This is a three-track Dual Contracts elevated on the former BMT line over McDonald (formerly Gravesend) Avenue. Just before the station, the southbound local track merges into the southbound express track, while the northbound express track becomes the El's bidirectional center express track. During the 1990s and 2000s, the center express track in this section was occasionally used for non-revenue testing. After Avenue X station, a ramp diverges to the surface {{for access to the}} Culver <b>Yard</b> <b>of</b> the Coney Island Yards complex.

5000|$|In {{this section}} Marx {{explains}} that commodities come in double form: natural form and value form. We {{do not know}} commodities' value until we know how much human labor was put in it. Commodities are traded for one another after their values are decided socially. Then there is value-relation, which lets us trade between different kind of commodities. Marx explains value without using money. Marx uses 20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen and a coat to show the value of each other (20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen = 1 coat, or 20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen are worth 1 coat). The statement [...] "20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen are worth 1 coat" [...] label two forms of value. The first form, the relative form of value, is the commodity that comes first in the statement (the 20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen in the example). The second form, the equivalent form of value, is the commodity that comes second in the statement (the 1 coat in the example). He adds that comparing 20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen to itself (20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen = 20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen, or 20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen are worth 20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen) is meaningless, {{because there is no}} expression of value. Linen is an object of utility whose value cannot be determined until it is compared to another commodity. Determining the value of a commodity depends on its position in the expression of comparative exchange value.|$|R
60|$|Suppose, for example, that 10 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> {{broad cloth}} cost in England as much labour as 15 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen, and in Germany {{as much as}} 20. If England sends 10 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> broad cloth to Germany, {{and is able to}} {{exchange}} them for linen according to the German cost of production, she will get 20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen, with a quantity of labour with which she could not have produced more than 15; and will gain, therefore, 5 yards on every 15, or 33-1/3 per cent. But in this case Germany would obtain only 10 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> cloth for 20 of linen. Now, 10 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> cloth cost exactly the same quantity of labour in Germany as 20 of linen; Germany, therefore, derives no advantage from the trade, more than she would possess if it did not exist.|$|R
5|$|Amazon {{went on to}} join Nelson in {{the chase}} to the West Indies and back during the Trafalgar Campaign. During the voyage across the Atlantic, Nelson wanted to pass on {{specific}} instructions to his captains about how he wished to engage the French, but {{did not want to}} lose time by ordering his ships to heave to. Instead he gave the plans to Parker, who was described by Pulteney Malcolm as the 'best frigate captain in the service', and Parker sped along the line in Amazon, delivering the instructions so efficiently that the fleet lost 'hardly a <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> ground'. Once more in European waters after the fleet's return, Amazon captured the Spanish privateer Principe de la Paz off Ushant on 17 September 1805. Principe was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns and four swivels. Her crew of 160 men, under the command of Captain François Beck, were principally French. She had been out five weeks and had captured the packet Prince of Wales from Lisbon, and the letter of marque Lady Nelson, which had been sailing from Virginia to Glasgow. A number of Lady Nelsons crew were aboard Principe, as was a considerable amount of specie.|$|E
5|$|The {{mutilated}} body of {{the fourth}} woman, prostitute Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway in the back <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2am {{on the day she}} was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8inches (15–20cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.|$|E
5|$|As in England, {{commissions}} of new statuary {{tended to}} be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> John Bacon (1740–99) who produced a monument for Robert Dundas (d. 1787) at Borthwick Church and one for Mrs Allardyce (d. 1787) at West Church, Aberdeen. Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coade stone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coat of arms, tablets, ornamental vases, church monuments and fonts. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Register House, Edinburgh, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. As well as supplying sculpture, candelabra and cippi, the Adam family supplied designs to the Carron Company, founded in 1759, which produced a wide range of iron products, including stoves, safes, vases and tablets.|$|E

5|$|In 1813 the <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> the King's Head {{coaching}} inn was widened {{to create}} Davey Place, a new street between {{the market and}} Back of the Inns, at that time a narrow passageway which ran parallel to Gentleman's Walk behind the coaching inns. (Although the inns no longer remain, Back of the Inns survives as a street name.) In 1820 the Gasolier, Norwich's first gas lamp, was installed in the market outside the entrance to Davey Place. Exchange Street, a new road running north from {{the northeast corner of}} the market, was completed in 1828 and a roadway was installed alongside the existing footpath. London Street, the main road connecting the market with the older areas of the city around Tombland and the Cathedral was widened in 1856. In 1860 the decrepit fish market adjacent to the Guildhall, by now over 700 years old, was replaced with a new neoclassical building. In 1863 Gentleman's Walk was paved properly with York stone, and in 1874 the cobbles of the marketplace were replaced by timber blocks. Although by this time the market operated on all working days, Sunday trading laws meant it was closed on Sundays. The market space on Sundays was used for public assemblies and gatherings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the {{development}} of the Grand Tour took young Scottish aristocrats to the continent, particularly Rome, which was home to the exiled Jacobite Stuarts. This in turn fuelled interest in classical and Renaissance styles, and the buying of artistic works, particularly sculptures. However, the only major Scottish collection of marble before the nineteenth century was that of James Johnstone, 2nd Marquess of Annandale. As in England, commissions of new statuary tended to be crafted in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> John Bacon (1740–99). Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coadstone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coats of arms, tablets and ornamental vases. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. They also supplied sculpture, candelabra and cippi that made up the neo-classical Adam Style.|$|E
5|$|Kilner {{began the}} 1920 season with an innings of 206 not {{out in his}} first match, against Derbyshire, and the effort {{remained}} the highest score of his career. He batted for four hours, hitting 24 fours and two sixes. He could have been caught when he had scored around fifty, but a local newspaper described the innings as brilliant, his driving and pulling being particularly effective. Kilner appeared in one representative match: at the end-of-season Scarborough Festival, he played for CI Thornton's XI against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side which visited Australia in the winter—at the time, the MCC administered English cricket, and the England team toured under its name. In total, he scored 1,316 runs {{at an average of}} 37.09 with two more centuries, placing him second in the Yorkshire averages. With the ball, he took 27 wickets but his average of 25.33 was relatively high. The county finished fourth in the Championship as Middlesex were crowned winners. Critics believed Kilner should have bowled more frequently, an opinion shared by Wilfred Rhodes, Yorkshire's main slow left-arm spinner. Conscious of his increasing age, the 42-year-old Rhodes wanted support with the bowling workload; he considered Kilner the best option and encouraged him to improve his left-arm spin. Consequently, during the winter, Kilner practised bowling in the <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> the Wombwell hotel where his father was landlord. Around the same time he celebrated the birth of his second son, named Major after Major Booth.|$|E
5000|$|... "The ‘price form' of linen is therefore: 20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen = 2 {{ounces of}} gold, or, if 2 ounces of gold when coined are £2, 20 <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen = £2." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Suppose that ten <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> {{broadcloth}} cost in England as much labor as fifteen <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen, and in Germany {{as much as}} twenty.” This supposition {{then being}} made, {{it would be the}} interest of England to import linen from Germany, and of Germany to import cloth from England. “When each country produced both commodities for itself, ten <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> cloth exchanged for fifteen <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen in England, and for twenty in Germany. They will now exchange for the same number <b>of</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen in both. For what number? If for fifteen yards, England will be just as she was, and Germany will gain all. If for twenty yards, Germany will be as before, and England will derive the whole of the benefit. If for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty, the advantage will be shared between the two countries. If, for example, ten <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> cloth exchange for eighteen of linen, England will gain an advantage <b>of</b> three <b>yards</b> on every fifteen, Germany will save two out of every twenty. The problem is, what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of England and the linen of Germany will exchange for each other? Let us suppose, then, that by the effect of what Adam Smith calls the higgling of the market, ten <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> cloth, in both countries, exchange for seventeen <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> linen.|$|R
