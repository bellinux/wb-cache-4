5000|$|Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly took a major {{swipe at}} the group for their overemphasis of Scherzinger as the lead singer. Watson said, [...] "there {{are two kinds of}} girl groups: those {{anchored}} by a superstar (the Supremes, Destiny's Child), and those made up of charismatic personalities endowed with limited individual gifts (Spice Girls, TLC). The Pussycat Dolls are neither—they're a brand, not a band. This follow-up to 2005's multi-platinum PCD finds lead Doll Nicole Scherzinger in the spotlight, and she's no Beyoncé.

5000|$|MusicReviews10 {{also stated}} a dislike for the album, commenting, [...] "Fight or Flight opens with the {{delightful}} second single Lovesick and trods on mindlessly till the album ends before <b>you</b> <b>even</b> <b>know</b> it. A few tracks {{do try to}} save the album, besides the aforementioned Lovesick, there's also the album's first single Let's Be Friends which bleeps and blurps like an arcade yet has a stadium-sized monster of a chorus which soon becomes a guilty pleasure. Among all the ballads, Marisol is a cut above the rest. It manages not to be boring and forgettable {{like the rest of}} the slow numbers on the album. But there's a problem with this collection of songs — there's little to no soul. Unlike Cyrus who does seem like she means what she sings most of the time, it just sounds like Osment made an album of catchy albeit forgettable songs to milk her career further. Fight or Flight isn't horrible by any measure, and when Osment decides to give you a guilty pleasure of a track, she sure as heck will, but the problem is, will you actually remember the songs on the album the next day? Because I didn't." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{track was}} {{described}} by NME as,One of the earliest songs on the session, toughened up from the Perry era, this confessional song is nonetheless one of the record’s more plaintive moments, in the vein of 'Malibu'. Lyrically, it finally addresses the scars she still bears over her husband’s death in the most brutal fashion: [...] "I knew a boy who came from the sea/he was the only boy who ever knew the truth about me... I knew a boy who left me so ravaged/do <b>you</b> <b>even</b> <b>know</b> {{the extent of the}} damage? ... I’m overwhelmed and undersexed?/Baby what did you expect?/I’m overwrought and so disgraced/I’m too ashamed to show my face/And they’re coming to take me away now/what I want I will never have/I’m on the Pacific Coast Highway/With your gun in my hand".In its week of release it became the most added song to modern rock radio in the United States.

What you are going to find here is a detailed and mathematically biased introduction to several aspects of the Finite Element Method. This is not however a course on the Analysis of the method. It is just a demonstration of how it works, written as applied mathematicians usually write it. There is going to be mathematics involved, but not lists of theorems and proofs. We are also going from the most particular cases towards useful generalizations, from example to theory. An aspect where this course differs from most of the many introductory books on finite elements is the fact that I am going to begin directly with the two–dimensional case. I’ve just sketched the one dimensional case in an appendix. Many people think that the one–dimensional case is a better way of introducing the method, but I have an inner feeling that the method losses richness in that very simple situation, so I prefer going directly to the plane...|$|E
