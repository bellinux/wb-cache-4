5000|$|The <b>yellow-shafted</b> <b>flicker</b> (C. a. auratus) {{resides in}} eastern North America. They are yellow under the tail and underwings and have yellow shafts on their primaries. They have a grey cap, a beige face, {{and a red}} bar {{at the nape of}} the neck. Males have a black moustache. Colaptes comes from the Greek verb colapt, meaning [...] "to peck"; auratus is from the Latin root aurat, meaning [...] "gold" [...] or [...] "golden", and refers to the bird's underwing.|$|E
50|$|Alabama’s birds include {{golden and}} bald eagles, osprey and other hawks, <b>yellow-shafted</b> <b>flickers,</b> and {{black-and-white}} warblers. Game birds include bobwhite quail, duck, wild turkey, and goose. Freshwater fish such as bream, shad, bass, and sucker are common. Along the Gulf Coast there are seasonal runs of tarpon, pompano, red drum, and bonito.|$|R

40|$|Examination of 1905 {{arthropods}} from a swamp {{and surrounding}} pasture in southern Louisiana revealed larval specimens of Mediorhynchus centurorum in 8 of 228 woodroaches, Parcoblatta pensylvanica, {{but in no}} other species. The life cycle was confirmed by feeding eggs of M. centurorum to laboratory-reared woodroaches. Cystacanths later recovered from the woodroaches developed into mature worms when pipetted into esophaguses of red-bellied woodpeckers, Centurus carolinus; redheaded woodpeckers, Melanerpes erythrocephalus; <b>yellow-shafted</b> <b>flickers,</b> Colaptes auratus; and a hairy woodpecker, Dendrocopos villosus. Infection was achieved in all woodpeckers fed cystacanths at least 47 days old and the mean prepatent period was 35 days. Cystacanths fed starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, and red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, did not produce infections although cystacanths from the same pool were infective to control woodpeckers. Larval development of Mediorhynchus centurorum in woodroaches {{did not differ significantly}} from that of M. grandis in grasshoppers. M. centurorum is the only species of the Gigantorhynchidae for which the life cycle has been confirmed by laboratory infections using an intermediate host species known infected in nature...|$|R
50|$|Bird-watchers {{can gain}} {{a glimpse of}} many species of birds through a visitation of the tubs. The tubs offer a {{possibility}} to view some of the birds that are becoming a rarity in the northeast region of the state. Depending on the seasonality of the birds {{in the area and}} the time at which hikers and visitors experience the tubs, different bird types can be viewed and observed. Common to the area are the whippoorwill and saw-whet owl, both of which are becoming scarce across much of their normal habitat. Also, the barred owl, rufous-sided towhee, <b>yellow-shafted</b> <b>flicker,</b> brown thrasher, and eastern wood pewee can be seen here. Game birds are frequent to the area as well and include wild turkey and ruffed grouse.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Yellow-shafted</b> <b>Flicker</b> (Colaptes auratus auratus) and Red-shafted Flicker (C. a. cafer) form a stable, narrow hybrid zone on {{the western}} Great Plains of North America. Allozyme data were {{obtained}} from 31 structural gene loci for 33 samples representing 246 Northern Flickers from throughout the Great Plains. Flickers were approximately equivalent to other birds in terms of proportion of polymorphic loci (P = 0. 207) and average heterozygosity (H = 0. 056). There was no concordant variation between plumage characters and allelic frequencies. Gene-diversity analysis indicated that 92. 5 % of the genic variation occurred as within-deme heterozygosity (GD = 0. 925), approximately 7 % occurred among individual demes (GST= 0. 07), and only 0. 9 % occurred among major river drainages (GST = 0. 009). Even less diversity was found among parental and hybrid groups (GST = 0. 002). There is substantial allozymic structuring of the Northern Flicker species population, but the structuring is not associated with the hybrid zone, and there is, at most, very weak structuring into riparian zones of habitat. The electrophoretic data support the inference that gene flow among Northern Flicker populations is high (Nm = 1. 9 - 4. 4 /generation). If the high gene-flow estimates are correct, then geographical selection gradients {{would be the most}} likely mechanism maintaining the narrow hybrid zone of plumage and morphometric traits...|$|E
40|$|The bounded-hybrid superiority {{hypothesis}} (BHSH) predicts stable hybrid {{zones are}} characterized by hybrids having the highest fitness within the zone. The dynamic-equilibrium hypothesis (DEH) predicts hybrids to have the lowest fitness and mating should be strongly assortative in the hybrid zone. I used phenotypic-based hybrid indices (HI) to assess mating patterns, reproductive success, and survival of hybridizing northern flickers (Colaptes auratus) within the hybrid zone at Riske Creek, British Columbia. Contrary to the BHSH, flickers showed significant assortative pairing (P = 0. 038) which may result via passive mate choice if yellow and red flickers migrate from allopatric winter ranges. North American band recoveries show red-shafted and <b>yellow-shafted</b> <b>flickers</b> winter on different sides of the Rocky Mountains while red-orange hybrids from Riske Creek winter {{in the range of}} red-shafted flickers. Arrival dates of phenotypes did not support the idea that mating patterns are caused passively via different arrival schedules. However, assortative mating patterns did correlate with regional weather patterns along flicker migration routes as well as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) a continental weather pattern that has been shown to influence various aspects of the annual cycle in other birds. If variable weather patterns result in different mating patterns by affecting migration, the geographic location of the northern portion of the zone may be variable due to the migratory behaviour of individuals. There were no differences among yellow, orange and red flickers to win more agonistic contests or have earlier nest initiation dates, larger clutch sizes, greater hatching success, or produce more fledglings. No colour group had a higher likelihood of having a successful compared to a depredated nesting attempt. Aggression was similar between red (N = 21) and yellow flickers (N = 20) during taxidermy model presentations of pure red-shafted and <b>yellow-shafted</b> <b>flickers.</b> Using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) in Program MARK, I determined survival was best modeled as either constant between males and females or varying annually according to weather. Models incorporating HI had less support but suggested that survival is best modeled as a linear relationship where red-shafted flickers have the highest survival. Survival modeled in quadratic relationships found hybrid flickers to have the highest apparent survival estimates in support of the BHSH. Overall there was no support for reduced hybrid fitness, but survival appears to be influenced more by annual variation rather than strictly by an individual’s HI. Overall, I failed to find reduced hybrid fitness in support of the DEH but also failed to find increased hybrid fitness as predicted by the BHSH. Annual changes in selection pressure could prevent introgression of hybrid genes throughout the zone if selection favours red-shafted genes in some years and yellow-shafted genes in other years...|$|R
