500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is {{about a woman who}} teaches her partner how to love her in the right way, {{throughout}} which she uses sexual references. MTV News' Jocelyn Vena concluded that song has [...] "sassy" [...] lyrics, but its melody is soft enough and makes you forget that [...] "the track is actually kind of dirty". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated that during the interpretation of the lyrics, Rihanna is proud and sexual and her confidence comes from elsewhere. Rihanna reveals her sex fantasies through singing the lyrics: [...] "I'mma do it do it do it/On the bed on the floor on the couch/Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth/Just because I can't kiss back/Doesn't mean you can't kiss that", which were described as the [...] "nastiest" [...] on the song by Brad Wete of Complex. As the song continues further, Rihanna is [...] "not-so-subtly" [...] instructing her lover within the lines [...] "It’s <b>your</b> <b>turn</b> now / Watch and learn now / Watch and learn how / If you learn how / I'll stay".|$|E
500|$|On 24 October Newton, now {{driving a}} Ford saloon, met Scott by {{arrangement}} in Combe Martin, {{just north of}} Barnstaple. Newton explained {{that he had to}} drive to Porlock, about 25 miles away, and suggested that Scott accompany him—he and Scott could talk on the journey. Scott had with him his recently acquired pet dog, a Great Dane called Rinka; this disconcerted Newton, who was afraid of dogs, but Scott insisted that Rinka go with them. At Porlock, Newton left Scott and Rinka at a hotel while he supposedly dealt with his business. He picked them up shortly after 8pm, and they began the drive back to Combe Martin. On a deserted stretch of road, Newton began to drive erratically, feigning tiredness, and accepted Scott's suggestion that he take over the driving. They stopped; Scott got out, followed by Rinka, and ran round to the driver's side, where he found Newton, gun in hand. Newton shot the dog in the head and, saying [...] "It's <b>your</b> <b>turn</b> now", pointed the gun at Scott. The pistol failed to fire several times; eventually Newton jumped into the car and drove away, leaving Scott and the dead or dying dog by the roadside.|$|E

500|$|... "Wait Your Turn" [...] {{was one of}} many songs {{featured}} on Rated R that incorporates musical genres different from any of Rihanna's previous work, drawing heavily on dubstep and hip hop genres. In her review of Rated R, Ailbhe Malone of NME briefly commented on the song, calling it [...] "an electric backstreet stiletto stab, where, eyebrow cocked, Rihanna sings 'I’m such a fucking lady/You don’t have to be afraid.'" [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly observed that Rihanna was drawing a lot of inspiration for several of the songs on the album from her Bajan background and heritage, most noticeably in her style of singing, saying [...] "Throughout, Rihanna dons hip-hop swagger like borrowed armor, leaning heavily on her Caribbean accent and unleashing a string of baddest-bitch boasts via dancehall-riddim'd bangers like 'Hard', 'G4L' and 'Wait Your Turn." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian referred to [...] "Wait Your Turn" [...] as a response to Rihanna trying to move on from her innocent [...] "Umbrella" [...] pop star image, commenting [...] "At the other, however, the desire to escape the single's vast shadow has clearly led some of her collaborators to indulge in feats of impressively risky invention: the hypnotic, dirgey electronic grind of Wait <b>Your</b> <b>Turn,</b> Gangsta 4 Life's druggy, intoxicating mix of backwards drums, minor-key verses and spectral backing vocals." ...|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune {{said that}} Rihanna lashes {{out on the}} song, with [...] "help from an even harder-edged MC, Young Jeezy." [...] Monica Herrerra of Billboard {{magazine}} wrote: [...] "Rihanna effectively assumes the hip-hop posture and even recruits the ultimate street cred booster in rapper Young Jeezy, who provides the thrust needed to send a song with a somewhat inert chorus home". Herrerra continued, [...] "Though 'Hard' doesn't find Rihanna in her typical comfort zone, the atypical is precisely what she has aimed for with her new material—and it works". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy" [...] the highlights of Rated R, and wrote, [...] "both of which exploit Rihanna's most appealing vocal style, a sulky, icy, monotone". Petridis {{also noted that the}} song [...] "undercuts the standard braggathon of Hard—'fan mail from 27 million. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented on Rihanna's vocal style and the persona she adopts in the song. Greenblatt wrote, [...] "Rihanna dons hip-hop swagger like borrowed armor, leaning heavily on her Caribbean accent and unleashing a string of baddest-bitch boasts via dancehall-riddim'd bangers like 'Hard,' 'G4L,' and 'Wait <b>Your</b> <b>Turn.</b> Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media wrote, [...] "the bulletproof guise is good for the record's high point on 'Hard', a strutting statement of power bolstered by a roiling undertow of a beat from 'Umbrella' producer Tricky Stewart." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Gens du pays" [...] {{has been}} called the {{unofficial}} national anthem of Quebec. Written by poet, songwriter, and avowed Quebec nationalist Gilles Vigneault (with music co-written by Gaston Rochon), it was first performed by Vigneault on June 24, 1975 during a concert on Montreal's Mount Royal at that year's Fête nationale du Québec ceremony. It quickly became a folk classic, and it has been played frequently at Fête nationale ceremonies since then. The chorus {{is by far the most}} famous part of the song: Gens du pays, c'est votre tour / De vous laisser parler d'amour, which, translated, says, [...] "Folks of the land, it is <b>your</b> <b>turn</b> to let yourselves talk of love." [...] At this time, Vigneault invited Quebecers to use this song when someone celebrate a birthday, changing [...] "Gens du pays" [...] by [...] "Mon cher (name)...". In many family, we can hear this song when the cake approaches.|$|E
2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when <b>your</b> <b>turn</b> comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E
2500|$|The Game Boy Advance {{version was}} {{generally}} considered the weakest {{version of the}} game. IGN's Marc Nix scored it 6 out of 10, and was especially critical of the combat; [...] "enemies get the jump on you with the first attack, and since there can be several enemies on screen, it can {{take a long time}} for <b>your</b> <b>turn</b> to come up. Then you have to watch every swipe of battle, which all begin and end with the characters taking a LONG walk across the screen to attack and then retreat - just the time that it takes for sprites to rotate back into the ready position is enough time for you to lose interest." [...] He called the game [...] "a rough start for the journey." [...] GameSpy's Avi Fryman scored it 1.5 out of 5, criticizing the graphics, and finding the game buggy, writing [...] "I wonder if it was even tested prior to its clearly rushed release." [...] GameSpot's Frank Provo scored it 2.1 out of 10, writing, [...] "the range of interactivity is so low and the action is so infrequent that Frodo's quest to Mount Doom is reduced to nothing more than a trivial errand. What's more, the entire game is so unpolished and full of bugs that it's unfathomable how it ever passed quality assurance in the first place." ...|$|E

[...] Opposition MPs were also not satisfied with Karami's resignation, and kept pressing for full Syrian withdrawal. [...] Former minister and MP Marwan Hamadeh, who survived a similar car bomb attack on October 1, 2004, said [...] "I accuse this government of incitement, negligence and shortcomings at the least, and of covering up its planning at the most... if not executing". [...] Two days later Syrian leader Bashar Assad announced that his troops will leave Lebanon completely [...] "in the next few months".
