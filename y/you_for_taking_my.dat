5000|$|... “My {{dear friend}} Osbald … I am {{disappointed}} in <b>you</b> <b>for</b> not <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> advice. I urged {{you in my}} letter that you should give up this way of life. Do not add sin to sin by ruining your country and shedding blood. Think how much blood of emperors, princes, and people has been shed through you and your clan.” ...|$|R

Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> pride in <b>my</b> academic pursuits and encouraging me to succeed and push on towards such a monumental goal. I {{have been able to}} forge my own path and that has shown to be more valuable than any material possession.

40|$|This master’s thesis {{could not}} be {{possible}} without the support and effort {{from a number of}} people. First, I would like to thank God, without him nothing is possible. To my beautiful daughter Andrea and my wonderful son Jesus, I love you.

To my beautiful, patient, understanding, and always willing to help, chair Dr. Alice Quiocho. You have done so much for me. I will be eternally grateful for your motivation, ideas, and advice.

6000|$|... "An {{excellent}} reason, then, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> advice, and marrying me instantly! But you wander {{from the}} question. Where are you going? That {{is the issue}} now before the house. You persist in evading it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> {{the trouble}} to explain. Good-morning." [...] Beaton bowed himself off, without {{offering}} to shake hands.|$|R
6000|$|BUILDER. [In a voice {{different}} from any we have heard from him] Say! What business had he to touch me, a magistrate? I gave my daughter two taps with a cane in a private house, for interfering with me <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> wife home-- ...|$|R
60|$|She {{threw her}} lapful of flowers {{away from her}} {{on the table at}} which she was sitting. She became {{perfectly}} furious with him <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> side. I permitted myself (the poor child could not see it, remember), the harmless indulgence of a smile.|$|R
60|$|I {{had just}} given a porter the {{necessary}} directions <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> portmanteau to Mr. Keller's house, when I heard a woman's voice behind me asking {{the way to}} the Poste Restante--or, in our roundabout English phrase, the office of letters to be left till called for.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{always comes}} on unlucky days!' she said. 'I wish I {{could have made}} it go off better. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> all the trouble.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He can't pay <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of him, and {{my mother}} says it isn't worth while to help folks that can't help us,' added Kate.|$|R
6000|$|... "None; and I even {{ventured to}} appear in this fashion lest you should think so. I also wanted to thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. He will {{be thankful}} to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> him in hand. Poor boy, I know how {{attractive}} his penitence is, but I have quite left off building on it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good child! I like <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> your mother's part. Mamma {{has another}} merit, my dear. She {{is old enough}} to {{understand}} me better than you do. Go and fetch her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold! so much {{to redeem}} our promise--now for justice; we pay <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> a spy, but we punish <b>you</b> <b>for</b> burning, robbing, and murdering. Seize them, my lads, and give each of them the law of Moses--forty save one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep your money," [...] he said. [...] "I've {{got more}} than you to-day, I daresay. But thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> a little interest. That's worth more than money to a man that's down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think we}} ever would have {{hit it off}} together; and I can't help a fancy that, after all, he didn't blame me very much <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> own way in spite of him," [...] he said.

[...] "I do wish {{somebody}} would catch those two rascals, not only on your account but on my account also.

6000|$|... "One cannot do everything, and I'm not insatiable. I'm {{getting too}} old to stand the shaking in the hot and dusty cars, and I can't accustom myself to going to bed in public, without undressing. No doubt, it's a matter of prejudice, but I've been used to more room <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> clothes off than they give you behind the {{flapping}} curtain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't exaggerate that," [...] said Madame de Bellegarde, {{getting up}} and laying her hand upon her daughter's arm. [...] "You can't expect an honest old woman to thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> away her beautiful, only daughter." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Of course I have, and I'm {{very much}} obliged to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> {{me to the}} theatre," [...] I added. After all, perhaps I was misjudging him. What {{possible}} motive could he have for being my enemy? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{at least}} let <b>my</b> brother thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> his place--in rescuing me. It was so {{thoughtful}} in you to put off at once when you saw I was surrounded. I {{might have been in}} great danger." ...|$|R
