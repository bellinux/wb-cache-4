500|$|I {{felt sorry}} for him because he must really be stuck in the past. Not only has his music not evolved, but also homeboy is still obsessed with my wife, the same female that wouldn't let him get to second base from eight years ago. What type of grown ass man lies about getting with a chick? Only Slim Lamey! LOL! I’m putting this out there now. Marshall Mathers, you need to holler at me... Man to man, let’s meet up and deal with this like adults. So, Miss Marshall, I'm going to make you wish you never spoke my name and regret the ungodly things <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> my wife. Your legacy has now been tainted from this day forth! You will now be known as the rapper who lost to corny-ass Nick Cannon! ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1935 Gertrude Stein gave {{a series}} of talks in the United States that included, on January 12 and 13, a visit to Choate. Fortunately for {{literary}} posterity, her audience included both a stenographer and Dudley Fitts, critic, translator, and longtime teacher of Greek and Latin at Choate. Stein's public speaking style was extemporary, and Fitts recognized the permanent value of a stenographic transcript. After an exchange of letters, Stein authorized Fitts to oversee publication of her talk in The Choate Literary Magazine. On February 5, he sent her the page proofs, saying, [...] "I had to restore {{a great deal of}} the lecture from memory. I hope I didn't spoil anything. Sorry to have missed entirely what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the noun." [...] (Fitts's typescript and the Fitts-Stein correspondence are now at Yale.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On 26 January 2001, John Redwood MP accused Prime Minister Tony Blair [...] of prejudicing the {{independent}} {{inquiry into the}} Hinduja passport affair, after Blair declared that the Foreign Office minister Keith Vaz had not done [...] "anything wrong". [...] On the same day, Vaz told reporters that they would [...] "regret" [...] their behaviour once {{the facts of the}} case were revealed. [...] "Some of you are going to look very foolish when this report comes out. Some of the stuff <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Peter, and about others and me, you'll regret very much when the facts come out", he said. When asked why the passport application of one of the Hinduja brothers had been processed more quickly than normal, being processed and sanctioned in six months when the process can take up to two years, he replied, [...] "It is not unusual." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It doesn't much matter. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> some property you've got in diamonds, and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{once that}} <b>you</b> must {{go out to}} look after it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My position's {{much the}} same as Mr. Grant's--I can do without. After what <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the Sachem, I'll join you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Mr. Dowling," [...] {{put in the}} housekeeper. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> pie yesterday, when Master Ben should come. What of that?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh! my {{attendant}} knights! no, indeed; {{you gave}} me such very slight hope of success; besides, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> something <b>about</b> my not wanting them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The explosion! The strike!" [...] she exclaimed; {{suddenly}} enlightened. [...] "Now I remember! <b>You</b> <b>said</b> something <b>about</b> Hampton being nitro-glycerine--human nitro-glycerine. You predicted this strike." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were going}} into the law, weren't you?" [...] I asked. [...] "I {{remember}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> something <b>about</b> it that day we met at Beverly Farms." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "How did it happen, Maurie?" [...] asked Jones. [...] "I {{was with}} you {{most of the time}} and noticed nothing wrong. Besides, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what did}} you tell him in your answers? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> nothin' <b>about</b> our call down on the Spanish Main, the time you were left ashore, I hope, Jack?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I thought I was {{justified}} {{in making the}} promise after what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the pleasure {{it would be to}} help me. You remember, that day on the hilltop?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Fitzjocelyn,' said Isabel, {{when they}} were shut into a coupe, 'tell me what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> {{distress}} of mind. It has haunted me whether you used those words.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But--see here!" [...] cried Patsy; [...] "that's {{a dreadful}} mistake. That spoils all the nice things <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the girl, Louise. I hope the Sizers won't notice it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} been used to public speaking. You speak uncommonly well, though I don't agree with you. From what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> sentiment, I fancy you are a Panslavist." ...|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I was prodigiously {{delighted with}} what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the book--so, on the whole, I've {{concluded}} to publish intrepidly, instead of concealing the authorship. I shall leave out that bull story.|$|E
