Perhaps you are contemplating only {{a single}} new institution, which is to depend for its success, on {{yourself}} and some coadjutors whom <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> and whom you well know. If this is the case, consider whether the establishment you are contemplating can be carried on, after you shall have left it, by such men as can ordinarily be obtained. If the plan is founded on some peculiar notions of your own, which would enable you to succeed in it, when others, also interested in such a scheme, would probably fail, consider whether {{there may not be}} danger that your plan may be imitated by others, who cannot carry it into successful operation, so that it may be the indirect means of doing injury. A man is, in some degree, responsible for his example, and for the consequences which may indirectly flow from his course, {{as well as for the}} immediate results which he produces. The Fellenberg school at Hofwyl has perhaps, by its direct results, been as successful for a given time, as perhaps any other institution in the world; but there is a great offset to the good which it has thus done, to be found in the history of the thousand wretched imitations of it, which have been started only to linger a little while and die, and in which a vast amount of time, and talent, and money have been wasted.|$|E

Most activities are supported by textual or audio material and are there to stimulate your thinking in a given area. The purpose of this theme is to help you gain a general overview of the main approaches to research design. Although the theme comprises two main sections, one on quantitative research and the other on qualitative research, this is purely to guide your study. The two approaches may be viewed as being part of a continuum with many research studies now incorporating elements of both styles. Eventually you will need to choose a research approach or methodology that will be practical, relevant, appropriate, ethical, of good quality and effective for the research idea or question that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> ...|$|E

30|$|The {{question}} generation method {{proposed in}} this paper may have drawbacks due to using question templates. That is, the question templates can be very specific for a special domain as discussed in Sect.  3. We were aware of this problem and tried to define question templates which should be general enough for several discussion domains. For example, the question templates in Table 3 {{can be used to}} generate questions for the discussion topic “charity” by replacing the placeholder: (1) What is charity? (2) What do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> when you think about charity? (3) What does charity remind you of? These questions are appropriate for helping participants think about the topic when they have to discuss about charity. Whether all question templates are general enough for other discussion topics, this needs to be evaluated and is a part of our future work. Since the goal of our research is to support students during brainstorming argumentation activities, we also intend to conduct an empirical evaluation study for this purpose.|$|E

Research can be frustrating, but {{is also one of}} the most fun and exciting activities I know of. What can be better than exploring and creating the unknown? Structure: Over a semester you will explore a mutually agreed upon research topic and present deliverables, which will include a written paper. We will meet on a regular, at least weekly, basis. During the semester you will write weekly project reports. While the time you invest in the project will vary from week to week, expect to spend an average of at least 15 hours per week for a 3 credit graduate directed research project. Because much of the work is unstructured, you must take the initiative and be self motivated. Due dates and deliverables: Project Proposal: due 1 week after the start of the semester.
