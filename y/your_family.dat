25|$|Family {{history and}} ancestry are factors that {{increase}} the risk of beta thalassemia. Depending on <b>your</b> <b>family</b> history, if your parents or grandparents suffered from beta thalassemia there is a high probability of the mutated gene being inherited by an offspring. Even if a child does not have beta thalassemia major, they can still be a carrier resulting in future offspring having beta thalassemia. Another risk factor is because of certain ancestry. Beta thalassemia occurs most often in people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African ancestry.|$|E

25|$|Wally Terzinsky (Scott Thompson) is a husband, father, and closeted homosexual. Wally masturbates to gay pornography, frequents {{public bath}} houses, and was sexually active with men during his {{military}} service – but remains unaware of his sexual orientation. He is prescribed GLeeMONEX by a frustrated therapist, (Dave Foley) ("You're gay. I know it, <b>your</b> <b>family</b> knows it... dogs know it!"). His happiest memory is a homoerotic Army mission fantasized by Wally while being chewed out by his drill instructor (Mark McKinney). Wally finds himself standing considerably {{closer to his}} drill instructor when through fantasizing. Shortly after this, he finally admits (via song and dance) {{that he is in}} fact homosexual. The character is an obvious variation on the TV show's dimwitted Danny Husk (Kevin McDonald as his wife in both the movie and series).|$|E

God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E
25|$|In 1662 Frankland {{retired to}} his {{patrimony}} at Rathmell, {{where he lived}} some years in privacy. His children were baptised (1664 and 1668) at the parish church. At this period he did not {{join the ranks of}} the ‘conventicle’ preachers. Efforts were being made by the nonconformists of the north to secure the educational advantages offered for a short time by the Durham College. William Pell, who had been a fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and a tutor at Durham, declined to start an academical institution, holding himself precluded by his graduation oath from resuming collegiate lectures outside the ancient universities. Application was then successfully made to Frankland, who was not hindered by the same scruple. Nonconformist tutors usually understood the oath as referring to prelections in order to a degree. Before opening his ‘academy’ Frankland was in London, where he felt ‘a violent impulse upon his mind to go to the king.’ By the help of ‘the old Earl of Manchester, lord chamberleyne’ (Edward Montagu), he gained an audience while Charles {{was on his way to}} the council. Frankland, in the divine name, enjoined Charles ‘to reform your life, <b>your</b> <b>family,</b> your kingdom, and the church,’ adding an impressive warning. ‘“I will,” saith the king, “do what I can.”’ After a few more words ‘the king hasted away, saying, “I thank you, sir,” and twice looking back before he went into the counsel-chamber, said, “I thank you, sir; I thank you”’.|$|E
