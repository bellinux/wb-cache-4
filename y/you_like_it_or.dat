25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, whether <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

500|$|New York Dolls was {{released}} on July 27, 1973, in the United States and on October 19 in the United Kingdom. Its controversial cover featured the band dressed in exaggerated drag, including high wigs, messy make-up, high heels, and garters. The photo was used for shock value, and {{on the back of}} the album, the band is photographed in their usual stage wear. To announce the album's release, Mercury published an advertisement slogan that read [...] "Introducing The New York Dolls: A Band You're Gonna Like, Whether <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>Or</b> Not", while other ads called them [...] "The Band You Love to Hate".

500|$|Although Harding's first {{address to}} Congress called for passage of anti-lynching legislation, he {{initially}} seemed inclined to {{do no more}} for African Americans than Republican presidents of the recent past had; he asked cabinet officers to find places for blacks in their departments. Sinclair suggested {{that the fact that}} Harding received two-fifths of the Southern vote in 1920 led him to see political opportunity for his party in the Solid South. On October 26, 1921, Harding gave a speech in Birmingham, Alabama, to a segregated audience of 20,000 whites and 10,000 blacks. Harding, while stating that the social and racial differences between whites and blacks could not be bridged, urged equal political rights for the African American. Many African Americans at that time voted Republican, especially in the Democratic South, and Harding stated he did not mind seeing that support end if the result was a strong two-party system in the South. He was willing to see literacy tests for voting continue, if applied fairly to white and black. [...] "Whether <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not," [...] Harding told his segregated audience, [...] "unless our democracy is a lie, you must stand for that equality." [...] The white section of the audience listened in silence while the black section cheered.|$|E

Philip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, who said in May 1998 the South Park phenomenon was [...] "dead", described the April Fools' prank as [...] "lamentable" [...] {{and part of the}} reason for the show's apparent decline. Others, however, praised Parker and Stone for making the move at the risk of upsetting fans. Tim Clodfelter of the Winston-Salem Journal said, [...] "It was a funny, clever move [...] quickly separated the fans who truly [...] "got" [...] humor from those who were just watching for the dirty jokes." [...] Jon Casimir of The Sydney Morning Herald said, [...] "It is gratifying, in an entertainment world dominated by market research and common denominators, to see a program that obviously doesn't care if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not."

It was not an inn and not a farm-house, strictly speaking, nor was it altogether a shop, {{although there was a}} [...] "store" [...] attached. If the traveller is anxious to obtain accommodation for man and beast at a place of this stamp he has to proceed warily, so to say, lest he should be requested to move on.

There is no such dreadful autocrat as your half-and-half innkeeper in South Africa, and then he is so completely master of the situation.

To begin with, he knew the owners of the place, who were very civil people if approached in a humble spirit, and, furthermore, he found everybody in such a state of unpleasurable excitement that they were only too glad to get another Englishman with whom to talk over matters. Not that their information amounted to much, however. There was a rumour of the Bronker's Spruit disaster and other rumours of the investment of Pretoria, and of the advance of large bodies of Boers to take possession of the pass over the Drakensberg, known as Laing's Nek, but there was no definite intelligence.|$|R

2500|$|Swervedriver {{appeared}} to rebound when they signed a three-album deal with DGC Records (a subsidiary of Geffen Records) in early 1996. Originally, the first album {{in the deal}} was to be an American release of Ejector Seat Reservation; the band had attempted to talk A into relinquishing them the rights, but after news of their talks with Geffen was publicized on the Internet, A had come back with an exorbitant price for its sale (to avoid the same missed opportunity after previously dropped Soul Asylum hit it big with 1992's Grave Dancers Union). With their advance, they finished building their own recording studio, Bad Earth in Farringdon, and instead began work on a new record for the label. Over the next year, the group would record 99th Dream with Moulder at the helm, this time taking a more simple, laid-back approach than with previous productions. They scaled back from 48-track to 24-track recording, condensing the layering of guitar in the process, and employed more full-ensemble straight live track, partly with the mindset of {{making it easier to}} play the guitar lines live. During that time, the band also put out a pair of self-produced boutique label seven-inch singles, including the double split [...] "Why Say Yeah" [...] with indie collaboration act Sophia. DGC distributed promotional copies of the album and scheduled a release date of 7 May 1997. Meanwhile, in December 1996 Swervedriver went back into the studio and re-recorded the album track [...] "These Times," [...] citing their growing dislike for the original's faster-paced, Oasis-like sound and a bad experience with one of the label's reps during mixing. Three and a half weeks before 99th Dream was due to be released, DGC dismissed the band's A representative, Jody Kurilla, in a corporate downsizing and three hours later terminated their contract (though they would not impede the record's future release). Considering the recent break with their third label in two years, Hindmarsh stated, [...] "Someone from A once told us that it takes four or five listens to a Swervedriver album to see whether <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not, and in this marketplace, unless you can hit immediately it's not going to register with people." ...|$|E

But they knew {{what was expected of}} them. [...] "We wrote a song that would sound good with a big production, and an overdub of strings that would sound good coming out of movie-theater speakers," [...] Fagen says in Reelin' in the Years, Brian Sweet's 2007 history of the band.

6000|$|A {{great many}} people run down jealousy, on the score {{that it is an}} {{artificial}} feeling, as well as practically inconvenient. This is scarcely fair; for the feeling on which <b>it</b> merely attends, <b>like</b> an ill-humoured courtier, is itself artificial in exactly the same sense and to the same degree. [...] I suppose what is meant by that objection is that jealousy has not always been a character of man; formed no part of that very modest kit of sentiments with which he is supposed to have begun the world: but waited to make its appearance in better days and among richer natures. And this is equally true of love, and friendship, and love of country, and delight in what they call the beauties of nature, and most other things worth having. Love, in particular, will not endure any historical scrutiny: to all who have fallen across it, {{it is one of the}} most incontestable facts in the world; but if you begin to ask what it was in other periods and countries, in Greece for instance, the strangest doubts begin to spring up, and everything seems so vague and changing that a dream is logical in comparison. Jealousy, at any rate, is one of the consequences of love; <b>you</b> may <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not, at pleasure; but there it is.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{aspects of}} the song make it notable among the band's work. It {{was the first time}} Becker and Fagen had written music for a film since 1971's You've Got to Walk <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> Talk <b>It</b> <b>or</b> You'll Lose That Beat, a year before Steely Dan {{released}} its debut album. It also features a string section arranged and conducted by Johnny Mandel, only the second time the band had used strings in a song. Lastly, it is the only time that Becker (bass and guitar) and Fagen (piano) have handled most of a song's instrumental work themselves. Engineer Roger Nichols won that year's Grammy Award for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for his work on [...] "FM", the only time that award was ever given for a single song.|$|R
