Once the song demo had been finished, Hooper and Marius De Vries rearranged the track and the final version was called [...] "Bedtime Story", which became the album's third single.

Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career, but there is something... to be said for getting to stay home every day with <b>your</b> <b>kids,</b> and you don't want anyone else to be better at it than you are. Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family.

500|$|Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene, {{the main}} villain. He {{is a leading}} member of Quantum posing as a {{businessman}} working in reforestation and charity funding for environmental science.

Amalric acknowledged taking the role was an easy decision because, [...] "It's impossible to say to <b>your</b> <b>kids</b> that 'I could have been in a Bond film but I refused.'" [...] Amalric wanted to wear make-up for the role, but Forster explained that he wanted Greene not to look grotesque, but to symbolise the hidden evils in society. Amalric modelled his performance on [...] "the smile of Tony Blair [...] the craziness of Sarkozy," [...] the latter of whom he called [...] "the worst villain we [...] have ever had... he walks around thinking he's in a Bond film." [...] He later claimed this was not criticism of either politician, but rather an example of how a politician relies on performance instead of a genuine policy to win power. [...] "Sarkozy, is just a better actor than [...] Ségolène Royal—that's all," [...] he explained. Amalric and Forster reconceived the character, who was supposed to have a [...] "special skill" [...] in the script, to someone who uses pure animal instinct when fighting Bond in the climax. Bruno Ganz was also considered for the part, but Forster decided Amalric gave the character a [...] "pitiful" [...] quality.|$|E

[...] Cyrus was inspired to write [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] by her deceased fish, Lyric and Melody, who died when Cyrus was eleven years of age. She said the topic drifted drastically once she began writing.
