500|$|In early 2009, Leto told Billboard that he {{was excited}} by the song {{as soon as he}} wrote it. He said, [...] "I had written a verse right as we were going to the airport—I {{literally}} almost missed the flight because I picked up the guitar and this song came out. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> moment of discovery that's exciting." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The {{whole idea}} is that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> nostalgic night out, so people who are older can listen to it too. None of us are naive enough not to know what kids do. It’s {{important}} not to patronise the youth of today, we’re not gonna be writing about ‘oh let’s just hold hands for a while’ you know? They need their music to connect. A lot of songs are about sex {{and you have to}} be realistic about it." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2008, Seyfried {{was cast}} as Anita [...] "Needy" [...] Lesnicki, the [...] "plain Jane" [...] best friend to Fox's {{character}} {{with whom she}} shares a somewhat lesbian infatuation. Seyfried {{said it was a}} relief to play the nerdy character opposite Fox. [...] "Being a lead (like Megan), <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> weird pressure of feeling like you have to look attractive," [...] she stated. [...] "In this movie, I didn't worry about any of that [...] I don't want to play the one that everybody is supposed to want to have sex with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] said Lord Glenvarloch. [...] "And, pray, what dream <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> {{deprived}} me of {{your good}} opinion; for that, I think, seems {{the moral of}} the matter?" ...|$|R

500|$|In 2012, {{longtime}} Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich {{said of the}} song: [...] "We {{tried to}} record it countless times, but it never worked. The irony is <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> shitty live version [...] To Thom's credit, he needs to feel a song has validation, {{that it has a}} reason to exist as a recording. We could do 'True Love Waits' and make it sound like John Mayer. Nobody wants to do that." [...] In 2016, more than 21 years after its debut, [...] "True Love Waits" [...] was finally released as the last track on Radiohead's ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, rearranged as a minimal piano ballad.|$|E
500|$|Christian Louboutin {{said that}} he would {{dedicate}} his time to creating some [...] "scene-stealing designs for the single's video", out of his appreciation for the song. According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house." ...|$|E
500|$|Weinberg {{played on}} {{only a couple}} of tracks on Springsteen's March 2012 album Wrecking Ball, but resumed his normal role with the E Street Band on the {{subsequent}} 2012–2013 Wrecking Ball Tour, this time augmented by percussionist Everett Bradley, as well as on its 2014 continuation, the High Hopes Tour. In 2014, Weinberg was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame {{as a member of the}} E Street Band. He said of the honor, [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> trophy in your hands, I've never experienced anything like that. ... You're walking around with this big heavy symbolic recognition of the work you've done." [...] Meanwhile, he continued to play in a jazz idiom on his own, now with the Max Weinberg Quintet. In late October 2014, Weinberg sat in for a surprise guest appearance on Conan. In early 2015, Weinberg received the Humanitarian of the Year Award from Temple Rodeph Torah in Marlboro, New Jersey, in recognition of his volunteering in association with multiple local groups; he said he was humbled to be accepting an award that focused on tikkun olam.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> much sense, <b>you</b> young Rip," [...] groaned poor Coppy, half amused {{and half}} angry. [...] "And {{how many people}} may <b>you</b> <b>have</b> told about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he {{answered}} hoarsely. [...] "I remember {{it very well}} indeed. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> the look in your eyes to-night which <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> day, {{the look of a}} frightened child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I never figured <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> many, and I don't quite see how <b>you</b> could <b>have</b> {{let them}} get away from you here. Something <b>you</b> didn't expect <b>has</b> happened?" ...|$|R
500|$|Jon Hamm {{was cast}} as Don Draper, the central {{character}} of the series. Hamm, who was relatively unknown at the time, competed with 80 other actors in the auditioning process. Weiner proclaimed that Hamm accurately portrayed the character, {{saying that he was}} [...] "the only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence. Both Don and Jon have an inner life. So long as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> kind of depth in a human being, people will root for him [...] Jon {{walked out of the room}} and I said, 'That guy has lived.'" [...] Hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed Thomas Jane would acquire the role. [...] "I started, literally, on the very, very bottom," [...] he iterated. [...] "I couldn't have had less heat on me. Nobody knew who I was. The casting directors didn't know who I was. I wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television." [...] Hamm went through seven auditions; his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. [...] "When we were riding down on the elevator, the woman in charge of whatever the decision-making process was told me, 'You got the job.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There {{was nothing}} done {{in there to}} stop anyone from asking questions", Fishman said. [...] "It's {{important}} that, when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> {{many people in the}} room who may not be familiar with the Israeli–Palestinian situation, those people have the opportunity also to hear those areas that are questionable in the book." ...|$|E
2500|$|I have at Oxnead {{seen this}} salt change black as ink, I must, at the lowest, [...] have an {{excellent}} aurum potable, and if the signs we are to judge in Sendivogius’ description be true, I have the key which answers to what he says, that if a man has that which will disolve gold as warm water doth ice, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> which gold was first made in the earth.|$|E
60|$|I <b>have</b> {{countermanded}} <b>that</b> face. Maclise <b>has</b> {{made another}} face of me, which all people say is astonishing. The engraving {{will be ready}} soon, and I would rather <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>that,</b> as I am sure you would if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> seen it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} congratulated me upon my escape," [...] he began, breezily. [...] "But <b>you</b> must <b>have</b> been dead-tired last night. I know I was. And <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> hard {{pull on the}} river besides." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so. I {{thought there}} always had been. I am sure, mamma, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> known <b>that</b> I <b>have</b> never liked Captain Scarborough {{so as to}} become his wife, and I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> known <b>that</b> I <b>have</b> liked Harry Annesley." ...|$|R
2500|$|We heard {{something}} was wrong with my dad during the [...] World Cup. He started feeling unwell and then, out of the blue, we were told he only had a few months to live. It was a huge shock because we've always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It {{gave me a chance to}} say thank you and goodbye. After a while I realised how lucky I was to do that. It's far harder if a parent is taken away before <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me. It's just a game – and a very simple game if you keep your mind straight.|$|E
2500|$|NBC {{executive}} Warren Littlefield said in July 1994 {{that the}} network would probably never air the pilot if Simpson were convicted; if he were acquitted, however, one television journalist speculated that [...] "Frogmen would probably {{be on the air}} before the NBC peacock could unfurl its plume". Most pilots that are two hours long are aired as TV movies {{whether or not they are}} ordered as series. Because—as the Los Angeles Times later reported—"the appetite for all things O.J. appeared insatiable" [...] during the trial, Warner Bros. and NBC estimated that a gigantic, Super Bowl-like television audience would have watched the Frogmen film. One of Simpson's co-stars in the film commented that the studio's decision not to air it or even release it on home video, and forego an estimated $14million in profits, was [...] "just about the only proof <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> there is some dignity in the advertising and television business".|$|E
2500|$|Leonard Woolf {{wrote about}} Sackville-West, who, as an aristocrat, {{came from a}} very {{different}} world than {{he and his wife}} : [...] "She [...] belonged indeed to a world which was completely different from ours, and the long line of Sackvilles, Dorsets, Da La Warrs and Knole with its 365 rooms had put into her mind and heart an ingredient which was alien to us and at first made intimacy difficult". While Sackville-West was visiting Nicholson in Tehran, Woolf wrote to her: [...] "Then there's my character (you see how egoistical I am, for I only answer questions that are about myself), I agree with the lack of jolly vulgarity. But then think about how I was brought up! No school, mooning about alone among my father's books, never a chance to pick up all that goes on in the schools-throwing balls: ragging: slang: vulgarity: scenes: jealousies: only rages with my half brothers and being walked off my legs round the Serpentine by my father". In her reply, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "But indeed, my upbringing wasn't so different from yours: I move about too, at Knole mostly, and haven't had a brother or sister to knock the corners off me. And I never went to school. If I am jolly and vulgar, you can cry quits on another count, for <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> interest in humanity which I can never manage-at least I have the interest, but not the diabolical skill in its practice which is yours. As I get older...I get more and more disagreeably solitary". Besides for having similar childhoods, both women had grown up with a profound sense of the weight of English history as Woolf's father Sir Leslie Stephen had been a leading contributor to The Dictionary of National Biography while Sackville-West had grown up at Knole House, one of the grand country houses of England. Likewise, Sackville-West had felt torn between her Spanish heritage which contrasted with the English grandeur she had been brought up in at Knole House while Woolf felt torn between the [...] "sobriety" [...] of her father's family vs. the [...] "flamboyance" [...] of her mother's family.|$|E
