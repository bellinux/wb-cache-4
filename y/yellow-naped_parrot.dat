50|$|Other avian {{species that}} have been {{affected}} by this disease are pigeons, chukar partridges, quail, ducks, geese, pheasants, psittacine birds, and peafowl. Most songbirds are resistant except for the wild house finches and some similar species in North America. Some exotic birds infected by this disease include greater flamingos, wild peregrine falcons in Spain, and <b>yellow-naped</b> Amazon <b>parrots.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because {{they are}} highly sought after as pets, and because {{trapping}} of wild birds, which is now illegal, {{there has been a}} population decline. This has made them difficult to find. Panama amazons are extremely playful, can be excellent talkers, and tend to be loud at times; much like (nominate) yellow-crowned, double yellow-headed, and <b>yellow-naped</b> amazon <b>parrots.</b> Though their body-language is the same, Panama amazons are much less likely to become physically aggressive. Many other amazon parrots are erroneously sold as Panama amazons, because of their scarcity and popularity.|$|R
