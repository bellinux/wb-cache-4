In this debut story, Fritz brings a young female cat home and strips all her clothes off before getting {{on top of}} her to pick fleas off of her. Preceding the publication of the story, Kurtzman sent Crumb a letter which read, [...] "Dear R. Crumb, we think the little pussycat drawings <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> us were just great. Question is, how do we print them without going to jail?" ...|$|E
500|$|Some UN {{aid workers}} {{immediately}} criticized the operation, arguing that very sick children were poorly served by programmes that obliged them to travel hundreds of miles. They argued, too, that with costs of around £100,000 per evacuated child the programme was devouring funds {{that could have}} been used to improve local facilities and treatment. The head of Kosevo Hospital's plastic surgery department said [...] "It would be much better if <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> the tools to do our jobs properly than for you to make a big show of a few token evacuations." [...] Countering this, A.D. Redmond of the Overseas Development Administration (the predecessor to the Department for International Development) wrote in November 1993 to the British Medical Journal: ...|$|E

[...] Later, while MacLeod trains Richie roughly so that he can face Immortal Annie Devlin (Sheena Easton), Richie angrily tells MacLeod, [...] "You can't get past it, Mac. I know. You've seen a lot of people die. But you had to be the hero, <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> us out to the car that night, you could have been there ...You look me in the eyes and you tell me you don't blame yourself for her death."

500|$|Hunter {{participated in}} the November 28, 2007 CNN/YouTube GOP Debate, and notably, {{received}} {{a question about the}} military's [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy. The questioner, former Brig. Gen. Keith Kerr introduced himself as a homosexual and asked [...] "...why you [...] think that American {{men and women in uniform}} are not professional enough to serve with gays and lesbians?" [...] Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was [...] "unit cohesion," [...] mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the debate, Kerr was found to be a member of Hillary Clinton's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee. Because of this, CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts. The next day, Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read: [...] "Dear Hillary Clinton, Regarding the [...] "plant", retired Brig. Gen. Keith H. Kerr, that <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> to ask me the question at the CNN-YouTube debate last night in Florida. Send more!!! Merry Christmas, Duncan Hunter." [...] The Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to the letter.|$|E
500|$|Willis {{arbitrarily}} {{refused to}} print {{the work of}} his sister Sara Willis ("Fanny Fern") after 1854, though she previously had contributed anonymous book reviews to the Home Journal. She had recently been widowed, became destitute, and was publicly denounced by her abusive second husband. Criticizing what he perceived as her restlessness, Willis once made her the subject of his poem [...] "To My Wild Sis". [...] As Fanny Fern, she had published Fern Leaves, which sold over 100,000 copies the year before. Willis, however, did not encourage his sister's writings. [...] "You overstrain the pathetic, and your humor runs into dreadful vulgarity sometimes... I am sorry that any editor knows that a sister of mine wrote some of these which <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> me", he wrote. In 1854 she published Ruth Hall, a Domestic Tale of the Present Time, a barely concealed semi-autobiographical account of her own difficulties in the literary world. Nathaniel Willis was represented as [...] "Hyacinth Ellet", an effeminate, self-serving editor who schemes to ruin his sister's prospects as a writer. Willis did not publicly protest but in private he asserted that, despite his fictitious equivalent, he had done his best to support his sister during her difficult times, especially after the death of her first husband.|$|E
500|$|Letters between Nicholas and Jefferson {{indicate}} a different series of events. In a letter dated October 4, 1798, Nicholas informed Jefferson {{that he had}} given [...] "a copy of the resolutions <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> me" [...] to Breckinridge, who would introduce them in Kentucky. The letter also indicated {{that this was a}} deviation from the original plan to deliver the draft to a legislator in North Carolina for introduction in the legislature there. Nicholas felt that recipient was too closely associated with Jefferson, risking his being discovered as the resolutions' author. According to Nicholas, Breckinridge wanted to discuss the draft with Jefferson, but Nicholas advised against the meeting, fearing it could implicate Jefferson. A subsequent letter from Jefferson expressed his approval of Nicholas' actions. Lowell Harrison notes that after Breckinridge left Virginia, his contacts with Jefferson were few until his election to the Senate in 1801. Harrison considered it unlikely that Jefferson was mistaken about a meeting between the two to discuss a matter as important as the resolutions, positing that Jefferson may have met separately with Breckinridge and Nicholas to discuss the resolutions, and that the meeting with Breckinridge was kept secret from Nicholas. Because of the uncertainty surrounding Breckinridge's activities in Virginia in 1798, the extent of his influence on Jefferson's original draft of the resolutions is unknown.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} {{process of}} the album eventually lasted from January to August 2003, with an additional mixing and mastering period lasting until October. Previous Blink-182 sessions were recorded in three months. The band stated that being in a studio longer than three months gave them the luxury of experimenting with different methods of writing, playing, and recording. The band built each song with a minute attention to detail. Hoppus described the studio as a [...] "musical laboratory": over 70 guitars, 30 amps, [...] "30 or 40" [...] different snare drums, up to six drum kits, various keyboards, turntables, and pianos {{were used in the}} album's production, a lot of which came from Finn's personal collection. Barker was responsible for the turntables and a copy of Pink Floyd's The Wall. The group also enlisted the help of James Guthrie, an engineer behind The Wall. The trio also sent The Cure frontman Robert Smith the bed track of [...] "All of This" [...] in hopes he would contribute; Smith makes a guest appearance and recorded his parts in England. The three initially believed their legitimacy would be in question due to the humor-oriented nature of their earlier recordings, to which Smith responded, [...] "Nobody knows what kind of songs you are going to write in the future and nobody knows the full potential of any band. I really like the music <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> me." [...] The band also collaborated with DJ Shadow and Dan the Automator, and Barker desired to work with The Neptunes. Jerry Finn, who had produced the previous two Blink-182 albums and the Box Car Racer album, returned to produce Blink-182, which would be his final contribution with the band.|$|E

2500|$|While he was {{attempting}} to get Verdi involved a new opera, in May 1879 Ricordi also tried to engage the composer in revising Simon Boccanegra. This suggestion, originally expressed ten years before but ignored, was once again shrugged off by Verdi, who sent a note saying that the 1857 score, which {{had been sent to}} the composer for review, would remain untouched [...] "just as <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> it to me".|$|E

In 1874, Muybridge {{discovered}} that a drama critic known as Major Harry Larkyns might have fathered Flora's seven-month-old son Florado. On 17 October, Muybridge went to Calistoga to track down Larkyns. Upon finding him, Muybridge said, [...] "Good evening, Major, my name is Muybridge and here's {{the answer to the}} letter <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> my wife", and shot him point-blank.

Afterward, they became engaged with the Union XII Corps. In the evening after the battle, Gen. Lee asked Hood where his division was. He responded, [...] "They are lying on the field where <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> them. My division has been almost wiped out." [...] Of his 2,000 men, almost 1,000 were casualties. Jackson was impressed with Hood's performance and recommended his promotion to major general, which occurred effective October 10, 1862.|$|E
2500|$|In 1868, Giulio Ricordi {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} revisions to Boccanegra; the idea was again broached ten years later, early in 1879, but was shrugged off by Verdi with a note saying that the 1857 score, which {{had been sent to}} the composer for review, would remain untouched [...] "just as <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> it to me". Persisting with further attempts to convince the composer, Ricordi had also broached the idea of a collaboration with Arrigo Boito for a new opera based on Shakespeare's Othello. Musicologist Roger Parker speculates that Verdi's final agreement to revise Boccanegra was based on a desire to [...] "test the possibility" [...] of working with Boito before possibly embarking on the larger project.|$|E

2500|$|I had {{the honor}} to be Archbishop Elko's {{assistant}} for 3 years. He was a true son of Mary and loved our Lord and lived the life. In the last 2 years I was with him, we created a mission project entitled: [...] "ROSARIES AROUND THE WORLD". We shipped to over 40 countries {{and a total of}} over 1,000,000 Rosaries and Scapulars. They went from St. Mother Teresa to Fr. Malachy Brogan, OFM. He wrote me once saying: [...] "Jim, the Rosaries <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> are now found {{in the hands of the}} praying, the dying and the dead." [...] This was funded in total by the good Archbishop's brother and blessed by Archbishop Elko and St. Pope John Paul II.|$|E
2500|$|Other gifts {{were also}} given to his neighbours. Among these was one to Chartres, of which its bishop wrote: [...] "When {{we saw the}} gift that <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> us, we were amazed at your {{knowledge}} {{as well as your}} faith… since you, whom we had heard to be a pagan prince, we now know to be not only a Christian, but also a most generous donor to God's churches and servants". He is known to have sent a psalter and sacramentary made in Peterborough (famous for its illustrations) to Cologne, and a book written in gold, among other gifts, to William the Great of Aquitaine. This golden book was apparently to support Aquitanian claims of St Martial, patron saint of Aquitaine, as an apostle. Of some consequence, its recipient was an avid artisan, scholar and devout Christian, and the Abbey of Saint-Martial was a great library and scriptorium, second only to the one at Cluny. It is likely that Cnut's gifts were well beyond anything we can now know.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Leslie Moore on Tumblr, Cainon Lamb recalled how he started working on the Boyz II Men's sample and how his work reached Knowles. He said that he began working on [...] "Countdown" [...] during the night preceding the 2010 BET Awards. He was in the studio, listening to Boyz II Men's song, [...] "Uhh Ahh". He commented: [...] " [...] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that could be something. Just the countdown itself.'" [...] Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some snare drum taps to it, and started a beat. After that, he sent the song to his publisher, EMI Music. The latter {{was impressed with the}} instrumental and went on saying: [...] "I had a meeting this morning with Beyoncé and I played a couple other songs I had and she wasn't really feeling them. When I played the beat that <b>you</b> <b>sent</b> me, you should have seen how she went crazy! She started dancing and bouncing up and down and just doing all kind of stuff. She loved that beat!" [...] On the request of his publisher, Lamb made [...] "a female version of the countdown part". Terius Nash wrote the verses and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.|$|E
