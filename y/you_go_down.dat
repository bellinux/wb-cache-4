500|$|Musically, [...] "Right Round" [...] {{uses the}} {{recurring}} pop rap themes of Flo Rida's music; specifically, similarities were noted between {{the song and}} [...] "Low" [...] (2007), with Allmusic reviewer David Jeffries calling [...] "Right Round" [...] its [...] "heir apparent". The song is [...] "" [...] and [...] "bass-heavy", according to Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly. The lyrics discuss being in a strip club with friends and tossing money at a woman performing a striptease. Additionally, the chorus line [...] "You spin my head right round, right round / When <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> down" [...] {{can be interpreted as}} a reference to fellatio. Bruno Mars, co-writer of the song confirmed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that the song's chorus was referring to oral sex. Philip Lawrence, also co-writer, confessed the song was [...] "almost something we had accidentally written in the car one night just hanging out." [...] It was him, Bruno Mars, and Aaron Bay-Schuck. Bay-Schuck was playing to Bruno and Philip some tracks and wanted {{to come up with something}} big for Flo Rida, and they were just throwing out 80's ideas. The song's sexual themes have been compared to those of [...] "If U Seek Amy" [...] (2009) by Britney Spears.|$|E

2500|$|... he Elo {{equivalent}} of a given handicap degrades as <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the scale. A knight seems to be worth around a thousand points when the [...] "weak" [...] player is around IM level, but it drops as <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>down.</b> For example, I'm about 2400 and I've played tons of knight odds games with students, and I would put the break-even point (for untimed but reasonably quick games) with me at around 1800, so maybe a 600 value at this level. An 1800 can probably give knight odds to a 1400, a 1400 to an 1100, an 1100 to a 900, etc. This is pretty obviously the way it must work, because the weaker the players are, the more likely the weaker one is to blunder a piece or more. When {{you get down to}} the level of the average 8 year old player, knight odds is just a slight edge, maybe 50 points or so.|$|E

2500|$|We {{seized the}} entire {{records of the}} Iraqi Nuclear program, {{especially}} the administrative records. We got a name of everybody, where they worked, what they did, {{and the top of}} the list, Saddam's [...] "Bombmaker" [...] was a man named Jafar Dhia Jafar, not Khidir Hamza, and if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the list of the senior administrative personnel you will not find Hamza's name in there. In fact, we didn't find his name at all. Because in 1990, he didn't work for the Iraqi Nuclear Program. He had no knowledge of it because he worked as a kickback specialist for Hussein Kamel in the Presidential Palace.|$|E
2500|$|In 1927, {{after the}} Mississippi floods had left {{half a million}} people homeless, Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe {{recorded}} [...] "When the Levee Breaks"; they sang, [...] "Oh crying won't help you, praying won't do no good/When the levee breaks, mama you got to move". A 1975 reviewer wrote that [...] "Dylan's song repeated these images, but ... added the Biblical notion that the flood was retribution for some past sin: 'Now it's sugar for sugar and salt for salt/If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> in the flood it's gonna be your fault'." [...] These lines are adapted from [...] "James Alley Blues" [...] by Richard [...] "Rabbit" [...] Brown—a song Dylan would have heard on Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music.|$|E
2500|$|Honey, the way {{you play}} guitar makes me feel so... makes me feel so...masochistic. The way <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> low deep into the neck... and I would do anything... and I would do anything. And Patty Hearst, you {{standing}} {{there in front of}} the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread. I was wondering: were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women? Or were you really dead? And now that you're on the run, what goes on in your mind? Your sisters they sit by the window. You know, your mama does sit and cry. And your daddy—well, you know what your daddy said Patty. You know what your daddy said, Patty? He said... he said... he said.... "Well, sixty days ago she was such a lovely child. Now here she is, with a gun in her hand." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike a stock market, {{the foreign}} {{exchange}} market is divided into levels of access. At the top is the interbank {{foreign exchange market}}, which {{is made up of}} the largest commercial banks and securities dealers. Within the interbank market, spreads, which are the difference between the bid and ask prices, are razor sharp and not known to players outside the inner circle. The difference between the bid and ask prices widens (for example from 0 to 1 pip to 1–2 pips for currencies such as the EUR) as <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the levels of access. This is due to volume. If a trader can guarantee large numbers of transactions for large amounts, they can demand a smaller difference between the bid and ask price, which is referred to as a better spread. The levels of access that make up the foreign exchange market are determined {{by the size of the}} [...] "line" [...] (the amount of money with which they are trading). The top-tier interbank market accounts for 51% of all transactions. From there, smaller banks, followed by large multi-national corporations (which need to hedge risk and pay employees in different countries), large hedge funds, and even some of the retail market makers. According to Galati and Melvin, “Pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, and other institutional investors have played an increasingly important role in financial markets in general, and in FX markets in particular, since the early 2000s.” (2004) In addition, he notes, “Hedge funds have grown markedly over the 2001–2004 period in terms of both number and overall size”. Central banks also participate in the foreign exchange market to align currencies to their economic needs.|$|E
2500|$|GM (Genetically modified) grains are {{not allowed}} in South Australia, where some grain {{producers}} have called for the moratorium to be lifted. [...] They argue the GM technology would help them tackle weeds and other pests, and that farmers {{should be able to}} choose how they run their enterprises {{and whether or not they}} wanted to grow the 'premium products' described by Leon Bignell, the South Australian (SA) Agriculture Minister. Producers have also said their GM-free grain is not translating to higher profits. Bignell conceded more work needed to be done to market produce as GM-free but said he was confident producers would see higher financial returns in the near future. [...] In March 2015, Bignell told farmers they should not use GM but should instead rely upon what he called [...] 'God's gifts'. [...] He said the [...] "amazing" [...] results of the Government's 'New Horizons' [...] soil improvement program [...] "prove," [...] in his view, that grain producers [...] "do not need genetic modification technology." [...] He said that [...] "Instead of using the top five centimetres of the soil, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to 50cm or even deeper. You put clay in it when it's needed, you put organic matter where it's needed as well." [...] Bignell said the trials had strengthened his view that South Australia should maintain a moratorium on GM technology, which he said gave the state's produce a [...] "market edge". [...] Bignell also said he believed results of the New Horizons program could be replicated in all grain growing areas of the state. Bignell added that [...] "If you look at GM and the promises around increases of about seven per cent in yields, why would you go for seven per cent when you can get 50 to 100 per cent increases in yield without having to use genetically modified seeds?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I thought {{these things}} were more exact and regular," [...] said she; [...] "I {{supposed}} if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> a mile in one place, you would find it as hot as you would in another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no," [...] he agreed; [...] "you {{are pretty}} closely packed. You had better pull that muffler over your ears more. It was rather {{different}} weather when <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to Canterbury in the summer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--don't <b>you</b> see?--if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> {{there as}} a friend of mine and were caught {{stealing}} the scarab, there would be just the trouble father wants to avoid--about my engagement, you see, and so on." ...|$|R

6000|$|But no. A {{minute later}} I caught their words once more. The {{stranger}} himself was speaking this time. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> and told Maloka exactly {{when and where}} to expect her?" [...] he asked seriously.|$|R
6000|$|... "But weren't {{you scared}} when she dropped? <b>You</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> {{so far that}} the fence plumb hid you. Couldn't see you at all. Ugh! Sure thought the wind had you. Weren't you scared then? You don't look it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; and I'd have outrun you easily, {{even with}} your horse to help you," [...] she said proudly, [...] "only I turned back when <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> into that prospector's hole with your horse and his broken neck atop of you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What do you say, Dan? It {{would be}} {{pleasant}} enough for you. You {{have not seen}} the place for a good many years now, and you might have a famous run with the harriers if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> next week," [...] said Sir Hugo.|$|R
6000|$|... "Contrairywise," [...] he continued, [...] "if {{the air was}} {{all took}} out of your inside an' allowed to remain on your outside, you'd go squash {{together}} like a collapsed indyrubber ball.
