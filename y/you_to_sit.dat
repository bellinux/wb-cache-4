2500|$|The Katherine Dunham Company toured {{throughout}} North America in the mid-1940s, even {{performing in}} the then-segregated South, where Dunham once refused {{to hold a}} show after finding out that the city's black residents had not been allowed to buy tickets for the performance. On another occasion, in October 1944, after getting a rousing standing ovation in Louisville, Kentucky, she told the all-white audience {{that she and her}} company would not return because [...] "your management will not allow people like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> next to people like us", and she expressed a hope that time and the [...] "war for tolerance and democracy" [...] would bring a change. One historian noted that [...] "during the course of the tour, Dunham and the troupe had recurrent problems with racial discrimination, leading her to a posture of militancy which was to characterize her subsequent career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wesley was {{initially}} {{designed to be}} a foil for the character of Rupert Giles. Actor Alexis Denisof comments that Wesley and Giles come from very similar backgrounds, but have gone in different directions [...] "with the tools that they had"; he was conceived as a [...] "nemesis" [...] for Giles and Buffy. Co-executive producer Doug Petrie, who wrote Wesley's first episode [...] "Bad Girls", explains, [...] "The way Faith is a reflection of Buffy, Wesley takes up a lot of the space that Giles traditionally occupies." [...] He elaborates that, because Giles is usually the [...] "stuffy guy from England who tells <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up straight and obey the rules", introducing Wesley, who embodies those traits [...] "to the nth degree", allows Giles to become [...] "subversive" [...] and [...] "cool". Writer Jane Espenson claims that the character was intended for viewers to have antipathy towards, since he was trying to undermine Giles.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am not {{surprised}} then, that <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> together,--though, <b>to</b> tell the truth, that is rather {{a reason why}} I should separate you." ...|$|R
6000|$|When he next spoke, there was, however, {{no hint of}} altruistic {{sentiment}} in his curt inquiry: [...] "Are <b>you</b> going <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> there until <b>you</b> freeze?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She roused {{herself to}} her duties as nurse. [...] "What are you doing? Why are <b>you</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up? Sit down! Don't touch your bandages. I told <b>you</b> not <b>to</b> talk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Therefore {{you will}} own that I am right in asking <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down. The story {{may be very}} long,--that is, if {{you mean to tell}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no such {{plenty of}} good cheer in your country, my good friend," [...] I replied, [...] "as to tempt <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> so late at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O Macumazana, {{before you}} leave us I wish {{to speak with you}} on a certain matter. Will it please <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> aside with me for a while?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Would <b>you</b> prefer <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> there? We {{can carry}} out this little table, and put the lamp on it. There is just room for three chairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|Soon {{afterward}} {{they went}} to his mother's room, and once safely inside the door he turned upon her. [...] "Mother, are <b>you</b> going <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> for Pettus to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Julian," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "you {{look like}} a ghost! Don't tell me that <b>you</b> had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up all night to shoot those wretched duck?" ...|$|R
6000|$|CHARTERIS (rising). As a favour to me, dearest, {{change the}} subject. Come {{away from the}} piano: I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> here with me. (Takes a step towards her.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I forbid <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{down in his}} house," [...] said Danville, {{advancing}} still; [...] "I order you to {{come back}} with me! Do you hear? I order you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it any use to ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down?" [...] she inquired sarcastically. [...] "Of course, there's nothing very {{entertaining}} {{here for}} you. The rest are all away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall yet {{drink the}} wine that I shall pour {{you for this}} night's work, my lord, and for this insolence! Who gave <b>you</b> leave <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> before me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be a silly little fool," [...] he {{answered}} good-humouredly. [...] "All I want from <b>you</b> is <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{by my side}} and talk, {{and tell me what}} to order." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, mother, I know him. Captain Bayley has {{had some}} {{business}} with him, {{and asked me to}} come down here <b>to</b> see him. <b>You</b> are <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down until he comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Rollo," [...] said Waldron, [...] "I am {{glad you}} have come. I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{on the top}} of my trunk with me, and make it shut down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} true, I believe," [...] Rochester admitted. [...] "My bailiff sees to those things, {{and if it}} amuses <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> here all night, you are {{perfectly}} welcome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Negook," [...] Edith said, [...] "there {{is to be}} {{no trouble}} {{for you and your}} people. Only is it for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and do nothing but listen and understand." ...|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (dully--without {{opening her}} eyes). There's no pain. (There is another pause--then she murmurs indifferently.) There are {{chairs in the}} room you can bring out if <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in {{the room}} while she was practising mixed scales, you'd be quickly undeceived," [...] said the editor of Good Humour, one Peter Hope. He spoke bitterly.|$|R
6000|$|... "These are {{my family}} of young men," [...] said Madame. [...] "We {{are drawn from}} three races, though only Ciccio is not of our mountains. Will <b>you</b> please <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr. Smith--ay, that it is!' she said. 'And that's Mr. Knight. I beg <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down. Perhaps {{you know}} that since I saw you last I have married Martin Cannister.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Never, {{and never}} will: it's against my principle. Go and get another chair from the kitchen, Tinker, if <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down; and then we'll {{have a bit}} of supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] {{the artist}} {{said with a}} smile, [...] "have <b>you</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> do? if not, I will give <b>you</b> sixpence <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> still on that gate {{for a quarter of}} an hour. I want a figure." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{too early}} in the morning, Prince," [...] she said, [...] "for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> there dreaming so long and so earnestly. Come in to breakfast. Every one is down, for a wonder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you please, Mr. Andrew," [...] she begged, [...] "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> by me {{and tell}} me how you came to live in so strange a place. Do you really not mind the solitude?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, if you please, sir," [...] said Dr. Stanhope very sternly but not {{now very}} loudly. [...] "And I'll trouble <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down, too, Charlotte. Your mother can wait for her tea a few minutes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, dear--I {{meant to}} speak of this--I do think that as host <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> back and listen, and let your guests {{have a chance to}} talk once in a while!" ...|$|R
