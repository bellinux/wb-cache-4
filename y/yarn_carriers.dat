50|$|In 1890, Major Coker and {{his eldest}} son, James, began {{a search for}} a way to turn Southern pine trees into pulp for papermaking, and three years later, they had perfected a process. Shipping costs for the pulp made this {{business}} unprofitable, so Coker purchased his own papermaking equipment. That resulted in the formation of Carolina Fiber Company. With precious few nearby customers for paper, in 1899, the Major organized the Southern Novelty Company, later renamed Sonoco Products Company, to use some of the paper to produce cone-shaped <b>yarn</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{second major}} way of {{manufacturing}} fibre preforms is Braiding. Braiding is {{suited to the}} manufacture of narrow width flat or tubular fabric and is not as capable as weaving {{in the production of}} large volumes of wide fabrics. Braiding is done over top of mandrels that vary in cross-sectional shape or dimension along their length. Braiding is limited to objects about a brick in size. Unlike standard weaving, braiding can produce fabric that contains fibres at 45-degree angles to one another. Braiding three-dimensional fibres can be done using four step, two-step or Multilayer Interlock Braiding.Four step or row and column braiding utilizes a flat bed containing rows and columns of <b>yarn</b> <b>carriers</b> that form the shape of the desired preform. Additional carriers are added to the outside of the array, the precise location and quantity of which depends upon the exact preform shape and structure required. There are four separate sequences of row and column motion, which act to interlock the yarns and produce the braided preform. The yarns are mechanically forced into the structure between each step to consolidate the structure in a similar process to the use of a reed in weaving. Two-step braiding is unlike the four-step process because the two-step includes a large number of yarns fixed in the axial direction and a fewer number of braiding yarns. The process consists of two steps in which the braiding carriers move completely through the structure between the axial carriers. This relatively simple sequence of motions is capable of forming preforms of essentially any shape, including circular and hollow shapes. Unlike the four-step process, the two-step process does not require mechanical compaction the motions involved in the process allows the braid to be pulled tight by yarn tension alone. The last type of braiding is multi-layer interlocking braiding that consists of a number of standard circular braiders being joined together to form a cylindrical braiding frame. This frame has a number of parallel braiding tracks around the circumference of the cylinder but the mechanism allows the transfer of <b>yarn</b> <b>carriers</b> between adjacent tracks forming a multilayer braided fabric with yarns interlocking to adjacent layers. The multilayer interlock braid differs from both the four step and two-step braids in that the interlocking yarns are primarily in the plane of the structure and thus do not significantly reduce the in-plane properties of the preform. The four-step and two-step processes produce a greater degree of interlinking as the braiding yarns travel through the thickness of the preform, but therefore contribute less to the in-plane performance of the preform. A disadvantage of the multilayer interlock equipment is that due to the conventional sinusoidal movement of the <b>yarn</b> <b>carriers</b> to form the preform, the equipment is not able to have the density of <b>yarn</b> <b>carriers</b> that is possible with the two step and four step machines.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new kind of {{computational}} approach of three-dimensional (3 D) braiding simulation based on matrix theory and symbol operation, which is suitable for batch integral calculation. The approach can be used to calculate braiding matrix at any step. Different braiding matrices fully reflect <b>yarn</b> <b>carrier</b> position changes. Using the braiding matrix calculation, the approach can provide data for storing <b>yarn</b> <b>carrier</b> paths, also termed braiding paths. The 3 D braiding paths study was conducted to better visualization and thereby analyse the carrierâ€™s movement characteristics and principles of operation.

40|$|A <b>yarn</b> <b>carrier</b> {{apparatus}} particularly {{suited for}} use in braiding machinery or the like due to its capability of continuous yarn feeding and retraction of long lengths of <b>yarn.</b> The <b>yarn</b> <b>carrier</b> apparatus comprises a yarn supply spool which is rotatably mounted within the housing, a spring motor also mounted within the housing and operatively connected to the yarn supply spool through a mechanical transmission assembly which is adapted to multiply rotational movement between the first element of the gear assembly operatively connected to the spring motor and the final element of the gear assembly operatively connected to the yarn supply spool. The spring motor is adapted to tension the yarn during both feeding and retraction thereof, and it is further adapted to periodically rotatably slip within the housing and partially unwind so as to allow for continuous withdrawal of a long length of yarn without the spring motor becoming fully wound and preventing further yarn retraction...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the current work is to bring the shuttle-plate braiding process {{to a higher level}} of development, permitting its potential to be assessed fully and to explore a wider range of applications. The process enables individual and independent control of each yarn in an interweaving process and can thereby potentially emulate any of the conventional weaving and braiding processes. Further, it can produce textile structures having continuously varying patterns. Specific goals of the current work are as follows: refine the control/operating software which was originally very basic in nature and cumbersome for the inexperienced user, develop design software to translate conveniently a desired structural pattern into commands for the machine, fabricate additional <b>yarn</b> <b>carriers</b> so complex structures can be made, develop the modularity of the system to simplify commercial implementation, implement hardware enhancements to increase speed and flexibility o...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{circular}} {{braiding process}} {{is adapted to}} produce three-dimensional shapes by braiding over a contoured mandrel. The present work deals with the simulation of various braided structures. The simulated structures are based on geometrical models developed for yarns on different shapes of mandrels. The geometry of a braided structure depends upon the machine parameters, such as number of <b>yarn</b> <b>carriers,</b> rotational speed of the carriers, take-up speed, and the effective perimeter of the mandrel cross section. Virtual reality modeling language (VRML) has been employed as a visualization tool to simulate these geometrical models on a predefined mandrel geometry. Models relate to the machine speeds {{and a number of}} machine settings. The path of the yarn on the mandrel is dependent upon the shape of the mandrel, i. e., if it is circular then it will be {{in the form of a}} helix or if it is a cubical body then it will be in the form of straight lines. An expert system has been generated to take into account all the parameters interfacing with VRML to simulate the braid geometry. A comparison is also made between the experimental and simulated structures.
