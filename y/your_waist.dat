Earrings, too, and bracelets, and a zone for <b>your</b> <b>waist.</b> This set is yours, and Mary has another like it. Tom couldn't understand why I wanted two. What a short-sighted Tom! Earrings and bracelets, and a zone for <b>your</b> <b>waist!</b> Ah! Beautiful! Let us see how brave they look. Ask Mr Westlock to clasp them on.' ...|$|E

60|$|Ah! young ladies, sweet young ladies, dear embryo {{mothers of}} our England {{as it will}} be, think not overmuch of your lovers' incomes. He that is true and honest {{will not have to}} beg his bread--neither his nor yours. The true and honest do not beg their bread, though it may be that for awhile they eat it without much butter. But what then? If a {{wholesome}} loaf on your tables, and a strong arm round <b>your</b> <b>waists,</b> and a warm heart to lean on cannot make you happy, you are not the girls for whom I take you.|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] {{returned}} the trooper, observing {{that he had}} brought bundle and all from the ground. [...] "I perceive that you belong to the baggage guard; but my sword belt will encircle <b>your</b> little <b>waist,</b> {{as well as my}} own." ...|$|R
60|$|FRANK. My dear Viv: she wouldn't {{appreciate}} it: the {{two cases}} require different treatment. But what on earth has happened to you? Last night we were perfectly agreed as to your mother and her set. This morning I find you attitudinizing sentimentally with your arm around <b>your</b> parent's <b>waist.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Craig," [...] he continued, [...] "you're {{coming with}} us. You {{know the way}} to Port Said and we want you--you know why. Untie that sash from <b>your</b> <b>waist.</b> Quickly!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take a {{glass of}} champagne, my darling," [...] said Cosway; [...] "and let me try if I can get my arm round <b>your</b> <b>waist.</b> That's all I want with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take it, sir. Strap it boldly round <b>your</b> <b>waist.</b> If anyone {{remarks on}} it, laugh, {{and say it}} was a Huguenot's half an hour ago. I will carry mine stuck under my arm.|$|E
500|$|A {{dance music}} and dancehall-inspired track, [...] "Sexy Mama" [...] {{was written by}} both Iyanya and Wizkid, while its {{production}} was handled by D'Tunes. Its lyrics revolve around a male protagonist developing interest in a woman he met at a dance club. Iyanya joyfully sings: [...] "Girl your dance makes me crazy / I'm feeling <b>your</b> sexy <b>waist</b> / And this is still the baseline".|$|R
50|$|Likewise, on hip throws, some systems grab {{around the}} waist (or in ignorance, the belt), and some systems prefer to wrap tori’s right arm under the uke's left. One should never grip the opponent’s belt; modern attire may not include a belt. In fact, {{grabbing}} the belt is not necessary. Simply grabbing {{around the waist}} (so long as the grip is {{all the way around}} the waist) works better anyway. One should note that it feels easier to grab <b>your</b> opponent’s <b>waist</b> with <b>your</b> right arm than it does wrapping your right arm around their left arm. Biomechanically, grabbing the opponent higher up the back (such as at the shoulder) can allow the opponent to bend at the waist making the hip throw more difficult. The sequence of actions required for the hip throw is: block, parry or deflect the opponent's punch if necessary, effect kuzushi, bend the knees and turn whilst pulling the opponent over your hip.|$|R
6000|$|I see you {{laughing}} at my fairy fancies, and {{calling me a}} voluptuous Mahometan; but I am certain I would be a happy creature, beyond anything we call bliss here below; nay, {{it would be a}} paradise congenial to you too. Don't you see us, hand in hand, or rather, my arm about <b>your</b> lovely <b>waist,</b> making our remarks on Sirius, the nearest of the fixed stars; or surveying a comet, flaming innoxious by us, as we just now would mark the passing pomp of a travelling monarch; or in a shady bower of Mercury or Venus, dedicating the hour to love, in mutual converse, relying honour, and revelling endearment, whilst the most exalted strains of poesy and harmony would be the ready spontaneous language of our souls! Devotion is the favourite employment of your heart; so it is of mine: what incentives then to, and powers for reverence, 'gratitude, faith, and hope, in all the fervours of adoration and praise to that Being, whose unsearchable wisdom, power, and goodness, so pervaded, so inspired every sense and feeling! By this time, I daresay, you will be blessing the neglect of the maid that leaves me destitute of paper! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a queer-looking thing," [...] he {{said with}} a smile, [...] "but it is the best we can manage in the emergency. Here is a belt, if you strap that round <b>your</b> <b>waist</b> it will make the thing look more comfortable." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Fairweather {{asked to}} have Penelope {{introduced}} to her, and when they found themselves alone together she said gently, [...] "My dear, I am going to ask a very impertinent question. Will {{you tell me where}} you got the silk of which <b>your</b> <b>waist</b> is made?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] said Dickory, {{as he and}} Lucilla stood {{together}} on the sand, [...] "that in that gown of gray, with the white sleeves, and the red cord around <b>your</b> <b>waist,</b> you please me better than even you did when you wore your sailor garb?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you come}} any closer!" [...] she cried. [...] "You'll sink up to <b>your</b> <b>waist!</b> I got here by {{treading}} {{on the little}} hummocks and holding on to that dead branch; but don't you take hold of it, for you'll break it off, and then I can't get back." ...|$|E
60|$|THERE'S just {{a twinkle}} in your eye That seems to say I MIGHT, if I Were only bold enough to try An arm about <b>your</b> <b>waist.</b> I hear, too, as you come and go, That pretty nervous laugh, you know; And then your cap is always so Coquettishly displaced.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quiet you, {{my sweet}} father," [...] said Branwen, {{with a little}} smile, [...] "you know that two can play at that game, {{and that you have}} a skull and a waist as well as Bladud--though <b>your</b> <b>waist</b> is a good deal thicker than his. I'm not so sure about the skull!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you ask me}} to walk again, Yoletta," [...] I panted, [...] "I {{shall not}} move unless I have a rope round <b>your</b> <b>waist</b> to pull you back {{when you try to}} rush off in that mad fashion. You have knocked all the wind out of me; and yet I was in pretty good trim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if {{you keep}} taking long breaths to hold it on. That is what I want you to do, {{and when you have}} filled this out we will go on {{enlarging}} it till <b>your</b> <b>waist</b> is more like that of Hebe, goddess of health, and less like that of a fashion-plate the ugliest thing imaginable." ...|$|E
6000|$|He seemed {{satisfied}} with her tone and went on: [...] "At that {{time you were}} sitting beside me {{at the back of}} your father's covered car, when we were coming home from gypsying, all the party being squeezed in together as tight as sheep in an auction-pen. It got darker and darker, and I said--I forget the exact words--but I put my arm round <b>your</b> <b>waist</b> and there you let it stay till your father, sitting in front suddenly stopped telling his story to Farmer Bollen, to light his pipe. The flash shone into the car, and showed us all up distinctly; my arm flew from <b>your</b> <b>waist</b> like lightning; yet not so quickly but that some of 'em had seen, and laughed at us. Yet your father, to our amazement, instead of being angry, was mild as milk, and seemed quite pleased. Have you forgot all that, or haven't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thought to be,' said Mrs Boffin. 'But if ever John Harmon {{drew the}} breath of life on earth, that is {{certainly}} John Harmon's arm round <b>your</b> <b>waist</b> now, my pretty. If ever John Harmon had a wife on earth, that wife is certainly you. If ever John Harmon {{and his wife had}} a child on earth, that child is certainly this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you {{see that}} great tree there?' said the Witch, {{pointing}} to a tree beside them. 'It is hollow within. You must climb up to the top, and then {{you will see a}} hole through which you can let yourself down into the tree. I will tie a rope round <b>your</b> <b>waist,</b> so that I may be able to pull you up again when you call.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My brave young Arthur!" [...] said Agatha, in her enthusiasm, {{kissing the}} {{forehead}} of the blushing Chevalier, [...] "you have won your spurs like a knight and a hero; you shall be my knight and my hero. And I {{will give you}} my glove to wear in your cap. But, tell me Arthur, why have you and Henri, those red handkerchiefs tied round <b>your</b> <b>waist?</b> Chapeau has one too, and those other men, below there." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was in Prague that Harris and I did a {{kind and}} {{friendly}} thing to George. We had noticed {{for some time}} past that George was getting too fond of Pilsener beer. This German beer is an insidious drink, especially in hot weather; {{but it does not}} do to imbibe too freely of it. It does not get into your head, but after a time it spoils <b>your</b> <b>waist.</b> I always say to myself on entering Germany: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{little man}} can play," [...] he declared. [...] "He has {{it in his}} fingers. We shall hear now the waltzes that I love. Ah, Miss Julia, why is this not Paris! Why can I not get up and put my arm around <b>your</b> <b>waist</b> and whisper in your ear as we float round and round in a waltz? Stupid questions! I am too short to dance with you, for one thing, and much too fat, But one loves to imagine. Listen." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{talked the}} matter over, and at length {{concluded}} to {{do a little}} more exploring of the cave. Dave turned up the pocket lantern as high as possible, and as he did this Roger took from his pocket a short, strong cord. [...] "I thought this might come in useful, for tying up our supplies," [...] explained the senator's son, [...] "so I brought it from the last house we stopped at. Tie one end around <b>your</b> <b>waist,</b> Dave, and I will hold fast to the other end. Then I'll walk behind you, and if you go into a hole----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the triumph}} of it had been very great. I had been assured of {{the love of her}} who among all the high ones of the world {{seemed to me to be}} the highest. Then came your decision. Do you really believe that I could abandon the sweetness, that I could be robbed of my triumph, that I could think I could never again be allowed to put my arm round <b>your</b> <b>waist,</b> never again to feel your cheek close to mine, that I should lose all that had seemed left to me among the gods, without feeling it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are true}} savages. Already has begun {{the custom of}} wearing human teeth. In another {{generation}} you will be perforating your noses and ears and wearing ornaments of bone and shell. I know. The human race is doomed to sink back farther and farther into the primitive night ere again it begins its bloody climb upward to civilization. When we increase and feel the lack of room, we will proceed to kill one another. And then I suppose you will wear human scalp-locks at <b>your</b> <b>waist,</b> as well--as you, Edwin, who are the gentlest of my grandsons, have already begun with that vile pigtail. Throw it away, Edwin, boy; throw it away." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Milly didn't hear: {{for she was}} {{occupied}} in telling me an immense long story about her waltzing with the Count de Schloppenzollern at the City ball to the Allied Sovereigns; and how the Count had great large white moustaches; and how odd she thought it to go whirling round {{the room with a}} great man's arm round <b>your</b> <b>waist.</b> [...] "Mr. Roundhand has never allowed it since our marriage--never; but in the year 'fourteen it was considered a proper compliment, you know, to pay the sovereigns. So twenty-nine young ladies, of the best families in the City of London, I assure you, Mr. Titmarsh--there was the Lord Mayor's own daughters; Alderman Dobbins's gals; Sir Charles Hopper's three, who have the great house in Baker Street; and your humble servant, who was rather slimmer in those days--twenty-nine of us had a dancing-master on purpose, and practised waltzing in a room over the Egyptian Hall at the Mansion House. He was a splendid man, that Count Schloppenzollern!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thet's whar you'd be lyin'! That yar heat kem out of {{the bowels}} of the yearth,--kem up like out of a chimbley or a blast, and kep up that yar fire. And when she cools down a month after, and I got to strip her, there was a hole in the yearth, and a spring o' bilin', scaldin' water pourin' out of it ez big as <b>your</b> <b>waist.</b> And {{right in the middle of}} it was this yer." [...] He rose with the {{instinct}} of a skillful raconteur, and whisked from under his bunk a chamois leather bag, which he emptied on the table before them. It contained a small fragment of native rock crystal, half-fused upon a petrified bit of pine. It was so glaringly truthful, so really what it purported to be, that the most unscientific woodman or pioneer would have understood it at a glance. Lance raised his mirthful eyes to Flip.|$|E
6000|$|It was, indeed, {{the fourth}} evening before Mikail told Godfrey {{that he had}} got {{everything}} except the knives. [...] "I will manage to get these in the morning," [...] he said, [...] "when I go {{into the kitchen and}} see about breakfast. If I were you, I would put on those two spare shirts over the one you wear, and take your three spare pairs of stockings. Of course you will wind the rope round <b>your</b> <b>waist.</b> I suppose you will buy bread from the others, there are always plenty ready to sell; you had better take enough for two or three days. Cut it in slices, put them inside your upper shirt with the other things you take, your belt will keep them safe. Don't try to slip away unless you see a really good opportunity; it is no use being shot at. Besides, with those irons on your legs, they would soon overtake you. Better put it off for another time than to run any risk." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{took her}} to the sofa: we sat side by side. She put her arm round my waist, and laid her head on my shoulder. Again the faint smile flickered like a dying light on her lovely face; wan and wasted, yet still beautiful--still the Virgin's face in Raphael's picture. [...] "We are a strange pair," [...] she said, with a {{momentary}} flash of her old irresistible humour. [...] "You are my bitterest enemy, and you burst out crying over me the moment we meet. I have been shockingly treated by you--and I have got my arm round <b>your</b> <b>waist</b> and my head on your shoulder, and I wouldn't let go of you for the world!" [...] Her face saddened again; her voice suddenly altered its tone. [...] "Tell me," [...] she went on, [...] "how is it that appearances were so terribly against you? Oscar satisfied me, at Ramsgate, that I ought to give you up, that I ought never to see you again. I took his view--there is no denying it, my dear--I agreed with him in detesting you, for a little while. But, when the blindness came back, I could keep it up no longer. Little by little, as the light died out, my heart would turn to you again. When I heard your letter read, when I knew that you were near me--it was just like the old times; I was mad to see you. And here I am--satisfied, before you explain it to me, that you have been the victim of some terrible mistake." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now Tiidu saw {{quite clearly}} {{that he could}} only hope to become rich by means of his pipes, and set about {{thinking}} if {{there was nothing he}} could do to make the money flow in faster. At length he remembered having heard some stories of a kingdom in the Kungla country, where musicians of all sorts were welcomed and highly paid; but where it was, or how it was reached, he could not recollect, however hard he thought. In despair, he wandered along the coast, hoping to see some ship or sailing boat that would take him where he wished to go, and at length he reached the town of Narva, where several merchantmen were lying at anchor. To his great joy, he found that one of them was sailing for Kungla in a few days, and he hastily went on board, and asked for the captain. But the cost of the passage was more than the prudent Tiidu cared to pay, and though he played his best on his pipes, the captain refused to lower his price, and Tiidu was just thinking of returning on shore when his usual luck flew to his aid. A young sailor, who had heard him play, came secretly to him, and offered to hide him on board, in the absence of the captain. So the next night, as soon as it was dark, Tiidu stepped softly on deck, and was hidden by his friend down in the hold in a corner between two casks. Unseen by the rest of the crew the sailor managed to bring him food and drink, and when they were well out of sight of land he proceeded to carry out a plan he had invented to deliver Tiidu from his cramped quarters. At midnight, while he was keeping watch and everyone else was sleeping, the man bade his friend Tiidu follow him on deck, where he tied a rope round Tiidu's body, fastening the other end carefully to one of the ship's ropes. 'Now,' he said, 'I will throw you into the sea, and you must shout for help; and when you see the sailors coming untie the rope from <b>your</b> <b>waist,</b> and tell them that you have swum after the ship all the way from shore.' ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was once}} upon a time a poor boy who had neither father nor mother. In order to gain a living he looked after the sheep of a great Lord. Day and night he spent out in the open fields, and only when it was very wet and stormy did he take refuge in a little hut {{on the edge of a}} big forest. Now one night, when he was sitting on the grass beside his flocks, he heard not very far from him the sound as of some one crying. He rose up and {{followed}} the direction of the noise. To his dismay and astonishment he found a Giant lying at the entrance of the wood; he was about to run off as fast as his legs could carry him, when the Giant called out: 'Don't be afraid, I won't harm you. On the contrary, I will reward you handsomely if you will bind up my foot. I hurt it when I was trying to root up an oak-tree.' The Herd-boy took off his shirt, and bound up the Giant's wounded foot with it. Then the Giant rose up and said, 'Now come and I will reward you. We are going to celebrate a marriage to-day, and I promise you we shall have plenty of fun. Come and enjoy yourself, but in order that my brothers mayn't see you, put this band round <b>your</b> <b>waist</b> and then you'll be invisible.' With these words he handed the Herd-boy a belt, and walking on in front he led him to a fountain where hundreds of Giants and Giantesses were assembled preparing to hold a wedding. They danced and played different games till midnight; then one of the Giants tore up a plant by its roots, and all the Giants and Giantesses made themselves so thin that they disappeared into the earth through the hole made by the uprooting of the plant. The wounded Giant remained behind to the last and called out, 'Herd-boy, where are you?' 'Here I am, close to you,' was the reply. 'Touch me,' said the Giant, 'so that you too may come with us under ground.' The Herd-boy did as he was told, and before he could have believed it possible he found himself in a big hall, where even the walls were made of pure gold. Then to his astonishment he saw that the hall was furnished with the tables and chairs that belonged to his master. In a few minutes the company began to eat and drink.|$|E
