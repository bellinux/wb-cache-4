5|$|Following the hasty {{departure}} of PedroI, Brazil {{was left with}} a five-year-old boy as head of state. With no precedent to follow, the Empire was {{faced with the prospect}} of a period of more than twelve <b>years</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> strong executive, as, under the constitution, PedroII would not attain his majority and begin exercising authority as Emperor until 2 December 1843. A regency was elected to rule the country in the interim. Because the Regency held few of the powers exercised by an emperor and was completely subordinated to the General Assembly, it could not fill the vacuum at the apex of Brazil's government.|$|E

5|$|Before 1707, the Kingdom of Scotland was a {{sovereign}} independent state {{which had its}} own legislature—the Parliament of Scotland—which met, latterly, at Parliament House on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The Treaty of Union, signed in 1707, created an incorporating political union between the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England. The two previous Acts of Union (one for the British Parliament {{and one for the}} Parliament of Scotland) had dissolved the previous parliaments. The Treaty of Union created the Parliament of Great Britain which was housed in the Palace of Westminster in London. As a consequence, Scotland was directly governed from London for the next 292 <b>years</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> legislature or a Parliament building of its own.|$|E
5|$|Beharall {{started off}} his playing career at {{hometown}} club Newcastle United in 1996 where he graduated {{to the first}} team in 1998 after being captain to the youth and reserve teams. Beharall made his first FA Premier League start and his début for Newcastle in the 3–1 loss against Everton on 17 April 1999. Beharall started another 3 FA Premier League games during the 1998–99 season. During the 1999–00 season, Beharall played 2 more premier league games; the 3–3 draw against Wimbledon and the 5–1 loss at Manchester United.

5|$|In 1996, Wenger {{was named}} manager of Arsenal {{and two years}} later the club {{completed}} a league and FA Cup double. The club won another league and cup double in 2002 and retained the FA Cup a year later. In 2004, Wenger managed Arsenal to an undefeated league season, a feat last accomplished by Preston North End, 115 years previously. Arsenal later eclipsed Nottingham Forest's record of 42 league matches unbeaten and went seven more matches before losing in October 2004. The club made their first appearance in a Champions League final in 2006, though they lost to Barcelona. After a period of nine <b>years</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> trophy, which coincided with the club relocating to the Emirates Stadium, Wenger guided Arsenal to further FA Cup success in 2014, 2015 and 2017.|$|E

5|$|Reaction in the U.S. Congress to the {{incursion}} {{was also}} swift. Senators Frank F. Church (Democratic Party, Idaho) and John S. Cooper (Republican Party, Kentucky), proposed {{an amendment to}} the Foreign Military Sales Act that would have cut off funding not only for U.S. ground operations and advisors in Cambodia, but would also have ended U.S. air support for Cambodian forces. On 30 June the United States Senate passed the act with the amendment included. The bill was defeated in the House of Representatives after U.S. forces were withdrawn from Cambodia as scheduled. The newly amended act did, however, rescind the Southeast Asia Resolution (better known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution) under which Presidents Johnson and Nixon had conducted military operations for seven <b>years</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> declaration of war.|$|E
5|$|After relegation, {{the club}} {{underwent}} off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline. Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted {{at the first}} attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in a play-off against Gillingham. A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved {{to have been a}} step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 2001–02 Division One championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a season in the process. The 2002–03 season was the last at Maine Road, and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a run of 13 <b>years</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> derby win. City also qualified for European competition {{for the first time in}} 25 years. In the 2003 close season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became the club's first manager from overseas when appointed in 2007. After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked in June 2008. Eriksson was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later on 4 June 2008.|$|E
