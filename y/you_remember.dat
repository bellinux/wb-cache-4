The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E

25|$|In 1914 Karalli also {{embarked}} on a successful acting career, {{and became one of}} Russia's first celebrated film actresses. Her first role was in the 1914 Pyotr Chardynin directed drama Ty pomnish' li? (English title: Do <b>You</b> <b>Remember?)</b> opposite the successful actor Ivan Mozzhukhin. From 1914 to 1919, Vera Karalli would appear in approximately sixteen Russian silent films, including the 1915 adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace titled Voyna i mir. Her last film appearance was in a German dramatic release entitled Die Reiche einer Frau in 1921. Often chosen as a leading lady by the notable director Yevgeni Bauer, Karalli is possibly best recalled for her performances in the Bauer directed adaptations of novelist Ivan Turgenev's Posle smerti (English: After Death) in 1915 and her role as Gizella in the 1917 melodrama Umirayushchii Lebed (The Dying Swan).|$|E

500|$|... "Peterotica" [...] {{was written}} by Patrick Meighan and {{directed}} by Kurt Dumas. The episode ran into multiple objections from broadcasting standards and the show's producers. For instance, the original title of the episode was [...] "A Connecticut Yankee and King Arthur's Butt", but broadcasting standards objected. A sequence showing all of the different erotic novels written by Peter was edited for the television version; one entitled Catcher in the Eye {{was removed from the}} television version as broadcasting standards disliked the cover, which implied her eye was a target for semen during ejaculation. The scene of Peter reading his new erotic novel to Lois was never cut from airing, although the producers of Family Guy had some trouble with it, as it is the second semen joke of the episode. When Lois' father, Carter, sits down at the breakfast table, Lois states: [...] "Daddy, did <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> to clean up?" [...] Originally, she was meant to say, [...] "Daddy, did <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> to wipe yourself?", but broadcasting standards objected, so it was modified to [...] "Daddy, did <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> to clean yourself?" [...] However, standards still objected, so it was changed to its current version.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Play" [...] is {{slightly}} world music-tinged, according to music critic Per Bjurman of Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet. AllMusic's John Lucas felt it incorporated a playful vibe, deeming it [...] "as playful a song as 's ever recorded". The recording's refrain contains the line, [...] "Your heart will never grow bitter if <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> how to play".|$|E

500|$|God of War was {{critically}} acclaimed, with aggregate {{scores of}} 93.69% from GameRankings and 94 out of 100 from Metacritic, who describe their score as [...] "universal acclaim". Tom Lane of CNN wrote, [...] "God of War {{is the type}} of game that makes <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> why you play games in the first place." [...] He said it is addictive and the action is balanced with a modest amount of puzzle and platforming elements. He praised how quickly it progresses and said it [...] "is one of the most violent [...] on the market".|$|E

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Remember</b> Rock 'n' Roll Radio?", {{a throwback to}} the rock music of the 1950s to late 1960s. The lyrics name several famous musicians of this era, {{including}} Jerry Lee Lewis, John Lennon, and T. Rex, and also cite The Ed Sullivan Show. Many instruments that were previously rarelyâ€”if everâ€”used in punk rock were featured in the song's score, including the saxophone and electronic organ. The lyrics, written by Dee Dee, depict his childhood in Germany where he would secretly listen to rock radio stations at night.|$|E
500|$|It {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, though many reviewers deemed {{it to be}} less favorable compared to the band's previous releases, due to Spector's production quality and the band's desire for mainstream success starting to show in their music, according to critics. Despite this, the album is the highest charting Ramones album of all time, reaching number 44 on the US Billboard 200 chart, and number 14 on the UK Albums Chart. End of the Century spawned the singles [...] "Baby, I Love You" [...] and [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Remember</b> Rock 'n' Roll Radio?," [...] both of which charted in Europe.|$|E
500|$|Kurt Loder, {{reviewing}} the album for Rolling Stone, called it [...] "Phil Spector's finest and most mature effort in years", {{and said that}} his production created a [...] "rich and vibrant and surging with power" [...] setting. He noted that the Ramones are still [...] "spotlighted", rather than their producer. Author Richard Williams exclaimed that to [...] "old fans the Ramones' version of 'Baby, I Love You' went too far, desecrating {{the memory of the}} original despite Joey's evident devotion to the task of emulating Ronnie's lead vocal." [...] Williams also said that [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Remember</b> Rock 'n' Roll Radio" [...] and [...] "Chinese Rock" [...] maintained the principles of the Ramones' in their earlier days.|$|E
