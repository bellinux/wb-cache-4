500|$|December 1967 {{also saw}} the release of Their Satanic Majesties Request (UK No. 3; US No. 2), which {{received}} unfavourable reviews and was widely regarded as a poor imitation of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Satanic Majesties had been recorded in difficult circumstances while Jagger, Richards and Jones were dealing with their court cases. The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions. The split was amicable, at least publicly, but in 2003 Jagger said: [...] "The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating {{and that we were}} being childish. It was not a great moment really â€“ and I would have thought it wasn't a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point, that was Andrew's job." ...|$|E
500|$|McCracken starred with Eddie Dowling, {{a veteran}} Broadway actor, {{in the play}} Angel in the Pawnshop, in a 1950 tour and on Broadway in 1951. She played a young woman seeking to escape her {{marriage}} from a homicidal thief, in a pawnshop owned by Dowling's character. While in the pawnshop, she puts on old clothing and fantasizes that she is living in happier times. Although she engaged in some choreographed dancing during the play, it was a straight dramatic role. While the play was being prepared for Broadway, in October 1950, she appeared on television in the premiere of the Pulitzer Prize Playhouse, playing Essie in You Can't Take It with <b>You.</b> <b>At</b> <b>that</b> time, McCracken gave an interview disparaging what she described as the [...] "over-commercialization" [...] of television, which might have hurt her career in the new medium. Reviews for Angel in the Pawnshop were negative, and she received mixed reviews for her performance.|$|E

60|$|LEE TAI. You forget {{sometimes}} the manners that were taught <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> elegant school for young ladies in England.|$|E
60|$|LADY MARY. But I am so unworthy. It was {{sufficient}} to me that I {{should be allowed to}} wait on <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> table.|$|E
60|$|Lau. Marry! Are <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> so soon, signior? Benito and Beatrix, I confess, {{had some}} acquaintance; but Aurelian and Laura are mere strangers.|$|E
6000|$|Lau. [Reading it.] What's here? An humble {{petition}} {{for a private}} meeting? Are <b>you</b> twittering <b>at</b> <b>that</b> sport already, mistress novice? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to that," [...] said Stanbury, slowly, [...] "I suppose I {{had better}} tell <b>you</b> <b>at</b> once, <b>that</b> the Nuncombe Putney {{arrangement}} cannot {{be considered as}} permanent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Meyer," [...] she said, [...] "you {{have done}} a shameful and a wicked thing, and I tell <b>you</b> <b>at</b> once <b>that</b> I can never forgive you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I told <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time," [...] he said, [...] "about a {{new drug}} called the cio-root, which had a great {{reputation}} for curing headaches." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{does he want}} {{to marry}} <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>that?</b> Take you as a present from the world at large?--against your will and desire?... I don't {{understand}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{that is to}} say, if it is {{over the}} five thousand. If it is under the five thousand, I will sell them to <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> sum." ...|$|E
60|$|Ah! John, John! You wouldn't, for the world, {{have told}} to {{man or woman}} what a fool <b>you</b> were <b>at</b> <b>that</b> moment.|$|R

6000|$|... 'It {{would be}} a humiliation to <b>you</b> <b>at</b> present <b>that</b> I could not bear if a {{marriage}} between us were made public; an inconvenience without any compensating advantage.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] she said, [...] "if our {{fortunes}} do not quickly mend, that {{we shall}} have to buy two little grindstones. You know I could help <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> sort of thing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Then {{perhaps you}} will get as far as Antwerp, and {{spend the rest of}} the {{holidays}} between the Cathedral and Paul Potter's bull. No, I shall have nothing to say to <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> rate,' said Claude.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} be acting rightly towards you if I did not tell <b>you</b> <b>at</b> once <b>that</b> so long as Captain Parsons lives, my love for him can never alter." ...|$|R

60|$|Tommy liked this, but foresaw a danger: {{the ticket}} {{might be taken}} from Shovel at the door, just as they took them from <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> singing thing in the church he had {{attended}} with young Petey.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, never mind. I'm {{playing a}} better game than that now," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Benjamin. [...] "I'll {{leave it to}} you to make the bargain. There's no one can beat <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> you know, dad." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well--never mind; don't grieve," [...] said Jude generously. [...] "I did suffer, God knows, about <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time; and now I suffer again. But {{perhaps not}} so much as you. The woman mostly gets the worst of it in the long run!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "DEAR MADAM--Your {{letter and}} its {{inclosure}} have caused me great concern and surprise.
