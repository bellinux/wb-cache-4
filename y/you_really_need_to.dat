500|$|While Radiohead has {{expressed}} anti-war sentiments in the past—including {{a contribution to}} the 1995 War Child charity compilation The Help Album—"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)" [...] marks {{the first time that a}} Radiohead song explicitly refers to war in its lyrics, marking a departure from Yorke's typically abstract writing. The lyrics are from the perspective of a soldier in the midst of First World War trench warfare. Several lines, including [...] "Give your leaders each a gun and then let them fight it out themselves" [...] and [...] "The next will be chemical but they will never learn", are adapted from quotations by Patch. Both Luke Lewis of NME and Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly likened the lyrics to Wilfred Owen's First World War-era poem Dulce et Decorum est. Rice referred to Yorke's voice in the song as an [...] "innocent and youthful falsetto"; the NME said his singing is [...] "subdued to the point where <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> read the lyrics".|$|E
500|$|The adult fandom {{has been}} {{perceived}} negatively by others, with {{coverage of the}} brony fandom overshadowing the show itself. Much of the fandom's ridicule from others comes from {{the perception of the}} mostly adult male fanbase enjoying a show that is marketed to the young female demographic. Through this, the brony community has encountered ridicule through trolling on internet forums, not only from its inception at 4chan, but after moving away from the site. This has also been called out in popular media. The Fox News Channel comedy talk program Red Eye poked fun at the fandom because it largely consists of young adult males. Kurt Schlichter of BigHollywood.com called the phenomenon a [...] "terrifying new trend", and wrote, [...] "Hollywood, do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> enable the creepy immaturity of these geebos? No. It's time to stop the insanity." [...] Commenting on Schlichter's article, Greg Pollowitz of the National Review Online wrote that considering the target audience he could not understand the show's appeal to adult men. Jerry Springer attempted to bring bronies onto his talk for a segment on [...] "Outrageously Guilty Pleasures", though the fandom warned others about the potential ridicule.|$|E
500|$|... "Stand Up for Love" [...] {{received}} negative reviews by most music critics. James Blake {{writing for}} BBC Online, described [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] as a [...] "sugary ballad". Pitchfork Medias writer Jess Harvell criticized the song by writing, [...] "Opener 'Stand Up for Love' is subtitled the '2005 World Children's Day Anthem', which {{should tell you}} all <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know, i.e. Diane Warren should be banned under the Geneva Conventions". Fiona Mckinlay criticized {{the fact that the}} song was used as an opener for #1's and felt it wasn't [...] "really causing any kind of reaction before they get started properly with Independent Woman Pt.1". Houston Chronicles Michael D. Clark described the track as [...] "overwrought and overproduced; at best, it's a future prom theme". Matthew Jacobs of The Huffington Post felt it was [...] "great" [...] the song was used for World's Children day but described it as a [...] "total snoozefest". A writer for Billboard magazine commented that the song lacked the potential to become a chart-topper. He went on to describe it as a [...] "schmaltzy AC ballad aiming to display the individual talents" [...] of Destiny's Child's members, adding that it was [...] "ironic" [...] as the group's other songs on the disc focused mainly on production. He finished his review by saying that [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] was a [...] "disappointing nonstarter".|$|E

Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote of Tomlin, [...] "nearly every moment in this movie is all hers", predicting award nominations for her performance. In a review of the film for The Boston Globe, Ty Burr offered the summary: [...] "it stars Lily Tomlin, and that's all <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know".|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the praise}} was {{directed}} especially for her many video game roles, including {{in a series}} of 2D fighting games by Capcom wherein she was noted as a particularly well animated character. In 1996, MAXIMUM reported Psylocke being possibly the most popular X-Men character in Japan, where Capcom games have introduced the franchise to general public, [...] "due to her Japanese appearance...and ninja-esque martial arts moves". Psylocke was chosen as one of the 20 [...] "muses" [...] of video games by Brazilian magazine SuperGamePower in 2001. In the 2009 Marvel poll asking who is the better fighter in Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Psylocke got over two-thirds of the votes (68%) against the Street Fighter series icon and the fighting game genre female symbol Chun-Li. UGO ranked her as fifth on their 2011 list of fighting games' finest female fighters for her appearances in Capcom titles, stating that [...] "the only thing more confusing than Psylocke's backstory is what exactly her powers are [...] all <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know is this: Psylocke is a sexy Asian lady ninja sporting the most obscene butt-floss this side of Linda Kozlowski in Crocodile Dundee". Complex included her in their 2012 list of the most humiliating victory quotes in fighting games.|$|E

40|$|Why is it {{that the}} most vocal opponents of Darwinism often are not {{biologists}} or geologists, but physicists, computer scientists, engineers or mathematicians, like myself?

I realize that the development of life took millions of years, that there is an ”evolutionary chain ” of similarities connecting all species, and that many things about the process give the appearance of natural causes, but none of this diminishes the main problem. In a Fall 2000 opinion piece in the Mathematical Intelligencer [1] I made the assertion that the underlying principle behind the second law of thermodynam-ics is that natural forces do not do extremely improbable things.
