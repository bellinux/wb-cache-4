500|$|The New York Times {{reviewer}} Jeannette Catsoulis praised it {{for avoiding}} the dichotomy of [...] "corporate greed versus environmental well-being", adding {{that instead of}} being an exposé, [...] "Under the gentle, humane investigations of its director, what emerges most strongly is a portrait of exploitation that ought to make us more nauseated than elated over those $20 jeans". Tamsin Blanchard, for the Daily Telegraph, called it a work that will [...] "do for the fast fashion business what Food Inc did for fast food". The Hollywood Reporters Frank Scheck commended it for approaching an issue often [...] "untouched by major news organizations". He said the film was [...] "more despair-inducing than instructive", but was optimistic about its possible impact on the fashion culture, citing the effect that films such as Super Size Me and Fast Food Nation had on the fast food industry. Carson Quiros of Paste also compared it to the former film. David Noh of Film Journal International called it a [...] "vitally important documentary" [...] that contains scenes that [...] "are enough to make <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go shopping again". Gabrielle Wilson of MTV stated it is [...] "hard to swallow but never feels preach-y or like a barrage of depressive factoids" [...] and will empower viewers to change their shopping habits. Casey Jarman said she was disappointed by [...] "the only solution offered: eliminating global capitalism"; however, ultimately, she wrote for Willamette Week {{that it is a}} [...] "compelling film, which is, above all else, a badly needed conversation-starter".|$|E
500|$|The pilot episode {{received}} acclaim {{from television}} critics. TV Guide's Matt Roush praised {{the marriage of}} Scorsese and Winter, saying it [...] "... brilliantly marries Martin Scorsese's virtuosic cinematic eye to Terence Winter's panoramic mastery of rich character and eventful story," [...] and finished his review by stating [...] "It's the most purely—and impurely—enjoyable storytelling HBO has delivered in ages, like a movie that <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> end." [...] Variety's Brian Lowry praised the show for returning network HBO to top form, saying [...] "This is, quite simply, television at its finest, occupying a sweet spot that—for all the able competition—still remains unique to HBO: An expensive, explicit, character-driven program, tackling material no broadcast network or movie studio would dare touch... For those wondering when the channel would deliver another franchise to definitively put {{it on top of}} the world, Ma, the wait is over: Go directly to [...] "Boardwalk."" [...] "One of the unexpected joys of [...] "Boardwalk Empire," [...] though, lies in the way the show revels in the oddities of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a giddy shadow world of criminals and politicians collaborating to keep the liquor flowing," [...] says online magazine Salon's Heather Havrilesky who went on to call the pilot [...] "breathtaking." [...] Roberto Bianco from USA Today said in his review that Boardwalk Empire was [...] "Extravagantly produced, shockingly violent and as cold and hard as ice, Boardwalk Empire {{brings us back to the}} world's former playground at the start of Prohibition—and brings HBO back to the forefront of the TV-series race." ...|$|E

After {{back-to-back}} 5th-place finishes in 2004 Athens and 2008 Beijing, Powell had his most disastrous final yet finishing in dead last with a time of 11.99 seconds, pulling up after seeing others in front of him, ultimately due to a niggling groin injury.

2500|$|Cantrell is {{critical}} of religion and Young Earth Creationism, satirizing them both in Alice In Chains' 2013 Album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here. Cantrell stated, [...] "There are two things <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get into a conversation or argument about: politics and religion. But fuck, I guess we're {{going to be talking}} about this for awhile". [...] "No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [...] comes from something that a lot of people actually believe in". Cantrell also stated that he’s sick of the hypocrisy that’s taken over many facets of organized religion. [...] "I think there’s overwhelming evidence that things aren’t working right now. We need to start growing up as a people. When you’re teaching people that being gay is a mortal sin, yet a good portion of the people teaching this are fucking kids, there’s a huge problem".|$|E

There are men who sail boats on the Round Pond, such big boats that they bring them in barrows and {{sometimes}} in perambulators, and then the baby has to walk.

5000|$|From {{the first}} episode, Franky {{looked like the}} top dog to many viewers as she was bossy, vicious and had a short temper and always had a hold over the girls. She was someone that <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> cross because of her violent temper. Franky {{had the luxury of}} {{speaking}} the first word of dialogue in the show: [...] "She bumped into me". This line was caused as she stopped fellow inmate Sally Lee from running around the prison. We also understood that she had a long-term feud with the real prison Top Dog Bea Smith.|$|R
