5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E

25|$|Un{{controlled}} and yield (give way) controlled intersections require large sight triangles {{clear of}} obstructions {{in order to}} operate safely. At uncontrolled intersections, the basic right-of-way rules apply (either <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vehicle on the right, or the boulevard rule, depending on the location). Vehicle drivers {{must be able to}} see traffic approaching on the intersecting road at a point where they can adjust their speed, or stop if need be, to <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other traffic before reaching the intersection. It isn't the only criterion for allowing these types of intersection control. Changing an intersection to stop control is a common response to poor safety performance.|$|E

25|$|Popes {{intervened in}} Hungary on several {{occasions}} to place one of their protégés on the throne.

However, some priests continued to administer the sacraments and excommunicated Pope Benedict VIII himself. Charles I was finally accepted as king after years of civil war.|$|E

The chiefs of White Apple sent emissaries to potential allies, including the Yazoo, Koroa, Illinois, Chickasaw, and Choctaw. They also sent messages to the African slaves of nearby French plantations, inviting them to join the Natchez in rising up to drive out the French.|$|E

It brought about his demise against Harbhajan Singh in India in 2001 when he was hell-bent on sweeping when the circumstances demanded a safer method. The fire hasn't been completely doused, but it comes in measured bursts now rather than in an uncontrolled stream, and the civilised Ponting has been a far more dangerous batsman in the last 18 months than during {{any other time in}} his career.|$|E

25|$|The Caviteños {{suffered}} terrible defeat {{because of}} lack of arms and ammunition. As the Spaniards approached the Poblacion, the revolutionaries retreated the stone building of the town. On February 25, 1897, the Spaniards decided to encircle the Poblacion rather go directly to the interior. They started burning all houses except the church. Seeing they were surrounded by fire, some of the rebels went out of hiding but were immediately met by open fire. Those who took refuge at the casa tribunal refused to come out and were all burned alive. Even those who took refuge in the church did eventually <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> advancing Spanish forces. By March, Perez-Dasmariñas had fallen back into the Spanish hand.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 August 917, the battle between the Bulgarians and the Byzantines began by the river Achelous near the modern village Acheloi, 8 {{kilometers}} {{to the north of}} Anchialus (modern Pomorie) on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast. The Byzantine generals planned to outflank the right Bulgarian wing in order to detach Simeon's troops from the Balkan Passes. The Bulgarian ruler concentrated his most powerful forces in the two wings and left the centre relatively weak in order to surround the enemy when the centre would <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine attack. Simeon himself was in charge of large cavalry reserves hidden behind the hills which were intended to strike the decisive blow.|$|E
25|$|In 1847 he was {{temporarily}} occupied with ideas of emigration, {{and with this}} object made a journey to Algiers, but returned to Baden and resumed his former position as the radical champion of popular rights, later becoming president of the , where he was destined to fall still further {{under the influence of}} the agitator Gustav von Struve. In conjunction with Struve he drew up the radical programme carried at the great Liberal meeting held at Offenburg on September 12, 1847 (entitled Thirteen Claims put forward by the People of Baden). In addition to the Offenburg programme, the Sturm petition of March 1, 1848, attempted to extort from the government the most far-reaching concessions. But it was in vain that on becoming a deputy Hecker endeavoured to carry out its impracticable provisions. He had to <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more moderate majority, but on this account was driven still further towards the Left. The proof lies in the new Offenburg demands of March 19, and in the resolution moved by Hecker in the preliminary Frankfurt Parliament that Germany should be declared a republic. But neither in Baden nor Frankfurt did he at any time gain his point.|$|E

25|$|The Six Dynasties poetic period {{formed an}} {{important}} {{link between the}} folk-ballad (yuefu) style prominent in the poetry of the Han dynasty and the following revival and experimentation with the older forms during the Tang dynasty. Even before the formal end of the Han Dynasty the poetic developments typical of that era had begun to <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jian'an style, just as {{the political power of}} Han yielded more and more to that of the rising power of various regional hegemons, including Cao Cao and the Cao family. The Cao family was both poetically involved in this process {{towards the end of the}} Han era and into the beginning of the subsequent Three Kingdoms era, one of which kingdoms was founded by the Cao family as dynasts. The Cao family's new state, which they called Wei, also was the base area of the Sima clan, which increased in power over time, until one of the Sima family became Emperor Wu of Jin. The early phase of this Jin dynasty, known as Western Jin, provided a unified period for China (265–316), but lacking long-term stability. After this period, the Jin ceded control of the north to various successor states. However, the Jin dynasty as a whole was rather productive of poetry, both original works and collections and criticism. The north–south divide continued as a major feature in the landscape of Chinese poetry through the eventual Sui dynasty re-unification, which shortly gave way to the relatively unified and long term stability of the Tang dynasty, and a whole new poetic era of Tang poetry.|$|E
