25|$|On June 10, 2016, Eisley {{revealed}} {{that they had}} begun the process of recording their fifth studio record {{with the assistance of}} producer Will Yip at the band's own studio in Tyler {{at the beginning of the}} month. DuPree-Bemis spoke of the new album in the band's press release, mentioning that, “Musically, you could say it’s classic Eisley, in the sense that it’s melodic, moody pop and is written from the heart. Lyrically, it’s very whimsical; it has a vibe that will take you into its own world and let you escape <b>your</b> <b>normal</b> life for a few minutes. I like to cloak things in a little mystery and romance; I think it’s part of what makes all of Eisley’s songs sound like they’re from the same world. Every record is like opening and reading a book in a series.” Tracking for the album concluded in early July, with mention of plans to release the record in early 2017.|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{contrast}} sensitivity function (CSF) {{is one of}} the most important single measures to determine the limits of the human visual system’s performance. The measure is the minimum contrast (contrast threshold) of a sinusoidal grating stimulus that can be detected by an observer on a background of the same space averaged mean luminance. To construct a complete {{contrast sensitivity}} function the contrast threshold is measured for a range of spatial frequencies. Acuity and spatial resolution are terms that are commonly used to describe the highest spatial frequency that the human observer can resolve. Acuity can be obtained by extrapolating the high frequency limb of the contrast sensitivity function to a contrast of 1. For normal observers under optimal conditions and with bright illumination this value is about 60 cycles/degree of visual angle. There are a number of ways                                  1 in which acuity is measured in the clinical setting. One of the most common is to use the Snellen letter chart which is described in the first part of this laboratory exercise. When conducting an experiment that involves sensory performance it is important to determine <b>your</b> subject has <b>normal</b> capacities. In the visual domain this often involves measuring the subject’s spatial, color and stereoscopic performance. The next sections provide an introduction to the initial screening that might be undertaken to determine normal vision...|$|R
40|$|Aims The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how families who have multiple autistic children function. Methods 11 families were recruited and included in the study. The number of children per family varied between two and six, with up to four autistic children in a family. Married, single parent, and non married partnerships were sampled. 44 semi-structured interviews were untaken with mothers, fathers, children with autism and their siblings. These were transcribed and analysed using Grounded Theory. A selection of transcripts was read by another researcher and the findings were sent to families for checking. Results A variety of themes emerged from the data, including the use of practical strategies to reduce behavioural problems, the place of emotions in coping, the use of statutory and other services and the views of verbal autistic children and their siblings. A theoretical model encompassing the families’ views of their children as normal was developed and highlighted that families dislike being pitied and pathologised by the non-autistic world. A surprising finding was that families with several autistic children in large families found coping easier, as they were more able to normalise the autistic children. Although several different types of emotions were expressed at the time of the diagnosis, there was also an overwhelming sense of relief. All of the families found there were several positive attributes to caring for autistic children. A small minority of families had very negative experiences and the reasons for these are discussed in my presentation. Conclusions Families rely mainly on their own internal family members for support, including grandparents, rather than on outside services. The Early Bird parent support scheme received high praise, with more criticism for education, social care and some health services. The main advice for newly diagnosed families was to treat <b>your</b> children as <b>normal</b> as much as possible, and to plan your day and activities ahead. ...|$|R
