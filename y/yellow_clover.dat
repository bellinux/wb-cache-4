The smooth and springy sward that {{stretched}} {{in front of the}} house was all composed of a tiny <b>yellow</b> <b>clover.</b> It gave beneath the foot like the pile on velvet. One's gaze looked forth from it upon the endless middle distances of the oak-clad Weald, with the uncertain blue line of the South Downs in the background. Ridge behind ridge, the long, low hills of paludina limestone stood out in successive tiers, each thrown up against its neighbor by the misty haze that broods eternally over the wooded valley; till, roaming across them all, the eye rested at last on the rearing scarp of Chanctonbury Ring, faintly pencilled on the furthest skyline. Shadowy phantoms of dim heights framed the verge to east and west. Alan Merrick drank it in with profound satisfaction.

5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of the honey extractor almost all honey produced was in the form of comb honey. Today, most honey is produced for extraction but comb honey remains popular among consumers both for eating 'as is' and for combining with extracted honey to make chunk honey. Hobbyists and sideliners can develop their beekeeping skills by producing comb honey, which takes more rigorous attention to beekeeping than the production of extracted honey. Because of the more demanding labor involved, comb honey has greater retail value than extracted honey. ($17/pound compared to $6.50/pound US). [...] Comb honey production is more suitable for areas with an intense prolonged honeyflow from eucalyptus, alfalfa, alsike, and <b>yellow</b> <b>clover.</b> Wooded areas are not as suitable for comb honey production, as bees tend to collect more propolis, making the harvesting of comb honey more difficult.

The legumes were milkvetch (Astragalus cicer), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and <b>yellow</b> sweet <b>clover</b> (Melilotus officinalis). All milkvetch plants survived inoculation with all nematode populations, while alfalfa and <b>yellow</b> sweet <b>clover</b> were more susceptible. On <b>yellow</b> sweet <b>clover,</b> MHCA was most pathogenic at 30 °C based on suppression of shoot growth while MHUT, MHWY, and MCUT were most pathogenic at 25 °C.

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are potentially carcinogenic compounds found in high concentrations in manufactured gas plant (MGP) residues. However, PAHs in soils contaminated with these residues are often highly resistant to degradation, particularly after the soils have been remediated with conventional {{techniques such as}} composting or land treatment. Phytoremediation holds promise as a finishing procedure for traditional approaches when significant PAH concentrations are present. Two greenhouse studies investigated {{the fate of the}} 16 EPA priority pollutant PAHs in MGP soil using phytoremediation as a secondary treatment. In the first study, contaminated soil was composted, and then planted with tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), and <b>yellow</b> sweet <b>clover</b> (Melilotus officinalis). Total PAH concentrations decreased after 12 months in treatments with tall fescue, annual ryegrass, and <b>yellow</b> sweet <b>clover</b> by 23. 9 %, 15. 3 %, and 9. 1 %, respectively. Tall fescue and annual ryegrass both had significantly higher root surface area than <b>yellow</b> sweet <b>clover,</b> but were not significantly different from one another. The PAH-degrader populations were not significantly different between treatments. ^ In the second study, contaminated soil was land treated, and then planted in the greenhouse with tall fescue and <b>yellow</b> sweet <b>clover.</b> To evaluate the impact of root decay on contaminant dissipation, plants were killed in some of the vegetated pots to induce root decay. Significant differences were noted between treatments for seven PAHs, with unkilled <b>yellow</b> sweet <b>clover</b> resulting in 60 – 75 % degradation of these compounds. The PAH degrader populations in the vegetated treatments were over 100 times greater than that of the unvegetated control. The PLFA structural group profile shifted over time, indicating a change in the community structure. A final study evaluated the lability of the PAHs in the soil from both greenhouse experiments. Resin-extractable PAHs (assumed to be bioavailable) decreased significantly during the greenhouse experiments. For five PAHs in the compost samples and three PAHs in the land-treated samples, the planted soils had lower available concentrations than unplanted soils; for the remaining PAHs, no differences existed. Phytoremediation is clearly capable of enhancing contaminant dissipation beyond that of conventional biotreatment techniques. ...|$|R

The project is testing the effects of four water catchment treatments (natural, seeded, compacted, and salted and compacted) on the establishment and production of four plant species (<b>yellow</b> <b>clover,</b> crested wheatgrass, four-wing saltbush, and western wheatgrass). The site consists of three parallel mounds or catchment areas (with 13 to 16 % slope) alternating with two topsoiled (10 to 12 inches deep) collection valleys (800 feet long and 120 feet apart). This past growing season was dry (3. 35 inches). Despite the drought, plants did establish and survive. The plant density was not high, but it greatly exceeded that of Peabody's reclaimed and planted areas. Even in places where some plants germinated early in the season, the subsequent dry period took an extremely high toll. At present the vegetation on the site is undergoing severe stress, but with decreasing temperatures it appears likely that survival will remain satisfactory until freezing weather.

40|$|The aphid Therioaphis trifolii (Monell) is {{indigenous}} {{to the western}} Palaearctic region, where it colonizes lucerne (alfalfa), clovers and related legumes. A form of the species, T. trifolii f. maculata (the spotted alfalfa aphid, SAA), has been known in Australia since 1977, feeding almost exclusively on Medicago sativa (lucerne). Since 1989, T. trifolii {{has been found in}} Australia colonizing Trifolium subterraneum (subclover). We have compared samples of T. trifolii in Australia collected on lucerne and subclover using several techniques: survival and reproduction on different hosts, morphology, cuticular hydrocarbon profile, karyology, and a combination of RAPD-PCR and mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome oxidase) genetic markers. Whereas there were no distinct differences in cuticular hydrocarbons and karyology, we found significant correlated differences between the host on which aphids were collected, some morphological characters, and the genotypes of the aphids. Aphids collected from lucerne were always of one genetic type, and nearly all those from subclover were of another. Both groups of aphids are morphologically distinguishable from the <b>yellow</b> <b>clover</b> aphid (YCA), the other form of the species recognized so far. We conclude that the clover-colonizers (spotted clover aphid, SCA) and the lucerne-colonizers (SAA) are each host-restricted forms (biotypes) of T. trifolii. Estimates of mtDNA divergence are in the range of conspecific to closely congeneric, as compared with other insects including aphids.

40|$|Alfalfa is {{a source}} for viruses that may be {{acquired}} by aphids and transmitted to snap bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L. Snap bean fields in proximity to alfalfa could have {{an increased risk of}} virus infection. Knowledge of the abundance and temporal and spatial dispersal patterns of commonly encountered aphids in commercial snap bean fields, varying in distance from alfalfa, could provide insight into this risk. Alate aphids were monitored using water pan traps in snap bean and alfalfa fields that were adjacent to or > 1 km away from each other. The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), was the most common aphid species captured in early-planted snap bean fields in 2002 and 2003 (56 and 23 % of total, respectively), whereas the corn leaf aphid, Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch), also was common in 2003 (15 % of total). In contrast, the <b>yellow</b> <b>clover</b> aphid, Therioaphis trifolii (Monell), and soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, were the most abundant species trapped in late-planted snap bean fields in 2002 (77 % of total) and 2003 (64 % of total), respectively. These species were prevalent in traps in alfalfa as well. The abundance and temporal dispersal patterns of these species in snap beans adjacent to and > 1 km away from alfalfa were similar, suggesting that the risk for virus infection may not be affected by proximity to alfalfa. A similar number of alate aphids also were captured along snap bean field edges and field centers, regardless of their proximity to alfalfa. This suggests that the aphids dispersed into snap bean randomly rather than directionally from the field edge. The implication of these results is that separating snap bean fields from alfalfa or using crop borders/barriers {{are not likely to be}} successful virus management strategie...|$|E

Lucerne and <b>yellow</b> sweet <b>clover</b> had the lowest α-tocopherol concentrations (21 − 23 mg kg− 1 DM) and salad burnet and ribwort plantain the highest (77 − 85 mg kg− 1 DM); β-carotene concentrations were lowest in lucerne, salad burnet, and <b>yellow</b> sweet <b>clover</b> (26 − 33 mg kg− 1 DM) and highest in caraway, birdsfoot trefoil, and ribwort plantain (56 − 61 mg kg− 1 DM).
