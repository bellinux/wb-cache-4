5000|$|In 2000, Iglesias {{performed}} at the Super Bowl XXXIV halftime show alongside Christina Aguilera, Phil Collins, and Toni Braxton. Shock jock Howard Stern repeatedly played a tape of a supposedly very off-key Iglesias on his radio show and accused the Iglesias {{of not being able}} to sing live. On 8 June 2000, Iglesias sang the song live on Stern's show with just a guitar accompanying him. After the performance, Stern remarked, [...] "I respect <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> here; you really can sing". Iglesias noted that the off-key recording was also him, but that it was probably a recording made during a television taping where he was required to lip sync. He would remark that the controversy was the best promotion he could have. The album's single [...] "Be With You" [...] became Iglesias's second number one single on Billboards Hot 100.|$|E

By gates in this place we are to {{understand}} the way of entrance; gates, <b>you</b> know, are <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> and <b>for</b> going out (Jer 17:19,20); and do in this place signify two things. First, An entrance into communion with the God and Saviour of this city. Secondly, Entrance into communion with the inhabitants and privileges of this city; in both which the gates do signify Christ: for as no man {{can come to the}} knowledge and enjoyment of the God, and glorious Saviour, but by and through the Lord Christ; so no man can come into true and spiritual communion with these inhabitants, but by him also: 'I am the way,' saith he, 'and the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me': and again, 'I am the door, by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture' (John 10:1-9; 14:6).|$|R
40|$|Explains {{how to read}} {{advanced}} MRI easily by precise {{correlation of}} clinical 3 T MRI with 2 - 4 mm thick sections of the brain - Includes {{more than a thousand}} images displaying nuclear anatomy, fiber tractography, and vascularization of the brain stem and cerebellum in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes - Presents organized series of diagrams and images to teach with a minimum of text - Prepares <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> advances <b>in</b> technology with 9. 4 T images of the brain stem that rival light microscopy Advanced MRI requires a sophisticated knowledge of anatomy. This volume gives you that knowledge by correlating the thin-section brain anatomy with corresponding clinical 3 T MR images in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. You’ll quickly learn the anatomic bases for advanced MR imaging. The international team of authors correlates advanced neuromelanin imaging, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and diffusion tensor tractography with clinical 3 and 4 T MRI. This illustrates the precise nuclear and fiber tract anatomy imaged by these techniques. Each region of the brain stem is then analyzed with 9. 4 T MRI to show the anatomy of the medulla, pons, midbrain, and portions of the diencephalonin with an in-plane resolution comparable to myelin- and Nissl-stained light microscopy (40 - 60 microns). The atlas is expertly designed as a teaching text, using carefully organized diagrams and images to teach with a minimum of text. You’ll learn how to read advanced MRI easily by precise correlation of clinical 3 T MRI with 2 - 4 mm thick sections of the brain. Written for: Radiologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, neuroscientists working in brain physiology and MR physicists Keywords: - brain stem - magnet resonance imaging - radiolog...|$|R

"I have {{something}} of a surprise <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> <b>In</b> <b>coming</b> to a settlement [...] with Pelter, Japson & Company, they notified {{me that they were}} [...] going out of business in New York City.

Both Pelter and Japson have [...] offered to turn over to us the entire contents of their offices in [...] Wall Street, along with their lease.

6000|$|The course which Draper was {{to pursue}} in his {{interview}} with Harry had been arranged between the Baroness and her man of business on the previous day. Draper was an able man, and likely in most cases to do a client good service: he failed in the present instance because he was piqued and angry, or, more likely still, {{because he could not}} understand the gentleman with whom he had to deal. I presume that he who casts his eye on the present page is the most gentle of readers. Gentleman, as you unquestionably are, then, my dear sir, have you not remarked in your dealings with people who are no gentlemen, that you offend them not knowing the how or the why? So the man who is no gentleman offends you in a thousand ways of which the poor creature has no idea himself. He does or says something which provokes your scorn. He perceives that scorn (being always on the watch, and uneasy about himself, his manners and behaviour) and he rages. You speak to him naturally, and he fancies still that you are sneering at him. You have indifference towards him, but he hates you, and hates you the worse because you don't care. [...] "Gumbo, a chair to Mr. Draper!" [...] says Mr. Warrington, folding his brocaded dressing-gown round his legs as he sits on the dingy bed. [...] "Sit down, if you please, and let us talk my business over. Much obliged to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> so soon <b>in</b> reply to my message. Had you heard of this piece of ill-luck before?" ...|$|R
