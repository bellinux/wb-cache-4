500|$|Mother's Milk {{features}} {{an array of}} musical styles in its thirteen tracks. Among the songs that surfaced from the Hully Gully sessions in early 1989, [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] {{became one of the}} most radical shifts in style for the band. The introspective lyrics, which analyze the death of Hillel Slovak and the devastating effect drugs can have on life, were a new approach for Kiedis, who primarily wrote of sexual intercourse and a hedonistic lifestyle. The vocalist did not, however, want the track to be associated with [...] "anti-drug" [...] sentiments, claiming, [...] " [...] is about letting your friends know that <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>help</b> and then being willing to accept the help of others when you need it, whether it's from drugs, or from a number of other personal problems." [...] According to music journalist Jeff Apter, the song [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was [...] "clearly the most important track the band had ever laid down; it proved that these Peppers were more than knuckleheads with socks hanging off their cocks." [...] Musically, the track integrates the Chili Peppers' typical punk influences, but asserts heavier emphasis on melody and harmonics that lead into more alternative territory. [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was originally recorded to be a duet between Kiedis and Frusciante, but the song was remixed before being released as a single; the new mix accidentally highlighted the guitarist's voice instead of Kiedis'.|$|E
2500|$|Olson, Jason, Ferrari, and Hutcheson (2005) {{reviewed}} the existent literature on four mutual-help organizations (Alcoholics Anonymous, Oxford House, GROW, and Schizophrenics Anonymous). They {{suggest that the}} processes of change framework found within the transtheoretical model of intentional behavior change (Prochaska, Diclemente, and Norcross, 1992) is a useful model to conceptualize the activities of mutual-help organization members throughout their journey of mental health recovery. They explicitly link social liberation, {{the last of the}} ten processes of change articulated by the model (the others being: consciousness raising, self-reevaluation, helping relationships, self-liberation, environmental reevaluation, dramatic relief/emotional arousal, stimulus control, reinforcement management, and counterconditioning) to the helper-therapy principle, along with a related concept known as bidirectional support (Maton, 1988). Per Olson et al. (2005), social liberation [...] "involves the person in recovery focusing attention away from oneself and developing a broader recognition of social issues that contributed to the targeted problem" [...] which encourages [...] "recovering individuals to take more helping-related attitudes toward others who face similar problems" [...] (p.174). In reviewing the research conducted among members of these four self-help/mutual-help organizations, they identify three different mechanisms which might underlie the therapeutic effect of mutual-help: (1) when an individual helps another, the helper's social functioning improves because the act of providing help to another allows the helper to work through their own difficulties; (2) when an individual helps another, the helper's social functioning improves because the act of providing help to another allows the helper to reinforce their own personal learning about recovery; and/or (3) when an individual helps another, the helper experiences an increase in their own sense of competence and usefulness to others and enables the helper to adopt a [...] "strength-based roles that have not been fully exercised in other areas of life" [...] (p.175). In reviewing the research on GROW, specifically, 67% of members of this organization sampled by Young and Williams (1987) who were asked how they most benefited from participation reported that involvement in GROW [...] "taught [...] could help others" [...] (the most endorsed answer among all listed categories). As suggested by a study by Maton and Salem (1995), this idea is most succinctly expressed by way of an axiom of GROW which is often recited at meetings: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>help,</b> help others." ...|$|E
