For example, questions such as [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something in a few minutes' time and then forget to do it?" [...] assessed prospective memory, short-term memory, and self-cued memory. Questions such as [...] "Do you repeat the same story to the same person on different occasions?"

B told me {{that her mother had}} given it to her more than 20 years ago, when she was diagnosed with a serious medical condition. “Oh? ” I asked. My curiosity was piqued—B hadn’t reported any important family history. Her mother, it turned out, had Huntington’s disease. The necklace was a gift, given before her mother died and before Huntington’s wreaked its significant cognitive and physical havoc. I probed a little further: “What have <b>you</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about genetic testing for your-self? ” “I was tested, ” B told me.

Methodology is how researchers make their epistemology and theoretical stance work for them in their research.

40|$|What is breast {{reconstruction}}? Breast reconstruction {{is a type}} {{of surgery}} for women who have had all or part of a breast removed. The surgery rebuilds the breast mound so that it is about the same size and shape as it was before. The nipple and the darker area around the nipple (areola) can also be added. Most women who have had a breast removed (mastectomy) can have reconstruction. Women who have had only the part of the breast around the cancer removed (lumpectomy) may not need reconstruction. Breast reconstruction is done by a plastic surgeon. Here are some facts to help you better understand the process and the words used when talking about breast reconstruction. Some of the words you might hear doctors use are also explained in the glossary {{at the end of this}} information. The choice to have breast reconstruction is yours to make. We hope this information will help you make your decision. Try to learn as much as you can before <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> what <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> No one source of information can give you every fact or all the answers you need. You and those close to you should talk with your healthcare team about any questions and concerns you have about this type of surgery...|$|R
