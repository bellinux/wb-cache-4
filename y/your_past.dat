5|$|Late in 1975, EMI/Capitol {{had issued}} greatest-hits {{collections}} on the Apple Records imprint for Lennon and Starr – Shaved Fish and Blast from <b>Your</b> <b>Past,</b> respectively. Since Lennon and Starr were still nominally Apple artists, they each had {{input into the}} content and packaging of their solo compilation, and Lennon, in particular, was active in promoting his album. Shaved Fish and Blast from <b>Your</b> <b>Past</b> sold reasonably well, in America, but their sales failed to match record-company expectations. For Harrison, there had been long delays between releases following the international success of his All Things Must Pass triple album in 1970–71, due first to {{his commitment to the}} Bangladesh humanitarian aid project and later to his production work for Dark Horse Records acts Splinter and Ravi Shankar. Harrison issued his final studio album for Apple in the autumn of 1975, Extra Texture (Read All About It). As a result, by the time that Capitol came to prepare a compilation of his solo work the following year, he had effectively surrendered all artistic control over its content.|$|E

The original version has appeared on Starr's compilation albums Blast from <b>Your</b> <b>Past</b> and , and as a bonus track on his remastered 1974 studio album Goodnight Vienna.

500|$|Some {{commentators}} consider [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] {{to be one}} of Starr's signature tunes. In his contemporary {{review for}} Rolling Stone, Ben Gerson praised it as a song on which [...] "a stunning alchemy occurs"; author Peter Doggett likens the track to a [...] "lost gem" [...] from the Beatles' Abbey Road album. [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] was later included on Starr's compilations Blast from <b>Your</b> <b>Past</b> (1975) and [...] (2007). Starr has often performed it in concert with his All-Starr Band, whose second album, [...] (1993), opens with the song. A version from the 1973 recording session with Lennon on lead vocals appeared on the 1998 box set John Lennon Anthology.|$|E
500|$|... 'Judas' is {{a metaphor}} and an analogy about {{forgiveness}} and betrayal and things that haunt you {{in your life and}} how I believe that it's the darkness in your life that ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone once said to me, 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from <b>your</b> <b>past</b> in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just like really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E

In the same article, Chiba recalls thinking, [...] "Okay, you're asking a lot of yourself. You're giving up a lot at once." [...] Chiba further explained that [...] "anyone who understands drug abuse knows that you use drugs to hide from <b>your</b> <b>past</b> or sedate yourself from strong, overwhelming feelings. So when you're newly clean and coming off the medications that have been masking all those feelings, that's when you're the most vulnerable." [...] Writing for SPIN, Liam Gowing also encountered a local musician who stated that Smith had said to him: [...] "The people who try to intervene, they're good people who genuinely care about you. But they don't know what you're going through. Do what you need to do." [...] According to the musician, Smith had adamantly dissuaded him from suicide.|$|E

According to Greg Kot, the album was [...] "hardly a black power manifesto for world domination, but a statement about racial paranoia. Though he spares virtually no one with his withering raps, Public Enemy's Chuck D is harshest of all on his fellow blacks, expounding on everything from history to fashion: Use your brain instead of a gun. Drugs are death. Know <b>your</b> <b>past</b> so you won't screw up the future. Gold chains worn around the neck demean the brotherhood in South Africa." [...] Kot wrote of Chuck D's perspective and the theme of fear, [...] "It's fear that divides us, he says; understand me better and you won't run. Fear of a Black Planet is about achieving that understanding, but on Public Enemy's terms. In presenting their view of life from an Afro-centric, as opposed to Euro-centric, perspective, P.E. challenges listeners to step into their world." ...|$|E

500|$|Among {{the notable}} {{omissions}} from The Best of George Harrison, in author Robert Rodriguez's opinion, were [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] – {{one half of}} the double A-side single with [...] "My Sweet Lord", and a number 1 hit in Canada in its own right – and [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong", which charted just inside the top 40 in the main markets of America and Britain but was a top ten hit in Europe. In comparison, Shaved Fish had contained [...] "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)", [...] "Mother" [...] and [...] "Woman Is the Nigger of the World", singles which, on the US Billboard Hot 100, respectively: did not chart at all; peaked at number 43; and reached number 57. On Blast from <b>Your</b> <b>Past,</b> the non-album B-side [...] "Early 1970" [...] was included, as were [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] (an album track never released as a single) and [...] "Beaucoups of Blues", which peaked at number 87 in the United States. On those terms, Harrison had the popular 1971 B-sides [...] "Apple Scruffs" [...] and [...] "Deep Blue"; [...] "Ding Dong", which peaked at number 36 on Billboard; and highly regarded album tracks such as [...] "All Things Must Pass", [...] "Beware of Darkness" [...] and [...] "Living in the Material World". Commentators have remarked also on the brevity of Starr's album, at just 30 minutes in length, whereas Capitol felt the need to achieve a running time of 45 minutes for the Harrison compilation.|$|E

Instead, Lois helped Clark do {{what he needs to}} do to get away and fulfill his destiny without telling him that she knows. The producers explained that there would be [...] "some twists and turns" [...] before Lois tells Clark that she knows.

2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember <b>your</b> <b>past</b> states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E
