40|$|Abstract. Registration of {{scientific}} primary data, {{to make these}} data citable as a unique piece of work and not {{only a part of}} a publication, has always been an important issue. With the new digital library techniques, it is finally made possible. In the context of the project ”Publication and Citation of Scientific Primary Data ” founded by the German research foundation (DFG) the German national library of science and technology (TIB) has become the first registration agency worldwide for scientific primary data. The datasets receive unique DOIs and URNs as citable identifiers and all relevant metadata information is stored at the online library cataloque. Registration has started for the field of earth science, but will be widened for other subjects in 2005. In this paper we will give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> overview about the project and the registration of primary data. ...|$|E
40|$|Handout {{written by}} Julie Zelenski with minor edits by Keith Schwarz. flex is a fast lexical {{analyzer}} generator. You specify the scanner {{you want in}} the form of patterns to match and actions to apply for each token. flex takes your specification and generates a combined NFA to recognize all your patterns, converts it to an equivalent DFA, minimizes the automaton as much as possible, and generates C code that will implement it. flex is similar to another tool, lex, designed by Lesk and Schmidt, and bears many similarities to it. While we will use flex in the course, almost all features we use are also present in the original lex. This handout is designed to give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> introduction to the flex tool.

40|$|Most {{books and}} reports on network {{security}} focus on encryption. To many people-including some experts-network security is encryption, and {{the sole purpose}} of network security is to prevent wiretapping. But the total network security problem is far more than the wiretapping threat, and encryption is just part of the solution. Understanding network security entails understanding network architectures, from the standpoints of protocol design and of physical construction and topologies. It also entails understanding how encryption techniques can be applied to solve part of the network security problem. In the first two sections that follow, we shall develop some terminology important to network security and some fundamental concepts of networking and encryption; then we shall undertake a detailed discussion of network security architectures. 13. 1 OVERVIEW OF NETWORKING CONCEPTS This section gives <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> overview of various salient characteristics of network architectures.

40|$|Most {{of us have}} {{at least}} one {{conversation}} that we know we ought to be having but we are putting it off because {{it is likely to be}} challenging for us. Even though only a small proportion of our total relationships involve challenging conversations, they determine our effectiveness and consume a great deal of our energy in planning, worrying, regretting, griping, talking with others and so on. To the extent that we have effective ways of dealing with difficult conversation we have more mental and emotional energy to do our work and live our lives with vitality and engagement. Being able to speak and listen in ways that build engagement, commitment and learning with anybody gives us tremendous power to shape our own lives. One way to understand the skills required for success in challenging conversations is outlined by Jentz (2007) in the attached reading. These notes have been prepared to give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> overview and reminder of the content of that chapter but the chapter itself is worth reading. The three skill sets are: 1.

40|$|Oman - The early mission {{operational}} {{problems caused}} by space motion sickness have been largely resolved in recent years. This has been achieved by appropriate timeline adjustments, voluntary head movement restriction, and judicious use of promethazine. Crew members now simply accept that some symptoms "come with the job," and usually last only a few days. But as more people have flown longer flights, we've seen cases of space sickness and inversion illusion that take several weeks to resolve. Visual reorientation illusions continue throughout long flights, and occasionally cause difficulties. EVA astronauts sometimes suddenly fear they will {{fall out of the}} payload bay or off of the RMS or Strella arms. Orientation and navigation in three dimensions in the MIR station reportedly does not come naturally, because modules have different visual verticals. It is clear that the neurovestibular problems of spaceflight have not disappeared. After return to Earth, many crew members are disoriented and ataxic in the first hour after return, and require assistance leaving the vehicle, Flight surgeons say that the longer the mission, the stronger the aftereffects, certain of which last for weeks. We do not yet know how to predict who will be afflicted. Looking ahead to 3 - 4 month long voyages to Mars, it seems obvious that if cruise is in O-G, the crew may encounter neurovestibular problems on arrival. Artificial G may be broadly effective as a countermeasure for many of the physiological changes of spaceflight, but from the neurovestibular perspective, it is a double-edged sword. We know that the Coriolis stimulus resulting from rotation is potentially disorienting and nauseogenic. But we don't yet know how much artificial G will be enough, nor how successfully people can adapt to a specific angular velocity and hypo G level. Development of countermeasures remains a big challenge for our neurovestibular community. Maintaining an interdisciplinary perspective is important. Three examples were presented at this meeting: 1) Transgenic animal experiments suggest that in addition to the light illumination cycle, vestibular inputs may also serve as an important input to the circadian system. 2) Radiation can cause important CNS effects in animals, including loss of spatial memory. 3) As described in our session, otolith inputs may contribute to cardiovascular regulation of orthostatic tolerance. Over the past three days, we've all enjoyed catching up with old friends, and making many new ones. On behalf of my colleagues, I want to thank Al Coats and the USRA DSLS staff for the great job they did in running this meeting. And keeping the emphasis on fun. And also my Co- Chair, Mal Cohen, who had more stamina than many of us, despite major surgery only three weeks ago.
