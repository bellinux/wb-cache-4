6000|$|BURGE [hotly] I deny it. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{never been}} poor. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never cleaned my own boots. You think my fingers have never come {{out through the}} soles when I was {{cleaning}} them. You think-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{are very}} kind,' {{returned}} Mr. Pickwick, shaking {{me by the}} hand again; 'you are so exactly what I expected! But for what particular purpose do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> sought you, my dear sir? [...] Now what DO <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come for?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't mention it,' said Mrs. Alicumpaine. 'I {{shall be}} too glad. But what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come for, ma'am? Guess, ma'am.' ...|$|E
6000|$|FENWICK. Know it? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> cannot guess? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not heard}} he {{followed}} <b>you?</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not suffered--O, suffered! George Austin is the man. Dear shall he pay it! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better go?' said Hurree Babu, half rising. 'They are, of course, dematerialized phenomena. Spencer says.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you asked}} me {{a little while ago}} whether <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left the Church, <b>I</b> let <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had.</b> <b>I</b> am still {{connected}} with St. John's, but I do not know how long I shall continue to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Floy,' said Paul, {{holding a}} ringlet of {{her dark hair}} in his hand. 'Tell me, dear, Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> grown old-fashioned?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... --Of course, I am, said Lynch. If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> an excrementitious {{intelligence}} {{run after}} Donovan {{and ask him}} to listen to you.|$|E
6000|$|When {{they were}} gone into the heath again Yeobright said quietly to his mother, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> turned teacher too soon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly! As Colonel Roseberry's daughter, she is {{connected}} with me by marriage already. Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> picked up a foundling?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perfectly well, Jack; it was bravely obtained, {{and neatly}} extracted; but don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better apply an oil to these bruises?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know where,' said Miss Wren, staring about her. 'But I {{never heard}} such odd noises. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better call somebody?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been wronged," [...] said Newman, {{with that}} oddly humorous accent {{with which he}} often uttered words of the gravest meaning.|$|E

6000|$|Now, reader, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{made out}} a good case, let me entreat you to go, with Brown in your eye, [...] "and do likewise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very nearly. You {{had better}} go {{and put that}} test-tube back in {{what is left of}} the safe now. Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{forgotten}} it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I ought," [...] said he. [...] "I did {{not think}} of that. And now, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better, <b>I</b> will go and carry them right back." ...|$|R
6000|$|He met her clear gaze. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of {{all this}} business, Eleanor?" [...] he asked abruptly. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a sort of fit in the cathedral?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, father; I am as warm as need be; {{and what}} do <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got thirty-eight bob and some coppers which they 'scribed for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Without answering, she asked, 'Whom, of {{all people}} on earth, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> met? Mr. Somerset! Has he been here?--he passed me almost without speaking!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Point blank! Sitting in my cedar parlour! Phoebe, you'll be {{the death}} of me,' cried Cilly, between peals of merriment. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> nerves of brass?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> best do next?" [...] {{asked the}} senator's son. The {{unexpected}} turn of affairs had bewildered him {{almost as much}} as it had bewildered Mrs. Carmody.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{better go}} along?" [...] asked Tom. [...] "Chester Waltham {{may be in}} a fix and need assistance. And, besides, they may both be more hurt than Grace said." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{mean that}} I seldom follow it. And so <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better employ a {{professional}} companion--a decayed gentlewoman--than save this young girl from going {{out as a}} governess and beginning to decay at twenty-three?" ...|$|R
6000|$|This calm {{assumption}} of superiority upset me not a little, and I answered peremptorily: [...] "Indeed, you old ruffian! What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> given you money for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but I {{have made}} an {{arrangement}} which I did not anticipate; and so I posted after you at once. Whom do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> brought with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Take it,” she said. “I haven’t {{the courage}} to deliver myself up to Therese. No. Not even for your sake. Don’t <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been miserable enough yet?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle George," [...] said Rollo, after {{a little}} pause, [...] "I saw some very pretty gold chains in a window near here; there was one {{just long enough for}} my watch. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better buy it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{rather go}} at it at once, and forget all about other people. You must teach me consideration, Mrs. Edmonstone, and in the {{meantime}} will you tell me what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better do about this scrape?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{any money}} to spare? Your father's pocketbook tempted me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen him open it, to pay his bill over-night. It was full of bank-notes. Oh, what an overpowering thing love is! Perhaps you have known it yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're getting damned virtuous {{all of a}} sudden," [...] growled Malbihn. [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{forgotten}} about the inn keeper's daughter, and little Celella, and that nigger at--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hear it? What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say, then? I am not {{to marry}} you, and that's enough. Your letter was {{excellently}} plain. I {{want you to}} hear nothing--not I." ...|$|E
6000|$|Write to me, my Isa, and do me {{good with}} your tender, warm thoughts. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no comfort in feeling them stroke me softly {{through the dark}} and distance? ...|$|E
6000|$|But Miss Starbrow was {{not willing}} to let him depart before giving him another taste of her resentment.

6000|$|MAZZINI [affectionately]. Oh, well, I {{know what}} a {{nuisance}} parents are, dear. I will be good and go. [He goes to the garden door].

6000|$|... "There wasn't any trouble, Sam--at least, I didn't {{make any}} trouble," [...] she repeated; and then, as {{he caught her}} arm and dragged her into the shop, she murmured: [...] "Oh, I--I feel so funny {{to go into a}} store for a thing like that!
