500|$|Chang called Dylan's father [...] "a stiff Asian stereotype", while Mohan of The Oregonian {{found it}} {{contradictory}} for an anti-racist film to contain such depiction. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian even {{claimed that the}} line [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> beat a little black girl" [...] (spoken by Dylan's father) signifies that Atchison [...] "thinks it's all right to bring in racism by making the Asians the racists." [...] Metro Silicon Valleys Richard von Busack commented that [...] "tepping around black stereotypes, the film squishes its two left feet right in the mire of Asian stereotyping." [...] Beth Accomando of KPBS also criticized Dylan and his father's portrayal as [...] "painful cliches", while Schager of Slant Magazine found it not authentic, even likening Dylan's father to Mao Zedong.|$|E
500|$|Director of {{photography}} Bill Roe later {{stated that he}} borrowed motifs from Steven Soderbergh's 2000 film Traffic {{for some of the}} shots. In addition, before filming, he decided to do various test shots to get the lighting right. The crew ended up shooting [...] "exteriors three, four stops over what you should shoot it at", resulting in very washed out outdoor scenes. Roe and his crew had a hard time developing the various lighting contrasts for the episode. When talking about the episode, Roe said: [...] "it was really dark so we had this huge contrast of lighting. It was dark and warm and brown. When you go inside, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> see things, but when you're outside, it's just blaring." [...] To create the Mexican town featured in the episode, scenes were filmed at a small town located outside of Los Angeles. A matte of the town's background and blue sky were then cut and a faux Mexican background was added. In addition, Mat Beck was given a flyer, and he duplicated it, making several strings of posters that did not exist when the shots were filmed.|$|E
500|$|Producer Oren Koules told horror news website ShockTilYouDrop.com {{that there}} are eleven traps in the film, the most ever in the franchise. [...] There is one [...] "trap" [...] scene in the film that {{producers}} would not allow in previous Saw films that they described as [...] "too violent", [...] "too disgusting", and [...] "just wrong". [...] Melton later confirmed that was the [...] "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a [...] "chain reaction" [...] with other characters. Gabby West {{was part of the}} trap. She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary! They put so much of it on, you can't see and they put it in your ears so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> hear anything. That was part of the prep for the film, which was really cool, to have a dummy made of yourself. But scary." [...] Over 25 gallons of fake blood was used in the film, which was two and half times more than Saw II.|$|E
5000|$|AllMusic's Stewart Mason {{wrote that}} Blaze of Glory was [...] "about as D.I.Y. as it gets.... {{recorded}} in leader Scott Miller's old bedroom at his parents' house in Sacramento, CA, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just <b>barely</b> hear his mom running {{the vacuum cleaner}} downstairs at one point."

500|$|Executive {{producers}} J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pickner {{were both}} impressed with Torv's {{take on the}} role, with Wyman stating that it [...] "just transcended all our expectations", while Pinkner noted that Nimoy himself was [...] "the most proud and most impressed" [...] with the outcome. Actor Joshua Jackson found her performance [...] "so creepy". He explained, [...] "In the episodes, <b>you</b> see I <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> look at her. I think it ended up being {{a good way to}} play Peter’s reaction to Olivia, but it was born out of the fact that when that voice came out of her, I was like: ‘Oh, that’s just wrong!'" [...] Pinkner confirmed in an interview with TVline that Bell's appearance would last for [...] "a couple" [...] episodes, and also warned that [...] "cohabitation is not as benign as William assumes it is", a reference to problems Bell would soon have in Olivia's body. The possessed state of Olivia has led viewers to refer to her as [...] "Bellivia".|$|R
5000|$|The urge to truthful {{reproduction}} of horror that prevails here outgrown two scenes, already almost exceed {{the limit of}} the expressible. One: a single battle ends with an infantryman is nipped in the swamp in front of everyone. (The fact that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still see protrude from the bubbling mud later a dead hand, is unnecessary sensationalism.) The other is the front military hospital in the church with the maimed, nurses and doctors who <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> operate their craft farther from exhaustion.

500|$|In the Easter 2007 episode, Dot {{takes an}} {{abandoned}} baby she finds in a church. This was filmed in Kent at Stansted, St. Giles Church in Wormshill, The Ringlestone Inn near Harrietsham and Court Lodge Farm. After being {{contacted by the}} child's Ukrainian mother Anya, Dot offers to care for both of them, however Jim turns Anya in to the authorities for being an illegal immigrant. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury questioned the plausibility of the storyline, observing: [...] "Babies aren't abandoned {{in the real world}} very often. But <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> cross [...] Square [...] without tripping over poor tots who their mothers don't want." [...] Laws also felt that the speed at which the immigration department operated was [...] "amazingly on-the-ball", when in reality many illegal immigrants [...] "slip through the net". The Daily Mail Jaci Stephen deemed the storyline one of the worst in EastEnders history, writing a critical review in which she opined that the use of the infant playing Tomas was tantamount to abuse, and criticised several scenes which saw the baby [...] "screeching until he was red in the face." [...] Stephen questioned: [...] "How can the show justify this and, more to the point, how can his real-life mother stand by and do nothing to comfort the poor little mite?" ...|$|E
500|$|Feige {{felt that}} the visuals of the film needed [...] "to be a Ditko/Kubrick/Miyazaki/The Matrix mind-trip", and said that [...] "You don't get into it in Harry Potter, but if a {{scientist}} went to Hogwarts he'd find out how some of that stuff is happening! We're not {{going to spend a}} lot of time on that, but there will be some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds." [...] In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like Fantasia and Harry Potter, wanting [...] "to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal. And to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that." [...] Feige called Doctor Strange the [...] "doorway" [...] into the supernatural side of the MCU, a role that Derrickson noted was also served by the character in the early comics, when the Doctor Strange comics [...] "broke open the Marvel comic book universe into the Marvel multiverse". Discussing the portrayal of other dimensions in the film, Feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like the comics' [...] "Earth-616 and Earth 617", but would instead feature [...] "dimensions that are so mind-bending that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> perceive them", like the Astral plane, Dark Dimension, and Mirror Dimension.|$|E
2500|$|Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald {{gave the}} film one star, commenting, [...] "There are enough laughs {{scattered}} throughout A Million Ways to Die in the West that while you're watching it, the movie {{seems like a}} passable comedy. By {{the time you get}} home, though, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> remember the jokes." [...] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the film's running time: [...] "Though the film is hardly laugh-free, its uneven jokes appear to have breezed through a very forgiving editing process." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal too found the film's length [...] "exhausting," [...] noting, [...] "Some of it sputters, settling for smiles instead of laughs, and much of it flounders while the slapdash script searches [...] for ever more common denominators in toilet humor." ...|$|E

Pittnews commented that it [...] "is {{chock full of}} poorly produced, synthesized, and — worst of all — instantly forgettable tracks that are mildly irritating at best, but are usually insufferable." [...] TheChannels said [...] "The lyrics are {{no better than the}} rest of the album. Montag sings about these ideas: how hard it is to handle the paparazzi, how she turns heads everywhere she goes, and how she ignores those that rain on her parade." [...] Limelife gave the album a mixed review, calling some of the songs [...] "catchy", but also said the album [...] "sounds so manufactured, I have no idea what Heidi would sound like without all this technology behind her." [...] HollywoodLife was also gave the album a mixed review, writing [...] "Superficial is just as over-produced as you'd expect a Heidi album to be. In fact, there are some points when <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> hear Heidi's breathy words over busy beats and sporadic whooshing sounds." [...] They did, however, praise the songs [...] "My Parade" [...] and [...] "I'll Do It". Superficial did receive some positive reviews, however, most notably from the LGBT community. Homorazzi gave the album a positive review, and cited songs [...] "Fanatic", [...] "Superficial", and [...] "More Is More" [...] as highlights of the album. MuuMuse also praised the album, calling it [...] "fun", while calling several of the songs [...] "guilty pleasures." ...|$|E

60|$|I did not {{understand}} till long afterwards, when I had watched the fawns many times, how important is this latter suggestion.
