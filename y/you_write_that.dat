2500|$|An October 18, 2006, {{article in}} the Washington Post quotes a recent {{interview}} with Webb concerning the portrayal of ethnic stereotypes in Hollywood. Webb said, [...] "Towel-heads and rednecks -- of which I am one. If <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> word, please say that. I mean, I don't use that pejoratively, I use it defensively. Towel-heads and rednecks became the easy villains in so many movies out there".|$|E

6000|$|... "Now {{that is very}} {{pleasant}}," [...] said my grandmother, as {{she rose}} from the table, [...] "very pleasant indeed; and if <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> you will be away fishing {{for a week or}} two, I shall stay at the Bromleys' longer than I intended,--perhaps until you return." ...|$|E
3000|$|<b>You</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> {{engineering}} {{organizations is}} quite a formidable task. Is it possible to improve on the evolutionary process? [...]...|$|R

6000|$|... 'And do {{you mean}} to say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> upon the {{strength}} of another man's remark, without having tested it by practice?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{would not}} comfort {{him to think}} me disobedient. He will trust me without, and he will know what you think. You are very kind, dear Charlie; but don't persuade me any more, for I can't bear it. I am going away now; but don't fancy I am angry, only I don't think I can sit by while <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> letter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{few hours}} after this that Winterborne, who, curiously enough, had NOT {{perceived}} Grace writing, was clearing away the tree from the front of South's late dwelling. He saw Marty standing in her door-way, a slim figure in meagre black, almost without womanly contours as yet. He went up to her and said, [...] "Marty, why did <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> on my wall last night? It WAS you, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to go in with the' ten-centers' an' wear a calico necktie, why don't you say so?" [...] cried Si, now {{thoroughly}} angry. [...] " [...] If I wanted to, I would," [...] retorted Tom. [...] "I stood by an' saw <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> letter, an' I'll stick to it; but all the same I'm sorry we've done what we have, 'cause whenever we've started anything the girls have always gone in with us, an' it looks mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. He is {{out with}} the farm bailiff. You have taken us all by surprise. <b>You</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> we were to expect you by the next train." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{mixing of}} genres also {{received}} praise from music publication The Music Essentials, which <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> [...] "his latest LP includes tracks from genres like electro and progressive house." [...] We Rave <b>You</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Darude’s ability {{is once again}} proven filling the spectrum from big-room to trance to dubstep-infused depth." ...|$|R
3000|$|<b>You</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> {{the logic}} of {{appropriateness}} may leave individuals to follow rules without, or in spite of, the calculation of consequences and expected utilities. It’s quite surprising to expect a person {{to make a decision}} that intentionally chooses the inferior alternative, isn’t it? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Cargill {{would have}} spoken some ghostly consolation, but she {{answered}} with pettish impatience, [...] "Waste not words--waste not words!--Let me speak that which I must tell, and sign {{it with my}} hand; and do you, as the more immediate servant of God, and therefore bound to {{bear witness to the}} truth, take heed <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> which I tell you, and nothing else. I desired to have told this to St. Ronan's--I have even made some progress in telling it to others--but I am glad I broke short off--for I know you, Josiah Cargill, though you have long forgotten me." ...|$|E
6000|$|With true ingratitude {{you see me}} pitch {{upon your}} exception; but {{it is easier to}} defend oneself {{gracefully}} than to acknowledge praise. [...] I am truly glad that you should like my books; for I think I see from what <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> you are a reader worth convincing. Your name, if I have properly deciphered it, suggests that you may be also something of my countrywoman; for {{it is hard to see}} where Monroe came from, if not from Scotland. I seem to have here a double claim on your good nature: being myself pure Scotch and having appreciated your letter, make up two undeniable merits which, perhaps, if it should be quite without trouble, you might reward with your photograph. - Yours truly, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As the {{friendship}} of the English is, at all events, {{the first and}} [...] most necessary consideration, I will therefore exert myself in [...] establishing peace: for the power of making peace with all is the [...] best object; to this all other measures are subservient, and will [...] certainly be done by them, the English. <b>You</b> <b>write,</b> <b>that,</b> after [...] having laid the foundation of peace with the Pundit Purdhaun, it [...] is requisite that some troops should be sent with General Goddard [...] against Hyder Naig, and take possession of his country, when all [...] those engagements and proposals may be assented to. My reason is [...] confounded in discussing this suggestion, {{at a time when}} Hyder Naig [...] is in every respect in alliance with the Peshwa, and has assisted [...] with his soul and life to repel the English. For us to unite our [...] troops with those of the enemy and extirpate him, would not this [...] fix the stamp of infamy upon us forever? Would any prince, for [...] generations to come, ever after assist us, or unite with the [...] Peshwa? Be yourself the judge, and say whether such a conduct would [...] become a prince or not. Why, then, do you mention it? why do you [...] write it? ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Trigger {{thought it}} might be as well to change the subject for a moment, or, at any rate, to pass on to another clause of the same bill. [...] "I was very sorry, Sir Thomas," [...] said he, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> letter to Mr. Givantake." ...|$|R

5000|$|Jack and Cordie had a {{long life}} together. By the time she died they {{had been married for}} over 63 years. Following her death in 1948 Barker sent a letter of condolence to Potter, who responded, [...] "It was awful nice in <b>you</b> <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> nice letter paying tribute to my dear wife. She though a lot of You and Mrs. B, She was always hearing {{something}} nice from you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Agnes--I {{hope you}} and Jemmy are getting [...] on well in your {{solitude}} without the schoolboys. Tell [...] Charles, when <b>you</b> <b>write,</b> <b>that</b> a gentleman staying here [...] caught a trout {{last week that}} weighed three pounds, but I [...] believe that those which are caught in these rivers taste of [...] mud, and are not nearly so good as our own. I was very [...] much afraid that Gerald would go to school this summer, [...] but now Mrs. Lyddell has heard that it was settled that he [...] should not go till he was ten, and it is arranged for him to [...] stay till next year, when I hope he will be happier than [...] Charles was at first. You asked after his drawing, so I [...] have put in the last scrap I met with, and in case you [...] should {{not be able to}} find out what it is meant for, I must [...] inform you that it is the dog springing on the young Buecleuch. [...] The other day he sent Edmund a letter in hieroglyphics, [...] with pictures instead of nouns, and Edmund answered [...] it in the same way with funny little clever drawings [...] throughout. His regiment is going abroad nest spring, he [...] thinks, to the Cape, but he has promised to come and see us [...] first, and thinks of going home to see about his things. [...] Thank Mrs. Wortley for being so kind as to scold me for [...] not dating my letters. I shall not be likely to forget the [...] date of this on September 30th, for Mr. Lyddell has just [...] paid me my first quarter's allowance, and I am frightened [...] to think how large it is; ten pounds a quarter only for my [...] dress, and I am to have more when I am seventeen. So [...] matters can go on more as they used in the parish. Will [...] you be so kind as to pay this quarter's schooling for Amy [...] Lapthorn and Honor Weeks and Mary Daw, and find out [...] what clothes they want, and if Susan Grey has not a new [...] bonnet, give her one, and a flannel petticoat for old Betty, [...] and if any body else wants anything else let me know, and [...] pay up for all the children that dear mamma used to put into [...] the penny club, and send me word what it comes to, and I [...] will send the money when Edmund comes to pay his visit. [...] I suppose the apples are gathered by this time; you cannot [...] think how I miss the golden and red piles under the trees, [...] and the droning of the old cyder press. And do those beautiful [...] Red Admiral butterflies come in the crowds they did [...] last year to the heaps of apples in our orchard? Do you remember [...] how we counted five that all came and sat on your [...] pink frock while we were watching them? ...|$|E

6000|$|The Scotchman murmured another negative, {{and there}} was a silence, till Henchard resumed: [...] "Then I am truly and {{sincerely}} obliged to you for the few words <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> on <b>that</b> paper." ...|$|R

50|$|It's a {{very simple}} matter. What Richard Marius wrote did not go unnoticed in Cambridge and beyond, {{because it was the}} Harvard alumni magazine. When you make the Nazi analogy, it cannot be tossed off as, 'Oh, how silly of me to have done this.' When <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>that,</b> you believe it. So, once the vice {{president}} knew, he had to figure out if he wanted someone who believed that on his staff.|$|E
5000|$|One {{song from}} the album that Gallagher would often perform live was [...] "The Last of the Independents". Like other Gallagher songs (e.g. [...] "Philby" [...] and [...] "Continental Op") the song was {{inspired}} by Gallagher's love of hardboiled fiction and film noir. When an interviewer asked him [...] "What about “The Last of the Independents” {{in some ways it}} talks about yourself. Did you have that in mind when <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> song?" [...] Gallagher replied: ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{so desperately}} indignant with <b>you</b> for <b>writing</b> me <b>that</b> short apology for a note, and pretending {{to suppose that}} under any {{circumstances}} I could fail to read with interest anything <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> to me, <b>that</b> I have {{more than half a}} mind to inflict a regular letter upon you. If I were not the gentlest of men I should do it! ...|$|R
5000|$|Ira Robbins <b>wrote</b> in Newsday <b>that</b> [...] "the record expresses as {{much about}} Bob Dylan's art as any {{collection}} of originals." [...] Even music critic Bill Wyman, who dismissed Good as I Been to <b>You,</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> [...] "it's a testament to his unpredictability that Good as I Been to You is tedious and World Gone Wrong is a signal document, a mesmerizing and sanguinary walk down the blood-soaked history of folk and blues. It also has his best liner notes since the 1960s." ...|$|R
5000|$|Garcia-Roberts: In the book, <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> Jon--who as a felon is {{not allowed}} to have guns--showed you {{silencers}} he kept buried in his backyard. One of his dogs regularly killed other dogs and cats in the neighborhood. Were you ever afraid during your time staying with Jon in Hollywood?Wright: Jon doesn't live in Hollywood anymore, and he's very sick, so I think I can say this. My most uncomfortable moment came when I was doing an interview, and he gets a call. He says, [...] "Oh, that's my police friends. They're selling me some unmarked guns." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept is}} often {{attributed}} to Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, reputed {{to have said}} [...] "Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass." [...] In fact, the quote is probably apocryphal, but derived from {{a letter to his}} brother in which he wrote [...] "In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you’ll have a moonlit night if <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball." ...|$|E
5000|$|Underwood told The Boot {{that the}} idea for the [...] "Undo It" [...] hook came accidentally. [...] "The guys had their guitars and they were playing {{something}} kind of bluesy, and Kara's got such a great R&B sense about her," [...] she said. [...] "And I started, 'Na, na, na-ing' to whatever they were playing. And they were like, 'What if that was the hook?' I said, 'Aw, I don't know?' And before you knew it, we had 'Uh, uh, uh undo it.' I mean, who would have thought? How do <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> down on paper? It was something that it didn't take that long to write and it's so much fun to sing on stage, and people get into it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, Edward, what's that, what's that!' she cried, in an {{agony of}} reproach. 'Why {{did you leave}} me to return to her? Why did <b>you</b> <b>write</b> me <b>that</b> cruel, cruel letter that nearly killed me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was a {{different}} thing. At any rate, it's I that say so now, and I want <b>you</b> to <b>write</b> <b>that</b> to him. It will bring him back flying. Will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And it {{was really}} <b>you</b> who <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> clever book?" [...] she continued, [...] "and all those {{brilliant}} things, in the magazines and journals. Oh, it must be delightful to be clever." ...|$|R
