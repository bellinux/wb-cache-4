500|$|Adult Swim in a Box {{was first}} {{announced}} by Warner Home Video on July 31, 2009, {{to be released}} on October 27 of the same year. The set was promoted as having a roughly threefold retail value ( [...] or $160 to $69.98), containing [...] "4 of the 5 best selling Adult Swim series." [...] It consists of seven discs, totaling 21 hours and 20 minutes of content. According to the network's now-defunct online shopping site, the set was chosen to harken {{to the experience of}} purchasing an entire album [...] "because <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> liked at least one song." ...|$|E
500|$|The vocal {{tracks were}} taped in Britannia Row and Protocol studios between May and June 1991. This {{was the first}} time vocalist Bilinda Butcher was {{involved}} in the recording. Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth, and only communicated with the engineers when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving. According to engineer Guy Fixsen, [...] "We weren't allowed to listen while either of them were doing a vocal. You'd have to watch the meters on the tape machine to see if anyone was singing. If it stopped, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> had to stop the tape and take it back to the top." [...] On most days, the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record. Dutt recalled: [...] "Kevin would sing a track, and then Bilinda would get the tape and write down words she thought he might have sung".|$|E
500|$|Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy {{drug use}} and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been {{something}} Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John Frusciante had been a true anomaly {{when it came to}} song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel Slovak to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and the next thing <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer's block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, Flea {{for the first time on}} any of the band's albums, besides contributing music as usual, took over and wrote some of the song's lyrics, including [...] "Transcending", his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to [...] "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis's youth. [...] Also for the first time on any album, Flea contributed lead vocals which he performed on his solo track titled [...] "Pea".|$|E

[...] "And <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> half want to believe that vision was real. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> do." ...|$|R

500|$|Despite {{positive}} assessments, [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] {{produced more}} variety within critical opinion. In his [...] "commendable" [...] 8.6 {{out of ten}} rating review, Ross Bonaime of Paste asserted that the program displayed some exceptional dimension into the characters—from Lana's apparent self-consciousness, to Cheryl's eccentric and [...] "odd" [...] persona, and Krieger's past. Ultimately, Bonaime professed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] was slightly inferior to its predecessor; [...] "'Space Race, Part II' doesn’t {{have some of the}} big laughs that the first part featured. By that, I mean Archer never rode Cyril through waves of Lana’s puke joyously. It is a step down from the first part comedically, but the episode does give us a few fun moments for each member of the cast." [...] Analogous sentiments were echoed by Blair Marnell of CraveOnline, who concluded: [...] "The space adventure had some fun moments, but it seemed to lack the punch provided by the two episodes that proceeded it. Even though it was good to see Barry again this season, his appearance in this episode seemed pretty tacked on." [...] VanDerWerff affirmed that the episode was a superb conclusion to Archer third season, despite not being as [...] "relentlessly entertaining" [...] as [...] "Space Race: Part I". While deeming the episode as a hilarious finale, TV Overmind writer Kevin Fitzpatrick claimed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] left many unanswered questions to the audience. Conversely, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic applauded the episode, issuing it a 4.7 out of 5 stars. [...] "Archer ended its third season tonight with the conclusion to its two part episode, 'Space Race'. And, man, from the second Archer announced he left his light saber in his other space pants, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> were in for a solid ending." ...|$|E

[...] "There were people fearful of walking by a table where <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> didn't belong, stuff like that. Certain groups {{certainly}} got preferential treatment across the board. I caught the tail end of one really horrible incident, and I know Dylan told his mother that it was the worst day of his life." [...] That incident, according to Laughlin, involved seniors pelting Klebold with [...] "ketchup-covered tampons" [...] in the commons.|$|E

2500|$|Discerning {{the line}} between the fact and the fiction of Thompson's work {{presented}} a practical problem for editors and fact-checkers of his work. Love called fact-checking Thompson's work [...] "one of the sketchiest occupations ever created in the publishing world", and [...] "for the first-timer... a trip through a journalistic fun house, where you didn't know what was real and what wasn't. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> had better learn enough about the subject at hand to know when the riff began and reality ended. Hunter was a stickler for numbers, for details like gross weight and model numbers, for lyrics and caliber, and there was no faking it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hinkle {{loved the}} intense physicality of football. According to one account, [...] "Clark Hinkle loved contact. It didn't matter {{which side of}} the ball he was coming from, Hinkle loved {{delivering}} blows." [...] Ken Strong, another Hall of Fame back of the era, remembered the force of Hinkle's tackles: [...] "When he hit you, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> were hit. Bells rang and you felt {{it all the way to}} your toes." [...] Another back, Johnny Sisk, said: [...] "No one in the whole league ever bruised me more than Hinkle did[...] [...] [...] Hinkle had a lot of leg action. I broke my shoulder twice tackling Mr. Hinkle." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{studied the}} book and built Steve Davis's own {{technique}} {{on it in the}} 1970s. He started playing at the Lucania Snooker Club in Romford, where at the age of 18 the manager of the club brought his talent to the attention of Barry Hearn, chairman of the Lucania chain of snooker halls. Hearn became Davis' friend and manager. Paid £25 a match by Hearn, Davis toured the country, taking part in challenge matches against established professionals such as Ray Reardon, John Spencer and Alex Higgins. Around this time he was given the nickname [...] "Nugget" [...] because, according to Hearn, [...] "you could put your case of money on him and <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> were going to get paid." ...|$|E

2500|$|Navarro's joining and Kiedis's {{continued}} {{drug addiction}} {{had a profound}} effect on the band and the subsequent sound of their next album, One Hot Minute (1995). With Frusciante no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been something Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John had been a true anomaly when it came to song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and the next thing <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] To compensate, Kiedis and bassist Flea took several vacations together, during which entire songs were conceived and with Kiedis often absent from recording due to his drug problems or struggling to come up with lyrics, Flea took a much bigger role in the writing process; coming up with ideas for many songs including full lyrics and even singing lead on his own song, [...] "Pea".|$|E
