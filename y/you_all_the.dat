5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E
5|$|Worship Music is {{the tenth}} studio album by American thrash metal band Anthrax. The album was {{released}} on September 12, 2011 internationally, and on September 13 in the United States. It was the band's first album of original material since 2003's We've Come for <b>You</b> <b>All,</b> <b>the</b> first full-length Anthrax album to feature vocalist Joey Belladonna since 1990's Persistence of Time, and the final album with guitarist Rob Caggiano prior to his departure in January 2013.|$|E

25|$|In Rationality in Action (2001), Searle {{argues that}} {{standard}} notions of rationality are badly flawed. According {{to what he}} calls the Classical Model, rationality is seen as something like a train track: you get on at one point with your beliefs and desires and the rules of rationality compel <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to a conclusion. Searle doubts this picture of rationality holds generally.|$|E

Evan-Thomas was now also in a position to himself assist other officers up the career ladder, and received formal thanks from Commander Michael Culme-Seymour, son of his previous commander, for help in obtaining promotion. A note from Lord Knollys to Beresford commended Evan-Thomas for good results in gunnery trials.|$|E

25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from <b>you,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

For the writers, the episode was not comedic, and they expressed awareness of the differences between episodes of Inside No. 9 like [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] and the expectations of viewers for television comedies. The pair acknowledged the particular complexity of the plot, with Pemberton saying [...] "If you missed two sentences in a row, you'd be like 'what?' Even I was thinking how are people following this? It's insane." [...] Pemberton also noted that not everyone enjoys crosswords, hence [...] "I always hated cryptic crosswords.

500|$|Marley {{considered}} cannabis {{a healing}} herb, a [...] "sacrament", and an [...] "aid to medication"; {{he supported the}} legalisation of the drug. He thought that marijuana use was prevalent in the Bible, reading passages such as [...] as showing approval of its usage. Marley began to use cannabis when he converted to the Rastafari faith from Catholicism in 1966. He was arrested in 1968 after being caught with cannabis, but continued to use marijuana in accordance with his religious beliefs. Of his marijuana usage, he said, [...] "When you smoke herb, herb reveal yourself to <b>you.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> wickedness you do, the herb reveal itself to yourself, your conscience, show up yourself clear, because herb make you meditate.

500|$|By May 6, the jails were so full that Connor {{transformed}} the stockade {{at the state}} fairgrounds into a makeshift jail to hold protesters. Blacks arrived at white churches to integrate services. They were accepted in Roman Catholic, Episcopal, and Presbyterian churches but turned away at others, where they knelt and prayed until they were arrested. Well-known national figures arrived to show support. Singer Joan Baez arrived to perform for free at Miles College and stayed at the black-owned and integrated Gaston Motel. Comedian Dick Gregory and Barbara Deming, a writer for The Nation, were both arrested. The young Dan Rather reported for CBS News. The car of Fannie Flagg, a local television personality and recent Miss Alabama finalist, was surrounded by teenagers who recognized her. Flagg worked at Channel 6 on the morning show, and after asking her producers why the show was not covering the demonstrations, she received orders never to mention them on air.

[...] This claim combined with the television advertising were the prime motivators behind the Spanish government's concerns with the XXL sandwich line. The government claimed that campaign violated an agreement with the government to comply with an initiative on curbing obesity by promoting such a large and unhealthy sandwich. In response to the government's claims, Burger King replied in a statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years. Our philosophy can be summed up with the motto 'As you like it,' in which our customers' taste trumps all." [...] The company {{went on to say that}} it offers other healthier items such as salads and that customers are free to choose their own foods and modify them as they desire.|$|E
500|$|On {{the drive}} to Athlead, Darryl opens up to Pam that he is worried about the {{interview}}. At Jim's new company, Pam gives Darryl a thumbs up as he heads into the interview room, and then is chatted up by an employee who says [...] "Jim speaks about <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time" [...] and we [...] "can't wait for you to move here." [...] The thought of moving to Philadelphia disturbs her. Meanwhile, Darryl initially fumbles his interview due to nerves and feelings of inadequacy, but everyone else helps calm him down, and he makes a strong reversal. Darryl concludes the interview by attempting to shoot a basket with the room's sports decorations, but instead knocks a light fixture into the fish tank, electrocuting all the fish. Pam commiserates with Darryl over this embarrassing misstep. Jim returns to inform Darryl that although {{he will have to}} pay for the fish, he has the job. During the drive home, Darryl gushes over his new job and the chance to live in Philadelphia while Pam worries about where she and her family will be in the future.|$|E

500|$|However, when McDonald {{reassembled}} {{the band}} for a last-minute scheduling at the Woodstock Festival, another personnel change {{resulted in the}} group's final lineup, which included recruits Mark Kapner on keyboards, Doug Metzner on bass, and Greg Dewey on drums. Among the festival's most memorable moments was McDonald's unexpected solo performance on August 16, 1969, which included [...] "The Fuck Cheer" [...] as a finale. The audience receptively responded by chanting along with McDonald. McDonald's rendition of [...] "The Fuck Cheer" [...] propelled the song into the mainstream culture in the U.S., and was featured on the Woodstock film, which was released on March 26, 1970. Radio stations regularly played both versions of the cheer, though the opposition to [...] "The Fuck Cheer" [...] limited its exposure to underground stations. In December 1969, McDonald began his own career outside the band, releasing cover versions of Guthrie-penned songs on Thinking of Woody Guthrie, and country standards on Tonight I'm Singing Just For <b>You.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> while, the group looked {{to capitalize on the}} momentum from Woodstock and their appearance in the film, Zachariah, by releasing their fifth album, CJ Fish, in May 1970. The album was a moderate success, reaching number 111 nationally. However the band members lacked the motivation for touring and recording, which led to their disbandment in mid-1970.|$|E

2500|$|Atkin's musical {{settings}} drew most {{of their}} inspiration from Tin Pan Alley, although in the above-mentioned Carnations on the Roof he set a somber description of a working class life to themes characteristic of Tamla Motown. [...] Often Atkin turned James' intentions upside down, as with The Last Hill That Shows <b>You</b> <b>All</b> <b>The</b> Valley, which James wrote as a dirge but which Atkin set to a thumping, angry rock beat. [...] The combination worked as James' mournful cataloguing of man's inhumanity to man became a cry of protest.|$|E
