40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, {{researchers}} have routinely used count data models (such as the Poisson and negative binomial) {{to estimate the}} demand for recreational activities. Along with the success and popularity of count data models in recreational demand analysis during the last decade, a number of shortcomings of standard count data models became obvious to researchers. This had {{led to the development}} of new and more sophisticated model specifications. Furthermore, semi-parametric and non-parametric approaches have also made their way into count data models. Despite these advances, however, one interesting issue has received little research attention in this area. This is related to the fast decay process of the dependent variable and the associated long tail. This phenomenon is observed quite frequently in recreational demand studies; most recreationists make one or two trips while a few of them make exceedingly large number of trips. This introduces an extreme form of overdispersion difficult to address in popular count data models. The major objective of this paper is to investigate the issues related to proper modelling of the fast decay process and the associated long tails in recreation demand analysis. For this purpose, we introduce two categories of alternative count data models. The first group includes four alternative count data models, each characterised by a single parameter while the second group includes one count data model characterised by two parameters. This paper demonstrates how these alternative models can be used to properly model the fast decay process and the associated long tail commonly observed in recreation demand analysis. The first four alternative count data models are based on an adaptation of the geometric, Borel, logarithmic and <b>Yule</b> probability <b>distributions</b> to count data models while the second group of models relied on the use of the generalised Poisson probability distribution. All these alternative count data models are empirically implemented using the maximum likelihood estimation procedure and applied to study the demand for moose hunting in Northern Ontario. Econometric results indicate that most of the alternative count data models proposed in this paper are able to capture the fast decay process characterising the number of moose hunting trips. Overall they seem to perform as well as the conventional negative binomial model and better than the Poisson specification. However further investigation of the econometric results reveal that the geometric and generalised Poisson model specifications fare better than the modified Borel and Yule regression models. fast decay process, recreational demand, count data models, Borel, Yule, logarithmic and generalised Poisson regression models, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Phylogenetic {{trees are}} widely used in biology to {{represent}} evolutionary relationships between species. As {{the details of the}} evolutionary process are mostly unknown, modelling work on the shapes of these trees has had to incorporate a random component. Two null models introduced for this purpose are the uniform model and the Yule model. A third model, the comb model, is useful for giving bounds on theoretical results. We investigate some mathematical properties of these three models. Let the distance between two nodes be the number of edges separating them. We find exact formulae for the mean distance of a randomly chosen leaf from the root, and for the mean distance between two randomly chosen leaves of a rooted tree. In addition, for the Yule model we find the probability distribution for the distance of randomly chosen leaf from the root. A cherry is a pair of leaves which are adjacent to a common node. By realising the process of cherry formation by extended Polya urn models we show that the number of cherries is asymptotically normal. This allows us to develop simple statistical tests for the Yule and uniform null hypotheses for the growth of rooted trees. A triplet is a cherry and a pendant edge that are adjacent to a common node. We also show that the asymptotic distribution of triplets is normal for the Yule model, and put forward a conjecture for the distribution under the uniform model. The construction of an evolutionary tree is generally a two stage process: an unrooted tree is constructed, then it is rooted. We investigate a method for rooting a tree based on the shape of the tree and the Yule model for the growth of rooted trees. We show that even for trees with large number of leaves the approximate location of the root can be located with high probability. Let S be a set of two rooted binary trees for which the leaf sets L 1, L 2 form a partition of the set {l, 2, [...] .,n}. We derive a recursion for the number of trees on n leaves that are compatible with the set S. We extend this recursion for a set S of three trees, but show that the numbers of terms required in the recursion grows at least exponentially with the number of trees in the set S. Let S be a set of rooted binary trees. A tree which is a sub-tree of each of the trees in the set is called an agreement sub-tree, and such a tree with the maximum number of possible leaves is called a maximum agreement sub-tree (MAST). We derive an upper bound for the probability that two randomly generated trees have a MAST with number of leaves {{greater than or equal to}} a given value s. We find the form the upper bound takes when the trees are generated according to the uniform and Yule models. The entropy of a probability distribution is equal to the mean information, where the information of an event E is - log P (E). We derive exact and asymptotic formulae for the entropy of the comb, uniform and <b>Yule</b> probability <b>distributions.</b> We show that the comb, uniform, and Yule models satisfy a property called group elimination. A special case of the property of group elimination is sampling consistency. We show that for any probability distribution on trees that satisfies sampling consistency there is an upper bound on the probability of the fully symmetric tree shapes. We introduce a modification of the Yule model in which the speciation rate is a function of the time since the last speciation event of a lineage. Using analytical methods we investigate the probability (conditional and unconditional) of the symmetric tree on four leaves under this modified model. If the speciation rate is constant then the probability of the symmetric tree is the same as in the Yule model. Making the speciation rate zero for a period after a speciation event, then constant afterwards, is found to make the symmetric tree more probable. If the speciation rate is constant for some period after a speciation event, then subsequently zero, the symmetric tree is found to be less probable...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on the research of critical phenomena in different size-scaled structures, from earth-scale, macro-scale to micro-scale. By analyzing the energy emission from their critical processes, some useful information or suggestion is extracted and to be provided in structural health monitoring (SHM). Three different forms of energies, acoustic emission (AE), electromagnetic emission (EM) and neutron emission (NE), are selected to be studied in our research. AE {{is the result of a}} sudden spontaneous strain energy release within a solid body due to the formation of cracks, which has been studied by many researchers in the past decades and is more developed compared with EM and NE studies. Further and advanced researches are fulfilled based on the qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis in AE study. Two contributions are especially mentioned here. On one hand, an improve approach, based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), is proposed to provide more reliable onset determination of AE signals. The introduced parameters, quantification of certainty degree and the apparent velocity in the improved-AIC method can help to eliminate the false or doubtful picked onset results automatically. On the other hand, to determine the active crack region plays a key role in AE monitoring analysis because it identifies the position of fractures in the damaged materials. The classical crack localization method works well in the steel and concrete materials due to their homogeneous or semi-homogeneous properties, but not in the masonry structures. A modified localization system based on the classical one is initiated in this context to offer a better crack localization results in masonry structures. AE monitoring technique is similar to the one employed in earthquake control. Damage in structural materials and earthquakes in geophysics, although they take place on very different scales, are very similar in many aspects. In this context, three particular aspects, b-value of the magnitude-frequency <b>distribution,</b> <b>Yule</b> statistics analysis and unified scaling law for recurrence-time are analyzed on both AE and earthquake. Among the researches, the robust method to estimate the b-value of magnitude-frequency distribution in earthquakes, the application of Yule statistics in earthquake prediction are both the first time to be mentioned in their research areas. EM can be observed in both natural and laboratorial conditions. In this context, models for occurrence mechanism of EM is summarized and analyzed theoretically. Experimental tests are operated to study the EM in laboratory and it is very interesting to note that the EM is generally observed only in correspondence to the sharp stress drops in the load versus time diagrams. As for NE, it is the first time for the research group of Prof. Carpinteri to talk about piezonuclear neutron emissions from very brittle failure of rock specimens in compression test.

40|$|Abstract only availableRuminants {{possess a}} {{specialized}} gastrointestinal (GI) tract that {{enables them to}} efficiently digest fibrous feeds. The first stomach compartment of the ruminant GI tract, the reticulorumen (RR), is the site of most fiber digestion due to the presence of cellulolytic microorganisms in conjunction with selective retention of feed particles; undigested fibrous feed particles are selectively retained and fermented by cellulolytic microorganisms in the RR until certain digestive processes are completed, enabling the particles to pass. Selective retention and the overall process of digesta flow in the RR affect feed digestibility, feed intake, and microbial efficiency—all important animal performance parameters in ruminant production. It is imperative to model digesta flow in the RR to better predict these animal performance parameters for use in ruminant production systems. Mathematical models have indeed been developed to describe the flow of digesta in the RR, typically with the RR represented as one or more mathematical compartments with flow between compartments defined by kinetic rate variables or constants. Mathematical models developed to the present use either fractional rate constants or rate variables based on the gamma distribution. The <b>Yule</b> <b>distribution</b> has also been suggested for modeling RR digesta flow kinetics, but its development has been cursory. It remains unseen what, if any, benefits may arise from applying the <b>Yule</b> <b>distribution</b> to describe the kinetics of RR digesta.

Physiological justification for using the <b>Yule</b> <b>distribution</b> is also provided on the basis of selective retention.

Additionally, mathematical models are being developed to describe small and large intestinal flow in ruminant and non-ruminant species, thereby expanding this modeling effort to include most of the GI tract.
