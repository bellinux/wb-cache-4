500|$|The exuberant first {{movement}} {{was derived from}} the final movement of the secular cantata. It opens with a virtuoso orchestral introduction of 24 measures, depicting vital joy. First the alto shouts: [...] "" [...] (Rejoice, you hearts), the tenor continues [...] "" [...] (fade away, you sorrows), then all voices proclaim in homophony: [...] "" [...] (the Savior lives and rules within you).

2500|$|While most Wufuxu {{methods for}} {{expelling}} the Three Worms involve anthelmintic herbs, a few do not. For instance, a recipe {{attributed to the}} Han Daoist Lezichang 樂子長 (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, [...] "Pluck peach leaves {{on the third day}} of the third month; crush them to extract seven pints of juice. Then mix in liquor and heat it five or six times. Take it before meals and the three worms will be driven out." [...] One anomalous Wufuxu method does not mention either medicinal herbs or diet. [...] "The Recipe of Master Redpine" [...] (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, [...] "When you cut the nails of your hands and feet on the sixteenth day of the seventh month, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>drive</b> out the three worms from your intestines." [...] Arthur (2013: 88) reasons that [...] cutting one's nails for cleanliness might help a person to avoid future parasite infestations but not existing ones, perhaps Master Redpine was referring to the Ghost Festival that is held on the full moon of the seventh lunar month.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{announced}} as the [...] "Eastwood pack coming in Fall 2008", the expansion known as [...] "Big Surf Island" [...] was released 11 June 2009. Design {{for the island}} was guided by the principle of [...] "If you can see it, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>drive</b> it". The island puts emphasis on the playground aspect of Burnout. The developers mentioned that in their telemetry they noticed that players congregate in areas of Paradise City that lend themselves to stunt-driving, and so {{the idea was to}} create an entire island to accommodate player desire. Big Surf Island also features new vehicles, which includes the Carson Dust Storm buggy, a car tailor-made for stunts. [...] In addition to the Dust Storm buggy two specially featured cars, the Hunter Olympus [...] "Governor" [...] and the Carson Annihilator Street Rod are also included.
