40|$|A {{remaining}} {{challenge for}} the development of economically feasible 2 nd generation bio-ethanol is low xylose consumption rate and inhibitor tolerance of the utilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. <b>Yeast</b> starter <b>cultures</b> produced for ethanol production in simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) processes have to meet high, seemingly conflicting requirements. A high biomass yield during propagation is required to produce the high cell concentrations required for the harsh conditions in the proceeding fermentation. Inhibitor tolerance is essential for producing a highly viable starter culture as well as favorable fermentation kinetics. Short-term adaptation of <b>yeast</b> <b>cultures</b> during propagation has been shown to {{have a positive effect on}} pentose conversion as well as inhibitor tolerance. Here we propose a model propagation strategy for evaluating physiology of <b>yeast</b> <b>cultures</b> during propagation. This model propagation strategy will be implemented in a study comparing physiology of <b>yeast</b> <b>cultures</b> with and without exposure to lignocellulosic inhibitors during propagation to assess what molecular mechanisms underlie the short-term adaptation response phenotype.

Viability of S. suaveolens and W. anomalus using three methods of drying (freeze-drying, convective drying, and spray-drying) and during 4 months of storage at 4 °C and 25 °C in the darkness was studied. Immediately after each drying method, high survival was obtained using freeze-drying followed by convective drying in rice cakes and spray-drying respectively.
