2500|$|All of {{the movie}} themes and mini-games were {{conceived}} by the creative-design team, which they decided the movie themes would have an old B-movie feel. Trowers notes {{the making of the}} mini-games to be [...] "quite an organic process": [...] "Sometimes we'd have a movie and we'd say OK, we want the player to do this in the scene, which is the action we want, so try to think of a game idea for this. But other times we'd be thinking, [...] "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> <b>we</b> got this great idea for a game and these are the essential actions we can get out of it, {{how are we going to}} use it in movies?" [...] So it was really a three-way process, trying to figure out what we could get people to do, what would be fun, how it would fit in the movie—it wasn't just one process of doing it, it had to go both ways." [...] There had also been a few more movie ideas, but they were left out of the game.|$|E

2500|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home to play the Reds, dropping the opener 6-4 when Dee Gordon committed a costly error {{in the seventh inning}} with the game tied, leading to four runs scoring. The Dodgers wasted a fine start by Kershaw on June 15 as the Scott Elbert allowed a go-ahead eighth-inning single to Joey Votto and the Reds won 3-2. Scott Rolen got three hits and drove in three runs as the Reds finished off their sweep of the Dodgers 7-2. The slumping Dodgers were subsequently handled by Houston starter Brett Myers, who retired 17 consecutive batters at one point and made only 98 pitches in a 7-3 Astros win. The Dodgers home losing streak hit five when they were shut out by the Astros 7-0 on June 18. The game was doubly frustrating because starting catcher Rod Barajas suffered an ankle strain in the second inning and joined the multitude of Dodgers already on the disabled list. Manager Don Mattingly said after the game, [...] "We're frustrated, that's for sure, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>We</b> don't have time to be frustrated... This {{is not the time to}} feel sorry for ourselves." [...] The Dodgers avoided being swept by the last place Astros with a 1-0 victory on June 19, that ended the five-game losing streak. A solo homer by Dioner Navarro in the bottom of the 8th inning was all the Dodgers offense could muster, but it was enough as Hiroki Kuroda and two relievers pitched a shutout. In the next game, Clayton Kershaw was dominant, striking out 11 in a two-hit shutout of the Detroit Tigers. He also hit a two-run eighth-inning single to extended the Dodgers lead in the 4-0 win. Chad Billingsley's turn was next and he also pitched effectively, allowing just one run in 5 1/3 innings as the Dodgers won their third straight, 6-1, over the Tigers. Matt Kemp reached base all five times he came up to bat in the series finale, with three hits (including a triple) and two walks but the Dodgers were done in by four home runs hit by the Tigers off of Ted Lilly in the 7-5 loss. The Los Angeles Angels came to town next for the next installment of the Freeway Series. In the opener, the Angels won a sloppy game with baserunning and fielding errors 8-3. [...] "I don't like the way it's going, thats for sure." [...] Manager Don Mattingly said after the Dodgers lost 6-1 in game 2. The Dodgers bounced back to take the series finale 3-2. Clayton Kershaw struck out eleven in the game and pitched his second straight complete game, the first Dodger to do so in 11 years. Tony Gwynn, Jr.'s RBI single in the bottom of the ninth won it for the Dodgers.|$|E
2500|$|As we {{progress}} through time, {{we reach the}} time of Abraham. Reuven Firestone states that, “In {{the case of the}} Abraham story, for example, Islamic interpretative literature traces his journeys to Haran, the land of Canaan, Egypt and back again to Canaan in a manner that parallels the basic route and chronology of the biblical story found in Genesis.” [...] However, {{it is interesting to note}} that Abraham’s journey also leads him to Mecca. Firestone states, “Abraham’s prayer in Quran 14:37 serves as proof text in the exegetical literature for his Meccan experience: “Our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in an uncultivated wadi by your sacred house, in order o Lord, which they may establish, regular prayer. There are other Quranic verses such as: “2:125-127, 3:97, and 22:26” that locate Abraham in Mecca. Firestone continues through his article to discuss how Islamic hadith and Quranic scripture were passed down orally. He also discusses how during this time, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam were all influencing one another in relation to the scriptural stories. Ibn Abbas, as discussed above, also recounts the story of Abraham’s journey from Syria to Mecca. This story was told by Ali b. Abi Talib, by Mujahid, and by Ibn Abbas. The version of this story told by Ibn Abbas can be found nineteen times among the sources, “it is the most popular and most complete explanation of Abraham’s transfer from Syria to Mecca”. To summarize the Ibn Abbas’ account, Abraham’s wife, Sarah, becomes jealous of Hagar because of the birth of Ishmael. Hagar leaves the house that she is staying in with Abraham and Sarah and hides her track so no one can follow her. Abraham takes Ishmael and Hagar to Mecca. After leaving both of them there, he returns to Syria. Hagar is weary of being left in this place and Abraham then recites the Quran 14:37-38: “O Lord! I have made some of my offspring live in an uncultivated wadi by your sacred house, in order, O Lord, that they establish regular prayer. So fill the hearts of some with love toward them, and feed them with fruits so that they may give thanks. O Lord! <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> conceal and what we reveal, for nothing on Earth or in Heaven is hidden from God.” Both Ishmael and Hagar run out of water and Hagar can no longer feed Ishmael by nursing him. “She climbs Safa and Marwa and runs between them seven times.” Ibn Abbas notes that either Gabriel, another angel, or Ishmael struck the ground with their heel and caused water to flow out of it. “The angel tells Hagar not to worry about perishing, for the boy and his father will someday build the House of God there in Mecca. This version of the legend follows the biblical account of Genesis 21:19-21 in almost perfect order.” The many versions of this legend attribute the importance and provide explanation for this religious building in Mecca. Reuven Firestone writes that this interpretation of the story, “serves in effect as an Islamic midrash on Genesis 21:10-21, and indeed, contains motifs with clear parallels in post-biblical Jewish exegetical literature.” It is interesting to note the many different versions that have been written serve different purposes in the Islamic tradition. Ali’s version includes more supernatural events that may be added for the purpose of making the Ka’ba seen as more of an important religious shrine to the Islamic people. Whereas, Ibn Abbas’ version perfectly aligns with the biblical narration in Genesis.|$|E
