5000|$|While {{many people}} think that the {{reduction}} in taxes in the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> is a benefit, that is not necessarily the case. While {{it is true that the}} unpaid taxes can be immediately invested and continue to grow, taxes on these gains will need to eventually be paid—either on an ongoing basis, if invested in a non-tax-deferred vehicle (e.g. if pre-tax options are already maximized), or at withdrawal otherwise. Assuming that both the tax deduction and the tax on its reinvestment gains only affect the individual's top tax bracket, the results are tax-neutral. Any potential benefits of claiming and reinvesting a tax deduction come from the expectation that the taxpayer may be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.|$|E
5000|$|For {{accumulated}} after-tax {{contributions and}} earnings in a designated Roth account (Roth 401(k)), [...] "qualified distributions" [...] {{can be made}} tax-free. To qualify, distributions must be made more than 5 {{years after the first}} designated Roth contributions and not before the year in which the account owner turns age 59½, unless an exception applies as detailed in IRS code section 72(t). In the case of designated Roth contributions, the contributions being made on an after-tax basis means that the taxable income in the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> is not decreased as it is with pre-tax contributions. Roth contributions are irrevocable and cannot be converted to pre-tax contributions at a later date. (In contrast to Roth individual retirement accounts (IRAs), where Roth contributions may be re characterized as pre-tax contributions.) Administratively, Roth contributions must be made to a separate account, and records must be kept that distinguish the amount of contribution and the corresponding earnings that are to receive Roth treatment.|$|E

30|$|The {{major policy}} {{regulation}} which I exploit {{in this article}} is the non-forfeiture clause (BetrAVG 2009). It regulates whether employees retain their pension claims in the case of job termination. The current regulation requires at least five <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions.</b> If an employment relationship is terminated after five <b>years</b> <b>of</b> employer provided <b>contributions,</b> pension claims are vested.

40|$|Background/Aim. Chronic renal {{insufficiency}} (CRI), diabetes, hypertension, autosomal dominant {{polycystic kidney disease}} (ADPKD) are {{the main reasons for}} starting dialysis treatment in patients having kidney function failure. At present, dialysis treatments are performed in about 4, 100 patients at 46 institutions in Serbia, out of which 90 % are hemodialyses. At end-stage renal disease (ESRD) the only correct selection is kidney transplatation. The basic aim of the planned research was to compare ratio of costs and effects (Cost Effectiveness Analysis - CEA) of hemodialysis and kidney transplantation in patients at ESRD. Methods. As the main issue of treatment in patients from both groups the life quality measured by the validated McGill Questionary, was used. The study included 150 patients totally, divided into two groups. The study group consisted of 50 patients with kidney transplantation performed at the Clinical Center of Serbia and the control group consisted of 100 patients on hemodialysis at Clinical Center of Serbia, Clinical Hospital Center Zemun, Clinical Hospital Center 'Zvezdara', Clinical Center Kragujevac and Health Center 'Studenica', Kraljevo, comparable with respect to sex, age and length of treatment with the study group. Results. Effect of kidney transplantation in relation to hemodialysis being selection of treatment is expressed in the form of incremental ratio of costs and effects (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio - ICER). It is clear from the enclosed tables that the strategy of kidney transplantation is far more profitable considering the fact that it represents saving of EUR 132, 256. 25 per one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) within the period of 10 years. According to all aspects of live quality (physical symptoms and problems, physical well-being, psychological symptoms, existential well-being and support), difference is statistically important in favor of transplant patents. Conclusion. The costs of patient therapy by hemodialysis at end-stage renal disease is far greater than by performing therapy of transplantation and maintenance, by almost three and a half times. Difference in total quality aspects of human life (physical, emotional, social, spiritual and financial) between dialyzed and transplant patients is statistically significant and by 18. 12 % greater in transplant patients than in patients on hemodialysis...|$|E

30|$|Prior to the 2011 reform, the {{two most}} {{relevant}} reforms took place in 1997 and 2002. In 1997, the number <b>of</b> <b>years</b> required {{to be entitled to}} a retirement pension was increased from 8 to 15 years with the corresponding timetable. Moreover, the period for calculating the reference wage was extended from 8 to 15 years and the replacement rate was established as 50 % for the first 15 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions.</b> Each additional <b>year</b> up to year 25 adds 3 % and from that year onwards, each additional year adds another 2 % until reaching 100 % for 35 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions.</b> Pensions have been indexed to inflation since this reform. Later, the 2002 reform allowed for early retirement at 61 for those workers that had not contributed before 1967 and had contributed a minimum <b>of</b> 30 <b>years.</b> Moreover, it also introduced changes to the penalization coefficient for early retirement and a premium for late retirement was introduced (2 % per additional year beyond 35 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> or qualifying <b>years).</b>|$|R
