40|$|Provides an {{overview}} of age-related changes in both involuntary and voluntary attention in adult Ss as manifested in scalp-recorded event related potential (ERP) s. A decline in orienting with old age was inferred from a substantial reduction with age in the magnitude of deviance-related ERP components. A review of focused attention studies suggested that old and <b>young</b> <b>Ss</b> do not differ substantially {{in the quality of}} attentional operations. In old Ss early selection processes, as reflected in their selection potentials, have a somewhat slower onset than in <b>young</b> <b>Ss,</b> especially in conditions in which selection is based upon complex discrimination of stimulus features. Furthermore, the global pattern emerging from visual and memory search studies is that search-related negativities in the ERPs are smaller and of longer duration in old than in <b>young</b> <b>Ss</b> over the central and anterior scalp sites. These effects could indicate that controlled search is less intense or takes more time per search operation in old than in <b>young</b> <b>Ss.</b> At more posterior scalp sites there was tendency towards an enhanced search-related negativity that could reflect a specific difficulty of old Ss in spatially locating targets in complex visual fields...|$|R

Neste trabalho, Scopogonalia e duas de duas espécies são redescritas, bem como são descritas seis espécies novas, sendo cinco a partir de espécimes do Brasil e uma da Argentina. Também é feita uma análise filogenética do gênero, para testar seu monofiletismo e elaborar uma hipótese de relacionamento filogenético entre elas. Como táxons terminais da análise filogenética estão as espécies de Scopogonalia e mais seis espécies no grupo externo: Tretogonia cribrata Melichar, Cyclogonia caeligutata Mejdalani & Nessimian, Rotigonalia larissae Cavichioli, Rotigonalia olivacea Cavichioli, Plerogonalia rudicula (Jacobi), e uma espécie nova de Rotigonalia Young que também é descrita. Uma chave taxonômica de Scopogonalia e outra de Rotigonalia foram elaboradas. Foram usados 59 caracteres morfológicos e de padrão de cor identificados com base em critérios topográficos, dentre os quais os multiestado foram codificados como não-ordenados e os autapomórficos não-informativos foram incluídos. A análise de parcimônia máxima foi conduzida no programa TNT, resultando em 8 árvores mais parcimoniosas, com comprimento = 137, índice de consistência (IC) = 0, 47 (excluindo caracteres não-informativos) e índice de retenção (RI) = 0, 72. Em todas, Scopogonalia é monofilético, porém com baixo suporte, tendo como sinapomorfias não-ambíguas a reversão do clípeo inflado para não-inflado, primeira condição presente em Rotigonalia e Plerogonalia, e a abertura da base das células anteapicais mediana e interna das asas anteriores. Uma análise com pesagem implicada chegou a três árvores, todas incluídas entre as originais, cujo consenso estrito mostra pouco conflito. Um dos clados suporta uma ligação pretérita entre a área núcleo do bioma Cerrado e {{enclaves}} de savana nos biomas Amazônia e Mata Atlântica. Outro sustenta uma relação proposta entre os blocos central e sul de áreas de endemismo da Mata Atlântica. The genus Scopogonalia Young {{belongs to}} the family Cicadellidae, subfamily Cicadellinae and tribe Cicadellini and contains 11 species, all recorded in South America: S. subolivacea (Stål) (type species), S. interruptula (Osborn), <b>S.</b> echinura <b>Young,</b> <b>S.</b> golbachi <b>Young,</b> <b>S.</b> nargena <b>Young,</b> <b>S.</b> oglobini <b>Young,</b> <b>S.</b> paula <b>Young,</b> <b>S.</b> penicula <b>Young,</b> <b>S.</b> altmanni Cavichioli, S. plaumanni Cavichioli, and S. splendida Cavichioli. In this work, Scopogonalia and two of its species are redescribed, as well as six new ones are described, which of them five from specimens from Brazil and one from Argentina. Moreover a phylogenetic analysis of the genus is conducted to test its monophyly and propose a hypothesis of phylogenetic relationship between them. The terminal taxa of the phylogenetic analysis are all species of Scopogonalia and six outgroup taxa: Tretogonia cribrata Melichar, Cyclogonia caeligutata Mejdalani & Nessimian, Rotigonalia larissae Cavichioli, Rotigonalia olivacea Cavichioli, Plerogonalia rudicula (Jacobi), and a new species of Rotigonalia which is also described. A taxonomic key of Scopogonalia and another of Rotigonalia were elaborated. 59 morphological and color pattern characters were used, identified based on topographic criteria, which of them the multistate were coded as unordered and the uninformative autopomorphic were included. The maximum parsimony analysis was conducted with the software TNT, resulting in 8 most parsimonious trees, with length = 137, consistency index (CI) = 0. 47 (excluding uninformative characters), and retention index (RI) = 0. 72. In all of them, Scopogonalia is monophyletic, although with low support, having as unambiguous sinapomorphies the reversion of the clypeus from swollen to not swollen, the first condition present in Rotigonalia and Plerogonalia, {{and the opening of}} the bases of the median and internal anteapical cell of the forewings. An implied weighting analysis lead to three trees, all included in the original ones, which the strict consensus shows little conflict. One of the clades supports a previous connection between the core area of the Cerrado biome and savanna enclaves in tha Amazon and Atlantic Forest biomes. Another one strengthens a proposed relationship between the central and south blocks of areas of endeminsm of the Atlantic Forest...|$|R

40|$|We tested two hypotheses, {{first that}} {{exercise}} training reverses age-related decrements in endothelium-dependent dilation in soleus muscle feed arteries and second that this improved endothelium-dependent dilation {{is the result}} of increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability due to increased content and phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and/or increased antioxidant enzyme content. Young (2 mo) and old (22 mo) male Fischer 344 rats were exercise trained (Ex) or remained sedentary (Sed) for 10 – 12 wk, yielding four groups of rats: 1) <b>young</b> <b>Sed</b> (4 – 5 mo), 2) young Ex (4 – 5 mo), 3) old Sed (24 – 25 mo), and 4) old Ex (24 – 25 mo). Soleus muscle feed arteries (SFA) were isolated and cannulated with two glass micropipettes for examination of endothelium-dependent (ACh) and endothelium-independent [sodium nitroprusside (SNP) ] vasodilator function. To determine the mechanism(s) by which exercise affected dilator responses, ACh-induced dilation was assessed in the presence of Nω-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA; to inhibit NO synthase), indomethacin (Indo; to inhibit cyclooxygenase), and l-NNA + Indo. Results indicated that ACh-induced dilation was blunted in old Sed SFA relative to <b>young</b> <b>Sed</b> SFA. Exercise training improved ACh-induced dilation in old SFA such that vasodilator responses in old Ex SFA were similar to <b>young</b> <b>Sed</b> and <b>young</b> Ex SFA. Addition of l-NNA, or l-NNA + Indo, abolished the exercise effect. Immunoblot analysis revealed that extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein content was increased by training in old SFA, whereas eNOS and SOD- 1 protein content were not altered. Addition of exogenous SOD, or SOD + catalase, improved ACh-induced dilation in old Sed SFA such that vasodilator responses were similar to <b>young</b> <b>Sed</b> SFA. Addition of l-NNA abolished the effect of exogenous SOD in old Sed arteries. Collectively, these results indicate that exercise training reverses age-induced endothelial dysfunction in SFA by increasing NO bioavailability and that increases in vascular antioxidant capacity may play an integral role in the improvement in endothelial function...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis is a {{literature}} study into the applications of diatom frustules. The second part is FE-analysis of micromechanical testing of diatom frustules undertaken at NTNU. The models are based on SEM-images of the specimens before and after testing. The simulations are initially run under an assumed <b>young</b> <b>s</b> modulus, the <b>young</b> <b>s</b> modulus is then modified until the displacement of the real and virtual tests yield identical results. Two distinct tests are analyzed in this thesis, a cantilever bending test (CBT) and a three-point bending test (TPBT), both on Coscinodiscus sp. frustules. The simulations of the CBT and TPBT returned <b>young</b> <b>s</b> moduli of 32. 8 GPa and 36. 7 GPa, respectively. The returned values for stress varied on the mesh size being used, a mesh size of the 10 mm equivalent to 10 nm returned 3415 MPa and 2690 MPa for the CBT and TPBT respectively. However, the point of highest stress in the TPBT simulation does not coincide with the fracture in the specimen. Since the results presented in this thesis are based on only two models, the dataset is insufficient to draw any conclusions as to the mechanical properties of the material. Further mechanical tests should be performed, with the purpose of analyzing the results using FE-tools.
