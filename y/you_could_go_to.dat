25|$|Harlacher {{grew up in}} Camarillo, California, {{and started}} acting in school plays. When she was around 9–10 years old, she was {{inspired}} by an interview by Christy Carlson Romano who voiced Kim Possible, in which Romano said that with voice acting, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work in your pajamas. Harlacher's mother responded {{that it was not}} a real job, and suggested she pursue acting only as a hobby. Her first exposure to anime was through Dragonball Z and Pokémon shows, which she considered more like cartoons, and that she really got into manga and anime in school when Fruits Basket was being published in English. At La Reina High School, she was active in the Speech and Mock Trial team, which was noted statewide and even attended a national event. She also competed on the school's diving team.|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} to his pre-war clerical job at the Sydney Town Hall, but soon switched to a job with motor parts distributor Stack & Company, which allowed him more time for cricket commitments. Morris was automatically restored to the Sheffield Shield team in 1946–47 upon the resumption of competition. He made 27 and 98 in his first match against Queensland, and was selected for an Australian XI match against Wally Hammond's touring MCC team when first-choice opener Bill Brown was injured. In what was effectively a trial for the Test team, Morris scored 115 and featured in a 196-run partnership with Test captain Don Bradman, who scored 106. It was {{the beginnings of a}} productive cricketing relationship. Morris said of Bradman: [...] "He was marvellous. If you had a problem, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him and sort it out. I found him relaxed and straightforward".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to writing a weekly column for The Dallas Morning News for 15years, Marcus {{was the author}} of multiple retailing-oriented books, including Minding the Store: A Memoir (1974), the sequel Quest for the Best (1979), and His & Hers: The Fantasy World of the Neiman Marcus Catalogue (1982) He was a close friend of other writers, including Jane Trahey, an author and longtime advertising copywriter who at one time worked for Neiman Marcus, and historian David McCullough. A television presenter for the public broadcasting program American Experience, McCullough said he once asked Stanley Marcus– [...] "one of the wisest men I know"– what single problem or aspect of American life, if given a magic wand, he would change, to which Marcus replied, [...] "I'd try to do something about television." [...] When asked why, he explained, [...] "Because", he said, [...] "If you could do something about television, think how far <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> solve all the other problems." ...|$|E

2500|$|Evert {{said that}} [...] "Martina {{revolutionized}} {{the game by}} her superb athleticism and aggressiveness...She brought athleticism {{to a whole new}} level with her training techniques — particularly cross-training, the idea that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the gym or play basketball to get in shape for tennis." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2012, Ramsay opened The Fat Cow in Los Angeles, US at The Grove, a {{shopping}} {{area that is}} also popular with tourists. Ramsay explained his intention for the Fat Cow in a press release to signify {{the opening of the}} venue: [...] "The concept for The Fat Cow came from my desire to have a neighborhood restaurant that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> all the time to just relax and enjoy a terrific meal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{comprehensive}} {{success of the}} Battle of Megiddo, Sir Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) at the War Office encouraged Allenby {{with the idea that}} the EEF could do anything: [...] "There is much talk here of the usual kind some saying <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Petrograd and some saying that all your force should now be transported to France, and some again {{who would like to see}} you march east to Baghdad!" [...] He continued: [...] "Your success being so complete, I should like you to consider the possibility of a cavalry raid on Aleppo, to be supported by infantry or not as the situation developed and as opportunities offered." [...] He added that the War Cabinet was prepared to take full responsibility for any unsuccessful outcomes.|$|E
6000|$|He {{could not}} help {{laughing}} either when 'Manda Grier said, [...] "I guess if you was likely to forget the number <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> round <b>to</b> the station and inquire. They got your address too." ...|$|R

2500|$|Responding to such {{criticism}} Popović said in early 1994: [...] "Well, I'm a lawyer, so technically yes, I am committing {{an act of}} treason under Serbian laws. But I distinguish between {{the interests of the}} Serbian state and the Serbian people and I think these interests are opposed at this moment. The military defeat of the Milošević government {{is in the best interest}} of the Serbian people. It is something that every good Serbian patriot should wish for. I don't think I betrayed my people". Pressed further to clarify his position on the ramifications of such an act such as an implication that a violent foreign intervention can solve certain political problems, like the problem of an armed Serb secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or from Croatia, as well as his position on the inevitable civilian death toll if such an action is to occur, Popović said: [...] "I think that's an unfair question. If I see somebody trying to murder somebody else, of course my duty is to try to stop him. I'm not saying that by doing so and applying violence to the situation, I'm actually trying to help those people lead a good life. I don't know what they will do once they leave the scene. What I see Serbs doing in Bosnia is committing an act of aggression against a state that has been recognized by United Nations, and I see them committing genocide. I think that both of these things should be stopped. Of course, stopping it would not solve the problem of how these people will live next to each other in the future, but first you have to stop the crimes. The international community has an obligation to do so, under the Genocide Convention and the United Nations Charter. They have an obligation to use force to stop aggression, and to stop genocide. In any armed conflict there will be civilian casualties. Unfortunately, that's something that can't be avoided. But I don't think that this fact should prevent the international community from doing what they are obliged to do under the international law: stopping the aggression, stopping the genocide. It sounds nice to advocate peaceful means, but it is not realistic. I return to this parallel: If you see some big guy beating a kid in the street, it would be very good if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him and say 'Please stop this, you shouldn't be doing this, it is uncivilized. This poor guy cannot defend himself.' No, if that doesn't work, you call the police, who have to use violence. At this point in history you have to revert to violence to stop crime." [...] Asked whether he signed the particular petition because of the circumstances rather than principally thinking that such measures solve problems, Popović said: [...] "I'll go even further. I signed this document knowing perfectly well that this will never happen. I did it as a gesture to show that I realized who's the main culprit in the Yugoslav conflict. And I wanted to express my opinion that this government would deserve it, even though it will never happen".|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> them, Kea," [...] I cried earnestly. [...] "Whatever {{they think}} and feel now, they couldn't help liking you and loving {{you when they}} saw you. I wish you could {{get away from this}} dreadful Hawaii!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Patty, I do wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the party. It was {{so sweet}} of Clare to invite you, and perhaps {{she will be}} {{offended}} if you don't go--she won't understand. Clare Forbes isn't a girl whose friendship is to be lightly thrown away when it is offered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well." [...] She put {{her hand}} on his arm and he felt it tremble there, while she palpitated, [...] "We are all so glad <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on <b>to</b> Rotterdam. My mother wanted me to tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Supposing I {{buy this}} {{document}} from you," [...] he said, [...] "what is its actual value? <b>You</b> <b>could</b> write out another confession, get that signed, {{and sell it}} to another of Sir Timothy's enemies, or <b>you</b> <b>could</b> still <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Scotland Yard yourself." ...|$|R

'If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> {{sleep for a}} couple of years, you would wake up to find yourself in a city such as I would not fear to compare with any in Europe. Your exhausted civilization is not as energetic as ours, I calculate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, dearest, {{you shall}} {{do what you}} would like best. But I wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep now. Try to rest quietly, and by-and-by you will perhaps sit up a little. God has kept you in life {{in spite of all}} this sorrow; it will be sinful not to try and make the best of His gift. Dear Tina, you will try;--and little Bessie brought you some crocuses once, you didn't notice the poor little thing; but you will notice her when she comes again, will you not?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't dare to complain," [...] said Alexina slowly. [...] "We {{ought to}} be so thankful to get the positions. I am thankful. And I don't mind so very much about my music. But I do wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> college, Stephen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've told William {{all about}} you," [...] said she. [...] "We have no secrets. I {{am so sorry}} about it. But it couldn't have been so very deep, <b>could</b> it, if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> off <b>to</b> {{the other end of}} the world and leave me here alone. You're not crabby, are you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Maria, [...] "I {{suppose they}} would; {{but it is}} a great deal better to have money of your own. Besides, suppose that when you get to Liverpool, for some reason or other, your father should not be there. Then, having plenty of money, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a hotel and stay there till your father comes. Or you could ask some one of the {{passengers}} who is going to London to let you go with him, and you could tell him that you had plenty of money to pay the expenses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is odd. If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him and tell him everything!" [...] But the Captain, looking at the matter all round, thought {{that he could not}} go to Sir Thomas and tell him anything. Then she began gently to {{introduce}} the respectable clergyman at Ostend. It was not necessary that she should refer at length to the circumstances under which she had studied the subject, but she gave Captain Batsby to understand that it was one as to which she had picked up a good deal of information.|$|E
6000|$|... "In any case," [...] she said, [...] "from the {{immediately}} practical standpoint England is {{the best}} place for you till you have shaken off all traces of that fever. Pass the time away somehow till the hunting begins, and then go down to the East Wessex country; they are looking out for a new master after this season, and if you were strong enough you might take it on for a while. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Norway for fishing in the summer and hunt the East Wessex in the winter. I'll come down and do a bit of hunting too, and we'll have house-parties, and get a little golf in between whiles. It will be like old times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{quite sure}} she'd {{like you to}} stay," [...] said Herbert. [...] "After you were all gone yesterday, she said how delighted she was <b>to</b> have you <b>go</b> away for a little time. And she did say she thought <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a better place than Castle Richmond." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a man; {{you know}} him; {{you know all}} sorts of things--all sorts of {{ways of looking at}} things, I don't know. If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> so far--as <b>to</b> be frank." ...|$|R
5000|$|What you're proposing is this - if I {{give you}} all the {{supplies}} <b>you</b> want, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> straight <b>to</b> Berlin - right straight (500 miles) to Berlin?

6000|$|... "Have you thought, Harry," [...] she asked, after {{speaking}} {{for some time}} about his doings and position at court, [...] "of joining your people again? There is peace between the Peishwa's court and the English. There is a British Resident at Poona and, as you have now gained a certain rank there, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him with a much better face than if you had come direct from here, as a peasant. Then it {{would probably have been}} supposed that you were an impostor. That you were English, of course could be seen by your skin; but it might have been thought that I had adopted some English child, and was now trying to pass it off as the son of an officer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{be alone}} with them. That's what I meant to discuss with you. I had a long talk with Rachel tonight. Anne, she's feeling dreadful bad over a good many things. She's not left very well off. It seems they mortgaged the farm eight years ago to give the {{youngest}} boy a start when he went west; and they've {{never been able to}} pay much more than the interest since. And then of course Thomas' illness has cost a good deal, one way or another. The farm will have to be sold and Rachel thinks there'll be hardly anything left after the bills are settled. She says she'll have to go and live with Eliza and it's breaking her heart to think of leaving Avonlea. A woman of her age doesn't make new friends and interests easy. And, Anne, as she talked about it the thought came to me that I would ask her to come and live with me, but I thought I ought to talk it over with you first before I said anything to her. If I had Rachel living with me <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college. How do you feel about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know not, sir; but 'tis {{likely they}} {{never even heard}} of it. The country is all dry and barren, and there were no mines to tempt them. The Indians never speak of it; those who were alive when the Spaniards came had some reasons for not doing so; and even now <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the nearest village, which lies more than twenty miles away, and ask the people about it, but they would only say that they had never heard of it, that no such place existed, for they believe that even to speak of it would bring dire disaster. We Indians are Christians; the Spaniards made us so. We make the sign of the cross, and we bow before their images and pictures, and once a year we go to their churches; but among the tribes east of the {{mountains}} that is all. We believe in the traditions of our fathers and in the demons of the forest; and though {{on this side of the}} hills, where the Spaniards held a tight grip upon us, the people have well-nigh forgotten their old faith, they still believe in many of the tales they have learned from their fathers, and this of the Castle of the Demons, as it is called, is as strong as ever in these parts." ...|$|E
5000|$|Peter Anthony {{made the}} film over a decade; {{the process was}} {{difficult}} because of Petrov's reluctance to open up. Anthony said: “He is quite difficult to work with, as in his day, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> still <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the gulag for disclosing unauthorised information, and as an ex-soldier, he wasn’t really interested in discussing his personal feelings. That though, is {{the beauty of the}} story.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Don Ramon smiled. [...] "After all, your joining Mr. Wolf {{has some}} advantages, {{particularly}} since the steamer he has chartered is ours, and I don't {{know that it is}} necessary for you to break your engagement with us. If it is not broken, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> Campeador after the other boat's return, and, in the meantime, will get your pay. I expect Mr. Wolf did not state how long he wanted you." ...|$|R
