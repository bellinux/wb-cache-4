50|$|In 1862 John Buhot, {{originally}} from Barbados, in the West Indies, experimentally produced sugar granules from cane {{grown in the}} Brisbane Botanical Gardens, demonstrating its potential as a commercial crop in Queensland. A number of farmers were interested in growing cane, but little was known about its cultivation in local conditions, or about the production of sugar. In October 1864, Buhot came to Maryborough to purchase plants from John Eaton who was growing an experimental cane crop. While there, he gave a lecture at the School of Arts on the cultivation and manufacture of sugar to a large audience. While in Maryborough, Buhot also trialled sugar production from some of Eaton's crop with promising results. Eaton and others formed the Maryborough Sugar Company in August 1865 and purchased 400 acres at Tinana for a plantation and mill. Several blocks were under cane by 1865 and the first crop was crushed by primitive methods producing a coarse <b>yellow</b> <b>sugar.</b>|$|E
50|$|When the {{partnership}} of Havemeyers & Elder {{was formed in}} 1863, Henry Osborne Havemeyer, known in the business as H.O. Havemeyer, was a fifteen-year-old apprentice and, in the family tradition, was learning his way through {{all aspects of the}} business from testing sugar at the docks to learning the complex processes of refinery operations, including the carefully guarded secrets of sugar boiling. Subsequently, he became apprentice to J. Lawrence Elder, working on the mercantile aspect of the business—purchasing, sales and record keeping. When Elder died suddenly in 1868, H.O. Havemeyer and his brother Thomas took over the mercantile business and became partners in Havemeyers & Elder in 1869. Cousin Charles H. Senff also joined {{the partnership}} to manage refinery operations and construction with Theodore A. Havemeyer. By 1868 the Havemeyers & Elder refinery had doubled in size. Known as the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sugar</b> House, it covered the blocks on the East River waterfront from South 2nd Street to South 5th Street. Modern innovations were introduced into refinery operations, such that sugar was refined with great efficiency. By 1876 Thomas Havemeyer was no longer involved in Havemeyers & Elder, and H.O. Havemeyer became the principal partner in charge of the mercantile business.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The Glycemic index (GI) is {{a measure}} of the effects of {{carbohydrates}} in food on blood sugar levels. It estimates how much each gram of available carbohydrate (total carbohydrate minus fiber) in a food raises a person's blood glucose level following consumption of the food, relative to consumption of glucose. Cane sugar requires further processing to provide the free-flowing white table sugar required by the consumer. The completely refined white sugar product is now over 99. 9 % sucrose and for all practical purposes contains no nutritional elements such as vitamins, minerals, proteins or fibers. Refined sugar is lethal when ingested by humans because it provides only that which nutritionists describe as "empty " or "naked " calories. It lacks the natural minerals which are present in the sugar beet or cane. The main objective of this study was to estimate and compare the GI values of the Partially Refined <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sugar</b> and PlantationWhite Sugar. In- vivo study was conducted by using Male wistar rats as a model and blood glucose analysis was done on semiautoanalyser by GOD – POD method. In this study, it was observed that the GI value of the Partially Refined <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sugar</b> was 84 % and GI value of the PlantationWhite Sugar was 100 %. From this we concluded that Partially Refined <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sugar</b> has low GI value as compared to the PlantationWhite Sugar and thus it can be used for the preparation of food items for the diabetic patients and for the weight loss program...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that in a sugar production, only about 80 % of sucrose, {{extracted}} from the beet, is output as a commercial product. The rest is lost during the processing or remains in intermediates. The color of white sugar is mainly determined {{by the color of}} the returned to the first stage of crystallization of the brown sugars melt. An effective way {{to improve the quality of}} melt is affination of brown sugars. Coloring substances are preferably present in the film on the surface of sugar crystals. To improve the efficiency of affination experiments were carried out by layer-by-layer processing of the normalized crystal size with the saturated solution of white sugar. To evaluate the numerical characteristics of the color of the samples studied scanerometrical method followed by computer processing of images in RGB color mode was used. The studies suggest that the solution of the starting <b>yellow</b> <b>sugar</b> having visual yellow color intensively absorbs 450 – 480 nm of spectrum, so there is no blue component in the graphs. During the affination removing of coloring substances from the surface of crystals takes place changing the light absorption intensity. There is a bleaching of the samples at affination duration up to 3 minutes. Further 5 – 10 min treatment is accompanied by partial diffusion of colorants from mother liquor to the surface of crystals and improved chromaticity. Prolonged affination results in crystals abrasion; it is accompanied by unproductive energy consumption on the mixing process. The results obtained indicate that the effective removal of coloring substances occurs within 1 – 3 minutes of affination. In this case brown sugar chromaticity decreases from 625 to 130 – 230 units of optical density and mother liquor chromaticity is increased from 20 to 900 – 1600 units of optical density. The studies suggest that most of the coloring substances determining the chromaticity of yellow sugars is found in the film on the crystal surface and is easily removed by 3 min long affination. Method of determining of objects color characteristics in RGB system describes adequately the intermediates coloring of sugar production and can be used in research...|$|E
