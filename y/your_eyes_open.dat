500|$|Beatles biographer Bob Spitz {{described}} Starkey's upbringing as [...] "a Dickensian {{chronicle of}} misfortune". Houses {{in the area}} were [...] "poorly ventilated, postage-stamp-sized ... patched together by crumbling plaster walls, with a rear door that opened onto an outhouse." [...] Crawford commented: [...] "Like all of the families {{who lived in the}} Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive." [...] The children who lived there spent much of their time at Princes Park, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood. Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in {{one of the oldest and}} poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool. Starkey later commented: [...] "You kept your head down, <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> and you didn't get in anybody's way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Give him miles an' miles--an' then comin' home, on good trails, ride him for {{all your}} worth.... Now, Lucy, keep <b>your</b> <b>eye</b> <b>open.</b> Don't let any one get near you on the sage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{lieutenant}} is {{a regular}} sneak," [...] he said. [...] "Keep <b>your</b> <b>eye</b> <b>open</b> fer him, Dave--an' don't trust him a farthing's worth. He is just the kind to play you dirty the first chance he gits." ...|$|R
500|$|Manhunt {{is easily}} the most violent game ever made. It will likely be {{dismissed}} by many as a disgusting murder simulator with no reason to exist. But Manhunt also is the Clockwork Orange of video games, holding <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> so as to not miss a single splatter – asking you, is this really what you enjoy watching? Had Manhunt been poorly made, using the snuff film angle as a cheap gimmick, the game would have been shameful and exploitative. What elevates it to a grotesque, chilling work of art is both presentation and game play. Manhunt is solid as a game; it's engaging to use stealth as you creep {{through the streets of}} this wicked city, using your smarts to avoid death, while dishing out much of your own. It's Ubisoft's Splinter Cell meets the cult Faces of Death videos [...] If Manhunt succeeds at retail, it will say more about America's fascination with violence than any political discourse or social debate. That makes Manhunt the most important video game of the last five years.|$|E

[...] one day when I started to leave, Ruby shook hands with me and I could feel {{a piece of paper}} in his palm… [...] {{he said it was a}} conspiracy and he said … if you will keep <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> and your mouth shut, you're gonna learn a lot. And that was the last letter I ever got from him." ...|$|E

[...] It originally began as a [...] "gathering for Indigo kids" [...] but developed into a [...] "movement of Integrity, Love and Unity" [...] which is [...] "trying to be the best you can be, taking responsibility for your reality and living with <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open.</b> It's not some religious preachy thing, rather being a passenger in this dimension, trying {{to make the most of}} your experience and striving for perfection while understanding it's okay not to be perfect." ...|$|E
