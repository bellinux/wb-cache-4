5|$|Once {{you hear}} the song 'Fighting Temptation', and all the music in this film, you can't help but {{fall in love with}} it. You'll {{definitely}} get emotional. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> become happy or even sad, but your heart will get full. All the songs are touching and spiritual, and that's what the movie itself is like.|$|E
5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E

5|$|None of them played instruments, so I {{was left}} to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it <b>you</b> <b>might</b> change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E

25|$|I {{have removed}} Aspar and Ardaburius from this world, {{so that no}} one who might oppose me would survive. But you also must kill your {{son-in-law}} Ricimer, lest there be anyone who might betray you.

25|$|While {{there are}} some {{relatively}} pristine objects, such as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> see in the Louvre or the British Museum, {{the vast majority of}} recovered tables and inscriptions are in much worse condition. They have been broken with only portions found, intentionally defaced, and damaged by weather or the effects of being buried underground. Many tablets were not even baked in antiquity and have to be carefully handled until they are heated properly.|$|E
25|$|If {{somebody}} kept a {{very accurate}} {{record of a}} human being, going through the era from the Gay 90s, from {{a very different kind}} of world through the turn of the century—as far into the twentieth century as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> live. I decided to make myself a good case history of such a human being and it meant that I could not be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.|$|E
25|$|Pieces {{that can}} slide forward promote far {{more easily than}} steppers or jumpers. As the board thins out their {{promotion}} becomes unavoidable, while steppers can almost always be met by an opponent stepper to neutralize it {{by the time it}} arrives at the promotion zone. The potential promotion gain of the sliders is thus always {{an important part of the}} material balance, but if it makes up too large a part of your total strength, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be overwhelmed before you can develop this potential.|$|E

25|$|Tallahassee raids a {{deep fried}} Twinkies stand {{in search of}} his snack. During this, Columbus is startled by the noises of a rat and accidentally shoots at the last {{remaining}} box of Twinkies in the pantry, destroying all the cakes and making them inedible. Luckily, Little Rock has gotten a Twinkie beforehand and gives it to Tallahassee. The movie ends with the group leaving Pacific Playland as Columbus realizes without relating to other people, that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> as well be a zombie, and that he now has what he's always wanted: a family.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of wild animals and birds have been {{observed}} in the area. The ones <b>you</b> <b>might</b> see when rambling around the countryside are wild boar, deer, foxes, hares and rabbits. The birds in your garden will include sparrows, swallows, starlings, crows, rooks, magpies, pigeons, finches and robins {{and you may be}} lucky enough to see flocks of migrating wild geese flying by. In the forest, you will hear - and sometimes see - owls and woodpeckers. Some species have suffered from hunting in recent years but there are now considerable efforts to protect flora and fauna. An area of the commune's forest is now a nature reserve.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} wonder {{in the region}} which is called Ercing. A tomb is located there next to a spring which is called Licat Amr; {{and the name of}} the man who is buried in the tomb was called thus: Amr. He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and Arthur himself killed and buried him in that very place. And men come to measure the grave and find it {{sometimes}} six feet in length, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen. At whatever length <b>you</b> <b>might</b> measure it at one time, a second time you will not find it to have the same length – and I myself have put this to the test.|$|E
