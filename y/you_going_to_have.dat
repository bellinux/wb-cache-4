2500|$|We {{all know}} that Social Security {{is running out of}} money, {{and it has to be}} fixed. You have {{proposed}} to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts. But the critics are saying that's going to mean finding $1 trillion over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up. So where do you get the money? Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to increase the deficit by that much over 10 years? ...|$|E
60|$|MRS MARCH. Heavens! Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> them X-rayed? They haven't got chest trouble, Geof.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aren't <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> breakfast?" [...] I urged. The clock at {{that moment}} began to ring a sonorous twelve. He looked up at it with subdued irritation.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{character}} team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each {{character is a}} pastiche of a superhero, Tischman insisted the concept was much broader than that: [...] "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. <b>You</b> are always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the really cute one. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the quiet one. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the spiritual one and <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the goofy one. Thatâ€™s the case from every group from Justice League to 'N Sync" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyhow," [...] he went on, {{speaking}} with decision, [...] "so {{long as you}} feel like that, <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new gown--or two--and a new hat, and <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> them at once. They are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be bought with your brother's money, mind. Shall I come shopping with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see very}} clearly," [...] remarked the Scarecrow, [...] "that <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> trouble in conquering those Horners--unless we help you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{almost like}} to fall sick {{for the sake}} of staying here," [...] said Tony, admiringly. [...] "Now, what sort of beds are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> miss? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child?' {{he asked}} incredulous. It seemed, {{to look at}} her, impossible, she was so young and so far in spirit from any child-bearing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> two teachers?" [...] asked Mary Bell. [...] "If you do, then we can't {{have any}} scholars;--for {{the baby is}} not old {{enough to go to}} school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you send}} me word <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a {{birthday}} party?" [...] asked the little Kansas girl, when the first greetings were over.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was not easy," [...] she said. [...] "If {{they had}} known that <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a doctor <b>to</b> visit him, {{it would have been}} impossible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, you awful despot," [...] he said, [...] "do {{you mean}} to tell me that <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no regard for the will of the people?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Merciless. Hasn't the {{beginnings}} of an idea of fair play.... None at all.... No human give or take.... Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> tea here, or are you walking back now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{simply will}} not have him sit with you again, and you must not advise any one to put a cent into his concern. Where are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this performance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{another glass}} of brandy-and-water?" [...] Pen said, with a humorous look. It was at the Black Kitchen that the above {{philosophical}} conversation took place between the two young men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, when I go in {{for myself}} <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an interest," [...] replied Andy, and his tone showed that he meant what he said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not that <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the curate!' said Mrs. Finch. 'Jane, Jane, {{that has}} brought the rouge! Oh! I hope and trust {{it is not the}} curate.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} best to know nothing at all," [...] she replied. [...] "I simply said that <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> dinner with some of your new friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{my niece}} wouldn't open it! The prophet is without honor {{in his own}} family. Well, {{what do you think}} of living for several hundred years? Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a try for it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} they would make you sick, amongst them," [...] said his mother. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{anything}} more to eat?" [...] she asked, with a housekeeper's latent impatience to get her table cleared away.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{going to}} take shares in a city next year, and watch the digging myself,' he said. 'It beats {{elephants}} to pieces. In this game you're digging up dead things and making them alive. Aren't <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a flutter?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Likely enough. 'Gad! the {{performance}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> commence," [...] Arthur exclaimed, quickly. [...] "Paul, <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new sensation. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see {{the most beautiful}} woman in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The bioscope," [...] Louise decided firmly, [...] "I refuse <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> do with. You {{have had}} all the entertainment <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this evening, Mr. Countryman." ...|$|R
6000|$|Carl was alarmed. [...] "Gosh!" [...] he protested, [...] "I hope <b>you</b> aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> much <b>to</b> do {{with the}} {{long-haired}} bunch.... I've invented a name for them--'the Hobohemians.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you ought}} to be doing is running a place over here in England like Muldoon has back home. But {{you will be able to}} write one more story out of this {{business}} here, if you want to. When are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> another try for my scarab?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{put that}} heart {{into such a}} breast--eighteen years old--and give it that masterly intellect which showed in the face, and furnish it with that almost god-like spirit, and what are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have?</b> The {{conventional}} Joan of Arc? Not by any means. That is impossible. I cannot comprehend any such thing as that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not. You {{have got}} the same mixed-up idea about these things that {{everybody}} has down there. I had it once, but I got over it. Down there they talk of the heavenly King--and that is right--but then they go right on speaking {{as if this was}} a republic and everybody was on a dead level with everybody else, and privileged to fling his arms around anybody he comes across, and be hail-fellow-well-met with all the elect, from the highest down. How tangled up and absurd that is! How are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a republic under a king? How are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a republic at all, where the head of the government is absolute, holds his place forever, and has no parliament, no council to meddle or make in his affairs, nobody voted for, nobody elected, nobody in the whole universe with a voice in the government, nobody asked to take a hand in its matters, and nobody ALLOWED to do it? Fine republic, ain't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that was}} your considerateness. You didn't want to give trouble, even if you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{sacrifice}} your principles. But it's all right now. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> your vegetables." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{objected to}} the sea trip strongly. A sea trip does you good when <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a couple of months}} of it, but, for a week, it is wicked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Silly child," [...] he answered, {{giving her}} hand a shake. [...] "Listen to what I am telling <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> friends <b>to</b> look after you always. Aren't you glad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{had seemed}} to her that he was looking much to the right of that cradle and tomb of his ancestral dignity; but she made no further observation, and taking his arm walked home beside him almost in silence. She did not know that Middleton Abbey lay in the {{direction}} of his gaze. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> out Darling this afternoon?" [...] she asked, presently. Darling being the light-gray mare which Winterborne had bought for Grace, and which Fitzpiers now constantly used, the animal having turned out a wonderful bargain, in combining a perfect docility with an almost human intelligence; moreover, she was not too young. Fitzpiers was unfamiliar with horses, and he valued these qualities.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we won't go into Shakespeare," [...] said Ogilvy [...] "What {{interests}} {{me is that}} our young women nowadays are running about as free as air practically, with registry offices {{and all sorts of}} accommodation round the corner. Nothing to check their proceedings but a declining habit of telling the truth and the limitations of their imaginations. And in that respect they stir up one another. Not my affair, of course, but I think we ought to teach them more or restrain them more. One or the other. They're too free for their innocence or too innocent for their freedom. That's my point. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any apple-tart, Stanley? The apple-tart's been very good lately--very good!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you coming}} to see my studio? I've got it rather nice and new. I'm making twenty-five a week; my next engagement, I'm going to get thirty. I should like Mrs. Fiorsen to know--Oh, I forgot; you don't like me to speak of her! Why not? I wish you'd tell me!" [...] Gazing, as the {{attendant}} had, at his furious face, she went on: [...] "I don't know how it is, but I'm not a bit afraid of you now. I used to be. Oh, how is Count Rosek? Is he as pale as ever? Aren't <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> anything more? You've had hardly anything. D'you know what I should like--a chocolate eclair and a raspberry ice-cream soda {{with a slice of}} tangerine in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, you've pleased {{them all}} and I've just {{fallen in love with}} <b>you.</b> I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> at the Woman's Club. You must come and see me. Come often, won't you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Garbage in, garbage out" [...] {{speaking}} to graduates at Simon Fraser University [...] "If <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any chance {{at all to}} solve any problem, first make sure your facts are correct." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now I'm afraid perhaps I'll hurt <b>you.</b> We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new schoolbuilding in this town--in {{just a few}} years--and we'll have {{it without}} one bit of help or {{interest}} from you! ...|$|R
