5|$|County {{finished}} the 2007–08 season {{fourth in the}} league, and subsequently won their play-off semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 on aggregate. The club had previously visited Wembley four times, and Gannon had played on all four occasions. He did as a manager what he could never do as a player, and guided Stockport victory at Wembley; the 3–2 win over Rochdale earned Gannon's club promotion to League One. He refused to give a post-match interview to Sky Sports following a nine-month dispute with the company over a broken Skybox. Nevertheless, having quickly taken Stockport from the foot of League Two and into League One on a meagre budget, Gannon had established himself {{as one of the}} most highly rated <b>young</b> <b>managers</b> in the lower leagues. In the summer he sold Liam Dickinson to Derby County for £750,000 – a player signed by previous manager, Chris Turner from Woodley Sports for a nominal fee just over two years previous.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} labor market for mutual fund managers. Using data from 1992 - 1994, we find that "termination" is more performance-sensitive for <b>younger</b> <b>managers.</b> We {{identify}} possible implicit incentives created by the terminationperformance relationship. The shape of the termination-performance relationship may give <b>younger</b> <b>managers</b> an incentive to avoid unsystematic risk. Direct effects of portfolio composition may also give <b>younger</b> <b>managers</b> an incentive to ''herd'' into popular sectors. Consistent with these incentives, we find that <b>younger</b> <b>managers</b> hold less unsystematic risk and have more conventional portfolios. Promotion incentives and market responses to managerial turnover are also studied. © 2000 the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present some results of an {{interview}} study of <b>younger</b> <b>managers</b> and older subordinates in Sweden. An aim of the study was to increase the understanding of the significance of age in working life and the relations between <b>younger</b> <b>managers</b> and older subordinates. Data have been collected through semi-structured interviews with 23 <b>younger</b> <b>managers</b> who had experience of managing subordinates who were 20 years older or more. Furthermore, 19 older subordinates who had experience of being managed by managers who were at least 20 years younger were interviewed. Male and female interviewees have been selected from different kinds of organizations, lines of business and management levels. The results showed that many <b>younger</b> <b>managers</b> stressed the importance of listening to older subordinates, both in order to make them feel involved in the daily work and in order to utilize their extensive experience and knowledge. Most of the older subordinates were satisfied with the way they were being managed but some told about situations when the <b>younger</b> <b>managers</b> carried out changes too fast, were insecure or concerned about their prestige. A conclusion was that both younger and older people have much to learn from each other and that generally age was not seen as being of determinant importance in management.  Readers must contact Common Ground Publishing Pty Ltd for permission to reproduce this article...|$|R

40|$|As Australia’s {{workforce}} ages, {{the incidence}} of <b>younger</b> <b>managers</b> supervising the work of older employees is increasing. However, research into issues arising from this phenomenon is in its infancy. This study investigates the perceptions of <b>younger</b> <b>managers</b> and older workers regarding their interactions. Results suggest that certain factors, including aspects of stereotyping and attitudes are salient to these relationships. By revealing such perceptions and differences between the cohorts, {{a better understanding of}} intergenerational differences and their effects on working relationships can be achieved. This, in turn, provides a framework upon which human resource management (HRM) might develop policies and procedures to manage emergent issues. Using data from 36 informants, this inquiry discovered that <b>younger</b> <b>managers</b> and older workers hold widely divergent perceptions of their interactions in the workplace, and many elements of these interactions affect working relationships in both a negative and positive manner. The implications of these findings are considered, and avenues by which intergenerational issues might be addressed by HRM are explored...|$|R
