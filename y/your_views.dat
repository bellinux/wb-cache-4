500|$|Shackleton's initial {{reply was}} accommodating: [...] "I {{would like to}} fall in with <b>your</b> <b>views</b> as far as {{possible}} without creating a position that would be untenable to myself". However, Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. [...] "I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided [...] "what limits he puts on his own rights". To this Shackleton replied: [...] "There {{is no doubt in my}} mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further".|$|E

During this study, Derrida not only divulges the exact instances Socrates or his interlocutors make use of this concept, but also reveals the relationship between Plato and Socrates which scholars have kept in secret by questioning the validity of authorship in Plato's letters, where in the Second Letter Socrates writes: [...] "Consider these facts and take care lest you sometimes come to repent of having now unwisely published <b>your</b> <b>views.</b> It is a very great safeguard to learn by heart instead of writing. It is impossible for what is written not to be disclosed (to me graphein all' ekmanthanein). [...] That {{is the reason why}} I have never written anything about these things, and why there is not and will not be any written work of Plato's own (oud' estin sungramma Platonos ouden oud' estai). What are now called his are the work of a Socrates embellished and modernized (Sokratous estin kalou kai neou gegonotos). [...] Farewell and believe. Read this letter now at once many times and burn it." [...] (Letter II, 314) ...|$|E
