Lady Constance is usually introduced by a statement {{along the lines}} of [...] "what is that coming towards us? – It's huge – It's a rhinoceros!" [...] – [...] "No, it's me!!!" [...] and this is often accompanied by a rousing rendition of [...] "Happy Days Are Here Again", and always by rousing cheers from the audience. Her size is legendary; in the [...] "Henry VIII" [...] sketch, Katharine of Aragon and Lady Constance (masquerading as Anne of Cleavage) fight a duel to decide who is to be Queen. [...] Brooke-Taylor introduces her in the style of a boxing MC: [...] "..and in the blue corner, at 15 hundredweight, your own, <b>your</b> <b>very</b> <b>own</b> – and there's enough to go round – twice -...". [...] In the [...] "Dentisti" [...] sketch, a parody on the 1960s TV series Daktari, Lady Constance plays (appropriately) an elephant; and in [...] "Jack The Ripper", Lady Constance is invited to: [...] "please, sit down anywhere ... or in your case, everywhere". In the [...] "Radio Prune Greek Tragedy" [...] sketch, she plays the mother of Oedipus Rex – according to the Oracle, she was hoping for a dog – and [...] she tells Oedipus: [...] "Now let me get on with my housework, I've got a little behind [...]." [...] (pause for the double-entendre to register) [...] ".. oh all right, I've got a colossal behind!!" [...] In the [...] "Colditz" [...] sketch, the lads' escape route is through the plug hole of her bath, and Bill Oddie exclaims [...] "She's like a ruddy great iceberg: one eighth above the water, 76 eighths below!". She also in her own way {{is a bit of a}} nymphomaniac – she's described in the 25th anniversary show version of [...] "Jack The Ripper" [...] as a steaming volcano of eroticism – and there are frequent references to unfulfilled sexual desire: in the [...] "3.17 to Cleethorpes" [...] sketch, she and the other players in the drama are adrift on a raft in the ocean; Lady Constance offers to take all her clothes off and use them for a sail, and when Hatch says, [...] "Yes, and then what?", Lady Constance replies, [...] "Well, that's rather up to you ...." ...|$|E

You've got one job, and no more. There inside you lies <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>very</b> self, like a germinating egg, your {{precious}} Easter egg of your own soul. There it is, developing bit by bit, from one single egg-cell which you were at your conception in your mother's womb, on {{and on to the}} strange and peculiar complication in unity which never stops till you die--if then. You've got an innermost, integral unique self, and since it's the only thing you have got or ever will have, don't go trying to lose it. You've got to develop it, from the egg into the chicken, and from the chicken into the one-and-only phoenix, of which there can only be one at a time in the universe. There can only be one of you at a time in the universe--and one of me. So don't forget it. Your own single oneness is your destiny. Your destiny comes from within, from your own self-form. And you can't know it beforehand, neither your destiny nor your self-form. You can only develop it. You can only stick to <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>very</b> self, and NEVER betray it. And by so sticking, you develop the one and only phoenix of your own self, and you unfold your own destiny, as a dandelion unfolds itself into a dandelion, and not into a stick of celery.|$|R
6000|$|He did, it is true, think {{something}} about his worldly prospects. He had talked rather grandiloquently to his mother as to his hating money, and hating the estate. His mother's never-ceasing worldly cares on such subjects perhaps demanded that a little grandiloquence should be opposed to them. But Frank did not hate the estate; nor did he at all hate the position of an English country gentleman. Miss Dunstable's eloquence, however, rang in his ears. For Miss Dunstable had an eloquence of her own, even in her letters. [...] "Never let them talk {{you out of your}} own true, honest, hearty feelings," [...] she had said. [...] "Greshamsbury is a very nice place, I am sure; and I hope I shall see it some day; but all its green knolls are not half so nice, should not be half so precious, as the pulses of your own heart. That is your own estate, <b>your</b> <b>own,</b> <b>your</b> <b>very</b> own--your <b>own</b> and another's; whatever may go to the money-lenders, don't send that there.

Granted that you wanted to vanish, was it necessary to put bogus bones in the cave, so as nearly to put a halter round the neck of Doctor Brown? And who put it there? The statement would appear perfectly maniacal; but so far as I can make head or tail out of anything, Doctor Brown seems to have put it there himself." ...|$|R

From this sure post it makes its sallies even to the beginning and to the end of all things. As to death, the scientific mind dies at its post working in normal and methodic fashion to the end. It disregards so petty a thing as its own physical dissolution as completely as it does all other limitations upon the plane of matter. Am I right, Professor Summerlee?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Reading is made {{too easy}} nowadays, with cheap paper editions and free libraries. A {{man does not}} {{appreciate}} at its full worth the {{thing that comes to}} him without effort. Who now ever gets the thrill which Carlyle felt when he hurried home with the six volumes of Gibbon's [...] "History" [...] under his arm, his mind just starving for want of food, to devour them at the rate of one a day?

60|$|When I try {{to account}} for this effect I find no {{difficulty}} about it. I find that, as a rule, when a thing is a wonder to us it is not {{because of what we}} see in it, but because of what others have seen in it. We get almost all our wonders at second hand. We are eager to see any celebrated thing--and we never fail of our reward; just the deep privilege of gazing upon an object which has stirred the enthusiasm or evoked the reverence or affection or admiration of multitudes of our race is a thing which we value; we are profoundly glad that we have seen it, we are permanently enriched from having seen it, we would not part with the memory of that experience for a great price. And yet that very spectacle may be the Taj. You cannot keep your enthusiasms down, you cannot keep your emotions within bounds when that soaring bubble of marble breaks upon your view. But these are not your enthusiasms and emotions--they are the accumulated emotions and enthusiasms of a thousand fervid writers, who have been slowly and steadily storing them up in your heart day by day and year by year all your life; and now they burst out in a flood and overwhelm you; and you could not be a whit happier if they were <b>your</b> <b>very</b> <b>own.</b> By and by you sober down, and then you perceive that you have been drunk on the smell of somebody else's cork. For ever and ever the memory of my distant first glimpse of the Taj will compensate me for creeping around the globe to have that great privilege.|$|E
6000|$|It is a {{great thing}} to start life with a small number of really good books which are <b>your</b> <b>very</b> <b>own.</b> You may not {{appreciate}} them at first. You may pine for your novel of crude and unadulterated adventure. You may, and will, give it the preference when you can. But the dull days come, and the rainy days come, and always you are driven to fill up the chinks of your reading with the worthy books which wait so patiently for your notice. And then suddenly, on a day which marks an epoch in your life, you understand the difference. You see, like a flash, how the one stands for nothing, and the other for literature. From that day onwards you may return to your crudities, but at least you do so with some standard of comparison in your mind. You can never be the same as you were before. Then gradually the good thing becomes more dear to you; it builds itself up with your growing mind; it becomes a part of your better self, and so, at last, you can look, as I do now, at the old covers and love them for all that they have meant in the past. Yes, it was the olive-green line of Scott's novels which started me on to rhapsody. They were the first books I ever owned--long, long before I could appreciate or even understand them. But at last I realized what a treasure they were. In my boyhood I read them by surreptitious candle-ends in the dead of the night, when the sense of crime added a new zest to the story. Perhaps you have observed that my [...] "Ivanhoe" [...] is of a different edition from the others. The first copy was left in the grass by the side of a stream, fell into the water, and was eventually picked up three days later, swollen and decomposed, upon a mud-bank. I think I may say, however, that I had worn it out before I lost it. Indeed, it was perhaps as well that it was some years before it was replaced, for my instinct was always to read it again instead of breaking fresh ground.|$|E
