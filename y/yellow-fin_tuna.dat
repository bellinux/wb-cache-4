50|$|The {{economy of}} Manihiki is {{dominated}} by the cultivation of black pearls and there are pearl farms dotted around the lagoon. Tourism provides a secondary source of income, although facilities are rudimentary. The reef provides excellent swimming and snorkeling among colourful tropical fish and coral, making scuba diving a major attraction for visitors. Visitors are allowed to snorkel or free-dive but not scuba dive without a permit. Visitors can obtain a permit at the administration office either from the Island Secretary or the Mayor or the Deputy Mayor. There is good fishing in the open waters beyond the reef, including catches of <b>Yellow-fin</b> <b>Tuna</b> and Flying fish. Tours of the pearl farms can be also be arranged.|$|E

40|$|Bycatch {{taken by}} the tuna purse-seine fishery from the Indian Ocean pelagic {{ecosystem}} was estimated from data collected by scientific observers aboard Soviet purse seiners in the western Indian Ocean (WIO) during 1986 – 92. A total of 494 sets on free-swimming schools, whale-shark-associated schools, whale-associated schools, and log-associated schools were analyzed. More than 40 fish species and other marine animals were recorded. Among them only two species, <b>yellow-fin</b> and skipjack <b>tunas,</b> were target species. Average levels of bycatch were 0. 518 metric tons (t) per set, and 27. 1 t per 1000 t of target species. The total annual purse-seine catch of yellowfin and skipjack tunas by principal fishing nations in the WIO during 1985 – 94 was 118, 000 – 277, 000 t. Nonrecorded annual bycatch for this period was estimated at 944 – 2270 t of pelagic oceanic sharks, 720 – 1877 t of rainbow runners, 705 – 1836 t of dolphinfishes, 507 – 1322 t of triggerfishes, 113 – 294 t of wahoo, 104 – 251 t of billfishes, 53 – 112 t of mobulas and mantas, 35 – 89 t of mackerel scad, 9 – 24 t of barracudas, and 67 – 174 t of other fishes. In addition, turtle bycatch and whale mortalities may have occurred. Because the bycatches were not recorded by some purse-seine vessels, {{it was not possible}} to assess the full impact of the fisheries on the pelagic ecosystem of the Indian Ocean. The first step to solving this problem is for the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission to establish a pro-gram in which scientific observers are placed on board tuna purse-seine and longline vessels fishing in the WIO...|$|R
50|$|The {{steep sides}} of the plateau cause deep-water {{currents}} to rise up {{when they hit the}} bank; this upwelling brings with it nutrients and minerals from the bottom, feeding the local ecosystem. Over 130 species from numerous classes of the animal kingdom call the bank home at least temporarily. Some such fish are the Atlantic cod, silver hake, yellow-tail flounder, blue-fin and <b>yellow-fin</b> <b>tuna,</b> striped bass, blue fish and numerous species of shark including the great white shark. Shellfish such as the American lobster, sea scallops, squid and ocean quahogs are also prevalent. Many marine birds call the bank home including gannets, shearwaters, storm petrels, fulmars, puffins and razorbills. Reptiles are even present, primarily being represented by the leatherback sea turtle. Possibly the most famous animals on Stellwagen Bank are the mammals. Five species of seals (harp seal, gray seal, harbor seal, hooded seal, and ringed seal), and numerous whale species swim in the waters of Stellwagen. Whale watchers can frequently see humpback whales, minke whales and fin whales. There are occasional sightings {{of one of the most}} critically endangered whale species, North Atlantic right whale. Several other whale species can also be seen here including the sperm whale, beluga, orca, pilot whale, White-beaked dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin, common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, Risso’s dolphin, harbor porpoise, blue whale, and sei whale.|$|E

40|$|We {{made some}} {{researches}} on {{the relations between}} the fishing conditions of tuna and general oceanographical conditions, comparing the fishing season of Summer with that of Winter. The results obtained were as the following. 1. Fishing rate per 100 hooks amounted to 6. 4 in Summer and to 7. 4 in Winter. 2. In the case of <b>Yellow-fin</b> <b>tuna</b> the percentage of fish caught in Winter was 52. 5 and in Big-eyed tuna the percentage was 16. 7 0, and that in Summer was 63. 9 and 2. 3 respectively. And from this fact it was elicited that the fluctuation of Big-eyed tuna catch in Summer was irregular. 3. The body length composition of Yellow-fintuna showed the varying range of 100 - 160 cm; the most general standard of size of the fish lay within the range of 130 - 150 cm; and a greater number of large-sized fish was found in Summer than in Winter. 4. The sex ratio of <b>Yellow-fin</b> <b>tuna</b> was about 692 in Winter; 57. 1 in Summer (both in the case of male). The almost all the fish caught in both seasons were found to be near the state of Ripenning. 5. The optimum temperature for catch was found to be 20 °- 23 °C in Winter; 23 °, [...] 25 °C in Summer. 6. Oceanographical and astronomical conditions in Winter and those in Summer showed different appearances; having quite intimate relations with the fishing conditions respectively. ...|$|E

40|$|Since 1952, the Tunny Catch Fluctuation {{at the sea}} fronts {{spreading}} {{over the}} both South & Northward of the sea fronts off the Mangoli and Taliabu Islands belonging to the Sula Islands lying eastward of the Celebes Island has investigated by {{the crew of the}} Kagoshima-maru, Training ship of Kagoshima University, {{as a part of the}} fixed researching plan. After making some researches according to the features derived from the regional and seasonal devisions, the following results were obtained. (1) It was in Winter and at the North side of the sea front that the Fishing Rate per 100 hooks reached its maximum at the figure of 6. 0 %; and the next one was observed, in Summer, at the Southern Sea Front, at the figure of 5. 8 %. (2) At the southern sea fronts, an abundant appearance of Big-eye tuna (38 %) was observed, the fish body being large, 30 % of those fish caught having the trunk-length more than 141 ~ 150 cm and body-weight more than 60 kg. At the northern sea front, in winter, the appearance of Marlin's reached 33. 7 % of the total, main species of which being Sail Fish. (3) The main sources of the Catch are, except the Summer Season at the southern sea front, composed of <b>Yellow-fin</b> <b>tuna.</b> (4) Through both Summer and Winter, good catch percentage was seen at the southern sea front along the water-line about 20 miles off the seaside of Taliabu Island. (5) At the Southern Sea Front, about 25 miles off the seaside and in case of the Northern Sea Front, about 30 miles off, the Drift-Line could not help being overwhelmed by the running waves, and this showed the existence of a Tide current. The detailed Sea condition of these fronts should be reported in the next paper...|$|E
40|$|Recentry the {{fish-finder}} for {{tuna fishing}} {{has been developing}} {{and there are many}} reports on the echogram of fish-finder,recording the swiming depth of the fish and their density, by HASHIMOTO, NISHIMURA and MANIWA. In the tuna fishery, however, the fish-finder by ultrasonic wave has not been used so effective as in trawl and purse sein. For the study on the method of its field operation, the auther had some experiments with the fish-finder at Philippine Sea,in June and November 1962. The fish-finder wich where installed on M. S. NAGASAKIMARU, the fishery training vessel, Nagasaki Univ., 130 GT, has charactors shown inTabie 1. The one NEC 1620 type, was used for detecting tuna shoal, another 1600 type, for tracing the tuna longline under waterco ntribution. From these experiments,it was recognized that the fish-finder could sharply catch the reflaction from the fish and was very covenient for the study of their ecology. And from echograms that the ability of sounding capacity was about 8000 m by 13. 5 KC and 800 m by 200 KC under cruising by 9 knots on the slight or moderate sea,and detecting a sigle tuna (20 db, bcdy weight 35 kg) it was 250 m by 13. 5 KC (Fig. 2 & 3). The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1) Their typical echograms are shown in PLATE Ⅲ- 2. 3 and detecting area of tuna echosunder the above conditions is shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore,it was caluculated from Fig. 5 that the fish-finder could cover the conical volume, 108 m 3 per hour under cruising by 9 knots. 2) It was measured that the running ultrasonic noise was 40 db under cruising by 9 knots against the wind being 12 m/sec, and the reflection loss of <b>yellow-fin</b> <b>tuna</b> (B. W. 30 kg) was 22 db (Fig. 7). The single tuna, however, was recorded distinguishably as "Λ" on the paper which was filled with ultrasonic noise (PLATE Ⅲ- 2). As the result from analysis of those echograms, it was estimated that the tuna were in 40 - 200 m depth layer and most of them were in "resting state", and some-times a few of them moved with 1 - 5 knots reactively against the aproaching plancton net or fishing gear. (PLATE Ⅳ- 5, 6) ﻿ 3) Especially, {{the fact that there were}} no correlation between the density of their population and the daily catch per hook; will have a important point on the estimation of their population (Fig. 10, Table 3). 4) From the PLATE Ⅳ- 7,Ⅴ- 8, 9 shown the daily migration of D. S. L. and small fishes,it was observed that the small fish (less than about 10 kg in body weight) would be moving vertically with the migration of D. S. L [...] From the nacturnal echogram, it was shown that the D. S. L. contained small single fish from surface to 120 m depth, but a few large fisfes (more 10 kg body weight) were scattered from 100 to 200 m depth, and it was observed that D. S. L. began to dive suddenly with the speed of 200 - 400 m per hour at begining of morning twilight and it proceeded to dive until arriving at the 230 - 300 m or 550 - 700 m depth at half an hour after sunrise, but during the daytime it has no migration. And it was observed that in the evening, D. S. L. began to refroat toward 0 - 120 depth under the same speed as in morning diving, following with the small fish and a few large fishes...|$|E
