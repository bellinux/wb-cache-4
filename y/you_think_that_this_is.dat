This is not an invention of the 20 th century but reaches back to history where we we can find women cross-dressed or even bearded as men. St Wilgefortis or St Uncumber was a bearded and crucified woman who was venerated widely in northern Europe during the fifteeneth and sixteenth centuries. Wilgefortis is a corruption of the term „virgo fortis“ („strong virgin“). She and other female saints were considered as „imitations of Christ“. The paper deals with the reasons why this saint became so popular and how even today ideas about such strong virgins which mirror androgynous symbolism live on in popular culture...|$|E

40|$|Computers use {{algorithms}} {{to evaluate}} polynomials. This paper will study {{the efficiency of}} various algorithms for evaluating polynomials. We do this by {{counting the number of}} basic operations needed; since multiplication takes much more time to perform on a computer, we will count only multiplications. This paper addresses the following: a) How many multiplications does it take to evaluate the one-variable polynomial, Σ= + + + + = n i i i n n a a x a x a x a x 0 2 0 1 2 [...] . when the operations are performed as indicated? (Remember that powers are repeated multiplications and must be counted as such.) Write this number of multiplications as a function of n. b) Use mathematical induction to prove that your answer is correct. c) Find another way to evaluate this polynomial by doing the operations in a different order so that fewer multiplications are needed. Hint: Think of ways to intermix addition and multiplication and experiment with polynomials of lower degree. Write the number of multiplications as a new function of n. The best algorithm will use only n multiplications. Explain the algorithm you will use. d) How many multiplications does it take to evaluate the two-variable polynomial, ΣΣ = = n i n j i j ij a x y 0 0 when the operations are performed as indicated? Write this number of multiplications as another function of n. e) Use mathematical induction to prove that your answer is correct. f) Find another way to evaluate the two-variable polynomial by doing the operations in a different order so that fewer multiplications are required. Write down the associated function of n. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the most efficient algorithm? If not hunt for a better algorithm...|$|E

On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour [...] "it is like confessing a murder". Hooker replied [...] "There may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species.

Ireland, Sir, pays a great deal more than Scotland, and is perhaps as much and as effectually united to England as Scotland is. But if Scotland, instead of paying little, had paid nothing at all, we should be gainers, not losers, by acquiring the hearty coöperation of an active, intelligent people towards the increase of the common stock, instead of our being employed in watching and counteracting them, and their being employed in watching and counteracting us, with the peevish and churlish jealousy of rivals and enemies on both sides.|$|R
