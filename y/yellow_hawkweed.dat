50|$|Hieracium floribundum (also {{known as}} pale hawkweed, smoothish hawkweed, <b>yellow</b> <b>hawkweed,</b> and yellow devil hawkweed) is {{a species of}} noxious and {{herbaceous}} perennial plant from Asteraceae family that is known in Europe (particularly France) and {{can also be found}} in United States and Canada. It was believed that it was a hybrid of Hieracium caespitosum and Hieracium lactucella.|$|E
50|$|Japanese {{knotweed}} {{is harmful}} to the ecosystem because it takes up available habitat for the native species thereby decreasing the biodiversity and disrupting the food chain. Also, knotweed roots are known to break off and float downstream, forming new infestation and threatening the stream banks. <b>Yellow</b> <b>hawkweed</b> tends to invade open and undisturbed natural areas. It establishes and spreads along roads or areas that are yet to reforest, affecting the forest industry.|$|E
50|$|Hieracium lachenalii {{also known}} as common {{hawkweed}} or <b>yellow</b> <b>hawkweed</b> is a species of plants in the dandelion tribe within the sunflower family. It is native to Europe but has become established as a weed in Australia and parts of North America. The species was widely known for many years as H. vulgatum but more recent studies indicated that the two names represented the same species. The name H. lachenalii was coined in 1802, H. vulgatum in 1819, so the older name is to be used.|$|E
50|$|Hieracium caespitosum (commonly {{known as}} meadow <b>hawkweed,</b> <b>yellow</b> hawkweed,field <b>hawkweed,</b> king devil, <b>yellow</b> paintbrush, devil's paintbrush, yellow devil, yellow fox-and-cubs, and yellow king-devil)is like several other Hieracium species {{and has a}} similar {{appearance}} {{to many of the}} other Hawkweeds.|$|R
50|$|Common {{plant species}} that flower {{in the spring}} and summer include fireweed, <b>yellow</b> and orange <b>hawkweed,</b> Oxeye daisy, nodding trillium, and yellow clintonia. Species {{flowering}} later in the season include viper's bugloss, bladder campion, yarrow, evening primrose and a variety of asters.|$|R
60|$|To {{return to}} the downs. Their very {{emptiness}} and desolation, which frightens the stranger from them, only serves {{to make them more}} fascinating to those who are intimate with and have learned to love them. That dreary aspect brings to mind the other one, when, on waking with the early sunlight in the room, you look out on a blue sky, cloudless or with white clouds. It may be fancy, or the effect of contrast, but it has always seemed to me that just as the air is purer and fresher on these chalk heights than on the earth below, and as the water is of a more crystal purity, and the sky perhaps bluer, so do all colours and all sounds have a purity and vividness and intensity beyond that of other places. I see it in the <b>yellows</b> of <b>hawkweed,</b> rock-rose, and birds'-foot-trefoil, in the innumerable specks of brilliant colour--blue and white and rose--of milk-wort and squinancy-wort, and in the large flowers of the dwarf thistle, glowing purple in its green setting; and I hear it in every bird-sound, in the trivial songs of yellow-hammer and corn-bunting, and of dunnock and wren and whitethroat.|$|R
