40|$|This is {{study of}} {{morphological}} and physical characteristic of bamboo from species Schizostachyum brachycladum. The bamboo samples {{were taken in}} Pergau jungle area, next to Pergau Dam. Bamboo culm of aged 1, 2, 3 and 4 years were used in this study. For the morphological study, the investigations that were carried out were on the rhizomes, shoots,culms, culm sheaths, branches, clump formation and leaves.

5|$|A flight {{lieutenant}} {{when war}} broke out, Balmer {{was promoted to}} squadron leader in June 1940, becoming the inaugural commanding officer of No.13 Squadron, which operated Lockheed Hudsons out of Darwin, Northern Territory. He was raised to temporary wing commander in April 1941, and within a <b>year</b> <b>had</b> taken charge of the RAAF's first Bristol Beaufort unit, No.100 Squadron. Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in June 1942, he led the Beauforts on bombing and torpedo missions against Japanese targets in the New Guinea campaign.|$|E
5|$|By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in {{its fourth}} year. The {{previous}} <b>year</b> <b>had</b> been one of success for France and her allies, most particularly on the Danube, where Marshal Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had created {{a direct threat to}} Vienna, the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of Versailles and Madrid, Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the Grand Alliance.|$|E

According to Atlus, the game's sales {{by the end of the}} 2002-2003 fiscal <b>year</b> <b>had</b> reached 45,000 units: this fell below their planned sales number of 67,000 units.

5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} {{was that the}} trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a miscarriage of justice.

The medal was to be given in gold to the heads of state and in silver to the victorious generals. Others to be honoured would receive the medal in bronze. The usual procedure for the time was followed: the Royal Academy were asked to submit a design. They proposed work by one of their members, John Flaxman.|$|E

5|$|In 1891, Fisher {{was elected}} {{as the first}} {{president}} of the Gympie branch of the Labour Party. In 1893, {{he was elected to the}} Legislative Assembly of Queensland as Labour member for Gympie and by the following <b>year</b> <b>had</b> become Labour's deputy leader in the Legislative Assembly. In his maiden speech, he pushed for a 50% decrease in military spending and declared support for a federation. Another policy area that captured his attention during this term, was the employment of workers from the Pacific Islands in sugar plantations, a practice that Fisher and Labour both strongly opposed. He lost his seat in 1896 following a campaign in which he was charged by his opponent Jacob Stumm with being a dangerous revolutionary and an anti-Catholic, accusations that were propagated by the newspaper Gympie Times.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, 'A' Force (the Cairo-based {{department}} responsible for deception operations in the North Africa) had begun an operation, codenamed Cascade, to inflate {{the number of troops}} in the region by creating fictional divisions.

The Allies invaded Italy in September 1943 {{and by the end of}} the <b>year</b> <b>had</b> occupied most of the south of the country. Thirty-eight divisions were deployed across the Mediterranean theatre, mostly in Italy with some in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, Capcom {{announced}} they expected {{the game to}} sell 7 million copies {{by the end of}} the 2012 fiscal year, however the company lowered their expectations to 6 million due to the game's mixed reception. Upon release, Capcom announced that it had shipped 4.5 million copies worldwide, setting a new record for the company. In October 2012, the game sold 806,000 copies in the United States. According to Capcom, sales weakened following the strong start, with the company admitting that the game would not meet their goals, and consequently lowered their financial projections for the fiscal year as a result. The game had sold 4.9 million copies by April 2013, and, by October the same <b>year,</b> <b>had</b> sold 5.2 million copies worldwide, becoming one of Capcom's best-selling video games.|$|E

5|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that the CWU had started a fighting fund to help support postal workers who were experiencing financial difficulties {{as a result of}} the strike.
