In this way it is similar to consequentialism, which some leaders of the movement explicitly endorse. The views of the philosopher Peter Singer in particular helped give rise to the effective altruist movement. Singer's book The Life <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Save <b>argued</b> for the basic philosophy of effective giving, claiming that people have a moral imperative to donate more because of the existence of extreme poverty. In the book, Singer argued that people should use charity evaluators to determine how to make their donations most effective. Singer personally gives a third of his income to charity.|$|R

40|$|In {{this project}} {{we will try}} to pin out what motives there were for the Danish {{military}} campaigns in the 12 th century. In {{the last couple of years}} there has been a discussion between medieval experts concerning the Danish engagement in the Wendish areas. Our inspiration derives from a general interest in the medieval conditions, especially from Danish perspective. Furthermore there has been quite a lot of debate about the matter lately, which also inspired us to dig into the subject. The experts have very different ways of how to perceive the Danish campaigns. By investigating the academic discussion of the medieval experts {{we will try to}} account for their arguments of whether or not <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> if Denmark were engaged in crusades to the Wendish areas. The Wendish campaigns though is characterized by a lot of different motives, both religious, but also political. Are investigating the experts and their work we can conclude that the military campaigns were to a much larger extent motivated by political reasons rather than religious. Although we do not neglect the fact that religion have had a huge significance in the Danish medieval society, and that it definelty have been part of the consideration before going to war in the Wendish areas, we don’t believe that the campaigns can be labeled as “crusades”. Above all because the campaigns aren’t consistent with the definition of a crusade...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates to what {{extend the}} Swedish film The Reunion (2013) by Anna Odell can be {{categorized}} as a documentary and how the spectator’s perception {{of the film is}} influenced by the understanding of its genre. Using a theoretical understanding of the documentary genre based on definitions by John Grierson, Bill Nichols and Carl Plantinga this paper explores how The Reunion manages to fulfill the demands that these definitions require from the documentary. The only exception is the documentary genre’s demand for truth value, which can be argued to be challenged {{by the fact that the}} first part of the film is fiction. However, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> that this issue can be solved, because the spectator is informed that this part of the film is fiction. Because genre status of the film is primarily defined by the spectator’s understanding of the documentary genre and not a theoretical definition, this paper further investigates how the use of fictionality may influence the spectator’s understanding of The Reunion. Through this investigation it was found that the film features elements that can be associated with fiction films and therefore potentially challenge the spectator’s understanding of the film as a documentary, if the spectator’s understanding of the documentary genre do not allow fictional elements. Furthermore, this paper explores the film’s potential for emotional impact and response from the spectator, but concludes, while this potential is present, that it is very hard to determine how the films genre impacts this emotional response...|$|E
40|$|There are {{earlier studies}} that have shown that there are {{correlations}} between grades and leisure time activities. Even though they are few and scattered {{in the sense that}} they have not investigated the same variables that effect grades. I have chosen to study the effects of leisure time activities and social time on school performance. The purpose of the study is to investigate if there is some or some specific leisure time activities that affect grades, and to investigate whether there is something else that affects the grades. This is to see if there are any leisure time activities that are more favorable for the students as well as less favorable. Analysis of empiric data and processing has occurred via SPSS by using the theories and studies. After realization of some answers from the survey weren’t statistically significant the study focused on looking for trends in the data. However, after more analysis so you can see a trend in the material that is procured, and that there are more than a denominator that affects grades. The results show that overall there are no correlation between leisure time activities and grades. Even though there where some trends found linking exercise and grades together to show a positive effect of exercise on school performance. It is no correlation and not conclusive. While the TV / Computer has shown almost the same thing, meaning that there were no correlations found between them and grades. And no trends showing anything at all were found. There are however some studies arguing that you can show correlations between time spent on leisure time activities and when analyzing those with the data that where collected <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> that there are some trends giving a ground for this, but in my opinion there is sadly enough not enough data to come to that conclusion.
