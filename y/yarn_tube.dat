40|$|The current <b>yarn</b> <b>tube</b> {{manipulator}} just finishes <b>yarn</b> <b>tube</b> grabbing work {{according to}} the fixed coordinates. In the actual production process, equipment problems or human factors which make the spindles not on fixed coordinates cause the damage of the manipulator. Real-time grabbing <b>yarn</b> <b>tube</b> system with visual sensing has been designed and a extraction algorithm of spindles coordinates based on a mixed image morphology and Hough transform algorithm has been proposed. Through {{the combination of the}} <b>yarn</b> <b>tube</b> image characteristics which are extracted by the algorithm and the visual measurement model which is established by pinhole imaging principle, the mapping relation of <b>yarn</b> <b>tube</b> image coordinates and world coordinates has been gained to get the location information of <b>yarn</b> <b>tube</b> in real time. Results show that the proposed method could make the robot complete the grabbing job precisely and efficiently, under which the system meet the requirement of spinning and dyeing production line...|$|E
40|$|Nanostructured {{materials}} with high aspect ratio and one-dimensional (ID) morphology are nature’s choices when {{high degree of}} functional performances and flexible properties are concerned. Two examples are extracellular matrices in tissues of living organism, and light harvesting rods of the retina and chlorophyll. Electrospinning (E-spinning) is a simple processing technique that allows fabrication of high aspect ratio nanofibers (NFs) in a commercial scale. Electrospun nanofibers (E-spun NFs) combine a number of physical properties such as guided electron transport, strain-induced electronic properties, high mechanical strength, high degree of flexibility, large specific surface area, high electron and thermal diffusivity, and tailorable pore distribution. Our laboratory {{has been involved in}} fabrication of E-spun polymeric, inorganic, and polymer-nanocomposite fibers in random, aligned, crossaligned, sheaths, <b>tubes,</b> <b>yarns,</b> core/shell, and trilayer morphologies. This article focuses on application of the E-spun fibers in the areas of clean energy, water treatment, and regenerative medicine in the authors’ laboratory. In addition, the article briefly reviews the progress made in these areas using E-spun NFs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) are {{of great}} technical interest {{because of their}} high strength (~ 37 GPa), good electrical conductivity, excellent thermal conductivity (3 000 W m- 1 K- 1), and good thermal stability at both low and high temperatures. A difficulty has been absence of reliable methods of controlling assembly of {{the large numbers of}} CNTs required for practical applications. We have developed, in collaboration with our partners at the NanoTech Institute, University of Texas at Dallas, a solid-state process for spinning CNTs into yarns without the use of binders that usually degrade the electrical and thermal conductivities. The singles yarns were twisted together to give coarser (multi-stranded) stronger yarns that were knitted using a miniature 5 -needle machine. Mechanical and electrical properties of the <b>yarns</b> and knitted <b>tubes</b> were assessed simultaneously using specially developed test equipment. Some specific applications under investigation include using the CNT yarns as incandescent and x-ray filaments, as electrodes for biomedical applications, and as composites with high toughness. Tests show the biocompatibility of the CNT yarns for selected cell lines is high...|$|R
