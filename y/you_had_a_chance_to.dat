[...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just made you want to feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should have}} seen it, had you done it," [...] Lute said. [...] "But it was all done before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> do anything. It was not your hand, not even your {{unconscious}} hand." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Lizard, [...] "you {{certainly}} are the champion boob. There <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> cop off a nice bunch of coin on that fight and instead you kill {{it for yourself}} and everybody else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he was {{not afraid}}--that is, {{he was not}} afraid of the journey, though it lay all through those dreadful wild Champs Elysees. But when we arrived, he was afraid to come in--to come up here. Captain Lovelock is so modest, you know--in spite of all the success he had in America. He will tell you about the success he had in America; it quite makes up for the defeat of the British army in the Revolution. They were {{defeated}} in the Revolution, the British, were n't they? I always told him so, but he insists they were not. 'How do we come to be free, then?' I always ask him; 'I suppose you admit that we are free.' Then he becomes personal and says that I am free enough, certainly. But it 's the general fact I mean; I wish you would tell him about the general fact. I think he would believe you, because he knows you {{know a great deal about}} history and all that. I don't mean this evening, but some time when it is convenient. He did n't want to come in--he wanted to stay in the carriage and smoke a cigar; he thought you would n't like it, his coming with me the first time. But I told him he need n't mind that, for I would certainly explain. I would be very careful to let you know that I brought him only as a substitute. A substitute for whom? A substitute for my husband, of course. My dear Mrs. Vivian, of course I ought to bring you some pretty message from Gordon--that he is dying to come and see you, only that he had nineteen letters to write and that he could n't possibly stir from his fireside. I suppose a good wife ought to invent excuses for her husband--ought to throw herself into the breach; is n't that what they call it? But I am afraid I am not a good wife. Do you think I am a good wife, Mr. Longueville? You once stayed three months with us, and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> see. I don't ask you that seriously, because you never tell the truth. I always do; so I will say I am not a good wife. And then the breach is too big, and I am too little. Oh, I am too little, Mrs. Vivian; I know I am too little. I am the smallest woman living; Gordon can scarcely see me with a microscope, and I believe he has the most powerful one in America. He is going to get another here; that is one of the things he came abroad for; perhaps it will do better. I do tell the truth, don't I, Mrs. Vivian? I have that merit, if I have n't any other. You once told me so at Baden; you said you could say one thing for me, at any rate--that I did n't tell fibs. You were very nice to me at Baden," [...] Blanche went on, with her little intent smile, laying her hand in that of her hostess. [...] "You see, I have never forgotten it. So, to keep up my reputation, I must tell the truth about Gordon. He simply said he would n't come--voila! He gave no reason and he did n't send you any pretty message. He simply declined, and he went out somewhere else. So you see he is n't writing letters. I don't know where he can have gone; perhaps he has gone to the theatre. I know it is n't proper to go to the theatre on Sunday evening; but they say charity begins at home, and as Gordon's does n't begin at home, perhaps it does n't begin anywhere. I told him that if he would n't come with me I would come alone, and he said I might do as I chose--that he was not in a humor for making visits. I wanted to come to you very much; I had been thinking about it all day; and I am so fond of a visit like this in the evening, without being invited. Then I thought perhaps you had a salon--does n't every one in Paris have a salon? I tried to have a salon in New York, only Gordon said it would n't do. He said it was n't in our manners. Is this a salon to-night, Mrs. Vivian? Oh, do say it is; I should like so much to see Captain Lovelock in a salon! By good fortune he happened to have been dining with us; so I told him he must bring me here. I told you I would explain, Captain Lovelock," [...] she added, [...] "and I hope you think I have made it clear." ...|$|E

Anders Wotzke from Cut Print Review called the film less funny than the 1993 Holocaust film Schindler's List.Stars from the film have acknowledged critical dislike of the film. During his Lifetime Achievement Award speech at the Golden Globes, Robert De Niro poked fun at the critical drubbing the film received, stating, [...] "I was very, very moved and gratified when you made the announcement this award two months ago, well before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> review Little Fockers".|$|E

5000|$|After 36 years passed, a fight {{broke out}} between the Yadavas, at a festival, who killed each other. His elder brother, Balarama, then gave up his body using Yoga. Krishna retired into the forest and started meditating under a tree. The Mahabharata also narrates {{the story of a}} hunter who becomes an {{instrument}} for Krishna's departure from the world. The hunter Jara, mistook Krishna's partly visible left foot for that of a deer, and shot an arrow, wounding him mortally. After he realised the mistake, While still bleeding, Krishna told Jara, [...] "O Jara, you were Bali in your previous birth, killed by myself as Rama in Tretayuga. Here <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> even it and since all acts in this world are done as desired by me, you need not worry for this". Then Krishna, with his physical body ascended back to his eternal abode, Goloka vrindavan and this event marks departure of Krishna from the earth. The news was conveyed to Hastinapur and Dwaraka by eyewitnesses to this event. The place of this incident is believed to be Bhalka, near Somnath temple.|$|E

[...] "Each day, 20,000 visitors line up for hours to catch these masterpieces by names synonymous with beauty -- Michelangelo, Bernini and Guercino, to name a few -- and to get a glimpse {{into the history of}} faith and aesthetics." [...] Furthermore, several of the artifacts arranged in the Vatican Splendors would not be shown in Rome. According to Peter Radestsky, [...] "'Even if you go to Rome, you won't see some of these things. They're just not displayed." [...] This statement is reiterated in Kaleem's article.

Unfortunately, shortages of INH are continuing and there will likely be a limited supply of INH for several months. CDC and the National TB Controllers Association (NTCA) have been working closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and drug manufacturers to assess the INH supply and determine how to ensure that the highest-risk patients receive this medication.

Christian, your attention to detail, desire for perfection, exceptional physical insight, and unwavering stance against the phrase direct black hole formation are qualities I admire and strive to reproduce in my own research. From our very first meeting, Christian has been an staunch advocate for open science, a philosophy that he has instilled in me throughout my time at Caltech and one that I plan on maintaining in my future career. I also thank the love of my life. Erin, there are so many reasons to be thankful to you. You are the best part of each and every day. On the science front, thank you for all our neutrino discussions, enlightening me on so many different aspects of neutrinos, and keeping my theoretical meanderings grounded in experimental reality. I am indebted to you for all your support, encouragement, persistence, and love throughout the writing of this thesis and I look forward to repaying that debt soon.
