5000|$|Cardijn {{blamed the}} death of his father, a mineworker, on harsh labor conditions. Working-class Belgians of the era tended to see the Church as serving the {{interests}} of the aristocracy, and some old friends considered Cardijn a traitor; he thus decided to devote his career to [...] "reconciling his Church with the industrial workers of the world." [...] When Cardijn was first made an assistant priest in the Brussels suburb Royal Laeken in 1912, he began to work with factory workers. In 1915, he became the director of the city's Catholic social work. In the years after the first world war, he began to organize <b>young</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>workers</b> the Brussels area to evangelize their colleagues; the group was named Jeunesse Ouvrière Chrétienne. Its teachings were based on labor encyclicals by Popes Leo XIII and Pius XI. It received approval from Pius XI in 1925.|$|E

5000|$|He was {{an average}} student in school though Frassati was known among his peers for his {{intelligence}} and more so for his devotion. He failed his exams in 1913 so was sent for private studies {{at a school}} that the Jesuits ran. Frassati was dedicated to works of social action that would unite people together in fellowship {{as a means of}} combating inequalities. He was an ardent opponent of Fascism and did not support the regime of Benito Mussolini. There was an instance in Rome where he was arrested while protesting alongside the <b>Young</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>Workers</b> Congress. He was involved with student groups as well as the Apostolato di preghiera and Catholic Action (joined in 1919) to which he dedicated himself to. But Frassati also became a professed member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic on 28 May 1922 to imitate the example of Saint Dominic in which he assumed the religious name of [...] "Girolamo" [...] in honor of Girolamo Savonarola. He was also devoted to the teachings of Saint Thomas Aquinas and Saint Catherine of Siena. The teachings of Saint Paul the Apostle also inspired him and that saint is mentioned in a range of Frassati's letters.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} history of the Chilean <b>Young</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>Workers</b> movement (JOC) from its founding in 1946 until the 1973 coup that almost completely destroyed it. The study explores how the JOC, a specialized branch of Catholic Action, formed a significant link in the widespread mobilization of the working classes in postwar Chile, where the movement achieved a depth and influence unmatched anywhere else in Latin America. The JOC reached its peak in the 1950 s in the country's booming industrial centers, with the movement's many large-scale events, activities, and campaigns attracting thousands from across the country, but it continued to have a considerable presence in working-class neighborhoods through the politically turbulent 1960 s and early 70 s. Fomenting a social and political consciousness intertwined with Catholic religiosity, the JOC served as a launching pad for local community activism as well as involvement in political parties and unions. Furthermore, JOC activists' commitment to social justice forged a path for the "popular" or "liberationist" Church that became a cornerstone of resistance to the Pinochet dictatorship. While connecting the JOC to Chile's broader social and political history, this dissertation focuses attention on how the ideologies and policies of a reformist Church worked themselves out on the ground. Drawing on both oral and written sources, it emphasizes the movement's significance for the young women and men living in Santiago's densely populated slums and working in the city's factories, workshops, and commercial centers. In particular, JOC activists' personal stories reveal how religion, class, and gender intersected in the movement to empower female workers. Despite being embedded in a patriarchal Church structure, the JOC's social Catholic discourse led working-class women to carve out a unique space for social activism and leadership that deeply influenced female activists' expectations regarding domestic relations and motherhood. At the same time, the JOC's focus on workers and workplace issues also made it attractive to young men, who traditionally shied away from Church participation at the parish level. In a movement in which women had equal authority, this participation provoked a subtle shift in men's perceptions of male power and dominance...|$|E
