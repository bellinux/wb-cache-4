5000|$|Until October 2010, Lime Wire LLC, the New York City based {{developer}} of LimeWire, distributed {{two versions of}} the program: a basic free version, and an enhanced version, LimeWire PRO, sold for a fee of US$21.95 with 6 months <b>of</b> <b>updates,</b> or $34.95 with 1 <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>updates.</b> The company claimed the paid version provides faster downloads and 66% better search results. This is accomplished by facilitating direct connection with up to 10 hosts of an identical searched file at any one time, whereas the free version is limited to a maximum of 8 hosts.Being free software, LimeWire has spawned forks, including LionShare, an experimental software development project at Penn State University, and Acquisition, a Mac OS X-based gnutella client with a proprietary interface. Researchers at Cornell University developed a reputation management add-in called Credence that allows users to distinguish between [...] "genuine" [...] and [...] "suspect" [...] files before downloading them. An October 12, 2005 report states that some of LimeWire's free and open source software contributors have forked the project and called it FrostWire.|$|R

However, due to these changes, all user statistics were reset. Additionally, the premium subscription options was dropped, as the game is no longer free-to-play and must be purchased for US$10.|$|R

50|$|The Friends of Rock Castle {{was formed}} in 1969 at time when the mansion and grounds were sold to the state from a Smith descendant. Board members take pride {{in the fact that}} Smith {{relatives}} have only owned the house. Sarah Crosby Berry was one of the founding members of the board. Each board member, save one, serves a three-year term. There are fifteen board members, including a “board member for life” who is Melinda Gaines, who has been on the board over twenty years. Most board members are very active with the site.At the time of museum creation, the State <b>of</b> Tennessee removed <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>updates</b> to the mansion. One update was the removal of a concrete floor in a bathroom, {{which turned out to be}} the kitchen. Sarah Berry assisted with the selection of the stones for the flooring based on her memory from when she was a child. Dormers were removed from the central portion of the house with the assumption that they were added later. However, they were actually original to that edition of the mansion, but are too expensive to restore at this point.|$|R

The CPCM program uses a team-based case management approach to monitoring patients on opioid prescriptions, with systematic tracking of patient data such as PEG scales, MEQ dosing, concurrent use of benzodiazepines, annual agreements, UDS and PMP checks and visit compliance, and regular provider-to-provider case reviews. While the CPCM program supports the primary care prescriber with consistent, data-based risk management and evaluation, it also aims to shift provider behavior and practices in opiate prescribing, towards an approach that is more collaborative, individualized to patients’ needs, and integrated with primary care. Through this breakout session, we will engage with other prescriber teams to learn about other team-based approaches to chronic pain case management, discuss best practices, and begin formulating issues that warrant research...|$|R

5000|$|Due to the Nexus 6's successor, the Nexus 6P, {{becoming}} more available, Google stopped selling the Nexus 6 on the Play Store in December 2015. Google has a stated policy {{of at least}} two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> software <b>updates</b> and three years (or 18 months after the last sale date on the Play Store, whichever is longer) <b>of</b> security <b>updates.</b> The Nexus 6 had guaranteed software updates through October 2016 and security patches through October 2017, however, Google announced that the Nexus 6 will receive the Android 7.1 update. This update was initially expected in December of 2016, but it was delayed until January 5, 2017 due to a [...] "last minute bug". In January 2017, Google announced that the Nexus 6, along with the Nexus 9 tablet, won't receive the 7.1.2 Nougat update, making 7.1.1 the last major software update from Google themselves.

40|$|Year after <b>year,</b> the {{frequency}} <b>of</b> <b>updated</b> releases <b>of</b> soft-ware continues to increase. Without an automated install process, {{the result is}} either that a system installs software with known defects and/or vulnerabilities, or systems require increased manual labor to maintain up-to-date software in-stallations. Linux packages, in conjunction with repositories, fill this need for automation to reduce both undesirable situa-tions. This model can be modified to a generic operating sys-tem environment, such as Windows, which currently lacks the capability to update arbitrary software applications. Our application, Appupdater, demonstrates this concept of de-tecting, downloading, and installing upgrades automatically. This provides a completely automated upgrade cycle...|$|R

Although this {{did not affect the}} broadcast area of NE1fm, it marked the end of thirty months of broadcast in a church building that had not typically been designed for radio broadcast, and allowed for the station to make further changes to its operation and sound. Shortly after the move, shifts in the stations management structure also occurred, with a number of founding members quoted on the initial Ofcom application ceasing to be involved with the station.
