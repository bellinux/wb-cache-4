The band initially intended to leave the album self-titled like their debut, but they changed it to You Could Have It So Much Better...With Franz Ferdinand before settling on the final title.

The band attempted to broaden its musical range on the album; Hardy said, [...] "There's {{more to life than}} disco-beat guitar music". It was generally well received in the press and seen as an album equal to, or better than, their first by most critics. It entered the UK Album Charts at Number 1 and the US charts at Number 8. The album eventually sold 2 million copies worldwide. To support the album, four singles were released. Included in that set is a double A-side single that contained a video-clip-only single as well (both the AA-side [...] "L. Wells" [...] and the video-clip [...] "Jeremy Fraser" [...] are not featured on the album, recorded in early 2006 during the band's tour of Australia in support of the album).

[...] "Do You Want To" [...] made it to number 4 and was declared by Q to be the greatest single of 2005, while [...] "Walk Away" [...] and [...] "The Fallen" [...] entered the top 15 of the UK Singles Chart.

You Could Have It So Much Better went on to earn a nomination for Best Alternative Album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in 2006, as did [...] "Do You Want To" [...] for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.|$|E
