500|$|When Henriksen {{first got}} the script, he mistook {{it for a}} film because of its [...] "powerful" [...] story. He was not fond {{of the idea of}} {{participating}} in a television project. Henriksen contacted Carter about the character; his first question was [...] "How are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this hero a hero? I mean, it is so dark, {{how are you going to}} handle this?" [...] Carter replied saying that Frank was a hero because he was able to [...] "stand-up" [...] against all of this. Henriksen was also worried about the dark [...] "feel" [...] of the show, saying that all shows needs some glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. According to Carter [...] "The yellow house" [...] was the light, which Henriksen later agreed upon.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Kramer {{delivered}} {{the final of}} four drafts of a novel that he wrote about the fast lifestyle of gay men of Fire Island and Manhattan. In Faggots, the primary character was modeled on himself, {{a man who is}} unable to find love while encountering the drugs and emotionless sex in the trendy bars and discos. He stated his inspiration for the novel: [...] "I wanted to be in love. Almost everybody I knew felt the same way. I think most people, at some level, wanted what I was looking for, whether they pooh-poohed it or said that we can't live like the straight people or whatever excuses they gave." [...] Kramer researched the book, talking to many men, and visiting various establishments. As he interviewed people, he heard a common question: [...] "Are you writing a negative book? Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it positive? ... I began to think, 'My God, people must really be conflicted about the lives they're leading.' And that was true. I think people were guilty about all the promiscuity and all the partying." ...|$|E

[...] "Pray give it up. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> yourself, and her, and her father miserable: <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> us all miserable. And for what? For a dream of justice. You will never make those twelve men happier than they now are." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I should if {{occasion}} ever arose; but I've {{never had}} to yet. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an international complication of the business?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Dane, [...] "will need a {{good many}} dollars, and you insisted on flinging those you had away. How are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There!" [...] shouted Billson, [...] "what {{have you}} got to say for {{yourself}} now? And what kind of apology are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{to me and to}} this insulted house for the imposture which you have attempted to play here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> your fortune, John, {{and get out}} of that disagreeable {{hardware}} concern?"

6000|$|... "If {{there were}} a few young men about, a little over {{seventeen}} and a little under fifty, it would be easier," [...] said Miss Anderson thoughtfully. [...] "But how are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a girl like other girls when there are no young men?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear fellow," [...] objected Gloriani, [...] "you don't mean <b>to</b> say <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> over in {{cold blood}} those poor old {{exploded}} Apollos and Hebes." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{that was}} for you to decide, Grisley," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Sanderson. [...] "Personally I don't see how <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any better investment in these times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{one of my}} team?" [...] {{said the}} Colonel {{to her on the}} morning after her arrival.

"I adore genius, Mr. Titmarsh," [...] {{said the}} young lady, with a most killing look of her {{beautiful}} blue eyes, [...] "and I have {{every one of}} your works by heart--all, except the last, which I can't endure. I think it's wicked, positively wicked--My darling Scott--how can you? And are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a Christmas-book this year?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're an undutiful daughter," [...] Lady Caroom declared. [...] "If I do talk I {{never say}} anything, so nobody need listen unless they like. About this entertainment, Arranmore.

6000|$|... "The man {{is growing}} {{stronger}} and better every day. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him recover, after all. I was afraid"--he corrected himself--"I thought"--the word was the truer--"that <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> poison him." ...|$|R

6000|$|The musical chime of {{a distant}} clock {{reminded}} her that supper time was near, and she sprang up as if much refreshed by this pleasant rest by the way-side.

6000|$|BARBARA. Why not! Do {{you know}} what my father is? Have you {{forgotten}} that Lord Saxmundham is Bodger the whisky man? Do you remember how we implored the County Council {{to stop him from}} writing Bodger's Whisky in letters of fire against the sky; so that the poor drinkruined creatures on the embankment could not wake up from their snatches of sleep without being reminded of their deadly thirst by that wicked sky sign? Do you know that the worst thing I have had to fight here is not the devil, but Bodger, Bodger, Bodger, with his whisky, his distilleries, and his tied houses?

6000|$|... “Suggest something, my dear sir?”—and Mr. Westgate {{looked him}} over with narrowed eyelids. “Open {{your mouth and}} shut your eyes! Leave {{it to me and}} I’ll fix you all right.

I find they generally want the true thing. So just please consider yourselves my property; and if any one should try to appropriate you please say, ‘Hands off—too late for the market.’ But let’s see,” continued the American with his face of toil, his voice of leisure and his general intention, apparently, of everything; “let’s see: are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> something of a stay, Lord Lambeth?” ...|$|E

But let's see," [...] continued the American, in his slow, humorous voice, with a distinctness of utterance which appeared to his visitors {{to be part of a}} humorous intention--a strangely leisurely, speculative voice for a man evidently so busy and, as they felt, so professional--"let's see; are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> something of a stay, Lord Lambeth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Who are you, Martin Eden? {{he demanded}} {{of himself in}} the looking-glass, that night {{when he got back}} to his room. He gazed at himself long and curiously. Who are you? What are you? Where do you belong? You belong by rights to girls like Lizzie Connolly. You belong with the legions of toil, with all that is low, and vulgar, and unbeautiful. You belong with the oxen and the drudges, in dirty {{surroundings}} among smells and stenches. There are the stale vegetables now. Those potatoes are rotting. Smell them, damn you, smell them. And yet you dare to open the books, to listen to beautiful music, to learn to love beautiful paintings, to speak good English, to think thoughts that none of your own kind thinks, to tear yourself away from the oxen and the Lizzie Connollys and to love a pale spirit of a woman who is a million miles beyond you and who lives in the stars!
