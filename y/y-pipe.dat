These dredge pipe pieces are used on-board of dredgers to connect the dredge pump with the discharge pipe. Mostly the pipes are made from cast steel. Sometime welded pipes are used.|$|E
40|$|The {{process piping}} in the {{refinery}} plant {{does not always}} have straight pipe geometry. The configuration of these pipelines are usually zigzag or snake-like. The pipe fittings or joints including elbow pipes, blind-tee pipes, T-pipes, <b>Y-pipes</b> {{are found to be}} common in a refinery. One of the reasons why the pipelines are layed in zigzag or snake-like configuration is because of the limited space for the piping equipment even in the largest refineries. The aim of the thesis is to study the physical flow inside a pipe with focus on blind-tee and elbow pipes. Laminar flow regime with Reynolds number equals to 1000 is investigated in this study. The analysis utilizes CFD numerical simulations by using OpenFOAM to investigate the physical flow inside the studied pipes. The geometry of the pipes which are used in this study have a diameter (D) of 1 m, and the blind-tee length varied from 1 D to 5 D. In order to achieve the main objective, there are sub-objectives which need to be carried out. First, the laminar flow analysis of the straight pipe with a length 10 D is investigated as the base case of the study. Since the straight pipe is installed before and after the pipe joints in order to attain the fully developed desirable flow profile. Second, the geometry and mesh setup of the studied pipes are created by using Autodesk Inventor, GMSH and SALOME Software, starting with the straight pipe, and then followed by the blind-tee and elbow pipe. Third, the numerical analysis is carried out by performing OpenFOAM CFD simulations. Fourth, the sensitivity studies of different mesh elements, timesteps, and Reynolds number are carried out. Last, the results of the velocity profiles obtained from the numerical simulations are validated with the velocity profiles of laminar flow derived from the analytical solution of classical formula. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of fluid flow in the straight pipe, blind-tee, and elbow pipe are presented. In addition, the streamline, velocity contour, and pressure contour of the blind-tee and elbow pipe cases are shown. For the straight pipe case, the velocity profile in the pipe agrees well with the analytical solution of classical formula. For the blind-tee and elbow pipe cases, the velocity profile at the 5 D from the inlet and 5 D from the outlet have been checked for grid convergence studies. It is found that there are flow circulations, which occurs inside the blind-tee. Moreover, for the blind-tee with the tee lengths that are equal to 4 D and 5 D, fluid deposits would very likely occur, since the velocity inside this tee is very low...|$|R

5000|$|The LG8 was {{a modern}} 307 CID L High-Output {{derivative}} of the LV2 produced from 1983 to 1987.

(The L69 F Body exhaust system components would be revised slightly and used again on the later LB9 305 and L98 350 TPI engines.)Additionally, the engines came equipped with a functional cold air induction hood on the 1983-1984 Trans Am H.O., a dual snorkel air cleaner assembly on the 1983-1986 Camaro Z28/IROC-Z H.O., and 1985-1986 Trans Am H.O., and a large, single snorkel, on the 1983-1988 Monte Carlo SS (also, rare optional dual snorkel in 1987-1988), an aluminum intake manifold, high stall torque converter in the Monte SS and 1984 F-Body, or a lightweight flywheel on T-5 eqipped F-Body's, and all F-Bodies utilized 3.73 axle gears (3.42 Standard in 1984 F-Body/ THM700R4/optional w/3.73:1).

5000|$|The Hyper Pak was a parts package made {{available}} from 1960 through 1962 at Chrysler Corporation dealer parts counters. The parts were {{made available}} {{to comply with the}} regulations of sanctioning bodies for racing events in which Valiants had been entered by factory-backed teams: All parts used had to be [...] "stock" [...] parts, the definition of which meant that they were available through normal factory parts channels. The Hyper Pak consisted of a very-long-ram intake manifold meant to accept a Carter AFB 4-barrel carburetor, the AFB carburetor itself and an appropriate air cleaner, dual (front-3 and rear-3) cast-iron exhaust headers, a large-diameter exhaust <b>Y-pipe</b> to connect to these dual cast-iron headers, a larger muffler, a 276°-duration camshaft with appropriate valve springs and pushrods, a heavier-duty clutch, a manual choke control, a starter motor modification template and, in the full-race version of the package, high-compression pistons designed to increase the engine's compression ratio to 10.5 from the stock 8.5. The Hyper Pak was recommended for installation only on vehicles equipped with manual transmissions, for the camshaft was of such characteristics that a high idle speed was required to prevent engine stall-out. The Hyper Pak was primarily intended for competition driving, its road manners involving rough idling and poor cold-engine driveability, a high power band and poor fuel economy. But, in competition events, it proved unbeatable. Eight factory-backed Valiants entered the 1960 NASCAR compact car race at Daytona Beach, and humbled the competition; the Valiants came in first through eighth. After a similar performance the following year, the race was dropped. A high-fidelity reproduction of the Hyper Pak intake manifold was created by noted Slant-6 builder Doug Dutra in the late 1990s; subsequently the tooling was sold to a marketer of performance equipment for inline six-cylinder engines.|$|E

Understanding and analyzing complex volumetrically varying data is a difficult problem. Many computational visualization techniques have had only limited success in succinctly portraying the structure of three-dimensional turbulent flow. Motivated by both the extensive history and success of illustration and photographic flow visualization techniques, we have developed a new interactive volume rendering and visualization system for flows and volumes that simulates and enhances traditional illustration, experimental advection, and photographic flow visualization techniques. Our system uses a combination of varying focal and contextual illustrativ...|$|E
