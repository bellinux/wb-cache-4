6000|$|... "No, I can {{understand}} that once beyond the wall you might in such a storm make <b>your</b> <b>way</b> unnoticed <b>up</b> to the fortress; but I understood that not only were there guards {{on the walls and}} down near the great moat, but that there were also sentries in all the streets leading to the walls, and that none were allowed to pass along those leading to the walls facing the citadel. Tell me how you managed it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, lads," [...] Malcolm said, [...] "two of {{you make}} <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> that ladder and rip {{up some of}} the planks of the flooring. See if there are any windows or loopholes in the chamber above, and if so stuff your jerkins into them; we will close up those here. In a few minutes we will have a roaring fire; but we must beware lest a gleam of light be visible without, for this belfry can be seen for miles round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pierre and Andre, you will, on {{the evening}} after you arrive, enter Nantes, {{following}} the river bank. You will go along to a spot where a church faces the river. Sit down on its steps and wait for us, until the clock strikes ten. If we are not there, return and come back the next evening. If we are still not there, you will know that some bad luck has befallen us; and the band will then disperse, and you will all find <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> home.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is very foolish," [...] she said. [...] "In {{the first}} place, if my opinion {{of you is}} worth anything, I tell you frankly that I would rather see you with ink-stained fingers and worn clothes, {{climbing}} <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> toward the truth, working and thinking in an atmosphere which was not befouled with all the small and petty things of life. It {{seems to me that}} since it amused you to play the young man of fashion, you have lost your touch--some portion of it, at any rate--upon the greater things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My uncle," [...] she said, [...] "you tell us {{that you}} cannot come on, and {{it is certain that}} we cannot spare the time and men to send you back. Therefore, it seems that you must stop where you are until we return, and if we should not return, make the best of <b>your</b> own <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the shaft. Farewell, my uncle, this place is safe and comfortable, and if you are wise you will rest awhile." ...|$|R
5000|$|A lot of {{what she}} {{achieved}} influenced her to convince others to run after their dream, so she went to children's hospitals and encouraged {{some of the children}} to never give up. She said: [...] "No matter what is in <b>your</b> <b>way</b> never give <b>up</b> and chase after your dream, with no interference of discouragement." ...|$|R

But he's only a grocer, you know"--the girl met her friend's intent eyes--"so that I'm afraid that, with the set you've got into, you won't see <b>your</b> <b>way</b> to keep <b>up</b> our friendship." ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH, very sternly at first, with {{a rising}} hysterical inflection: [...] "Nothing, Allen! Do {{you call it}} NOTHING, to have Mrs. Dawes come out with all that about your {{accident}} on <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the river, and ask me if it didn't frighten me terribly to hear of it, even after it was all over; and I had to say you hadn't told me a word of it? 'Why, Lucy!'"--angrily mimicking Mrs. Dawes, [...] "'you must teach him better than that. I make Mr. Dawes tell me everything.' Little simpleton! And then to have them all laugh--Oh, dear, it's too much!" ...|$|E
60|$|The bedroom had one big {{bed and a}} cot in it; but I {{could not}} see where the girl was going to sleep. The {{architect}} had overlooked her altogether: that is so like an architect. The house also suffered from the inconvenience common to residences of its class, of possessing no stairs, so that {{to move from one}} room to another it was necessary to burst <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> through the ceiling, or else to come outside and climb in through a window; either of which methods must be fatiguing when you come to do it often.|$|E
6000|$|... "Turn myself against you! I {{would turn}} myself any {{way so that}} I might save you from the sort of life which you are {{preparing}} for yourself. I see nothing in it that can satisfy any manly heart. Even if you are successful, what are you to become? You will be the creature of some minister, not his colleague. You are to make <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the ladder by pretending to agree whenever agreement is demanded from you, and by voting {{whether you agree or}} do not. And what is to be your reward? Some few precarious hundreds a year, lasting just so long as a party may remain in power and you can retain a seat in Parliament! It is at the best slavery and degradation,--even if you are lucky enough to achieve the slavery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{heard there}} is {{something}} of the sort up yonder," [...] said he; [...] "but it's not a thing as I would advise you to meddle with. There's enough trouble with the folk of this world, Boy Jim, without going out of <b>your</b> <b>way</b> to mix <b>up</b> with those of another. As to young Master Rodney Stone, if his good mother saw that white face of his, she'd never let him come to the smithy more. Walk slowly on, and I'll see you back to Friar's Oak." ...|$|R
500|$|While {{the verses}} are {{dedicated}} to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady / Put <b>your</b> hand <b>way</b> <b>up</b> high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". As Carey sings the second chorus, she reverts to the singular conversation with her deceased father, however now revisiting 2005, [...] "And you {{never got a chance}} to see how good I've done / And you never got to see me back at No. 1", referencing her return to the top of music with The Emancipation of Mimi. The song does not feature a bridge, instead repeating the chorus twice, once in the same key as the rest of the song, while the other in a raised octave. During the last chorus, Carey's voice is doubled, with her regular tone voice singing softly over the piano chords, while her more prominent and higher pitched vocals are laid over it.|$|R

According to Thrower, the [...] "distils everything that we’re about." [...] With [...] "Boomerang", the group wanted to, according to Duce, [...] "do a pop track and see what comes out." [...] Discussing [...] "Work for It", Duce explained that you [...] "either have a choice to sit on your arse and hope things come <b>your</b> <b>way</b> or get <b>up,</b> get to work and put in the effort and perseverance." [...] The song was initially inspired by Duce's brother and sister receiving their GCSE results, [...] "but it morphed into a song about me sorting my life out and focusing on my career in music." [...] Duce wrote [...] "Could Be Worse" [...] for himself [...] "because things could always be worse." ...|$|R
60|$|Good {{as far as}} it went, but it did not go far enough. It was {{not real}} excitement. Something rather more dashing seemed to him to be indicated. He {{hammered}} {{for a moment or two}} on the floor of his cage, ate a mouthful of the newspaper there, and stood with his head on one side, chewing thoughtfully. It didn't taste as good as usual. He suspected Nelly of having changed his Daily Mail for the Daily Express or something. He swallowed the piece of paper, and was struck by the thought that a little climbing exercise might be what his soul demanded. (You hang on by your beak and claws and work <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> to the roof. It sounds tame, but it's something to do.) He tried it. And, as he gripped the door of the cage it swung open. Bill the parrot now perceived that this was going to be one of those days. He had not had a bit of luck like this for months.|$|E
60|$|WE WILL go {{and make}} a morning call. The garish light of day, that never suits a chamber, was broken by a muslin veil, which sent its {{softened}} twilight through a room of moderate dimensions but of princely decoration, and which opened into a conservatory. The choice saloon was hung with rose-coloured silk, which diffused a delicate tint over the inlaid and costly cabinets. It was crowded with tables covered with bijouterie. Apparently, however, a road had been cut through the furniture, by which you might wind <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> to the divinity of the temple. A ravishing perfume, which was ever changing, wandered through the apartment. Now a violet breeze made you poetical; now a rosy gale called you to love. And ever and anon the strange but thrilling breath of some rare exotic summoned you, like an angel, to opening Eden. All was still and sweet, save that a fountain made you, as it were, more conscious of silence; save that the song of birds made you, as it were, more sensible of sweetness.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{perfectly}} right!" [...] he snorted. [...] "I do! I want {{to stand}} {{so far away from}} it that I can't see the thing with a telescope!" [...] He turned on Corky like an untamed tiger of the jungle who has just located a chunk of meat. [...] "And this--this--is what you have been wasting your time and my money for all these years! A painter! I wouldn't let you paint a house of mine! I gave you this commission, thinking that you were a competent worker, and this--this--this extract from a comic coloured supplement is the result!" [...] He swung towards the door, lashing his tail and growling to himself. [...] "This ends it! If you wish to continue this foolery of pretending to be an artist because you want an excuse for idleness, please yourself. But let me tell you this. Unless you report at my office on Monday morning, prepared to abandon all this idiocy and start in {{at the bottom of the}} business to work <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>up,</b> as you should have done half a dozen years ago, not another cent--not another cent--not another--Boosh!" ...|$|E

60|$|Who {{does not}} know the outside hall of the {{magnificent}} gambling-house at Monte Carlo, with all the golden splendor of its music-room within? Who {{does not know}} the lofty roof and lounging seats, with its luxuries of liveried servants, its wealth of newspapers, and every appanage of costly comfort which {{can be added to}} it? And its music within,--who does not know that there are to be heard sounds in a greater perfection of orchestral melody than are to be procured by money and trouble combined in the great capitals of Europe? Think of the trouble endured by those unhappy fathers of families who indulge their wives and daughters at the Philharmonic and St. James's Hall! Think of the horrors of our theatres, with their hot gas, and narrow passages, and difficulties of entrance, and almost impossibility of escape! And for all this money has to be paid,--high prices,--and the day has to be fixed long beforehand, so that the tickets may be secured, and the daily feast,--papa's too often solitary enjoyment,--has to be turned into a painful early fast. And when at last the thing has been done, and the torment endured, the sounds heard have not always been good of their kind, for the money has not sufficed to purchase the aid of a crowd of the best musicians. But at Monte Carlo you walk in with your wife in her morning costume, and seating yourself luxuriously in one of those soft stalls which are there prepared for you, you give yourself up with perfect ease to absolute enjoyment. For two hours the concert lasts, and all around is perfection and gilding. There is nothing to annoy the most fastidious taste. You have not heated yourself with fighting <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> crowded stairs; no box-keeper has asked you for a shilling. No link-boy has dunned you because he stood useless for a moment at the door of your carriage. No panic has seized you, and still oppresses you, because of the narrow dimensions in which you have to seat yourself for the next three hours. There are no twenty minutes during which you are doomed to sit in miserable expectation. Exactly at the hour named the music begins, and for two hours it is your own fault if you be not happy. A railway-carriage has brought you to steps leading up to the garden in which these princely halls are built, and when the music is over will again take you home. Nothing can be more perfect than the concert-room at Monte Carlo, and nothing more charming; and for all this there is nothing whatever to pay.|$|E
