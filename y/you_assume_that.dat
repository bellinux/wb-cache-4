6000|$|MY DEAR SIR--You {{remember}} my {{speaking to you}} of what I called your over-cautiousness.

But, then, <b>you</b> <b>assumed</b> too much when <b>you</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> I had such a letter. I have obliged you to the fullest extent in my power.

50|$|So that defecting {{is a huge}} reward, the superrational {{strategy}} maximizes {{the expected}} payoff to <b>you</b> <b>assuming</b> <b>that</b> the other player reasons the same way.

But the other machine did; the machine <b>that</b> worked it. <b>You</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the man in rags jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy, because he was Lord Falconroy's murderer. He jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy because he is Lord Falconroy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! Just {{like you}} young fellows. In {{some things you}} have no more brains than geese. Being made of {{cast-iron}} and shoe-leather <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> everybody else is, or ought to be, made of the same raw material. Don't you know that surprises of this sort are apt to kill delicate people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{style of}} {{reasoning}} is rather wild, {{to say the}} least of it," [...] answered Ned, as he rubbed down his colours on the bottom of a broken plate. [...] "In the first place, <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> I propose to spend all my life in rambling; and, in the second place, you found your argument on the absurd supposition that everybody else must find their sole enjoyment in the same occupation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what heat!" [...] complained Binet, [...] "and all for what? Why must <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> I {{have the}} soul of a usurer? When our little {{arrangement}} was made, I had no idea how could I?--that you would prove as valuable to me as you are? You had but to remind me, my dear Scaramouche. I am a just man. As from to-day you shall have thirty livres a month. See, I double it at once. I am a generous man." ...|$|E

40|$|By using a {{vast number}} of {{examples}} in social and economical data including natural languages, George Zipf was able to show an amazingly robust functional form of the rank-frequency plots [1], f ~ 1 /r (f for frequency, r for rank), now commonly called Zipf’s curve or Zipf’s law. George Miller, a renowned linguist, summarized this study in 1965 : “Faced with this massive statistical regularity, you have two alternatives.

"You cannot answer Berkeley, even if {{you have}} annihilated Kant, and yet, perforce, <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> Berkeley is wrong when you affirm that science proves the non-{{existence}} of God, or, as much to the point, the existence of matter.--You know I granted the reality of matter only in order to make myself intelligible to your understanding. Be positive scientists, if you please; but ontology has no place in positive science, so leave it alone. Spencer is right in his agnosticism, but if Spencer--" ...|$|E
6000|$|The solitary {{wrong answer}} is from NELL. To be thus [...] "alone in the crowd" [...] is a distinction--a painful one, no doubt, {{but still a}} distinction. I am sorry for you, my dear young lady, and I seem to hear your tearful exclamation, when you read these lines, [...] "Ah! This is the knell of all my hopes!" [...] Why, oh why, did <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the 4th and 5th bags weighed 4 lbs. each? And why did you not test your answers?

"Your daughter, {{with her}} natural {{refinement}} and delicate habits, {{is certainly not}} fit {{to be married to}} a foul-mouthed fellow, ignorant, dirty, besotted, and out of place in any company except at the bar in a public house. That is probably your idea of a workman. But the fact of her having consented to marry me is a proof that I do not answer to any such description. As you have hinted, it will be an advantage to me in some ways to have a lady for my wife; but I should have no difficulty in purchasing that advantage, even with my present means, which I expect to increase largely in the course of some years. Do you not underrate your daughter's personal qualities when <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> it was her position that induced me to seek her hand?" ...|$|E
50|$|Offering the up sell at {{the right}} time is a crucial part of the technique. More often than not, the best time is when the {{customer}} has decided to make the purchase. This is when they are open to suggestions for product and benefits of the product. If you expose the customer to new options that they have not considered while {{in the middle of their}} decision process, it can influence the customer's behaviour around <b>you,</b> <b>assuming</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are trying to up the sale simply for your own benefit or incentive.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the concept of}} innovation and social innovation, and establishes that social innovation in cooperatives {{is reflected in the}} overall performance of its members, so that the cooperative action gets over the borders of the cooperative society and spreads in the core of the existence of deprived classes.

She doesn't like one single thing; she hates the damp cave, the rats running over her bare legs, the stiff skin garments, the eating of half-raw meat, her husband's bushy face, the constant battles, and the worship of the spirits who will hoodoo her unless she gives the priests her best claw necklace. Her man protests, 'But it can't all be wrong!' and he thinks he has reduced her to absurdity. Now <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> a world which produces a Percy Bresnahan and a Velvet Motor Company must be civilized. It is? Aren't we only about half-way along in barbarism? I suggest Mrs. Bogart as a test. And we'll continue in barbarism just as long as people as nearly intelligent as you continue to defend things as they are because they are." ...|$|E

What {{leads you to}} infer that the Consolidated Tractions Company was not organized in good faith? Do you think that business men are always infallible? The street-car lines of this city were at sixes and sevens, fighting each other; money was being wasted by poor management. The idea behind the company was a public-spirited one, to give the citizens cheaper and better service, by a more modern equipment, by a wider system of transfer. It seems to me, Mr. Hodder, that you put yourself in a more quixotic position than the so-called reformers when <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the men who organize a company in good faith are personally responsible for every share of stock that is sold, and {{for the welfare of}} every individual who may buy the stock. We force no one to buy it. They do so at their own risk. I myself have thousands of dollars of worthless stock in my safe. I have never complained." ...|$|E

Besides, I see you are laboring under a total misapprehension. It is your duty not to inflame but to calm yourself. I am {{prepared}} to show you, if you will only point out the article that you allude to, that you regard as 'charges' what no calm and logical mind has any right to regard as such. Show me the charges, and I will try, at all events; and if it becomes plain that no charges have been preferred, then plainly there can be nothing to retract, {{and no one could}} rightly urge you to demand a retraction. You should beware of making so serious a mistake, for however honest a man may be, every one is liable to misapprehend.

"I assume," [...] pursued Ezra Jennings, [...] "that the {{influence}} of the opium--after impelling you to possess yourself of the Diamond, with the purpose of securing its safety--might also impel you, acting under the same influence and the same motive, to hide it somewhere in your own room. <b>YOU</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the Hindoo conspirators could by no possibility commit a mistake. The Indians went to Mr. Luker's house after the Diamond--and, therefore, in Mr. Luker's possession the Diamond must be! Have you any evidence to prove that the Moonstone was taken to London at all? You can't even guess how, or by whom, it was removed from Lady Verinder's house! Have you any evidence that the jewel was pledged to Mr. Luker? He declares that he never heard of the Moonstone; and his bankers' receipt acknowledges nothing but the deposit of a valuable of great price. The Indians assume that Mr. Luker is lying--and you assume again that the Indians are right. All I say, in differing with you, is--that my view is possible. What more, Mr. Blake, either logically, or legally, can be said for yours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|While I am fault-finding, {{let me do}} {{a little}} more, and take [...] another scrap of paper for the purpose. (I took only a scrap [...] before, as I was determined, then, not to “afflict you above [...] measure.”) I note, then, two things about you. Outstripping others [...] in the race, you reach the goal or {{conclusion}} before them; and, [...] being there, <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> they are there also. This is [...] unpopular. You are unpopular this very day with a poor wretch, [...] whom you have apprised that he has lost his seat, and you have not [...] told him how. Again, and lastly, I think you do not get up all [...] things, but allow yourself a choice, as if politics were a [...] flower-garden and we might choose among the beds; as Lord [...] Palmerston did, who read foreign office and war papers, and let [...] the others rust and rot. This, I think, is partially true, I do [...] not say of your reading, but of your mental processes.

6000|$|And yet I am {{told that}} this {{doctrine}} must not be resisted or called in question, because of its fitness to preserve unity of faith, and {{for the prevention of}} schism and sectarian byways! Let the man who holds this language trace the history of Protestantism, and the growth of sectarian divisions, ending with Dr. Hawker's ultra- Calvinistic Tracts, and Mr. Belsham's New Version of the Testament. And then let him tell me that for the prevention of an evil which already exists, and which the boasted preventive itself might rather seem to have occasioned, I must submit to be silenced by the first learned infidel, who throws in my face the blessing of Deborah, or the cursings of David, or the Grecisms and heavier difficulties in the biographical chapters of the Book of Daniel, or the hydrography and natural philosophy of the Patriarchal ages. I must forego the means of silencing, and the prospect of convincing, an alienated brother, because I must not thus answer [...] "My Brother! What has all this to do with the truth and the worth of Christianity? If you reject a priori all communion with the Holy Spirit, there is indeed a chasm between us, over which we cannot even make our voices intelligible to each other. But if--though but with the faith of a Seneca or an Antonine--you admit the co-operation of a Divine Spirit in souls desirous of good, even as the breath of heaven works variously in each several plant according to its kind, character, period of growth, and circumstance of soil, clime, and aspect; on what ground can <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> its presence is incompatible with all imperfection in the subject--even with such imperfection as is the natural accompaniment of the unripe season? If you call your gardener or husbandman to account for the plants or crops he is raising, would you not regard the special purpose in each, and judge of each by that which it was tending to? Thorns are not flowers, nor is the husk serviceable. But it was not for its thorns, but for its sweet and medicinal flowers that the rose was cultivated; and he who cannot separate the husk from the grain, wants the power because sloth or malice has prevented the will. I demand for the Bible only the justice which you grant to other books of grave authority, and to other proved and acknowledged benefactors of mankind. Will you deny a spirit of wisdom in Lord Bacon, because in particular facts he did not possess perfect science, or an entire immunity from the positive errors which result from imperfect insight? A Davy will not so judge his great predecessor; for he recognises the spirit that is now working in himself, and which under similar defects of light and obstacles of error had been his guide and guardian in the morning twilight of his own genius. Must not the kindly warmth awaken and vivify the seed, in order that the stem may spring up and rejoice in the light? As the genial warmth to the informing light, even so is the predisposing Spirit to the revealing Word." ...|$|E

25|$|BLITZER: So, {{when you}} told Robert Novak that Joe Wilson, the former U.S. ambassador's wife, worked at the CIA, and she was {{involved}} somehow in getting him this trip to Africa {{to look for the}} enriched uranium, if there were enriched uranium going to Iraq, <b>you</b> simply <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> she was not a clandestine officer of the CIA.|$|R
50|$|When he left AR, Villchur {{went back}} to working as a researcher. He chose the field of hearing aids, since he {{felt that there was}} {{considerable}} room for improvement in these devices.

But when you see a person with a hearing aid, <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the person still has hearing difficulties.

5000|$|Scott Mendelson from Forbes {{was more}} {{critical}} of the film, saying there was [...] "nothing objectively wrong with The Peanuts Movie", but as he personally was {{not a fan of}} the Peanuts comic strip, that made him [...] "anti-Charlie Brown", loathing each time Charlie Brown failed in the film. Joe McGovern from Entertainment Weekly was also not as receptive, giving the film a grade of C+, and criticizing the animation, stating, [...] "Even if <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> Schulz always wanted his frozen pond reflecting lustrous light and Snoopy frolicking in a lavish Hayao Miyazaki world, the animation steroids injected into the aesthetic here nonetheless shrivel the great melancholy that's so key to the comic's endurance".|$|E

In your own dress we might for a short time walk the street without observation; but if you sallied out in that blouse with your white hands and your head thrown back, and a look of disdain and disgust on your face, the first gamin who met you would cry out, 'There is an aristocrat in disguise!' ...|$|R
