60|$|LORETTA. [Not exactly {{enthusiastic}} in her reception, going {{slowly to}} meet him.] <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> you were coming.|$|E
6000|$|... “What?” screamed Bertie, {{jumping up}} from his sea, “a brown horse! Miserable woman, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word about it’s being a brown horse.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He did! I had no {{idea you}} were hurt. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word. And you carried me and my {{instrument}} all day--with a broken hand!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Guardy, {{you were}} my dear Philip's father, weren't <b>you?</b> I've <b>never</b> <b>said</b> anything; but of course you were. He was so like you, and so is Jock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Such {{a lovely}} animal <b>you</b> <b>never</b> saw,' <b>said</b> Lance, {{swinging}} himself downstairs. 'You must walk {{out and see}} it, Fee, for you'll have it in the Pursuivant some Saturday.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Sure, {{just what}} I’m goin’ to start.” O’Brien {{abruptly}} steadied himself and looked with awe at Mucluc Charley. “How did <b>you</b> know? <b>Never</b> <b>said</b> so. Jes’ thought I said so. You’re a min’ reader, Charley. Le’s have another.” ...|$|R
60|$|Thers. You say! why <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> {{any thing}} in all your life. But, since you will know, it is proclaimed through the army, that Hector is to cudgel you to-morrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "The army!" [...] Harry exclaimed {{in a tone}} of {{astonished}} delight. [...] "Oh, sir, do {{you really}} think of my going into the army? <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word about that before. I should like that immensely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Corny, it is odd <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> {{a word of}} this to me! when I {{was showing}} him Lilacsbush, and talking of you and of your father, not a word did he say on the subject." ...|$|E
60|$|KNOX. [beginning to cry] I did all I {{could to}} make <b>you</b> happy. I <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a harsh word to you.|$|R
2500|$|Mr. President, I {{want to go}} back to {{something}} Senator Kerry said earlier tonight and ask a follow-up of my own. He <b>said...</b> that <b>you</b> had <b>never</b> <b>said</b> whether <b>you</b> would like to overturn Roe v. Wade. So I'd ask you directly, would you like to? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Durn lucky <b>you</b> can't. You'd <b>never</b> hole up {{your head}} again. A plummer fool <b>you</b> <b>never</b> see," [...] <b>said</b> Jennie, {{determined}} to drive his shame home to him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well! I thought, when I came back, no one {{did seem}} to guess as 'twas all along of me!' cried Tom. 'So sure I thought you hadn't known it, my Lord. And <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> nothing, my Lord!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For heaven's sake, {{what is the}} matter, Honora?" [...] he faltered. [...] "I--I {{thought we}} were happy. You were getting on all right, {{and seemed to be}} having a good time down here. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> {{anything}} about--this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, since <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> so, and Mr. Phelps {{never said}} so, {{and nobody else}} knew {{anything}} of the matter, then the thief's presence {{in the room was}} purely accidental. He saw his chance and he took it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! Lily, it {{is plain}} that <b>you</b> <b>never</b> knew Harry,' <b>said</b> Claude. 'I {{do not believe}} you ever did--that is one ting {{to be said for}} you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chettam is {{a little}} hasty, my dear," [...] said Mr. Brooke, {{coloring}} slightly; [...] "a little hasty, <b>you</b> know. I <b>never</b> <b>said</b> I should do anything of the kind. I <b>never</b> <b>said</b> I should not do it, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{wished to}} blurt out his indignation but she {{regarded}} {{him with an}} expectant air which checked him. His visible discomfort made her uneasy. He could only repeat [...] "Oh yes. You are perfectly honest. You might have, but I dare say you are right. At any rate <b>you</b> have <b>never</b> <b>said</b> anything to me which you didn't mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense about that! If <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> {{anything}} {{worse than}} that Philip was a meddling coxcomb, you haven't much to repent of; and I am sure I was ten old fools when I let him bore me into writing that letter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> {{a word to}} me,' replied Elfride, not reproachfully {{either in}} tone or thought. Indeed, her feeling was the very reverse of reproachful. She felt {{relieved}} and even thankful. Where confidence had not been given, how could confidence be expected? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Silas," [...] {{said his}} wife, making a wife's free {{version of her}} husband's words, and {{replying}} to their spirit rather than their letter, [...] "I hope <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word to Mr. Corey {{to let him know}} the way you feel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you are doing out there, {{although}} <b>you</b> have <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word to me about it," [...] she continued, with an odd little note of passion in her tone. [...] "Don't let her persuade you to stop. Let them cut and burn and hew till there isn't room for a mouse to hide. You promise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She pleases all <b>you</b> wish. <b>Never</b> mind,' <b>said</b> Arthur, fairly {{putting her}} out, then {{stepping}} back, 'Lie still, and mind your big baby; {{that is all}} you have to do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Four weeks more, Mrs Hardy, and we'll {{give you}} {{a cup of tea}} such as <b>you</b> <b>never</b> had before,' <b>said</b> second mate Hoffmann, as he paused beside two ladies sitting in a {{sheltered}} corner of the deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "How did it happen?" [...] she continued. [...] "He didn't rescue {{you over}} a cliff, or {{that sort of}} thing, did he? Do say that he did! And <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word about it, Mr. Corliss. Do tell me. I'm just dying to know!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I s'pose <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> {{your prayers}} {{until we got}} {{you to go to}} church," [...] said Felicity--who had had no hand in {{inducing}} Peter to go to church, but had stoutly opposed it, as recorded in the first volume of our family history.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop--stop, Catharine, for mercy's sake! <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> so {{much that}} was good {{concerning}} me, save to introduce some bitter censure, of which your praises were the harbingers. I am honest, and so forth, you would say, but a hot brained brawler, and common sworder or stabber." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm sure <b>you</b> <b>never</b> could," [...] <b>said</b> Tessa, earnestly. [...] "You {{thought he}} might be Nofri," [...] she added, with a triumphant air of conclusiveness. [...] "But <b>never</b> mind; <b>you</b> couldn't know. What is your name?" ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. I {{was very}} {{innocent}} in those days. I thought that when two people loved one another they married. I wasn't a Eurasian then, George. I was {{like any other}} English girl. If you'd married me I shouldn't be what I am now. But they took you away from me. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> even <b>said</b> good-bye to me. You wrote and told me you'd been transferred to Canton.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did <b>you</b> <b>never</b> hear," [...] <b>said</b> Agatha, [...] "that {{there was}} one of the {{brothers}} who was a bad lot, and ran away. My sister says Wilfred is like him. I believe," [...] she added, [...] "that he was her romance!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{first saw}} you," [...] he began, [...] "I {{thought you were}} like a {{creature}} who'd lived all its life among pearls and old bones. Your hands were wet, d'you remember, and <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word until I gave you a bit of bread, and then you said, 'Human Beings!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{surprise}} of the others at finding that Mr. Armstrong knew Ronald was very great. [...] "I wonder you didn't mention it before," [...] Jacob Carey said, giving voice to the common feeling. [...] "We have talked about him so often, and <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word {{to let us know}} you had met him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bertram {{smoothed}} her cheek gently. She tried to prevent him, {{but he went}} on in spite of her, with a man's strong persistence. Notwithstanding his gentleness he was always virile. [...] "Good-bye!" [...] he cried. [...] "Good-bye! why on earth good-bye, Frida? When I left you before dinner <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> one word of it to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't make a lark of me, hang it, Poyntz," [...] said Foker, turning red, {{and with}} tears almost in his eyes, [...] "you know what I mean: it's those what's-his-names--in Homer, <b>you</b> know. I <b>never</b> <b>said</b> I {{was a good}} scholar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a lie. You {{came to see}} my Nunaga, and {{you hope}} to get her; but <b>you</b> <b>never</b> will!" [...] <b>said</b> Okiok. He said it only to himself, however, being far too polite to say it to his guest, to whom he replied deferentially-- ...|$|R
