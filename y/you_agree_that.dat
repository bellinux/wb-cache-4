500|$|The {{following}} morning Kennedy and Edelman met with Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, and angrily criticized the food stamp program for charging families {{that had no}} income. Freeman deflected, [...] "Bob, there isn't anyone in America who has no income." [...] Kennedy replied, [...] "I'll tell you what. I'll send Peter [...] here back down there with some of your people... Will <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> you'll change the regulations if your people are convinced there really are people in Mississippi who have no income?" [...] Freeman agreed, and was eventually persuaded by incoming evidence to open up access to food stamps.|$|E
500|$|The Grand Council of the Crees in Northern Quebec was {{particularly}} vocal and prominent in its {{resistance to the}} idea of being included in an independent Quebec. Grand Chief Matthew Coon Come issued a legal paper, titled Sovereign Injustice, which sought to affirm the Cree right to self-determination in keeping their territories in Canada. On October 24, 1995, the Cree organized their own referendum, asking the question: [...] "Do you consent, as a people, that the Government of Quebec separate the James Bay Crees and Cree traditional territory from Canada {{in the event of a}} Yes vote in the Quebec referendum?" [...] 96.3% of the 77% of Crees who cast ballots voted to stay in Canada. The Inuit of Nunavik held a similar local vote, asking, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> Quebec should become sovereign?", with 96% voting No.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{where could}} it be, Harry? <b>You</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> {{there was not}} {{sufficient}} depth between the floors for any place of concealment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> {{we cannot}} surrender?" [...] and Mark asked the {{question}} in an angry tone, as if expecting she would refuse to view {{the situation in the}} same light he did.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> {{your biggest}} fish should be mine if I caught more fish than you did. I've caught {{four times as}} many, so the {{pickerel}} is mine," [...] retorted Reddy, winking at Little Joe Otter.|$|R
500|$|MK Dons {{initially}} {{maintained that}} any debate was pointless as their club {{was simply a}} renamed Wimbledon F.C.. Winkelman was unequivocal when answering readers' questions in FourFourTwo magazine in November 2004: [...] "MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon share the same heritage, but we're the real child of Wimbledon", he wrote. One reader asked: [...] "Now that you have renamed the team, and changed the badge and colours, do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> AFC Wimbledon now carry the true spirit of Wimbledon?"; Winkelman replied that AFC Wimbledon's founders had betrayed their club and [...] "left their team before their team left them". In another answer, he poured scorn on suggestions that he might give Wimbledon F.C.'s trophy replicas to AFC Wimbledon, writing that the fans had [...] "abdicated their right to it when they all walked away." [...] "The fans who have continued to support us from London—they're the ones who've {{had to put up}} with this shit for so long," [...] he concluded.|$|E

2500|$|Senator Edwards, as we wrap up {{the foreign}} policy part of this, I do {{want to talk to}} you about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Today, a senior member of Islamic Jihad was killed in Gaza. There have been suicide bombings, {{targeted}} assassinations, mortar attacks, all of this continuing at a time when the United States seems absent in the peace-making process. What would your administration do? First of all, do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the United States is absent? Maybe you don't. But what would your administration do to try to resolve that conflict? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "you {{will tell}} other people this {{and go to}} see Corporal Curtis? <b>You</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> women have some power here, and, even if you're not convinced, you will do what I ask because I wish it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Under these circumstances, I have no {{hesitation}} in re-employing both {{him and his}} wife; and I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> I could not do less. I think <b>you</b> will <b>agree,</b> also, <b>that</b> in the whole transaction I have done nothing of which the parent of any boy intrusted to me {{has a right to}} complain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It’s {{not fair}} of you,” was her greeting. “You are usurping {{one of my}} prerogatives. You know <b>you</b> I <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the cooking should be mine, and—” ...|$|R
2500|$|The Edinburgh Agreement {{stated that}} {{the wording of the}} {{question}} would be decided by the Scottish Parliament and reviewed for intelligibility by the Electoral Commission. The Scottish government stated that its preferred question was [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> Scotland should be an independent country?" [...] The Electoral Commission tested the proposed question along with three other possible versions. Their research found that the [...] "Do you agree" [...] preface made it a leading question, which {{would be more likely to}} garner a positive response. The question was amended to [...] "Should Scotland be an independent country?", which the Electoral Commission found was the most neutral and concise of the versions tested.|$|E
60|$|SIR OLIVER. Hey! {{what the}} plague! {{you seem to}} differ strangely in your accounts--however <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> Sir Peter is dangerously wounded.|$|E
60|$|MRS. H. Then <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Hornblower {{at least}} should be told. What {{he does with}} the {{knowledge}} is not our affair.|$|E
6000|$|... “Of {{course we}} must accept your {{assurance}} that you didn’t turn Mrs. Hampton into a wolf,” said Clovis politely, “but <b>you</b> will <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> appearances are against you.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I see any use in it, I can talk," [...] {{retorted}} Flett. [...] "What's your notion, Mr. Lansing? <b>You</b> don't <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> {{the fellow}} shot your beast from here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you promise}} not to let his thoughtlessness {{distress}} you, my love, I {{promise not to}} speak to him about it. Do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> to <b>that</b> bargain? If you do, give me a kiss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DO you agree, Mr. Sisson?" [...] {{said the}} Marchesa. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the mock-innocence and the sham-wistfulness of Botticelli's Venus are her great charms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As for {{the first}} point, here are Mr. Pound's words in answer to the question, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the great poet is never emotional?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{if you are}} {{prepared}} to admit {{that there was no}} libel in all that the newspaper said. If <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> it was all true, then you will have to pay the costs on both sides, and the indictment can be quashed. It will be a serious admission to make, but perhaps that won't signify, seeing what your position as to character will be." ...|$|E
60|$|LUBIN. I am glad <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> with me <b>that</b> Socialism and Votes for Women {{are signs}} of decay.|$|R
60|$|I hope <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> to <b>that</b> reasoning; for by it I {{think we}} arrive most surely at {{a belief in}} the unity of the human race, and that the Negro is {{actually}} a man and a brother.|$|R
6000|$|Haskins {{was like}} a man struck {{on the head with}} a sandbag; he couldn't think; he stammered as he tried to say: [...] "But I never'd git the use You'd rob me!

6000|$|... “It {{would be}} much more to the point to have them all under lock and key. England must be brought into line. The {{imbecile}} bourgeoisie of this country make themselves the accomplices of the very people whose aim is to drive them out of their houses to starve in ditches. And they have the political power still, if they only had the sense to use it for their preservation. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the middle classes are stupid?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> {{if either}} of you lives again, he or she shall make some sign to let the other know?" [...] I suggested. [...] "Well, that has been tried so often, and has it ever worked? It's open to the {{question}} whether the dead do not fail to show up because they are forbidden {{to communicate with the}} living; and you are just where you were, as to the main point. No, I don't see any way out of it." ...|$|E

6000|$|Lawford {{took out}} his watch, 'You are really very kind,' he said. 'But, perhaps--well, {{whatever}} that history may be, I think <b>you</b> would <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> mine is even--but, there, I've talked too much about myself already. Perhaps to-morrow?' ...|$|R

60|$|But <b>you</b> will <b>agree</b> <b>that,</b> if Master Analysis {{took that}} shell to pieces, Master Synthesis {{would not be}} likely to put it {{together}} again; much less {{to put it together}} in the right way, in which Madam How made it.|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> {{will all}} <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> God gives the first; that {{he gives the}} soil, the timber, the fisheries, the coal, the iron.|$|R
50|$|If you {{consider}} that depreciation is an allocation of the original cost of the asset, then <b>you</b> must <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> time value of money considerations make the original cost HIGHER {{than the sum of}} the subsequent ROC expenses not realized until many years in the future.|$|R
