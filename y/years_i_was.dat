5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
500|$|The mummies of Stroma were {{something}} of a tourist attraction in the 18th century; the Welsh naturalist and traveller Thomas Pennant described the mummies as [...] "entire and uncorrupted bodies of persons who had been dead sixty <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> informed {{that they were very}} light, had a flexibility in their limbs and were of a dusky color." [...] However, their popularity proved their undoing. In 1762 Bishop of Ross and Caithness Robert Forbes recorded in his journal that Murdoch Kennedy ...|$|E
500|$|Her work at {{art school}} began to suffer, and {{teachers}} {{told her the}} relationship with Lennon was doing her no good. Lennon continued to be casually inconsiderate towards her, later saying, [...] "I was in sort of a blind rage for two <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> either drunk or fighting. It had been the same with other girl friends I'd had. There was something the matter with me." [...] Tony Bramwell—a friend of Lennon's since his youth—later said: [...] "Cynthia was beautiful, physically, and on the inside. Although she knew he [...] was apt to find love on the road, she was totally dedicated to his success... and extremely influential. He was insecure and Cynthia was there to pump him up, to buttress, sort of, his weak side." ...|$|E

500|$|American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile, {{the second}} {{spin-off}} to the American Pie film series, was a commercial success, and Universal Pictures {{prepared for a}} sequel. The Naked Miles writer, Erik Lindsay, pitched the film by saying: [...] "Look, we're not going to top Animal House of course, but it's been 25 <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in a fraternity for six years. Let's just make a straight pledging movie." [...] Universal gave Lindsay {{the green light to}} write Beta House, and also hired Andrew Waller and The Naked Miles producer, W. K. Border, as the film's director and producer, respectively. The film's screenplay was based on characters by Adam Herz and on aspects of Lindsay's own life. Lindsay felt that Universal being unworried about making the film similar to Animal House provided [...] "more opportunities to keep the story organic," [...] which he found the challenge of writing a sequel.|$|E
500|$|McCormack {{enrolled}} at Ryerson University School of Theatre in Toronto to further improve his acting. He left Ryerson in 1985, {{several months before}} graduating, [...] to accept a position with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, where he spent five seasons performing. [...] "It was all I wanted, to be a classical actor {{for the rest of}} my life, but during the last couple of <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there, I started to realise that it wasn't for me. Perhaps I didn't have to give my Hamlet before I died, that the world might be an OK place without my Hamlet, in fact." [...] McCormack appeared in the productions A Midsummer Night's Dream, Henry V, Murder in the Cathedral and Three Sisters. McCormack later performed with the Manitoba Theatre Centre in a production of Burn This, as well as with Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre in Biloxi Blues.|$|E
500|$|She later {{described}} {{this period of}} her life to Essence saying [...] "People {{need to understand that}} the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at that time… I had to step away when I realized that {{for the sake of the}} machine, I was being way too compromised. I felt uncomfortable about having to smile in someone's face when I really didn't like them or even know them well enough to like them." [...] She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, [...] "For two or three <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> away from all social interaction. It was a very introspective time because I had to confront my fears and master every demonic thought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, young and gifted in this western culture." [...] She went on to say that she had to fight to retain her identity, and was forced [...] "to deal with folks who weren't happy about that." ...|$|E

500|$|McGovern {{had made}} several real estate {{investments}} in the D.C.area and became interested in hotel operations. In 1988, using the money he had earned from his speeches, the McGoverns bought, renovated, and began running a 150-room inn in Stratford, Connecticut, {{with the goal of}} providing a hotel, restaurant and public conference facility. It went into bankruptcy in 1990 and closed the following year. In 1992, McGovern's published reflections on the experience appeared in Wall Street Journal and the Nation's Restaurant News. He attributed part of the failure to the early 1990s recession, but also part to the cost of dealing with federal, state and local regulations that were passed with good intentions but made life difficult for small businesses, and to the cost of dealing with frivolous lawsuits. McGovern wrote, [...] "I... wish that during the <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in public office I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have made me a better U.S.senator and a more understanding presidential contender." [...] His statement would still be resonating with American conservatives two decades later.|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{according}} to Greenwald, [...] "I decided voluntarily {{to wind down}} my practice in 2005 because I could, and because, after ten <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> bored with litigating full-time and wanted {{to do other things}} which I thought were more engaging and could make more of an impact, including political writing." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{writing in}} 2015 {{in his final}} column for Top Gear magazine, he {{credited}} the Shropshire Star as his first outlet as a motoring columnist: [...] "I started small, on the Shropshire Star with little Peugeots and Fiats and worked my way up to Ford Granadas and Rovers until, after about seven <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> allowed to drive an Aston Martin Lagonda...

2500|$|Although a United States {{resident}} since 1994, Sharapova still prefers Russian citizenship. The {{reason she}} prefers to keep Russian citizenship is because [...] "it {{is about the}} family environment, {{it is about the}} rich culture.

And not necessarily simply the country, but the people, the mentality and the toughness and that never giving up attitude".|$|E

2500|$|Bliss {{began the}} 1930s with Pastoral (1930). In {{the same year}} he wrote Morning Heroes, a work for narrator, chorus and orchestra, written {{in the hope of}} exorcising the spectre of the First World War: [...] "Although the war had been over for more than ten <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still troubled by {{frequent}} nightmares; they all took the same form. I was still there in the trenches with a few men; we knew the armistice had been signed, but we had been forgotten; so had a section of the Germans opposite. It was as though we were both doomed to fight on till extinction. I used to wake with horror." ...|$|E

Whilst on board the Beagle I was quite orthodox, & I {{remember}} being heartily laughed at by several of the officers (though themselves orthodox) for quoting the Bible as an unanswerable authority on some point of morality. I suppose it was the novelty of the argument that amused them. But I had gradually come, by this time, {{to see that the}} Old Testament from its manifestly false history of the world, with the Tower of Babel, rainbow as a sign, etc., etc., and from its attributing to God the feelings of a revengeful tyrant, was no more to be trusted than the sacred books of the Hindoos, or the beliefs of any barbarian." ...|$|E

2500|$|I had {{the honor}} to be Archbishop Elko's {{assistant}} for 3 years. He was a true son of Mary and loved our Lord and lived the life. In the last 2 <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> with him, we created a mission project entitled: [...] "ROSARIES AROUND THE WORLD". We shipped to over 40 countries {{and a total of}} over 1,000,000 Rosaries and Scapulars. They went from St. Mother Teresa to Fr. Malachy Brogan, OFM. He wrote me once saying: [...] "Jim, the Rosaries you sent are now found {{in the hands of the}} praying, the dying and the dead." [...] This was funded in total by the good Archbishop's brother and blessed by Archbishop Elko and St. Pope John Paul II.|$|E
2500|$|After nearly {{drinking}} {{himself to}} death during the shooting of The Klansman (1974), Burton was dried out at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Burton was allegedly inebriated while making the movie, {{and many of his}} scenes had to be filmed with him sitting or lying down due to his inability to stand upright. In some scenes, he appears to slur his words or speak incoherently. According to his own diaries, he used Antabuse to try to stop his excessive consumption of alcohol, which he blamed for wrecking his marriage to Elizabeth Taylor. Burton himself said of the time leading up to his near loss of life, [...] "I was fairly sloshed for five <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> up there with John Barrymore and Robert Newton. The ghosts of them were looking over my shoulder." ...|$|E
2500|$|Apocalypto {{gained some}} passionate champions in the Hollywood community. Actor Robert Duvall called it [...] "maybe the best movie I've seen in 25 years". Director Quentin Tarantino said, [...] "I think it's a masterpiece. It {{was perhaps the}} best film of that year. I {{think it was the}} best artistic film of that year." [...] Martin Scorsese, writing about the film, called it [...] "a vision," [...] adding, [...] "Many {{pictures}} today don't go into troubling areas like this, the importance of violence in the perpetuation of what's known as civilization. I admire Apocalypto for its frankness, but also for the power and artistry of the filmmaking." [...] Actor Edward James Olmos said, [...] "I was totally caught off guard. It's arguably the best movie I've seen in <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> blown away." [...] In 2013, director Spike Lee put the film on his list of all-time essential films.|$|E
60|$|My {{mother died}} in July 1817, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little over eight years old, and it <b>is</b> odd that <b>I</b> can {{remember}} hardly anything about her except her death-bed, her black velvet gown, and her curiously constructed work-table.
