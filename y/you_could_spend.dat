500|$|George Martin, {{along with}} Brian Wilson, is {{generally}} credited with helping to popularise {{the idea of}} the recording studio as a musical instrument which could then be used to aid the process of composition. In MacFarlane's opinion, Sgt. Pepper most important musical innovation is its [...] "integration of recording technology into the compositional process". He credits Edgard Varèse's Poème électronique as the piece of music that made this advance feasible, by [...] "expand the definition of sound recording from archival documentation to the reification of the musical canvass"; he identifies [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] as the Sgt. Pepper track that best exemplifies this approach. Although early analogue synthesisers were available – Robert Moog was working on the second generation of the first commercially available keyboard around {{the same time as the}} Sgt. Pepper recording sessions – none were used during the album's recording, which relied solely on electric and acoustic instruments and field recordings that were available at Abbey Road Studios. The musician and producer Alan Parsons believes that with Sgt. Pepper [...] "people then started thinking that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> a year making an album and they began to consider an album as a sound composition and not just a musical composition. The idea was gradually forming of a record being a performance in its own right and not just a reproduction of a live performance." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sludgefactory {{gave the}} album 10/10 and opened its review, [...] "If you like heavy, down-and-dirty, balls out rock n’ roll then stop reading this review and go buy this album, simple as that.

60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. [After a pause.] Then you {{are going}} to allow your {{greatest}} friend, Robert Chiltern, to be ruined, rather than marry some one who really has considerable attractions left.

But there, forgive me, Arthur; I think I must be {{getting a little bit}} hardened to the position, so far at least as any hope is in my mind of rather amateurish experiments being of much help. I may seem unsympathetic in saying frankly what I feel. But amateurish or no, you are curiously erratic.

500|$|Prior to the {{dismantling}} project, there was debate by local residents {{on whether the}} wrecked stern should be removed. Some local officials believed the stern, which lay on a remote area of the beach, was not a hazard or an eyesore. Arnie Roblan, a state representative from Coos Bay, called the wreck a potential tourist attraction. For some residents, uncertainty remained surrounding Titan's removal plan, with the worry that the stern {{would be unable to}} withstand the force of the hydraulic pullers and that parts of the ship already buried in the sand would be unmovable. The president of the Coos Bay city council expressed concern that the proposed removal operation could cause ecological damage that would not occur if the ship were left on the beach. He further noted that [...] "shipwrecks on the Oregon Coast are part of our history. There are a lot of ways <b>you</b> <b>could</b> better <b>spend</b> the money here." ...|$|R

He [...] said you were a man after his own heart, and I wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have [...] heard how he praised you. It made Genevieve quite jealous, or would [...] have, {{if it had been}} any one else. But she is so happy in your [...] approval of her marriage, which is to take place before the [...] 'sindaco' to-morrow, We shall only have the civil rite; she feels [...] that it is more American, and we are all coming home to Lion's Head [...] in the spring to live and die true Americans. I wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> [...] <b>spend</b> the summer with us there, but, until Lion's Head is rebuilt, [...] we can't ask you. I don't know exactly how we shall do ourselves, [...] but Mr. Durgin is full of plans, and we leave everything to him. [...] He is here, making Genevieve laugh so that I can hardly write.

6000|$|And yet poor Bill Sykes, {{for whom}} here I would willingly {{say a word}} or two, could I, by so saying, {{mitigate}} the wrath against him, is always held as the more detestable scoundrel.

60|$|In short, Mrs. A., if {{you think}} that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> your money more like a Christian than in laying it out on a fashionable party, go forward and do it, and twenty others, whose {{supposed}} opinion you fear, will be glad of your example for a precedent. And, Mrs. B., if you do think {{it would be better for}} your children to observe early hours, and form simple habits, than to dress and dance, and give and go to juvenile balls, carry out your opinion in practice, and many an anxious mother, who is of the same opinion, will quote your example as her shield and defence.|$|E
5000|$|Bob Sacamano's father {{comes through}} {{with what was}} said to be Wizards where Kramer and Morty have just given them out to the {{remaining}} condo board members. Sid Luckman tells Morty that his [...] "Wizard" [...] overtipped him for the BLT he had. Morty identifies the item as a [...] "Willard" [...] as Jerry comments that Bob Sacamano's father ripped him off. The Willards are shown to not calculate tips properly and in some cases lack a full complement of numerals. Jerry then admits to his father that the Wizard costs $200 {{and that there was no}} deal. Sid Luckman tells Morty and Kramer that their election campaign is over as he leaves telling everyone to vote for the guy in the wheelchair. Jerry apologizes to his father that there was no sale on the Wizard. Morty quotes [...] "You should be. How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!" [...] Jerry once again reminds him that it does other things.|$|R

60|$|Be {{it known}} to you, good friend, that having wound up my {{business}} affairs, I {{am about to}} start for Flanders, and shall, in the first place, go to Ghent, having a mission from those in authority at Court here to carry out in that city. It would greatly please me if you would accompany me. The times are troubled in Flanders, as you doubtless know, and you would see much to interest you; and, moreover, as at present there is naught doing in England, save the trying and executing of malefactors, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> your time better in seeing somewhat of a foreign country than in resting quietly at St. Alwyth. I need not say that the trip will put you to no cost, and that by accepting, you will give pleasure to my wife and daughter, {{as well as to}} myself.|$|E
6000|$|I like {{pointing}} morals, and inventing {{for myself}} cheap consolations, to reconcile me to {{that state of}} life into which it has pleased Heaven to call me; and as the Light of the World disappeared round the corner, I reasoned pleasantly with myself about His Highness, and enjoyed that secret selfish satisfaction a man has, who sees he is better off than his neighbour. [...] "Michael Angelo," [...] I said, [...] "you are still (by courtesy) young: if you had five hundred thousand a year, and were a great prince, I would lay a wager that men would discover in you a magnificent courtesy of demeanour, and a majestic presence that only belongs to the sovereigns of the world. If you had such an income, you think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> it with splendour: distributing genial hospitalities, kindly alms, soothing misery, bidding humility be of good heart, rewarding desert. If you had such means of purchasing pleasure, you think, you rogue, you could relish it with gusto. But fancy being brought to {{the condition of the}} poor Light of the Universe yonder; and reconcile yourself with the idea that you are only a farthing rushlight. The cries of the poor widow fall as dead upon him as the smiles of the brightest eyes out of Georgia. He can't stir abroad but those abominable cannon begin roaring and deafening his ears. He can't see the world but over the shoulders of a row of fat pashas, and eunuchs, with their infernal ugliness. His ears can never be regaled with a word of truth, or blessed with an honest laugh. The only privilege of manhood left to him, he enjoys but for a month in the year, at this time of Ramazan, when he is forced to fast for fifteen hours; and, by consequence, has the blessing of feeling hungry." [...] Sunset during Lent appears to be his single moment of pleasure; they say the poor fellow is ravenous by that time, and as the gun fires the dish-covers are taken off, so that for five minutes a day he lives and is happy over pillau, like another mortal.|$|E

60|$|Then {{the modern}} {{splendor of the}} place began. The entire {{population}} of the three towns, Monaco, Monte Carlo, and Condamine, is not above fifteen thousand, and apparently {{the greater part of}} the inhabitants depend upon the gay industry of the Casino for their livelihood. I should say that the most of the houses in Monte Carlo were hotels, or pensions, or furnished villas, or furnished apartments, and if one could be content to live in the atmosphere of the Casino, which is not meteorologically lurid, I do not know where one could live in greater comfort. It is said that everything is rather dearer than in Nice, for instance, but such things as I wanted to buy I did not find very dear. The rates at the most expensive hotels did not seem exhorbitant when reduced to dollars, and if you went a little way from the Casino the hotels were very reasonable, so that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> {{a great deal of money}} at the tables which in America you would spend in board and lodging. I fancy that a villa could be got there very reasonably, and as the morals of all the inhabitants are scrupulously cared for by the administration of the Casino, and no one living in the principality is allowed to frequent the gaming-tables, it is probable that domestic service is good and cheap. If I may speak from our experience at our very simple little hotel, it is admirable, one waiter sufficing for ten or twelve guests, with leisure for much friendly conversation in the office, between the breakfasts served in our rooms and the excellent dinners at the small tables in the salon. If you liked, he would speak French or Italian, though he spoke English as well as any one, and he was of that excellent Piedmontese race which has been the saving salt of the whole peninsula. As for the food, it was far beyond that of our cold-storage, and it must have been cheap, since it was provided for us at the rate we paid.|$|E

[...] The songs {{will be released}} exclusively in a 7" [...] vinyl record format. According to Robinson, the reason for avoiding a digital version was to curb file sharing and also return music releases to a physical medium complete with artwork and liner notes.
