5000|$|The young company {{received}} {{a boost in}} 1920 with the award of the RAC Dewar Trophy to a Rolls-Royce 40/50 hp that successfully completed a 10,000 mile reliability trial fueled exclusively by National Benzole.Problems arose {{in the same year}} from a coal strike which restricted benzole availability, and increased demand in the ensuing years led to frequent shortages of coal shale from which the benzole was made. At the same time, some reckoned neat benzole was a little strong for the average engine and started to mix it with petrol. This led in 1922 to the replacement <b>of</b> <b>benzole</b> fuel with a [...] "fifty-fifty mixture" [...] <b>of</b> <b>benzole</b> and petroleum which addressed the supply issue and could be seen as an early example of customer responsiveness. Neat benzole continued to be marketed as an effective anti-knocking performance enhancing additive.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} men, {{including}} Samuel Henshaw, then {{the chairman of}} the Staffordshire Chemical Company, reckoned there was money to be made from these surplus-to-requirements stocks. Henshaw became the first chairman <b>of</b> the National <b>Benzole</b> Company. Although the idea <b>of</b> using <b>benzole</b> to power automobiles was not new, cars fueled on neat benzole needed altered carburetter settings which was inconvenient for owners who had previously used petrol and the effectiveness <b>of</b> neat <b>benzole</b> as a paint stripper raised concern about the possible effect on carburettor floats made of varnished cork - a common feature in US vehicles which at the time were being imported in greater numbers. There was also concern about the variable quality and specification <b>of</b> the <b>benzole.</b> It was in the need to address these concerns, especially regarding consistency of fuel quality, that Henshaw and his colleagues recognized their commercial opportunity.|$|R
50|$|Mansfield {{returned}} to England {{in the spring}} of 1853, resumed his chemical studies. He had been invited to send specimens <b>of</b> <b>benzole</b> to the Paris Exhibition of 1855, and on 17 February 1855, while he was preparing these in a room which he had hired for the purpose in St. John's Wood, a naphtha still overflowed, and Mansfield was so injured that nine days later he died in Middlesex Hospital, at age 35.|$|R
5000|$|Mansfield read widely, and {{gathered}} friends round him: with Charles Kingsley, a contemporary at Cambridge, he formed a lifelong friendship. While still at Cambridge he attended medical classes at St. George's Hospital; {{but when he}} settled in London in 1846 he concentrated on chemistry. In 1848, after completing a course at the Royal College of Chemistry, he undertook, at August Wilhelm Hofmann's request, a series of experiments leading to the extraction <b>of</b> <b>benzole</b> from coal-tar, important for the dye industry. He patented his inventions, but others reaped the profits.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, {{responding}} to the growing importance <b>of</b> <b>benzole</b> as a specialist chemical, {{it was decided to}} concentrate on this market by means of a new company named Benzole Producers Limited. At the same time the motor fuel marketing business was now fully merged with Shell-Mex and BP Ltd. Benzole (no longer part of the mixture) was dropped from the fuel's name and Mr Mercury’s black and chrome gave way to sparkling new yellow, blue and white. Following the de-merger of Shell-Mex and British Petroleum (BP) in 1976, the National brand continued to be distinctively marketed by BP for over a decade.|$|R
50|$|Effectively {{promoted}} {{and distributed}} {{into the second}} half of the twentieth century, National Benzole continued to be very popular with British motorists and the National Benzole brand remained a common sight at the roadside. However the proportion <b>of</b> <b>benzole</b> in the mixture was reduced progressively after the Second World War as the number of more lucrative specialist applications for the chemical grew with the development of the UK's chemical industry. During the late 1950s Benzole was determined to be hazardous to health: its anti-knocking properties as a fuel ingredient were no longer so important for the smooth running of engines, since various additives including, ironically, tetraethyllead were now routinely included in refined petroleum. Therefore, from the early 1960s onwards National sold only petrol.|$|R
50|$|Often {{only used}} at large {{gasworks}} sites, a <b>benzole</b> plant consisted <b>of</b> {{a series of}} vertical tanks containing petroleum oil through which the gas was bubbled. The purpose <b>of</b> a <b>benzole</b> plant was to extract benzole from the gas. The benzole dissolved into the petroleum oil was run through a steam separating plant to be sold separately.|$|R
50|$|Military {{service in}} the First World War {{introduced}} many British men to motoring for the first time: returning survivors began, where funds permitted, to purchase small motor cars or motor bikes, while others set up in business to maintain and repair the motor cars of the wealthy. Before the war motor fuel suppliers in the UK had typically included pharmacies, cycle shops or even blacksmiths, but after the war commercial roadside garages began to appear, slowly at first. Because garages were initially sparse the Automobile Association itself set up twelve strategically located filling stations, supplying fuel only to its own members and making no profit from the transactions. Initially the AA fuel stations supplied only National Benzole which was seen a particularly patriotic fuel choice because the coal shale which was the principal ingredient <b>of</b> <b>benzole</b> was domestically produced. In 1927 the AA dismantled its small chain of service stations as {{the growth of a}} commercially motivated service station network rendered them unnecessary, but by this time National Benzole was a nationally established fuel brand in the UK.|$|R

Maximum temperature has significant negative effect on <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> cassava but positive effect on <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> sorghum, rice and yam.

Although rainfall has no significant impact on rice yield, it may be true in rice growing areas in Ghana.
