[...] A staff editor from Selective Hearing was positive in their review; he/she said, [...] "It took some time but for Perfume fans this was definitely worth the wait. Neither track outshines each other and both are worthy of a-side status. Which one you prefer depends on what <b>your</b> <b>mood</b> is." [...] A staff editor from CD Journal reviewed the single release, and was generally favorable; he.she labelled it an [...] "adorable pop tune". Another staff editor from the same publication reviewed the album mix, and praised the [...] "stylish" [...] new composition. A reviewer from Imprint, a newspaper printed by the University of Waterloo, complimented the song in their review. He/she said that, [...] "Album mixes, [...] "Laser Beam" [...] and [...] "Glitter", mark a twist to in style to fit a more punk style dance music." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said he; [...] "it {{would be}} very difficult, perhaps impossible, to find a {{competent}} man who would answer your purpose. The good ones {{could not afford to}} give you part of their time, which is all you require, and you would not want any other. With women the case is different; and besides, I am sure, from my own experience, that a lady amanuensis would suit your purpose much better than a man: she would be more patient, more willing to accommodate herself to <b>your</b> <b>moods,</b> in every way more available." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But how"--I thought [...] "about such as do {{not feel}} it ridiculous to despise; how about those whose temperaments and {{religions}} show them all things so plainly that they know they are right and others wrong? They must be in a bad way!" [...] And for some seconds I felt sorry for them, and was discouraged. But then I thought: [...] "Not at all--obviously not! For {{if they do not}} find it ridiculous to feel contempt, they are perfectly right to feel contempt, it being natural to them; and you have no business to be sorry for them, for that is, after all, only your euphemism for contempt. They are all right, being the expressions of contemptuous moods, having religions and so forth, suitable to these moods; and the religion of <b>your</b> <b>mood</b> would be Greek to them, and probably a matter for contempt. But this only makes it the more interesting. For though to you, for instance, it may seem impossible to worship Mystery with one lobe of the brain, and with the other to explain it, the thought that this may not seem impossible to others should not discourage you; it is but another little piece of that Mystery which makes life so wonderful and sweet." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{one end of}} {{this large}} room there was a bowed window, the space near which was curtained {{off from the rest}} of the library, and, the window being filled with painted glass (most of which seemed old, though there were insertions evidently of modern and much {{inferior}} handiwork), there was a rich gloom of light, or you might call it a rich glow, according to <b>your</b> <b>mood</b> of mind. Redclyffe soon perceived that this curtained recess was the especial study of his friend, the Warden, and as such was provided with all that modern times had contrived for making an enjoyment out of the perusal of old books; a study table, with every convenience of multifarious devices, a great inkstand, pens; a luxurious study chair, where thought [Endnote: 3] upon. To say the truth, there was not, in this retired and thoughtful nook, anything that indicated to Redclyffe that the Warden had been recently engaged in consultation of learned authorities,--or in abstract labor, whether moral, metaphysical or historic; there was a volume of translations of Mother Goose's Melodies into Greek and Latin, printed for private circulation, and with the Warden's name on the title-page; a London newspaper of the preceding day; Lillebullero, Chevy Chase, and the old political ballads; and, what a little amused Redclyffe, the three volumes of a novel from a circulating library; so that Redclyffe came to the conclusion that the good Warden, like many educated men, whose early scholastic propensities are backed up by the best of opportunities, and all desirable facilities and surroundings, still contented himself with gathering a flower or two, instead of attempting the hard toil requisite to raise a crop.|$|E
