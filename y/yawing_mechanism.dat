40|$|Tidal {{power is}} a growing {{industry}} {{in the world but}} particularly in the United Kingdom. Many companies have started the race to achieve a cheap and efficient tidal turbine design. For instance, Tidal Energy Limited has opted for an innovative design by incorporating three horizontal axis turbines in a triangular frame that will be lying on the seabed. This project is called “DeltaStream” and a test device will be placed in Ramsey Sound, in the Welsh coast. The design of the project includes a <b>yawing</b> <b>mechanism</b> capable to turn the nacelle around the vertical axis in order for the turbines to face the tidal flow. This mechanism maximizes the power production as the tidal speed changes in direction every 6 hours. But it has another function. Due to the tidal speeds and the water density, the torque created in the rotor is very large. As Tidal Energy Ltd. has opted for an optimized blade design with no blade pitching mechanism, the only way to decrease the huge rotor torque in order to stop it is by the yawing of the nacelle away from the flow. However, it is believed by the author of this thesis that the <b>yawing</b> <b>mechanism</b> can be improved in system redundancy terms, in relation with the important role that accomplishes in the overall turbine design. The present thesis is an analysis of the weakest points of the current yaw system design and an investigation in an alternative to be cheaper, simpler and improved in reliability terms. The proposed design uses motors with reduction planetary gearboxes attached to the nacelle to drive the gear ring fixed on the tower structure. The new design is believed to be more reliable than the original due to the high level of redundancy. Nevertheless, it is not as cheap as expected due to a very expensive yaw brake system. In that point, the author recommends further investigation in the price reduction of that component without decreasing the level of brake fixation...|$|E
40|$|Several {{commercial}} {{tidal turbine}} designs feature axial flow rotors within bi-directional ducts. Such devices are typically intended to increase power extraction through a flow-concentrating effect, operating on flood and ebb tides without a <b>yawing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Research focused on such devices {{has been limited}} so far, with available results indicating poor performance relative to bare rotors. This study further investigates the relative performance of bi-directional ducted tidal turbines in confined flow. Several duct profiles are evaluated relative to unducted rotors using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver ANSYS Fluent. The rotor is represented as an actuator disc, which mimics the streamwise thrust of a real device but does not reproduce its swirl or additional turbulence generation. This idealised model achieves optimal energy extraction and enables fair comparison of duct geometries. Device power is reported relative to total frontal area, reflecting {{the fact that the}} overall dimension of the device will be limited by water depth. Comparisons based on rotor area show how the absolute power is increased by a duct, but that this is attributable to an increase in blockage. The fundamental effect of a duct on a rotor, as well as the secondary effects of duct camber and thickness, are identified by analysing streamwise distributions of velocity, pressure and cross-sectional area along the rotor streamtube. Ducts are found to limit the expansion of the downstream flow, in turn restricting the pressure reduction immediately behind the rotor. This effect, in combination with the reduced volumetric flux through a ducted rotor relative to a bare rotor, results in reduced power extraction. The effects of duct curvature and thickness on turbine performance are also examined. Where a ducted rotor is desirable, e. g. for the protection of rotor blades, a thick profile with slight curvature performs best...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the non-dimensional performance {{characteristics of a}} tidal stream turbine and how they varied in response to changes in flow direction. The problem was considered from an industrial perspective and used the commercial software package ANSYS CFX and a 1 : 20 th scale experimental turbine. Initial considerations analysed {{the performance of the}} turbine in an ‘upstream’ or ‘downstream’ configuration relative to the turbines support structure. The conclusions resulting from this were that up to a point by increasing separation between an upstream turbine and its support structure the greater average nondimensional performance characteristics became. Also, more significantly, it was identified that this orientation and clearance reduced the blade stanchion interaction considerably relative to the downstream orientation. The study made justification for the inclusion of a <b>yaw</b> <b>mechanism</b> to rotate the turbine to face the flow for flood and ebb phases of the tide. In an operational environment this would be expected to enhance the life of the turbine’s blades, thrust bearings, and gearbox - which are known to be prone to fatigue failure, due to highly dynamic loads. The thesis continued to expand into the potential uses of a <b>yaw</b> <b>mechanism</b> to address flow misalignment experienced throughout the tidal cycle. In order to justify this, the non-dimensional performance characteristics of the same turbine were compared for a series of flow misalignment cases. The CFD analysis showed that increased flow misalignment in either the positive and negative direction had the effect of reducing turbine torque and power performance characteristics, and also significantly increases the out-ofplane bending moments. A distinction between the positive yaw angles and negative yaw angles was identified in the turbine’s performance. The negative flow misalignment showed more favourable performance changes than the positive flow misalignment, this was due to the turbines rotational direction. The subsequent recommendations to industry were included making use of the turbines rotational direction and <b>yaw</b> <b>mechanism,</b> to experience lower performance reductions in the case of flow misalignment. Experimental results from tow tank testing at CNR-INSEAN using the 0. 5 m diameter turbine validated the nondimensional performance characteristics of the CFD results. It was identified that steady state CFD results did not capture the performance characteristics of flow misalignment cases as well as the transient CFD results. The experimental turbine captured temporal features identified in the CFD analysis. Recommendations to industry include the careful consideration of steady state CFD analysis in non-idealised flow conditions...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a 3 -stage plan for refurbishment of the planar motion mechanism (PMM). The purpose behind refurbishing the PMM is to make improvements that will translate into more accurate test results. This report looks at increasing the PMM structural stiffness by replacing the <b>yaw</b> <b>mechanism,</b> designing and building a new modular dynamometer for use on the PMM, and the issues associated with the current software for the PMM as well as possible improvements to be made in replacement software. Stage 1 of the refurbishment involves the design of the dynamometer. A cruciform structure was used as it showed greater stiffness then the present trapezoidal structure in finite element analysis. Other improvements made to the dynamometer include the use of button load cells as opposed to cantilever for increased stiffness. Stage 2 involves incorporating two tapered roller bearings into the <b>yaw</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the PMM. One bearing has a particularly large diameter that sits between the dynamometer and the PMM frame. This increases the stiffness of the PMM by allowing the dynamometer to be held closer to the PMM frame and through a wider contact surface. In stage 3 of the refurbishment issue with the current control software are addressed. The most important of these issues is the lack of documentation for the software. It is felt that rewriting the software would be the best solution. Stage 3 also lists some possible improvements that can be made to rewritten software such as the separation of the software into two entirely separate programs instead of having one program with two parts, as is the present case. Also, the future expansion of the PMM is considered in the software improvements by having excess control channels programmed into the software that would allow additional hardware controllers to be used.

40|$|International audienceWind Energy {{is seen as}} one of {{the most}} {{promising}} solutions to manÕs ever increasing demands of a clean source of energy. But there is a need to reduce the high initial costs for setting up and the maintenance costs. The maintenance cost may be lowered through the use of condition monitoring (CM) and structural health monitoring (SHM). SHM allows early detection of damage and allows maintenance planning which reduces the cost. In this paper, change in Neutral Axis (NA) position is proposed as a metric for damage detection. A discrete Kalman filter (KF) is employed for the estimation of the NA in the presence of measurement noise from the strain sensors. The KF allows data fusion from the strain sensors and the <b>yaw</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the accurate estimation of the NA. Any change in the NA position may be used as an indicator for the presence and location of the damage.

40|$|A diffuser-augmented {{wind turbine}} (DAWT) {{has been an}} {{attractive}} concept of wind energy extraction since the early 1970 s, due to the system's ability to increase the power generated by a regular bare turbine of the same size. However, the DAWT needs to reach a minimum augmentation ratio of 4 {{in order to become}} economically feasible. This paper investigates the possible improvement of a DAWT system by adding a collector fuselage to increase its augmentation ratio. Testing using a small experimental unit shows that adding a collector increases the power augmentation of the DAWT by more than 50 %, and increases the mass flow rate through the turbine by increasing the effective upstream area of the wind that enters it. Changing the angle of the incident wind on a collector- and diffuser-augmented wind turbine (CDAWT) shows {{that it is possible to}} capture the energy in the wind up to an angle of 71 °. Moreover, the CDAWT can keep extracting wind energy, without any diminution of the augmentation ratio, as wind direction varies ± 45 ° from the turbine axes, thus eliminating the requirement for a <b>yaw</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Hence, the variant wind direction has a positive effect on the augmentation ratio.

This drive {{mechanism}} {{does not require a}} separate <b>yaw</b> drive <b>mechanism</b> and allows direct control of the yaw rotation of the ball. Unlike CMU Ballbot that uses four motors for driving the ball and one motor for yaw rotation, BallIP and Rezero use only three motors for both the operations. Moreover, they only have three force transmission points compared to four points on CMU Ballbot. Since the contact between an omni-wheel and the ball should be reduced to a single point, most available omni-wheels are not properly suitable for this task because of the gaps between the individual smaller wheels that result in unsteady rolling motion. Therefore, the BallIP project introduced a more complex omni-wheel with a continuous circumferential contact line. The Rezero team equipped this omni-wheel design with roller bearings and a high-friction coating. They also additionally fitted a mechanical ball arrester that presses the ball against the actuators in order to further increase friction forces and a suspension to dampen vibrations.

40|$|It is {{desirable}} for the boundary {{layer on a}} re-entry vehicle (RV) to be laminar during as much of its flight as possible, since a turbulent boundary layer causes several problems, such as high heat flux to the vehicle and larger drag forces.

The crossflow instability may also influence transition on <b>yawed</b> RVs. The <b>mechanisms</b> through which these phenomena induce transition are poorly understood. Several experiments have been conducted to study these phenomena. The temperature-sensitive-paint (TSP) and oil-flow techniques were used to observe transition and crossflow vortices on cones at angle of attack in the Purdue Boeing/AFOSR Mach- 6 Quiet Tunnel.

Crossflow vortices were observed with both TSP and oil flow under noisy conditions in the turbulent boundary layer on a sharp cone.

The vortices were similar to those seen in noisy flow. An array of roughness elements at x = 2 inches (axially) with a spacing of 9 ° on a yawed sharp cone in noisy flow influenced transition that was apparently induced by the crossflow instability.

40|$|This project aims {{to develop}} a simple and {{economical}} Small Wind Turbine (SWT) design. The turbine {{is intended to be}} used in regional Queensland, requiring an investigation into the available wind resources. Anthropogenic climate change is driving a world-wide renewable energy revolution. Rising fossil fuel prices as a result of dwindling reserves is prompting the investigation of alternative energy sources. In Queensland the presence of a market for small off-grid or remote area power supplies, has led to the consideration of SWTs as an increasingly viable alternative energy source capable of meeting future demands. This project sets out three major objectives: 1. A complete SWT design integrating commercially available components with engineered structural parts, some of which may utilise fibre-composite materials. This includes a 3 D parametric model, manufacturing drawings and system specifications. Considerable allowance is given for manufacture, installation, maintenance and decommissioning. 2. An investigation into wind resources in Queensland, and a proposed installation site, or sites that could benefit from the use of wind power; and, 3. An estimation of the SWTs power output and a total system price to evaluate against similar products, with a Cost Benefit Analysis to support the design feasibility. The research methodology was divided into three subparts: a) Conduct a literature review investigating background information, current technology and issues, to form the basis of the design. b) Research a potential installation site in regional Queensland by crossreferencing data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology with information pertaining to the extent of Queensland’s electricity distribution network. c) Develop a simple and economical SWT design by synthesizing commercially available components and engineered parts into a working conceptual solution.

40|$|The {{object of}} this study is {{primarily}} to understand the behavior of the wake behind a yawed turbine, and if yaw can be a method for actively controlling the direction of the wake, and thereby controlling the power output of downstream turbines. Two model wind turbines were tested experimentally in the wind tunnel at NTNU. First of all, the performance of a single upstream turbine operating at fixed rotational speed with varying yaw angles was examined. Further, the aim was to understand to what extent the side force created by the yawed turbine affects the wake, thus the velocity deficits and turbulence intensities in the downstream flow field were experimented on. In addition, the performance and dynamic loads experienced by a second turbine operating at 3 D downstream of the upstream turbine were examined. Finally, the overall efficiency of the wind farm was found for the different yaw scenarios. The study confirms that when a turbine is operating in yaw, both the power and thrust coefficient will decrease significantly with increasing yaw angle. Yawing the upstream turbine will also affect the behavior of the wake to a great extent, as the wake is deformed and deflected sideways. When the upstream turbine is yawed 40 &# 176;, the width of the wake at 3 D downstream is decreased to half its size of un-yawed condition and is shifted about 0. 5 D sideways. The performance of the downstream turbine increases with increasing yaw angle of the upstream turbine. When the upstream turbine is yawed 50 &# 176;, the downstream turbine obtains a power gain of 24 % compared to the un-yawed condition, resulting in a maximum power coefficient of 33 %. This confirms that the second turbine experiences less interaction with an upstream turbine operating under yawed conditions. It was found that the optimal wind farm efficiency of the two model turbines occurs when the upstream turbine is yawed between 0 &# 176; to 30 &# 176;, resulting in a wind farm efficiency of approximately 54 % for all three conditions. The power loss experienced by the upstream turbine is offset by the corresponding power gain of the downstream turbine. However, fatigue loads were found to act on both the turbine operating in yaw and the downstream turbine partly exposed to the wake, which will eventually reduce their longevity. Therefore, the result of the study carried out on two wind turbines in the wind tunnel suggests that it will not be beneficial to use <b>yaw</b> as a <b>mechanism</b> for controlling the wake direction and thereby increase the wind farm efficiency since the power gain of the downstream turbine will be offset by the power loss of the yawed turbine. Tailoring the blade design of the yawed turbines may, however, {{have a positive impact on}} the overall wind farm efficiency and also reduce fatigue loads. </p...|$|R
