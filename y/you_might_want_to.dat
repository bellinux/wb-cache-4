500|$|Heading {{into his}} junior year, Anderson was named preseason third-team All-Atlantic 10. He {{became known as}} the entrenched {{starting}} point guard for UMass and was named team captain. He posted a team-high 21 points, 5 rebounds, and 6 assists in his debut vs. St. Francis (NY). Anderson notched a career-high 29 points on December 2, against Vermont, connecting on 7 of his 9 three-point attempts. He was the first Minuteman to accomplish the feat since Monty Mack in March 2001. Anderson also recorded the seventh-most three-pointers in a single game in school history. He said, [...] "When you see a guy hit a couple shots <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> run a play to get that guy open. So it definitely helps out a lot, it makes it way easier for me." [...] Following another 20-point effort vs. Boston College and a season-best 9 rebounds, he was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Week and Dinn Brothers UMass Athlete of the Week.|$|E
500|$|Mega Man 6 is {{occasionally}} seen as [...] "redundant" [...] to the series. GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer labeled Mega Man 6 the [...] "cheesiest" [...] {{among the}} NES titles: [...] "If you're looking for mega-laughs, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{try this one}} out." [...] 1UP.com contributors likewise found that the game's [...] "inane" [...] storyline and villains both insult fans of the series and outweigh the game's good soundtrack and interesting power-ups. The {{four members of the}} Electronic Gaming Monthly review panel all voiced similar opinions regarding the game's familiar 8-bit presentation and its addition to the already repetitive nature of the series. One reviewer commented, [...] "OK, Mega Man was fun and original {{back in the days when}} the letters 'N E S' meant something. Now the game is just getting redundant. Oh sure, Mega Man may learn a few new tricks here and there but this series has to end soon." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{five years}} of {{substance}} abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs {{and a return to}} his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to do it." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery is hardly the peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo every which way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting she sounded as though she sang through {{the side of her}} mouth much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced the skeptics who insisted Lange was the reason for Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to come, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hold your breath on that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly saccharine, yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, McAdams starred {{with her}} The Family Stone co-star Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford in the comedy Morning Glory. She played a {{television}} producer attempting {{to improve the}} poor ratings of a morning television program. The film was billed as a starring vehicle for McAdams. She initially felt she was unsuited to the role saying, [...] "I'm not funny. So I said, 'if you need me to be funny, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> look somewhere else'". The film's director Roger Michell {{had a number of}} dinners with McAdams and persuaded her to join the cast. Since working with Keaton, McAdams has described her as a mentor figure. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said McAdams [...] "gives the kind of performance we go to the movies for" [...] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt she played [...] "as lovable a lead as anyone since Amy Adams in Junebug" [...] in an otherwise [...] "routine" [...] movie. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was impressed by [...] "her gift for physical comedy", as was Varietys Andrew Barker. While Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt she [...] "plays her role exceptionally well" [...] and is [...] "effortlessly likable", it called on Hollywood to give her parts [...] "worthy" [...] of her talent. [...] "Ms.McAdams has to rely on her dimples to get by. She does, but she could do better." [...] The film was a modest commercial success, grossing $58million worldwide from a production budget of $40million. McAdams later expressed her disappointment that the film failed to find a larger audience.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 52, {{he began}} to revive his career and started taking acting classes, {{something}} he had not thought about after being cast in Neighbours. He described his age, unknown status and willingness {{to work for a}} relatively low fee as being his main assets for getting work in America. His drama teacher, who he has remained with ever since, told him [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> play great roles, but truth is you will get cast as a specific type. Just work out your type. The others in the class said I was a bit Anthony Hopkins and a bit Sean Connery and that went into my head. I thought if I go for roles those guys would go for I'm more likely to get them." [...] The first role he was offered was a part in a series called Sign of Life, a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of ER. Since then, Dale has been [...] "busier than ever". He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on The West Wing, Torchwood, The Lone Gunmen, Californication, and The Practice. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in JAG and its spin-off NCIS, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of The X-Files, playing the [...] "Toothpick Man". He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of 24, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial Midnight Man and the Australian series Sea Patrol in 2008. He also had recurring parts on Undercovers, Entourage as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series Moving Wallpaper as a fictional version of himself. He had a recurring role as King George in the series Once Upon a Time, and Emmett in Hot in Cleveland, before joining the main cast of Dominion in 2014, playing General Edward Riesen.|$|E

[...] "I don't recall that", said the eighty-four-year-old Harry Sayeau.|$|E

5000|$|Carrie O'Grady in The Guardian {{was more}} critical, [...] "Could {{it be that}} this book's rigidity, its {{avoidance}} of risk, is because the story {{is too close to}} the author's own? Shriver could have added more potential outcomes - what if Ramsey dumped Irina? What if Lawrence, the worm, suddenly turned - and Shriver kept us guessing, as she did in Kevin? Instead she sacrifices drama for Irina's musings and homilies. There's a sense of events playing out in neat, parallel tracks, as if predetermined - which <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> do, under certain circumstances. But a bit of chaos is much more fun, both in life and in fiction." ...|$|R
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on November 7, 2005 that rapper Kirk [...] "Sticky Fingaz" [...] Jones had signed to star as Blade, filling the role made {{popular in the}} films by Wesley Snipes. Sticky {{would go on to}} comment that he was not out to make people forget about the Blade films, but he also wanted to put his own spin on the character. [...] "I think it's more my own direction, but I have to incorporate some of what [...] did," [...] he said. [...] "That's what people are familiar with, and you don't want to change it up drastically. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> change the seasoning a little bit, but you want the same meat." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producers {{and writers}} for NCIS were {{initially}} divided {{over how to}} proceed with Tadros' character. In January 2009, some were suggesting possibly making him a relative of Ziva, an idea Cote de Pablo opposed. It was also proposed that Ziva would [...] "stop toying with [...] completely" [...] which would [...] "drive him even more insane". De Pablo relayed, [...] "We're going to play around {{with the idea that}} it could possibly be real love, and see how [...] deals with it." [...] In March, executive producer Shane Brennan stated, [...] "You've got what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> call a triangle. It's a triangle with very, very pointy ends. Someone's going to get hurt." [...] He continued, [...] "Something tragic will happen to Tony. Something tragic will happen to Ziva as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Gatiss {{said that}} Capaldi's Doctor was [...] "sort of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee and even Christopher Eccleston style...it's someone who's not {{immediately}} {{going to be}} your best friend and can be quite abrupt and rude." [...] Moffat added to this analysis of the character by saying, [...] "He has a tremendous ability with throwaway humour {{and a lot of it}} is around the fact that sometimes he is terribly rude. I think kids will think he is the rude Doctor [...] <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> cuddle him but he really will resist." [...] It has been said that part of the Doctor's personality will share [...] "a certain acid wit" [...] of Malcolm Tucker, the role Peter Capaldi is most famous for, [...] "specifically the attitude, the wisecracks and the energy...he can be edgy, volatile and dangerous". Capaldi has stated that all of the previous actors who had played the Doctor were channelled in his portrayal and that his particular influences were Hartnell, Pertwee and Davison.|$|E

In response to a suggestion that the regular criminal court system {{could be used to}} try them, he said, [...] "Another reason <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use the trial system is that the trial system, to be legitimate, has to have the possibility of acquitting someone of a crime."

40|$|After an {{exciting}} class discussion, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> students <b>to</b> write conventional papers directed {{at you and}} focused ultimately on a grade, or <b>you</b> <b>might</b> prefer that they bring their further insights to their classmates, continuing and enriching the ongoing class collaboration. Blogging is {{an excellent way to}} implement the second option, continuing an exchange of ideas and providing students with another tool to improve their writing skills. Student class blogging offers many benefits—for student and instructor alike—compared to assigning conventional papers directed only at the instructor. The collaborative writing and peer editing inherent in blogging offer challenges as well as benefits, so guidance in facilitating a meaningful exchange as well as navigating the nuts-and-bolts technicalities may be useful to honors faculty who are establishing a class blog. Ideas for class exercises, assignments, and evaluative expectations co-designed by an instructor and a team of honors students may also help bring out maximum creativity and collegiality in the honors blog...|$|R
