They were to be encamped at Fort Monroe on the tip of the Virginia Peninsula.

500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] is song {{composed}} {{in the dance}} genre, that encompasses a techno beat infused in its backing, as well as synthesizers. The song features auto-tuned vocals by Kesha. According to Robert Cospey of Digital Spy, the song's chorus contains [...] "trancey" [...] elements and is reminiscent of Benny Benassi's song, [...] "Satisfaction". Lyrically, Cruz explained the song's message saying, [...] "the song is actually about sending sexy pictures to your significant other, if you miss each other and you can't see each other, you're far away from each other, <b>you</b> <b>send</b> pictures to remind each other of how sexy you are." [...] According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate beat rate of 125 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of F Minor; Cruz' vocal range spans from the note of Eb4 to the note of F5.|$|E
500|$|The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31, {{and arrived}} outside Charleston Harbor the next day. Moultrie noticed a British scout boat {{apparently}} looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island (now {{known as the}} Isle of Palms), {{just a few hundred}} yards from Sullivan's Island; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan's. By June 8, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan's Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. Optimistically believing he would not even need Clinton's land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort's guns were knocked out, he would [...] "land seamen and marines (which I have practiced for the purpose) under the guns" [...] and that they could [...] "keep possession till <b>you</b> <b>send</b> as many troops as you think proper".|$|E

[...] Another set of items, including some of Lennon's drug paraphernalia, brought over $60,000 for her in 1995.

500|$|Washington's party reached Fort LeBoeuf on December 11, in {{the middle}} of a raging snowstorm. [...] The French commander, Captain Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, {{received}} them with hospitality; however, in response to Dinwiddie's demands, he pointed out that the letter was more properly addressed to his superior, New France's governor the Marquis Duquesne. [...] The letter Legardeur drafted in response to Dinwiddie's was clear and to the point: [...] "as to the summons <b>you</b> <b>send</b> me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it." [...] Washington took careful notes of the military arrangements at both forts before departing on December 16. [...] He was somewhat concerned by the fact that Tanacharison and his men remained behind for further discussions with the French; he wrote, [...] "I saw that every strategem which the most fruitful brain could invent, was practiced to win Half King to their interest". [...] He returned to Williamsburg after a month of difficult travel. [...] Dinwiddie had Washington's account of the expedition widely distributed to emphasize the French threat. It was printed on both sides of the Atlantic, giving Washington an international reputation.|$|E
500|$|The Franciscan Padre Luis Sotelo came to {{our country}} to spread the faith of God. On that occasion, I learnt about this faith and desired to become a Christian, but I still haven't {{accomplished}} this desire due to some small issues. However, {{in order to encourage}} my subjects to become Christians, I wish that <b>you</b> <b>send</b> missionaries of the Franciscan church. I guarantee that {{you will be able to}} build a church and that your missionaries will be protected. I also wish that you select and send a bishop as well. Because of that, I have sent one of my samurai, Hasekura Rokuemon, as my representative to accompany Luis Sotelo across the seas to Rome, to give you a stamp of obedience and to kiss your feet. Further, as our country and Nueva España are neighbouring countries, could you intervene so that we can discuss with the King of Spain, for the benefit of dispatching missionaries across the seas."

But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide my purse from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and so I would encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if I could do it with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E

2500|$|In 1889 {{the chiefs}} and rulers of Niue, {{in a letter}} to Queen Victoria, asked her [...] "to stretch out towards us your mighty hand, that Niue may hide herself in it and be safe".

If <b>you</b> <b>send</b> the flag of Britain that is well; or if <b>you</b> <b>send</b> a Commissioner to reside among us, that will be well". The British did not initially take up the offer. In 1900 a petition by the Cook Islanders asking for annexation included Niue [...] "if possible". In a document dated 19 October 1901, the [...] "King" [...] and Chiefs of Niue consented to [...] "Queen Victoria taking possession of this island". A despatch to the Secretary of State for the Colonies from the Governor of New Zealand referred to the views expressed by the Chiefs in favour of [...] "annexation" [...] and to this document as [...] "the deed of cession". A British Protectorate was declared, but it remained short-lived. Niue was brought within the boundaries of New Zealand on 11 June 1901 by the same Order and Proclamation as the Cook Islands. The Order limited the islands to which it related by reference to an area in the Pacific described by co-ordinates, and Niue, at 19.02 S., 169.55 W, lies within that area.|$|E
