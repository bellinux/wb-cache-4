His older son, Biff, causes [...] "old hopes and boiling resentments" [...] to return by visiting home. Willy is loved by Biff, who nonetheless does not get along with him. [...] Their relationship is the emotional lynchpin of the production. “In fact, Willy's logical mind becomes blind…” Biff attempts to help his father see what has become of him. In the end, Biff decides that he must force his father to see the truth rather than his fanciful images, for his own good, regardless of its toll on his father. [...] This is the emotional climax of the show as he bares his soul saying [...] "Pop, I'm nothing! I'm nothing, Pop! Can't <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that?</b> There's no spite in it any more. I'm just what I am, that's all." [...] At Willy's funeral, Biff states that [...] "He had the wrong dreams...He never knew who he was.".|$|E

So, anecdotal evidence involves all your subjectivity—if we do it like this we don't have that anymore. Why, surely do you understand how powerful that is?" [...] And if they don't, then that's what you have to explain to them. It's an extremely powerful thing and a very basic thing.|$|E
2500|$|The State Duma Committee on Commonwealth of Independent States Affairs, {{headed by}} Leonid Slutsky, visited Simferopol on 25 February 2014 and said: [...] "If the {{parliament}} of the Crimean autonomy or its residents express {{the wish to}} join the Russian Federation, Russia will be prepared to consider this sort of application. We will be examining the situation and doing so fast." [...] They also stated that {{in the event of}} a referendum for Crimea region joining Russian Federation they would consider its results [...] "very fast". Later Slutsky announced that he was misunderstood by Crimean press and no decision regarding simplifying the process of acquiring Russian citizenship for people in Crimea has been made yet. And added that if [...] "fellow Russian citizens are in jeopardy <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> we do not stay away". On 25 February, in a meeting with Crimean politicians he stated that Viktor Yanukovych was still the legitimate president of Ukraine. That same day in the Russian Duma, they announced they were determining measures so that Russians in Ukraine who [...] "did not want to break from the Russian World" [...] could acquire Russian citizenship.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{addressed}} {{this idea of}} proving God in this discourse. He says, [...] "When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit {{and wait for the}} decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence {{with the help of a}} few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!" [...] He also said, [...] "Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to assume that <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> there is a God is not so vain as to think that he has invented the existence of God. He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote:it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast — I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past — why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper. I will hurry along the path I have found and shout to everyone I meet: Do not look back as Lot's wife did, but remember that we are struggling up a hill.|$|E
