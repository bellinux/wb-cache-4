Jerry and George try to persuade Kramer to forget the idea, but Kramer is determined {{to go on with}} it. Kramer's pizza parlor idea reappears in later episodes such as [...] "The Puffy Shirt" [...] in season 5, and [...] "The Couch" [...] in season 6.|$|E

Jerry's neighbor, Kramer, conceptualizes [...] "a pizza place where <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> pie". The episode {{was written by}} Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, {{and was the first}} filmed episode directed by Tom Cherones. This was the first episode produced with Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) as a character. It also was the first episode to use Jonathan Wolff's title music. This is the only Seinfeld episode whose title does not begin with the definite article [...] "The".|$|E
500|$|The series win was the Red Sox's first {{title in}} 86years. They {{were also the}} fourth team to win a World Series without {{trailing}} {{in any of the}} games in the series, and the seventh to win it having previously been three outs away from elimination. With the win, pitcher Lowe became the first pitcher to ever win three series-clinching games in a single postseason having also won Game 3 of the ALDS against the Angels and Game 7 of the ALCS against the Yankees. Although the series was won in St. Louis, 3,000Red Sox fans were present at the game, and many stayed after the final out to celebrate with the team, including going on the field when the team came back out of their dugout with the World Series trophy. Ramírez, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, said afterwards [...] "I don't believe in curses, I believe <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> destination. [...] " [...] Kevin Millar said {{that it was important to}} finish off the Cardinals in four and not let it go to a fifth game given the team's history.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of the band's {{previous}} albums Almost There and Spoken For, MercyMe was given [...] "significantly" [...] more resources to develop their next record by their record label, INO Records. Although they decided not to alter their Christian approach to songwriting, live performances, and interviews, they opted to work with outside songwriters on the album, employed the London Symphony Orchestra to play strings on several tracks, and added a sixth member to the band, guitarist Barry Graul. Additionally, MercyMe wrote and recorded the music for Undone before they wrote any of the lyrics. Lead singer Bart Millard noted that by using this method, instead of his lyrics swaying the musical elements of the song, the music acted as [...] "a canvas with which to write [...] ". He elaborated that [...] "We’ve been making records for 10 years, so anything that sparks creativity... is very much welcomed". The title of the album was inspired by [...] "the unexpected twists and turns in the band's journey"; Millard commented that [...] "We had our plans for {{what we were going to}} do; but when the bigger picture happened, all of our plans came unraveled. We don’t know what tomorrow will hold. When <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> plans, you suddenly find yourself undone; and that’s exactly where God wants us in the first place".|$|E
500|$|New York Magazine put [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as {{third of}} its list of [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes", {{claiming}} that [...] "because with all his other problems, daddy issues don't feel like {{something that needs to}} be thrown at Hurley" [...] and David could have been written as a positive character [...] "just to add some variation to the bad-dad overkill on this show". IGN ranked [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as the second worst Lost episode, above only [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", explaining [...] "Is there a better metaphor that Lost was running in circles at this point in Season 3 than seeing several of the castaways driving in circles on the island, with goofy grins on their faces?... With a dull story on the island and flashbacks weakly giving Hurley the requisite daddy issues so many of the other characters already had, it was clear Lost needed to make a big change soon to recapture what was special about the show. Thankfully, they did." [...] A similar list by the Los Angeles Times ranked the episode much higher at 31, writing [...] "The haters need to shut up. This is a nearly pure embrace of the Lost ethos. <b>You</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> fate up until the moment when you don't." ...|$|E
500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback does a great job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E

500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E

It was slang originally for beef on the hoof, because in the Military Areas two-thirds of your meat-rations at least are handed over {{to you on the}} hoof, and <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> arrangements. The word 'heef' became a parable for camping in the Military Areas and all its miseries. There are two Areas in Ireland, one in Wales for hill-work, a couple in Scotland, and a sort of parade-ground in the Lake District; but the real working Areas are in India, Africa, and Australia, and so on." ...|$|E

She is anomalous, but, to our way of thinking, all the Americans I have met are anomalous, and she has the merits that you would not logically attribute to her character. Of course, I cannot feel that her evident regard for me is the least of these, though I like to think that it is founded on more reason than the rest.|$|E
6000|$|Half {{the controversies}} about {{the freedom of}} the will would have had no existence, if this pithy {{paragraph}} had been well pondered by those who oppose the doctrine of necessity. For they rest upon the absurd presumption that the proposition, [...] "I can do as I like," [...] is contradictory to the doctrine of necessity. The answer is; nobody doubts that, at any rate within certain limits, you can do as you like. But what determines your likings and dislikings? Did <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> constitution? Is it your contrivance that one thing is pleasant and another is painful? And even if it were, why did you prefer to make it after the one fashion rather than the other? The passionate assertion of the consciousness of their freedom, which is the favourite refuge of the opponents of the doctrine of necessity, is mere futility, for nobody denies it. What they really have to do, if they would upset the necessarian argument, is to prove that they are free to associate any emotion whatever with any idea whatever; to like pain as much as pleasure; vice as much as virtue; in short, to prove, that, whatever may be the fixity of order of the universe of things, that of thought is given over to chance.|$|E

6000|$|Now we {{know that}} St. Paul speaks truth, from the {{writings}} of heathens; for God raised up from time to time, even among the heathen Greeks and Romans, witnesses for Himself, to testify of Him and of His life, and to testify against {{the sins of the}} world, such men as Socrates and Plato among the Greeks, whose writings St. Paul knew thoroughly, and whom, I have no doubt, he had in his mind when he wrote his first chapter of Romans, and told the heathen that they were without excuse. And among the Romans, also, He raised up, in the same way, witnesses for Himself, such as Juvenal and Persius, and others, whom scholars know well. And to these men, heathens though they were, God certainly did teach a great deal about Himself, and gave them courage to rebuke the sins of kings and rich men, even at the danger of their lives; and to some of them he gave courage even to suffer martyrdom for the message which God had given them, and which their neighbours hated to hear. And this was the message which God sent by them to the heathen: that God was good and righteous, and that therefore His everlasting wrath must be awaiting sinners. They rebuked their heathen neighbours for those very same horrible crimes which St. Paul mentions; and then they said, as St. Paul does, 'How <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> sins worse by blasphemies against God! You sin yourselves, and then, to excuse yourselves, you invent fables and lies about God, and pretend that God is as wicked as you are, in order to drug your own consciences, by making God the pattern of your own wickedness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Curlydown and Bagwax {{occupied}} {{the same room}} at the office in St. Martin's-le-Grand; {{and there it was}} their fate in life to arrange, inspect, and generally attend to those apparently unintelligible hieroglyphics with which the outside coverings of our correspondence are generally bedaubed. Curlydown's hair had fallen from his head, and his face had become puckered with wrinkles, through anxiety to make these markings legible and intelligible. The popular newspaper, the popular member of Parliament, and the popular novelist,--the name of Charles Dickens will of course present itself to the reader who remembers the Circumlocution office,--have had it impressed on their several minds,--and have endeavoured to impress the same idea on the minds of the public generally,--that the normal Government clerk is quite indifferent to his work. No greater mistake was ever made, or one showing less observation of human nature. It is the nature of a man to appreciate his own work. The felon who is made simply to move shot, perishes because he knows his work is without aim. The fault lies on the other side. The policeman is ambitious of arresting everybody. The lawyer would rather make your will for you gratis than let <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> The General can believe in nothing but in well-trained troops. Curlydown would willingly have expended the whole net revenue of the post-office,--and his own,--in improving the machinery for stamping letters. But he had hardly succeeded in life. He had done his duty, and was respected by all. He lived comfortably in a suburban cottage with a garden, having some private means, and had brought up a happy family in prosperity;--but he had done nothing new. Bagwax, who was twenty years his junior, had with manifest effects, added a happy drop of turpentine to the stamping-oil,--and in doing so had broken Curlydown's heart. The 'Bagwax Stamping Mixture' had absolutely achieved a name, which was printed on the official list of stores. Curlydown's mind was vacillating between the New River and a pension,--between death in the breach and acknowledged defeat,--when a new interest was lent to his life by the Caldigate envelope. It was he who had been first sent by the Postmaster-General to Sir John Joram's chambers. But the matter had become too large for himself alone, and in an ill-fated hour Bagwax had been consulted. Now Bagwax was to be sent to Sydney,--almost with the appointments of a lawyer! ...|$|E
