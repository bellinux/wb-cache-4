500|$|After more behind-the-scenes {{contract}} wrangling, Smith {{became a}} St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool {{designed to help}} Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, [...] "Every time you hit a fly ball, <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> <b>me</b> a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll keep that going all year." [...] Smith agreed to the wager, {{and by the end}} of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, [...] "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to me that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 1932, Starr grew irritated with Meher Baba {{and wrote}} to him, [...] "Give me either the 400 pounds <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> <b>me</b> or illumination; otherwise, I {{will leave you}} and expose you as a fraud!" [...] He then did leave Meher Baba. The money he {{referred}} to was money he had spent hosting Meher Baba at his retreat in Devon. Starr disbanded the Devon retreat and sold the property {{a year and a}} half later. He later organized 'nature cure and scientific relaxation' courses at Frogmore Hall, Herts.|$|E
2500|$|Totte is Zillah's three-year-old (stuffed animal) chimpanzee. [...] The duo talk, sing, {{and perform}} magic tricks {{together}} for their comical performances. For the winning performance, Zillah & Totte sang Herreys [...] "Diggi-loo diggi-ley" [...] {{on a stage}} with large letters that spelled TOTTE. [...] In {{the middle of the}} song, Zillah fell backwards over the letters and Totte blamed her for destroying their chance to win. [...] "Now <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> <b>me</b> a million!" [...] said Totte to Zillah before first demanding the audience to vote for him and then sweetly asking for their vote. [...] The strategy worked as they not only won the jury's votes but also votes of the public.|$|E

6000|$|Foster hesitated. [...] "To begin with, it {{must have}} looked as if I wanted to boast about keeping my promise and hint that <b>you</b> <b>owed</b> <b>me</b> something." ...|$|R
60|$|Octav. Would you triumph o'er poor Octavia's virtue? That pride was all I had to bear me up; That {{you might}} think <b>you</b> <b>owed</b> <b>me</b> for your life, And owed it to my duty, not my love. I have been injured, and my haughty soul Could brook but ill the man, who slights my bed.|$|R
2500|$|Starting in September 2006, O'Brien was stalked by Father David Ajemian of the Archdiocese of Boston, who, despite {{multiple}} {{warnings to}} stop, sent O'Brien letters signed as [...] "your priest stalker" [...] and {{came into contact}} with O'Brien's parents. O'Brien and Ajemian had attended Harvard University at the same time. Frustrated that he had been denied a spot in the Late Night audience, Ajemian sent a letter to O'Brien stating that he flew to New York [...] "in the dimming hope that you might finally acknowledge me." [...] He stated in another letter, [...] "Is this the way you treat your most dangerous fans??? <b>You</b> <b>owe</b> <b>me</b> big time, pal." [...] In another letter, Ajemian seemed to make a death threat, saying, [...] "Remember Frank Costello once dodged a bullet in your building and so can you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stiltz later {{testified before}} the coroner's jury that Switzer had banged on the front door, saying, [...] "Let me in, or I'll kick in the door." [...] Once inside, he and Stiltz began to argue. Switzer said, [...] "I want that 50 bucks <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> <b>me</b> now, and I mean now." [...] When Stiltz refused {{to give it to}} him, the men began to fight. Switzer {{allegedly}} struck Stiltz with a glass-domed clock, which caused him to bleed from his left eye. Stiltz retreated to his bedroom and returned with a [...]38-caliber revolver. Switzer grabbed the gun, resulting in a shot being fired that struck the ceiling. Switzer forced Stiltz into a closet, although Stiltz had regained his revolver. Switzer allegedly pulled a switchblade knife and screamed, [...] "I'm going to kill you!" [...] Fearing Switzer was about to attack, Stiltz shot him in the groin. Switzer suffered massive internal bleeding and was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.|$|E

6000|$|OCTAVIA. Would you triumph o'er poor Octavia's virtue?

[...] I have been injured, and my haughty soul [...] Could brook but ill the man who slights my bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo, oldster!" [...] he replied, {{in a tone}} of {{the most}} insolent indignation, [...] "wot ever do you mean by runnin' agin my 'ead like that? Hain't you got no genteel boys in the West-end to butt agin, that you come all the way to Vitechapel to butt agin me? I've a good mind to 'and you over to the p'leece.

6000|$|... "Six fathoms your grandmother!" [...] was the trader's retort. [...] "You {{want to pay}} up your debts, that's what <b>you</b> want. <b>You</b> <b>owed</b> <b>me</b> {{twelve hundred}} dollars Chili. Very well; <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> them no longer. The amount is squared. Besides, I will give you credit for two hundred Chili. If, when I get to Tahiti, the pearl sells well, I will give you credit for another hundred--that will make three hundred. But mind, only if the pearl sells well. I may even lose money on it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} done as much for any of my people," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>you</b> don't <b>owe</b> <b>me</b> any thanks. To be frank with you, I hoped you'd die." ...|$|R

6000|$|... '"This day six years," [...] said Heyling, [...] "I {{claimed the}} life <b>you</b> <b>owed</b> <b>me</b> for my child's. Beside the lifeless form of your daughter, old man, I swore {{to live a}} life of revenge. I have never swerved from my purpose for a moment's space; but if I had, one thought of her uncomplaining, {{suffering}} look, as she drooped away, or of the starving face of our innocent child, would have nerved me to my task. My first act of requital you well remember: this is my last." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS BUILDER. [Shaking her head] I'm {{going in}} a moment. [To ATHENE] <b>You</b> <b>owe</b> it to <b>me,</b> Athene.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't think I'm conferring any benefit on you," [...] he said. [...] "It's {{simply a}} {{business}} arrangement, I'm giving you board and lodging {{in return for}} your work. <b>You</b> don't <b>owe</b> <b>me</b> anything. And there's nothing humiliating to you in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ha--ha--ha,' laughed M'Ruen; 'but that's just it--can you pay? <b>You</b> <b>owe</b> <b>me</b> a {{great deal}} of money, Mr. Tudor. You are so unpunctual, you know.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think more}} about it, perhaps, than you do. I think <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> it <b>me</b> to come down. You will never {{probably}} have another {{chance of being}} present at your brother's marriage." [...] This {{he said in a}} tone that was almost lachrymose.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you look}} at it this way it’s fair enough," [...] ses George. [...] "I gave you your life and you give me your gal.

60|$|BLANCO. I didnt steal it. I distrained on it {{for what}} <b>you</b> <b>owed</b> <b>me.</b> I thought it was yours. I was a fool {{to think that you}} owned {{anything}} but other people's property. You laid your hands on everything father and mother had when they died. I never asked you for a fair share. I never asked you for all the money I'd lent you from time to time. I asked you for mother's old necklace with the hair locket in it. You wouldn't give me that: you wouldn't give me anything. So as you refused me my due I took it, just to give you a lesson.|$|R
