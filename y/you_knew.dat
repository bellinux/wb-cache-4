That's not, like, a revelation – <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> {{just by looking}} at her… She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia… I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger.|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

25|$|The ad depicts Mrs Claus as {{more modern}} than {{previous}} examples, with her riding a snowmobile and flying a helicopter while Santa is out delivering gifts {{in the traditional}} sleigh. At {{the conclusion of the}} ad, she says to Santa “Well it wouldn’t be fun if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> all my secrets” suggesting she has a secret life assisting with Christmas present delivery. The brand also created a social media campaign in which Mrs. Claus answered requests and questions from members of the public.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the white influx, some blacks operated alternative venues in their homes. Called buffet flats, they offered alcohol, music, dancing, prostitutes, and, commonly, gambling, and, less often, rooms to which a couple could go. Their location in residential buildings, typically on cross streets above 140th Street, away from the nightclubs and speakeasies on the avenues, offered a degree of privacy from police, and from whites: you could only find a buffet flat if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> the address and apartment number, which hosts did not advertise.|$|E

Additionally, the band's {{official}} website had linked to the group's website. The full band was shown in a documentary for Alive & Well declaring their support before a performance. Links and references to Alive & Well have since been removed and no further mentions or shows of support have been made.|$|E
25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew. He {{was a kind}} of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes and <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E

500|$|Adult Swim in a Box {{was first}} {{announced}} by Warner Home Video on July 31, 2009, {{to be released}} on October 27 of the same year. The set was promoted as having a roughly threefold retail value ( [...] or $160 to $69.98), containing [...] "4 of the 5 best selling Adult Swim series." [...] It consists of seven discs, totaling 21 hours and 20 minutes of content. According to the network's now-defunct online shopping site, the set was chosen to harken {{to the experience of}} purchasing an entire album [...] "because <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> you liked at least one song." ...|$|E
500|$|Andy Battaglia {{compared}} {{the feeling of}} the music to the online virtual world Second Life, the city-building game SimCity, and the work of experimental filmmaker Ryan Trecartin. Adam Harper of Dummy called it a [...] "pastiche [...] a kind of music you never knew <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> existed: techno-capitalist stock promotional music for the era of the personal computer ... Each track is bristling with the maximalist promise of a world of possibilities waiting behind the screen for your double-click, and evokes a time when we were much less familiar with and cynical about the virtual world technology has brought us into." ...|$|E

500|$|Yet while hip-hop artists {{continue}} {{to draw upon}} this template for album production, the practice has earned some criticism. In an article titled, [...] "How Nas' [...] "Illmatic" [...] Ruined Hip-Hop," [...] Insanul Ahmed of Complex argues that one [...] "unintended consequence" [...] of Illmatic was the overall decline in the cohesion and quality of rap albums: [...] "Next thing <b>you</b> <b>knew,</b> rap albums started having a different producer for every song. And like a film that has a different director for every scene, albums became unfocused affairs. This also meant that producers weren’t tied to artists anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The result kept Burton in {{the lead}} in the Drivers' Championship. After the race, Jeff Gordon (who was {{involved}} in the lap-137 accident) was less optimistic about his championship chances: [...] "This pretty much does it for us as far as I'm concerned for the championship. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> exactly that something like that was going to happen." [...] In the Manufacturers' Championship Chevrolet increased its point total to 231; Dodge moved into second place with 180 and Ford was a close third with 179. The race took three hours, ten minutes and twenty-three seconds to complete; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E
500|$|Irene Kacandes, {{professor}} of German Studies and Comparative Literature at Dartmouth College, calls Rosa's internal monologues apostrophes, or [...] "intrapsychic witnessing", in which [...] "a character {{witnesses to the}} self about the character's own experience". Kacandes points out that Rosa believes {{she would not be}} able to internalise anything if she knew someone was listening. In an apostrophe addressed to Conrad, Rosa remarks, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> I was talking to you I wouldn't be able to talk". But because Rosa is not vocalising her monologues, no one can hear her, and she is able to proceed with her self-analysis unhindered. Kacandes says [...] "Rosa imagines an interlocutor and then occupies that place herself." ...|$|E

[...] But they did not? [...] "No, {{not all of them}} did. In fact, some were invented from almost the beginning to almost the end." [...] The Rebbe leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger: That means you are writing lies! I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defense. Yet, I had to justify myself: [...] "Things are not that simple, Rebbe. Some events do take place but are not true; others are—although they never occurred." ...|$|E
500|$|The ad was {{conceived}} {{by the agency}} Wieden+Kennedy. Copywriters Derek Barnes and Paul Renner were in a shopping mall when they noticed many of the youths around them wearing Air Jordan shoes, despite Jordan having retired in 2003: [...] "Just one look around the food court, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> kids still waved his flag." [...] The creative directors were Kevin Proudfoot and Todd Waterbury. Waterbury explained, [...] "We thought {{of the fact that}} a version of him is alive in everyone that loves basketball. And there are moments in Jordan's career where you just say the move, or the game, and people who love the man, and love the sport, immediately can imagine that scene. Here, we were just taking advantage of those incredible moments." ...|$|E
500|$|Grohl {{has said}} that Cobain told him, [...] "Music comes first and lyrics come second," [...] and Grohl {{believes}} that above all Cobain focused on the melodies of his songs. Cobain was still working on the album's lyrics well into the recording of Nevermind. Additionally, Cobain's phrasing on the album {{is often difficult to}} understand. Vig asserted that clarity of Cobain's singing was not paramount. Vig said, [...] "Even though you couldn't quite tell what he was singing about, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> it was intense as hell." [...] Cobain would later complain when rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics, writing [...] "Why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a second-rate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics, when 90 percent of the time they've transcribed them incorrectly?" ...|$|E
