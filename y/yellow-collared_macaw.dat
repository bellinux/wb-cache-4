50|$|Affectionate, and {{somewhat}} mischievous, the <b>yellow-collared</b> <b>macaw</b> {{has a reputation}} for being an intelligent and resourceful little parrot. They thrive on attention from their owners, and like other macaws, will seek that attention by any means necessary. They also require a large cage with many toys because they get bored easily. They can have a fairly extensive vocabulary. They can be very affectionate but unpredictable with children. This bird has been known to get aggressive without attention.|$|E
