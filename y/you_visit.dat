25|$|The Clan Ranald {{is one of}} {{the most}} tragic and unique shipwrecks in Australian waters. It {{represents}} one of the worst shipwrecks in Australian history with a massive loss of life. Combined with the grave sites of the officers and the crew in the nearby Edithburgh Cemetery, the Clan Ranald is a somber reminder of a huge tragedy. For this reason, the wreck site and the event itself is very important to the community of the lower Yorke Peninsula, not only because of the disastrous loss of life, but also because they played a major role in aiding the survivors. Even to this day, if <b>you</b> <b>visit</b> the graves, there are fresh flowers near the headstones.|$|E

In 2001, The Portland Mercury called the club [...] "a must-visit for any true strip club connoisseur" [...] for {{offering}} [...] "friendliness and sexiness". A reporter found the interior [...] "cozy", with conversational dancers who seemed to enjoy their interaction with guests. After Keller's death, Willamette Week said that the club [...] "has cemented its place in history far beyond the city limits" [...] for featuring Love and Jorgensen and offering nudity to a loyal customer base. The newspaper's Mary Christmas wrote that Keller had become a [...] "regional celebrity" [...] and could be credited with beginning a local industry. In 2011, a contributor to the Daily Vanguard (Portland State University's student newspaper) included Mary's on his list of the city's top five strip clubs: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>visit</b> only one dance club in this town it should probably be Mary’s. The inside is stuffy and sleazy, but embodies that red-light district feel that fits right in with [...] rowdy environment." [...] That year, Willamette Week called the club [...] "the undisputed grande dame of West Coast strips" [...] and [...] "a stubbornly degenerate landmark". According to the newspaper's Matthew Korfhage, its entertainment {{came in the form of}} [...] "girls/ladies, friendly also brassy, oddly classy, with sterling taste on the juke, who let you see all of their piercings and tattoos. Also, video poker". In 2013, Portland Monthly made Mary's Club an [...] "editor's pick" [...] for its dancers, its all-female staff, and its [...] "welcoming and relaxed" [...] environment. Thrillist.com included Mary's in its [...] "definitive guide" [...] to Portland's best strip clubs, complimenting its [...] "glorious flashing sign that welcomes you to Downtown" [...] and calling the club [...] "a part of Portland's past we should all cherish". Men's Fitness included Mary's on its list of the [...] "Top 10 Best Strip Clubs in America", calling it a [...] "neon landmark" [...] with blacklight murals and a [...] "relaxed, hole-in-the-wall vibe".|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{destinations}} within Second Life which {{are dedicated to}} those who enjoy role-playing. Some of these are sexual in nature, while others focus on themes such as fantasy, history, science fiction, or other subjects. Many {{of these types of}} worlds have very specific sets of rules that each avatar who visits is expected to follow. [...] Such rules can include things such as a dress code, a code of behavior, and world guidelines. If these rules are not followed, the avatar can be booted from the world by a game administrator. One example of one of these role-playing worlds is [...] "The Realm of Valahari". [...] This particular world takes place in a fantasy medieval setting. [...] In order to exist within that world, your avatar must be dressed in fantasy or medieval attire. [...] In case your avatar does not already own such clothing, the world provides clothing shops for you in an area which <b>you</b> <b>visit</b> before you actually enter the world. However, none of these clothing shops provide free items; all of them cost Linden Dollars (L$). Within the world, everyone is also expected to maintain the role-playing atmosphere. [...] Anyone who is using [...] "regular" [...] or [...] "everyday" [...] language tends to be frowned upon and seen as an outsider by {{the other members of the}} Realm. [...] "Regular" [...] language is to be kept in private chat windows, so that the fantasy/medieval atmosphere is not polluted by it.|$|E
