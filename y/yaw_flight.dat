40|$|A l/ 4 -scale {{dynamically}} similar {{model of}} the XFV- 1 airplane has been flown in the Ames 40 - by 80 -foot wind tunnel, using the trailing flight-cable technique. This investigation was devoted to establishing the flight characteristics of the model in forward flight from hovering to wing stall, and in <b>yawed</b> <b>flight</b> (wing span alined with the relative wind) from hovering to the maximum speed at which controlled flight could be maintained. Landings, take-offs, and hovering characteristics in flights {{close to the ground}} were also investigated [...] Since the remote control system for the model was rather complicated and provided artificial damping about the pitch, roll, and yaw axes, sufficient data from the control-system calibration tests are included in this report to specify the performance of the control system in relation to both the model flight tests and the design of an automatic control system for the full-scale airplane. The model in hovering flight appeared to be neutrally stable. The response of the model to the controls was very rapid, and it was always necessary to provide some amount of artificial damping to maintain control. The model could be landed with little difficulty by hovering approximately a foot above the floor and then cutting the power. Take-offs were more difficult to perform, primarily because the rate of change in power to the model motors was limited by the characteristics of the available power source. The model was,capable of controlled <b>yawed</b> <b>flight</b> at translational velocities up to and including 20 feet per second. The effectiveness of the controls decreased with increasing speed, however, and at 25 fps control in pitch, and probably roll, was lost completely. The model was flown in controlled forward flight from hovering up to 70 fps. During these flights the model appeared to be more difficult to control in yaw than it was in pitch or roll. The flights of the model were recorded by motion picture cameras. These motion pictures are available on loan from NACA Headquarters as a film supplement to this report...|$|R

40|$|The F/A- 18 A {{aircraft}} {{has experienced}} engine stalls at high angles-of-attack and <b>yaw</b> <b>flight</b> conditions which were outside of its flight envelope. Future aircraft may {{be designed to}} operate routinely in this flight regime. Therefore, {{it is essential that}} an understanding of the inlet flow field at these flight conditions be obtained. Due to the complex interactions of the fuselage and inlet flow fields, a study of the flow within the inlet must also include external effects. Full Navier-Stokes (FNS) calculations on the F/A- 18 A High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) inlet for several angles-of-attack with sideslip and free stream Mach numbers have been obtained. The predicted forebody/fuselage surface static pressures agreed well with flight data. The surface static pressures along the inlet lip are in good agreement with the numerical predictions. The major departure in agreement is along the bottom of the lip at 30 deg and 60 deg angle-of-attack where a possible streamwise flow separation is not being predicted by the code. The circumferential pressure distributions at the engine face are in very good agreement with the numerical results. The variation in surface static pressure in the circumferential direction is very small with the exception of 60 angle-of-attack. Although the simulation does not include the effect of the engine, it appears that this omission has a second order effect on the circumferential pressure distribution. An examination of the unsteady flight test data base has shown that the secondary vortex migrates a significant distance with time. In fact, the extent of this migration increases with angle-of-attack with increasing levels of distortion. The effects of the engine on this vortex movement is unknown. This implies that the level of flow unsteadiness increases with increasing distortion. Since the computational results represent an asymptotic solution driven by steady boundary conditions, these numerical results may represent an arbitrary point in time. A comparison of the predicted total pressure contours with flight data indicates that the numerical results are within the excursion range of the unsteady data which is the best the calculations can attain unless an unsteady simulation is performed...|$|E

The model was tested in the NPS Low Speed Wind Tunnel to measure the drag force on {{the main body of the}} model at wind tunnel velocities up to 72 knots.

The method starts by computing a multiscale dense optical flow field, {{which is used}} to segment the wings, i. e., pixels with larger velocities. Then, the kinematic and deformation of the wings were characterized as a temporal set of global and local measures: a global angular acceleration as a time function of each wing and a local acceleration profile that approximates the dynamics of the different wing segments. Additionally, the variance of the apparent velocity orientation estimates those wing foci with larger deformation. Finally a local measure of the orientation highlights those regions with maximal deformation. The approach was evaluated in a total of 91 flight cycles, captured using three different setups. The proposed measures follow the <b>yaw</b> turn hummingbird <b>flight</b> dynamics, with a strong correlation of all computed paths, reporting a standard deviation of 0. 31 rad/f rame 2 and 1. 9 (rad/f rame) 2 for the global angular acceleration and the global wing deformation respectively...|$|R

During normal cruise the outer wing panels of Helios are arched upward and give the aircraft the shape of a shallow crescent when viewed from the front or rear. This configuration places the motors on the outer wing panels higher than the motors on the center panels. Speeding up the outer-panel motors caused the aircraft to pitch down and begin a descent.

40|$|Tapejara wellnhoferi, a small azhdarchoid pterodactyloid {{from the}} Early Cretaceous Santana Formation of Brazil, {{provides}} critical {{information about the}} aerodynamic function of its spectacular head crest. The cranial crests in pterodactyloids were sexually dimorphic and {{are thought to have}} evolved in adult males in response to female mate choice. However, the location of cranial crests in front of the center of gravity would create instability in the <b>yaw</b> axis during <b>flight</b> and may seem like a handicap.

The investigation consisted of hovering flights in still air at a considerable height above the ground, hovering flights very close to the ground, vertical take-offs and landings, flights through the transition range from hovering to normal forward flight, and sideways translational flights. The model could be flown smoothly and easily in hovering flight {{despite the fact that the}} uncontrolled pitching and yawing motions were unstable oscillations.

40|$|Modern Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) {{technology}} {{has a number}} of limitations and one of these is vehicle manoeuvrability. Conventional flight style AUVs generally have turning circle diameters of five or more vehicle lengths, but most marine animals can turn in under one body length. This shows there is merit in looking at marine animals for inspiration to improve the manoeuvrability of AUVs. Aquatic flight propulsion is one marine animal propulsion strategy that was identified early in the research as having the potential to full fill this role. Aquatic flight propulsion has been studied experimentally in the past, but most of the past research focused in one or two axis aquatic flight (foil pitch and dorsoventral roll). However, marine animal literatures show animal aquatic flight is a three axis problem and there is an additional motion component in anteroposterior yaw. The effect of this yaw motion is not well understood and this will be the focus of this thesis’s research. The effect of aquatic <b>flight</b> <b>yaw</b> motion is investigated using a combination of computation modelling and experimental studies. It found two-axis aquatic flight is better for producing propulsive thrust for most scenarios, but three-axis aquatic flight is useful for producing additional off axis force. In particular, the three axis slanted foil actuation path can produce a sizeable vertical force with very little change to the horizontal thrust coefficient, which would be very useful for a positively buoyant AUV to control its depth. The experiment verified the model’s results and many of the experiment data points were within 30 % of the model prediction. The experiment has a relatively large uncertainty due to turbulences in the recirculating water channel, so 30 % is a reasonably good fit. Whilst there is room for improvement for both the model and the experiment, the current model is sufficient to produce provisional estimates for actuator and control system design as well as identification of various cases of interest for further in depth analysis. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the search}} for {{parameters}} to predict motion sickness that {{can be measured in}} the laboratory, we performed a longitudinal investigation in aviators. Since the vestibular system is involved in the generation of motion sickness as well as eye movements, vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) parameters seemed relevant. We investigated three topics: 1) the effect of axis orientation and its orientation to gravity on the VOR; 2) changes in VOR parameters depending on flight experience; and 3) differences in VOR parameters in aircrew with high and low susceptibility to motion sickness. Hypothesis: Nystagmus decay after angular velocity steps would be faster for non-susceptible and trained aviators. Methods: We recorded eye movements evoked by angular on-axis velocity steps (± 90 ° · s- 2, to and from 90 ° · s- 1) in yaw, pitch, and roll, about both the Earth vertical and Earth horizontal axes in 14 subjects with a low susceptibility to motion sickness. These data were compared with those of 10 subjects with a high susceptibility. Results: Horizontal axis rotations are nauseogenic. We found that during (per) and post-condition, left- and rightward rotation responses were equal, and the orientation with respect to gravity did not alter the basic nystagmus decay, apart from a sinusoidal modulation. Moreover, pitch and roll rotations show equal nystagmus decays, significantly faster than for yaw; yaw and pitch peak velocities were equal and were larger than for roll. With regard to changes in VOR parameters depending on flight experience, we found that repeated vestibular stimulation reduced nystagmus decay as well as the otolith modulation. With respect to the changes in VOR parameters and motion sickness susceptibility, we found that subjects highly susceptible to motion sickness showed a slower decay of nystagmus with a larger peak velocity than less susceptible subjects. Conclusions: Group averages indicate a difference in eye movement parameters, only in <b>yaw,</b> depending on <b>flight</b> experience; and between subjects with low and high susceptibility to motion sickness. The involvement of the velocity storage mechanism as realized by an internal model is given as a plausible explanation...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of a 1 / 7 -scale powered model of the Kaiser Fleetwing all-wing airplane {{was made in the}} Langley full-scale tunnel to provide data for an estimation of the flying qualities of the airplane. The analysis of the stability and control characteristics of the airplane has been made as closely as possible in accordance with the requirements of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department's specifications, and a summary of the more significant conclusions is presented as follows. With the normal center of gravity located at 20 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord, the airplane will have adequate static longitudinal stability, elevator fixed, for all flight conditions except for low-power operation at low speeds where the stability will be about neutral. There will not be sufficient down-elevator deflection available for trim above speeds of about 130 miles per hour. It is probable that the reduction in the up-elevator deflections required for trim will be accompanied by reduced elevator hinge moments for low-power operation at low flight speeds. The static directional stability for this airplane will be low for all rudder-fixed or rudder-free flight conditions. The maximum rudder deflection of 30 deg will trim only about 15 deg <b>yaw</b> for most <b>flight</b> conditions and only 10 deg yaw for the condition with low power at low speeds. Also, at low powers and low speeds, it is estimated that the rudders will not trim the total adverse yaw resulting from an abrupt aileron roll using maximum aileron deflection. The airplane will meet the requirements for stability and control for asymmetric power operation with one outboard engine inoperative. The airplane would have no tendency for directional divergence but would probably be spirally unstable, with rudders fixed. The static lateral stability of the airplane will probably be about neutral for the high-speed flight conditions and will be only slightly increased for the low-power operation in low-speed flight. The airplane will not roll against the ailerons in a side-slip maneuver. Although the airplane would probably meet the minimum requirements of pb/ 2 V of 0. 07 at all speeds, there will be a loss in rolling ability of the airplane at high aileron deflections and at low flight speeds. It is estimated that the wing stall will be a gradual movement forward from the trailing edge and will be accompanied by no sudden pitching or rolling accelerations. Some stall warning may be indicated by reduction in the elevator and aileron force gradients and by the shaking of the controls caused by unsteady flow over the surfaces near the stall...|$|R

Bu gözlemlerden hareketle, öngörüldüğü gibi, doğrusal olmayan hareket denklemlerinden belirli varsayımlar ile türetilen doğrusal durum denklemlerinin belirli bir hataya sebebiyet verdiği belirlenmiş ve bu hata miktarı ortaya konulmuştur. Çalışmanın devamında, uzunlamasına ve yanlamasına hareket için LQR, PID ve iç-dış çevrim, durum geri besleme kontrolcüleri ile referans girişe karşılık gelen cevap gözlenmiş, karşılaştırılmış ve gerekli eyleyici girişleri, maksimum ve minimum limitleri göz önüne alınmış ve uçuş otonomlaştırılmıştır. Bu bölüme kadar uçuşun belirli bir kondisyonda gerçekleştirildiği varsayımı ile hareket edilmiştir. Gerçekleştirilen tasarımlar da nominal ölçütlerde düşünülmüştür. Ancak uçak kararlılık türevlerinin uçuş kondisyonuna bağlı olarak değiştiği bilinmektedir. Gerçekleştirilen simülasyonlarla da bu kararlılık türevlerinin uçağı kararsızlaştırabilecek etkilerde bulunabileceği gözlemlenmiştir. Buradan hareketle dayanıklı (robust) bir kontrolcü tasarımı gereksinimi saptanmıştır. Kayma kipli kontrolcü ve dayanıklı PID kontrolcü tasarımları gerçekleştirilmiştir. Bu tasarımların parametrik belirsizliklere ve bozuntulara rağmen kararlı davranış sergilediği görülmüştür. In {{the last}} decades, making {{unmanned}} air vehicle autonomous has gained highly {{importance in the}} point of controlling flight modes especially for fighter aircrafts. From this point, observing and developing of flight maneuver abilities necessity have emerged. On the other hand, precision and effectiveness of developed techniques is very important. In this regard, response of flight modes to actuator inputs for both non-linear and linearized flight equations is a valuable research subject which is worked on in the thesis. The validity of linearized equations is discussed and presented the area which can be accepted to lead these linearized equations. Other important subject is to achieve maneuver abilities {{in the form of}} desired input. Controller design which would provide possible maneuver tasks to the fighter aircrafts on the time of mission is an inevitable necessity. The purpose of maneuver planning and making autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV’s) because of flight missions and requirements is in dense in the thesis. All the referred tasks cause some analysis on the field of control engineering. Effects of actuator inputs on flight modes of UCAV’s have been examined and designed PID, Inner loop-Outer loop, Pole Placement and LQR controller techniques. For this sequence, at the beginning, aircraft’s six degree of freedom non-linear dynamic equations have been created. Once non-linear equations, the linearized model is derived from non-linear equations with some assumptions. Defined actuator inputs have effects on state variable of the aircraft. Both non-linear and linear equations bring solution to actuator inputs. From the simulations results, although the same reference input manage the system, linear equations lead some error for the certain flight conditions. On the next step, linearized model is divided by two separated flight which named longitudinal and lateral flights. With the control designs PID, Inner loop-Outer loop, Pole Placement and LQR, response to reference input (desired output) is obtained for the both longitudinal and lateral flights with the allowance of physical limits of actuator mechanisms. Linear model is said to be derived by some assumption. These assumptions include constant stability derivative. But in real flight, stability derivatives are variable parameters and change of at least one state variable would change other derivative values. This fact requires robust stability analysis within the limits of stability derivatives and a robust controller design is an obligation to guarantee stability of aircraft. Main forces which have effects on flight dynamics are classified as aerodynamic forces, thrust force and aircraft weight. By taking consideration of these forces and with the regard of Newton law, we obtain six degree of freedom non-linear equations of aircraft. From this point for the linearization purpose of equations, state variables are classified into longitudinal and lateral flight. So, effects of state variables on each others are cancel out and two separated flights are proceeded. The other assumption is that flight is around a certain trim point and deviations from trim point are not that important to change flight condition and stability derivatives. The other assumption is separating elevator and thrust effects as longitudinal flight inputs and aileron and rudder effects as lateral flight inputs. This means that both linearized systems have multiple inputs. Subsequent assumption is to set beginning rotational rates to zero. So pitch, roll and yaw rates are zero origins. Additionally, roll and yaw angle are zeros as well. Further assumption is the small degree and high perturbations. With all the assumption and defined flight conditions linear model has constructed. The work should be done after that step is to carry out the linear equations to state space model. The aim of this model is to construct a first order differential equation with A system matrix, B input matrix, C output matrix and D feed through matrix. The state space model will help to transition to transfer functions of input-to-output with the Cramer rule and ease the simulation modeling. System variables are chosen among the energy absorbing variables. After eigenvalue investigation and simulation results, it is decided that, in longitudinal flight, all the poles are at the left side of s-plane, so system is stable but there are two poles very close to origin which are needed to be damped faster. 1 degree deflection of elevator input is observed and its causes are negative pitch moment and increment in speed for the steady flight. Thrust increment causes augmentation for speed in short term but in long term its effect is pitch up moment. Simulation results have proved that the aircraft has short term and long term oscillation which must be controlled. In lateral flight 4 roots represent 3 different flight modes. 2 complex conjugate roots represent dutch-roll mode which is defined by the action both rolling and yawing modes, third root represents rolling mode and finally fourth root represents spiral mode. Aileron deflection changes lift forces of two wings in different directions and generate roll moment and additionally it has yawing moment contribution. So dutch-roll mode appears by the side effects. Rudder deflection causes mostly yawing moment but also generates roll moment because of the location of the rudder. The results from analysis and simulations are the needs of a controller design for the stabilization of unstable modes and fast response. Governing the non-linear equations is quite different apart from the linear one. Since the change in control surfaces and state variable situations would change the stability derivative, system may be destabilized. Stability derivatives are defined as functions of high and mach number, so a more complex stability analysis will be required. Comparison of non-linear and linear equations solution includes some basic methods. One is to keep the control surfaces deflected quite short time and small values. By this way stability derivatives will not change highly and response will be very close to linear solution. The other one is the contrarily deflection and response will be very different. This kind of solution would show the validity limits of linear solution. Controller need has been fulfilled by different methods. For the constant parameters using linear model optimal control, modern control and a control theory which is common in aeronautic field named inner loop-outer loop control have been conducted. Linear model which has variable stability derivatives need robust control. Robust stability analysis is also worked on. PID controller which is frequently used for the dynamical systems control and has a wide application area is known its easy design and proper response to systems needs. Direct output feedback and calculated or estimated proportional, integral and derivative constants are sufficient simulation requirements to design this system. Inner loop-outer loop controller is a little bit more complicated than PID controller. Manipulation of longitudinal flight modes with inner loop-outer loop controller design, two flight’s modes will be examined as SISO systems and defined feedback and feed-forward constants. After stabilization the modes system will be converted to MIMO system and output states will be stable and equal to reference input. For the pitch angle, firstly pitch rate is defined as output state. Gyroscope coefficient can be sought by observing root locus as elevator to be input. Pitch rate is now stabilized, next step would be seeking feedback constant of outer loop which will converge the pitch angle to reference input. Loop for speed is provided by throttle input, feedback function is chosen by derivative and proportional constants and loop is completed. Moreover, a feed-forward amplifier using decrements overshoot and shortens peak and settling time. Inner loop-outer loop design gives satisfactory response for longitudinal flight. In inner loop-outer loop control design of lateral <b>flight,</b> <b>yaw</b> angle would be tried to be equal to reference input. For this purpose, firstly steady state value of yaw rate would be equal to zero. Nextly, sliding angle would be minimized by feedback of the mode. Lastly, Aileron input is represented as inner and outer loop feedback of yaw and roll rates. Simulation results shows that such a design worked on achieve to keep pitch angle and speed at desired output. In lateral flight, by inner loop yaw rate is set to zero and by outer loop sliging angle is set to desired output. Additionally, roll rate is set to zero for the stabilization purpose of roll angle. All the required feedback and feed-forward coefficients are found from root locus graphs. Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is a controller to guarantee asymptotic stability. Riccati equation solution would define state feedback matrix. In order to find proper feedback matrix which provide asymptotic stability some rules must be followed like choice of Q and R matrix. The choice of Q and R matrices would directly affect output matrices, so weight of every element of these matrices should be carefully examined. Pole placement technique is a subject of modern control theory which require to be fully controllable and observable systems to apply the theory. In the case of unobservable system, control system needs an observer to estimate unmeasurable modes of flight. The main purpose of this design is to place the roots to desired points at the s-plane by using state feedback to the input device. That is why all the states need to be known or estimated. In the case of observer use, observer dynamics must be faster than aircraft dynamics, in other words observer roots must be placed to the left side of system roots to estimate the state variables faster than the dynamic system. Until this part of the thesis, it is assumed that the flight is operated in a certain condition. The realized desings is thought in nominal cases. But, {{it is a fact that}} stability derivatives are changeable depending on flight condition. Simulations that are presented is showing that these stability derivatives can destabilize the aircraft. The lack of stability forces us to the design of a robust controller. Subsequently, sliding mode controller and robust PID controller designs are realized. Although parameter uncertainties and disturbances, the aircraft behaves as a stable characteristic. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
