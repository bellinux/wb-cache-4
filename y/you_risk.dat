While Dutch residents are automatically insured {{by the government}} for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If you don't take out insurance, <b>you</b> <b>risk</b> a fine. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone {{over the age of}} 18 years, regardless of age or state of health – it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.|$|E

[...] Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave it 3 out of 5, while commenting, [...] "Agneepath, less of a remake, more of a tribute. The makers of Agneepath should have just called it Dharmapath." [...] Kunal Guha of Yahoo.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying that, [...] "The biggest dilemma of remaking a movie is how much to retain and what to retain. If the new story takes violent shifts, you lose the {{audience}} who came to revisit the original. If you photocopy scene-by-scene, <b>you</b> <b>risk</b> failing to connect with the audience who is accustomed to present sensibilities. The only safe bet: a ‘khichdi’ of the past and the present, like this one." ...|$|E

500|$|Usually {{described}} as a drama or a thriller, Flame & Citron can also be classified as a historical drama, a war film, a war drama (or a war thriller) and a gangster drama.

Lodge stated it has [...] "stately middle-arthouse stylings and thriller overtones". Walter Addiego of SFGate commented that it [...] "has the look, and sometimes the pacing, of a serious Hollywood picture, but it has an art-house mood". Nick Roddick of the London Evening Standard commented that [...] "it could succumb to the Sod's Law of foreign-language cinema: make a arthouse movie too commercial and <b>you</b> <b>risk</b> losing both audiences." [...] Abeel opined, [...] "This icy portrait of two assassins shooting Nazis point-blank offers no Hollywood-style uplift to mollify mainstream viewers. But Flame [...] should pull in a niche group of World WarII connoisseurs and will delight art-house and fest audiences with its innovative mix of drama and history filtered through genre." ...|$|E
