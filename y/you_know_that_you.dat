This, at least, proves what a cataclysmic misjudgement Curtis had made. When you try to satirise the critics of your campaign, {{and it turns out}} that those very critics embrace your film as demonstrating exactly what they find {{unbearable}} about the climate-obsessed eco-lobby, then <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have kicked the ball into your own net".|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Within You Without You", [...] "The Inner Light" [...] was {{the second}} {{composition}} to fully reflect Harrison's immersion in Eastern spiritual concepts, particularly meditation, an interest that had spread to his Beatles bandmates and to the group's audience and peers. The lyrics espouse meditation {{as a means to}} genuine understanding. Theologian Dale Allison describes the song as a [...] "hymn" [...] to quietism and comments that, in their attempt to [...] "relativize and disparage knowledge of the external world", the words convey Harrison's enduring worldview. Author John Winn notes that Harrison had pre-empted the message of [...] "The Inner Light" [...] in an August 1967 interview, when he told New York DJ Murray Kaufman: [...] "The more you learn, the more <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't know anything at all." [...] Writing in his study of Harrison's musical career, Ian Inglis similarly identifies a precedent in the song [...] "It's All Too Much", where Harrison sings: [...] "The more I learn, the less I know." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically {{the track}} is written about a failing {{relationship}} {{caused by a}} partner who abuses alcohol. The singer speaks {{of a man who}} faces a disconnect between his personality while drunk and sober, causing the inability to forge a connection. During the second verse Gomez sings [...] "Why is it so different when we wake up? / Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch / Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do it just enough, but not enough / But I know what's next, and I want so much", describing a lover who can only show his true emotions while intoxicated. Later in the song she expresses the pain she feels having wasted so much time into her relationship, and decides to leave her dysfunctional lover: [...] "You've got a hold on me / You're like a wasted dream / I gave you everything / But you don't know how to love me when you're sober".|$|E

2500|$|Decompression is an {{area where}} you {{discover}} that, the more you learn, the more <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> really don't know what is going on. For behind the [...] "black-and-white" [...] exactness of table entries, the second-by-second countdowns of dive computers, and beneath the mathematical purity of decompression models, lurks a dark and mysterious physiological jungle that has barely been explored.|$|E

The public took it for granted, Maria was startled: [...] "Nicholas, what have you done? Didn't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are heir presumptive?" [...] The oath sparked an unprecedented dynastic crisis: two principal contenders forfeited their rights in favor {{of each other in}} [...] "a hitherto unheard-of struggle â€” a struggle not for the acquisition of power, but for its renunciation!". The throne remained vacant.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Lopez, journalist Diane Sawyer of ABC News noted that people [...] "in the abuse counseling industry, have said you can't tell women that, they can't do that. That something that's dangerous, even {{to see it in}} their minds." [...] Lopez responded by stating: [...] "Well, you know, this is a movie that has the touches upon those themes, but really, it's a thriller [...] it's about empowering yourself in any situation, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have. When I read the script, I saw it as, you have the power within yourself, no matter how severe the situation can be, to change whatever that is, to find that power within yourself to change any negative situation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you sit?" [...] he continued. [...] "To speak truth, the Annapolis packet came in {{last night}} with news for <b>you.</b> <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have not had time to hear from Maryland, I sent for you." ...|$|R
