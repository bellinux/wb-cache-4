500|$|The Alden Tavern is {{well known}} for being the site of the horsewhipping of a captive General Richard Prescott, {{commander}} of the British troops of Rhode Island, by the tavern's owner Captain Alden. Several days after Prescott's capture, he was escorted to General George Washington's headquarters, but on the trip came to dine at Alden's tavern. Several books detail different accounts and portrayals of the exchanges which led to Prescott's whipping, all involving the Prescott being served [...] "the common dish of corn and beans" [...] and throwing the food on the floor. Three of Benson Lossing's books recount this tale, in The Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution Volume 1 (1852), Our Countrymen (1855) and Lives of Celebrated Americans: Comprising Biographies of Three Hundred and Forty Eminent Persons (1869). It also appears in similar wording in The Boys of '76: A History of the Battles of the Revolution by Charles Coffin in 1876, with Prescott's line being: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> pigs' feed". The story has persisted and a fictional account was referenced in 2010 in Martha Finley's Elsie Yachting with the Raymonds.|$|E
2500|$|Obama's win in Iowa {{was seen}} as a boost to his already-improving chances in New Hampshire. On January 4, he told {{supporters}} in New Hampshire, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> same chance that Iowa gave me last night I truly believe that I will be the president of the United States of America." [...] The campaign received another boost when former New Jersey senator and 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley endorsed Obama on January 6. At the Democratic debate at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire, on January 5, Obama, Clinton, and Edwards all battled over who best exemplified the buzzword of the campaign, [...] "change". In one key exchange, Clinton said, clearly targeting Obama's rhetorical prowess, [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. ... We don't need to be raising false hopes." [...] Obama replied that [...] "The truth is, actually, words do inspire. Words do help people get involved." ...|$|E

I've but put them together. <b>You</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> Brissendens--bound hand and foot; and I've but made them, in that sorry state, pull me through. I've blown on my torch, in other words, till, flaring and smoking, it has guided me, through a {{magnificent}} chiaroscuro of colour and shadow, out into the light of day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was {{a pretty}} good list <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> other day, Wingate," [...] he remarked, [...] "You've made money. You're making it still." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{sick with}} your [...] "Fital Card", you do! I'm goin' 'ome.' And she left Sally {{in the midst}} of her explanation.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{your life}} which is in question, not my eyesight," [...] he muttered. [...] "Do you accept my offer? Will <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> document?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] said Douglas, hastily {{putting down}} {{his hat and}} {{advancing}} a step. [...] "You cannot plead misunderstanding now. Can <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> assurance I seek?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was also}} one thing," [...] she remarked, looking at him intently, [...] "which I {{intended}} to ask <b>you,</b> provided <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> opportunity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your letters wouldn't be {{interesting}} if <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> Equity news; {{but they would}} if you left it out. Then you'd have to write about yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} that fiver <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> time I didn't have carfare? Well, there it is, with ninety-nine brothers {{of different ages}} {{but all of the}} same size." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] said Dean significantly; [...] "you {{need not}} recall that just now. Can <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{name and address}} {{of the family in}} Pimlico?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Again for {{an instant}} I thought. [...] "The offer I propose to make <b>you</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> right to address you a {{question}} remarkably direct. Are you still engaged to Miss Anvoy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Always {{ready to}} learn!" [...] I said. [...] "Ever since <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> chance of Latin. So far we don't {{seem to have}} hit upon any Latin-speaking stratum in the population." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you had been, {{would you}} have pretended to {{recognise}} me upstairs just now? I tell you, pal, I was all in for a second, till <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> high sign." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am a {{creature}} of habit, Mr. Thain," [...] he said. [...] "At twelve o'clock I walk for {{an hour in the}} Park. Will <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> honour of your company?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> time?" [...] {{said the}} sergeant, {{addressing}} himself to Mr. Pumblechook, as {{to a man}} whose appreciative powers justified the inference that he was equal to the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> choice, sir, I {{would rather}} rejoin the regiment. Staff duty in war time is {{extremely}} interesting; but in peace time, I {{would rather be}} at work with the regiment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{he said at}} length, [...] "you needn't talk if you'd sooner not. But <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> cut direct in Adexe, and {{although}} I may have deserved it, it hurt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> idea," [...] {{interrupted}} Harris again. [...] "You {{know you}} said it was a mistake for a man to get into a groove, and that unbroken domesticity cloyed the brain." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah! dear, don't believe it," [...] {{he went on}} earnestly. [...] "There isn't any bond {{so strong}} that I won't break it for you, no knot I won't untie, if <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I have, but I'm scared {{just the}} same," [...] said the Lion. [...] "I shall really be very unhappy unless <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think you}} will be able to help your father and George better if you are my wife. I'm afraid your {{position}} will be very difficult. Won't <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> great happiness of helping you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{returned}} {{together to}} the palace. [...] "Why, Lionel," [...] said Adrian, [...] "what did you intend? {{you could not}} hope to conquer, and yet <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> pain of a triumph over my dearest friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Working finely," [...] {{answered}} the Scarecrow. [...] "I'm very certain, Oz, that <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> best brains in the world, for I can think with them day and night, when all other brains are fast asleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I've {{misunderstood}} you," [...] he said. [...] "There's a catch {{somewhere and}} I haven't seen it. But {{for a moment}} <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> impression that <b>you</b> had promised to marry some man on the boat!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{wish you}} to come if you don't want to," [...] replied Jones; [...] "you can stop here till doomsday for me. But do you suppose I'd come here for the mere {{amusement}} of hearing <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> lie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to trouble you, sir," [...] Tavernake said, [...] "but I heard your {{announcement}} just now from the front. Can <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> address of Professor Franklin? I am a friend, and I should like {{to go and see}} them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I thought, when <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> book, {{it was to}} be an {{adventure}} like mine, not all standing still in an old river. What do you think Hubert Delrio ought to do after persuading me into such an awful predicament?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} I want, and you, too, {{by the look}} of you," [...] he continued--"a beefsteak, with some more of that green corn <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> other day, and fried potatoes, and Burgundy. We'll have some oysters first while we wait." ...|$|R
