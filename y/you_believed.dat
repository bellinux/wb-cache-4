Rita wrote in her diary: [...] "You have died for what <b>you</b> <b>believed</b> in, but without you, I too am dead." [...] A week later Rita locked herself into the apartment and wrote a note, which said: [...] "I am devastated by the killing of Judge Borsellino. Now there's no one to protect me, I'm scared and I can't take it any more." [...] Then she threw herself out of the window.|$|E
2500|$|Bassoonist/multireedist James Jacson {{had studied}} Zen Buddhism before joining Sun Ra and {{identified}} strong similarities between Zen teachings and practices (particularly Zen koans) and Ra's use of non sequiturs and seemingly absurd replies to questions.

Drummer Andrew Cyrille said Sun Ra's comments were [...] "very interesting stuff... whether <b>you</b> <b>believed</b> it or not.

In 2011, she appeared as Bailey Tallet in Real Steel. Despite having turned down a number of film offers, she traveled to Los Angeles to get the part after director Shawn Levy sent her the script. Levy said: [...] "She's magnificent to look at, she's soulful, and she's sexy. I needed someone who <b>you</b> <b>believed</b> {{had grown up in}} a man's world.

2500|$|By 1918, Lloyd and Roach {{had begun}} to develop his {{character}} beyond an imitation of his contemporaries. Harold Lloyd would move away from tragicomic personas, and portray an everyman with unwavering confidence and optimism. The persona Lloyd referred to as his [...] "Glass" [...] character (often named [...] "Harold" [...] in the silent films) was a much more mature comedy character with greater potential for sympathy and emotional depth, and was easy for audiences of the time to identify with. The [...] "Glass" [...] character {{is said to have}} been created after Roach suggested that Harold was too handsome to do comedy without some sort of disguise. To create his new character Lloyd donned a pair of lensless horn-rimmed eyeglasses but wore normal clothing; previously, he had worn a fake mustache and ill-fitting clothes as the Chaplinesque [...] "Lonesome Luke". [...] "When I adopted the glasses," [...] he recalled in a 1962 interview with Harry Reasoner, [...] "it more or less put me in a different category because I became a human being. He was a kid that you would meet next door, across the street, but at the same time I could still do all the crazy things that we did before, but <b>you</b> <b>believed</b> them. They were natural and the romance could be believable." [...] Unlike most silent comedy personae, [...] "Harold" [...] was never typecast to a social class, but he was always striving for success and recognition. Within the first few years of the character's debut, he had portrayed social ranks ranging from a starving vagrant in From Hand to Mouth to a wealthy socialite in Captain Kidd's Kids.|$|E
