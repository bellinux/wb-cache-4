I'd sort of be the referee, try to resolve it so that we could get back to work. So there was that side of it. Everybody knows there was {{friction}} {{between the two of them}} on the stage. In the beginning, Bruce was just a guy’s guy. Let's just say he evolved. Over the years, he went from being the crew's best friend and just being grateful for the work and all of that to realizing that he was going to be a movie star and wanting to move on. Part of that was because of his strained relationship with Cybill. That sometimes made the set a very unpleasant place to be. Cybill – I got along with her very well at times, other times I’d have to be the one who said <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out of the trailer and go to work. In fairness to her, she was in the makeup chair at six thirty in the morning with pages of dialogue she hadn’t seen before, she'd work very long hours, and then be back in the makeup chair at six thirty the next morning." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Tasmanian Archbishop Julius Porteous {{distributed}} {{a booklet}} outlining the Catholic Church's position on marriage, titled [...] "Don't mess with Marriage". It encouraged parents to lobby parliamentarians against same-sex marriage. An application {{was made by}} Martine Delaney, a Hobart transgender activist and Greens candidate, to Tasmania’s Anti-Discrimination Commission over the booklet. John Roskam, writing in the Australian Financial Review has said, [...] "A vote in a plebiscite or referendum, in which one side {{is not allowed to}} present its case, is not a legitimate vote. That's why both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage should be concerned by the complaint against Archbishop Porteous and the Catholic Church. Freedom of speech is fundamental to liberal democracy. Freedom of speech confers legitimacy on political outcomes". [...] The Anti-Discrimination Commission subsequently upheld the complaint. Senator Eric Abetz said that the church’s right to [...] "teach its flock" [...] its beliefs on marriage were being [...] "shut down". Janet Albrechtsen, writing in The Australian says, [...] "This is not one of those thorny cases of conflicting rights where <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down on one side or another. It’s not a case of either supporting same-sex marriage or supporting free speech. Here you have the luxury of both. [...] This is not about defending the Catholic bishops. The real issue is the emergence of yet another orthodoxy that is strangling free speech".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{in search of}} me, Geoffrey," [...] she said; [...] "this is Mr. Lorimer--Captain Ormond.

6000|$|... 'Isn't there!' she cried. 'Oh, isn't there? No, {{there is}} {{need for a}} great deal more. I don't {{know what you think}} I am. How much farther do you' think you can go? No, you don't like {{reminding}} of us. You sit moping, sulking, because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to your own children. I wonder how much you think I shall stand? What do you think I am, to put up with it? What do you think I am? Am I a servant to eat out of your hand?' ...|$|E
6000|$|But we didn't; {{which was}} just as well, for {{we should have been}} interrupted. Before the stones had been raging through the leaves and {{bouncing}} from the boughs fifteen minutes, we began to notice a smell. A couple of sniffs of it was enough of an explanation --it was smoke! Our game was up at last. We recognized that. When smoke invites you, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> They raised their pile of dry brush and damp weeds higher and higher, and when they saw the thick cloud begin to roll up and smother the tree, they broke out in a storm of joy-clamors.

There are two of them in it, you understand. The other one gets the gold. Never mind how, but we will hope that there is no harm. Let us suppose, for example, that they have found a marvellous mine, where you can just shovel it out like clay from a pit. Well, then, he sends it on to this one, and he has his {{furnaces}} and his chemicals, and he refines and purifies it and makes it fit to sell. That's my explanation of it, Robert. Eh, has the old man put his finger on it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mighty funny <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{out here}} and do a little of this.

60|$|The Tunnel is a {{subterranean}} passage {{under the}} Thames, {{made at a}} place where it was impossible to have a bridge, on account of the shipping. They expected, when they made the Tunnel, that it would be used a great deal by persons wishing to cross the river. But it is found, on trial, that almost every body who wishes to go across the river at that place prefers to go in a boat rather than go down into the Tunnel. The reason is, that the Tunnel is so far below the bed of the river that you have to go down a long series of flights of stairs before you get to the entrance to it; and then, after going across, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up just as many stairs before you get into the street again. This is found to be so troublesome and fatiguing that almost every one who has occasion to go across the river prefers to cross it by a ferry boat {{on the surface of the}} water; and scarcely any one goes into the Tunnel except those who wish to visit it out of curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Was you frightened, lady? Did <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in here? I'm {{sorry you}} found me swooned. I don't {{know how long}} I was swooned. Davy and me was sitting here talking about having the banns called, {{and it was a}} sorry talk, lady, for the vicar, he's told me four times I should not marry Davy, because he says he is a Radical; but for all that Davy and me wants the banns called all the same, but not knowing how we was to have it done, for the vicar, he's so set against Davy, and Davy, he had just got done saying to me {{that he was going to}} marry me, vicar or no vicar, banns or no banns, come what might, when that very minute, with an awful hiss, {{something}} flashed in front of us, dazzling my eyes so that I shut them and screamed, and then when I opened them again, there, in the yard back of us, was a great white spirit twice as high as the cow stable, with one eye in the middle of its forehead, turning around like a firework. I don't remember anything after that, and I don't know how long I was lying here when you came and found me, lady, but I know what it means. There is a curse on our marriage, and Davy and me will never be man and wife." [...] And then she fell to groaning and moaning.|$|E
60|$|Colvin, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{here and}} see us in our { native / mortal } spot. I just don't {{seem to be able}} to make up my mind to your not coming. By this time, you will have seen Graham, I hope, and he will be able to tell you {{something}} about us, and something reliable, I shall feel for the first time as if you knew a little about Samoa after that. Fanny seems to be in the right way now. I must say she is very, very well for her, and complains scarce at all. Yesterday, she went down SOLA (at least accompanied by a groom) to pay a visit; Belle, Lloyd and I went a walk up the mountain road - the great public highway of the island, where you have to go single file. The object was to show Belle that gaudy valley of the Vaisigano which the road follows. If the road is to be made and opened, as our new Chief Justice promises, it will be one of the most beautiful roads in the world. But the point is this: I forgot I had been three months in civilisation, wearing shoes and stockings, and I tell you I suffered on my soft feet; coming home, down hill, on that stairway of loose stones, I could have cried. O yes, another story, I knew I had. The house boys had not been behaving well, so the other night I announced a FONO, and Lloyd and I went into the boys' quarters, and I talked to them I suppose for half an hour, and Talolo translated; Lloyd was there principally to keep another ear on the interpreter; else there may be dreadful misconceptions. I rubbed all their ears, except two whom I particularly praised; and one man's wages I announced I had cut down by one half. Imagine his taking this smiling! Ever since, he has been specially attentive and greets me with a face of really heavenly brightness. This is another good sign of their really and fairly accepting me as a chief. When I first came here, if I had fined a man a sixpence, he would have quit work that hour, and now I remove half his income, and he is glad to stay on - nay, does not seem to entertain the possibility of leaving. And this in the face of one particular difficulty - I mean our house in the bush, and no society, and no women society within decent reach.|$|E
