500|$|Zinta {{has been}} the subject of several controversies. In 2003, as a witness in the Bharat Shah case, she testified against the Indian mafia. Bharat Shah, the financer of one of her films, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, was arrested in 2000 for having {{connections}} with Chhota Shakeel, a Mumbai underworld boss. Unlike several of her colleagues, Zinta repeated in court her earlier statement that she had received extortion threats from the mafia during the shooting of the film. After her testimony, she was given witness protection and was forced to stay out of the public eye for two months. Thirteen other witnesses before her, including celebrities Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan, were witnesses in the case but later retracted their earlier statements. Zinta was the only witness who did not become hostile to the prosecution; the nation responded positively to her actions. Consequently, she was the first recipient of Godfrey's Mind of Steel Award at the annual Red and White Bravery Awards, given to her for the [...] "courageous act" [...] of standing against the Mumbai Underworld. On receiving the award, she said, [...] "To be brave is not to be fearless. It is when you fear and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> it, then you can be called brave. I am human. It is not that I fear nothing. But getting over a fear is a continuous process and I have been successful so far." [...] Since 2006, Zinta {{has been the}} brand ambassador for the Godfrey Phillips Bravery awards.|$|E
2500|$|The Camerons {{have had}} four children. Their first, Ivan Reginald Ian, {{was born on}} 8 April 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham, London, with a rare {{combination}} of cerebral palsy and a form of severe epilepsy called Ohtahara syndrome, requiring round-the-clock care. Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: [...] "The news hits you like a freight train... You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality. But then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> that, because he's wonderful." [...] Ivan was cared for at the specialist NHS Cheyne Day Centre in West London, which closed shortly after he left it. Ivan died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 25 February 2009, aged six.|$|E

[...] GameSpy's Patrick Joynt scored the PlayStation 3 version 3 out of 5 and the Wii version 3.5 out of 5, and {{was critical of}} the game's use of its license; [...] "Sickening bloodlust and a fondness for repetition are essential skills for enjoying The Godfather, placing an otherwise decent open-world game at direct odds with its own license and identity." [...] However, he also felt that [...] "once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> the disconnect of the license and the gameplay, the missions are plentiful and entertaining." [...] He concluded [...] "a licensed game doesn't need to be slavishly adhered to the property it's coming from. And the actual gameplay here isn't half-bad. But like slapping the word [...] "art" [...] on a toilet, there's a constant dissonance between the license and the gameplay." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Colón Sánchez {{expressed}} {{her desire}} to run for a seat as Councilwoman. She {{was supported by the}} Democratic town committee; and endorsed by the mayor, several councilmen, and the Hispanic Democratic Reform Club. Despite all of this support for Colón Sánchez, Councilman Nicholas Carbone, who was a powerful figure in the Democratic political machine, supported Mildred Torres instead. Carbone may have been prejudiced against Colón Sánchez's physical appearance and made her feel that she just wasn't ready. According to a statement made by Carbone when she ran for the school board:“We ran María for the school board and she spoke broken English. She wasn't an attractive woman, she was heavy, so where would you take her? How did you sell her? How did you get people to vote for her? And how did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> the prejudice that she spoke with a thick accent? So we didn't take her into a lot of neighborhoods... You had to be practical as you were trying to get her on the school board.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Toad {{ranked in}} the seventh slot on GameDaily's top 10 Nintendo {{characters}} that deserve their own games list; the site explained {{that he has a}} strong appeal that Nintendo has yet to tap into. GameDaily also listed the [...] "neglected guy" [...] on its list of top 25 video game archetypes, listing Toad as an example. Toad is listed in the most neglected Mario Bros. characters list as he has been described by the site to have been ignored by Nintendo for quite a while due to his lack of starring roles in the more recent games. IGN editor Matt Casamassina criticized Nintendo for including the two generic Toads over more notable characters (including the red-spotted Toad himself) in the Mario series for New Super Mario Bros. Wii, arguing that the developers were being lazy to not include other characters because the Toads were easier to make. IGN also listed Toad {{as one of the top}} ten characters needing a spin-off. In an Oricon poll conducted in Japan from 2008, Toad was voted as the eighth most popular video game character in Japan. Another poll (of over 1000 votes) conducted in Japan by NintendoWorldReport in concern to Japan's favorite Mario Kart racers listed Toad as the second most favorite Mario Kart racer in the country (only being beaten by Yoshi). Toad has been credited for being one of the celebrated characters in the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Super Mario Bros. games. MTV, when commenting on the wackiness of Super Mario 2 (Super Mario Bros. 2), called Toad [...] "so awesome". UGO.com listed Toad on their list of [...] "The Cutest Video Game Characters," [...] stating [...] "Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> his misleading name, you’ll find Toad to be quite the adorable mushroom." ...|$|E
