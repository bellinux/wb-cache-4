Some of the dialogue was reportedly taken from a Charles Manson documentary. The dialogue is [...] "The whole thing, I think it's sick." [...] In an interview shortly after the album was released, Joey Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor's, sped up. 742617000027 was the barcode number on their 1996 self-released album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. All of the band members wear that number on their jumpsuits. [...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] is {{about a man who}} keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit. One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me. Everything that <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case. So I think it's just openmindedness and just be cool." [...] Paul Gray said about the meaning behind [...] "Surfacing" [...] chorus: [...] "Basically, we dedicate it to the kids as their new national anthem. It's our way of saying don't worry about everybody else. Just worry about yourself. Don't worry about the people judging and the people coming down on you and all the fake crap. Stick to what you believe in." [...] "Spit It Out" [...] was written in response to some individuals who worked at a local radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, where Slipknot is from. These individuals worked hard to keep Slipknot off the air. [...] "Prosthetics" [...] was inspired by the 1965 film The Collector, which is about a butterfly collector who chose to collect humans, too.|$|E
500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must {{get the better of}} certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob." [...] His motto comes from Plutarch, [...] "The deceived is wiser than one not deceived." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 2011, {{conservative}} {{talk radio}} host Rush Limbaugh told his listening audience: [...] "When I was 10 years old I was more self-sufficient than this parade of human debris calling itself Occupy Wall Street." [...] Glenn Beck said on his internet television network GBTV, [...] "Capitalists, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can play footsies with these people, you are wrong. They will come {{for you and}} drag you into the streets and kill you. They will do it. They’re not messing around." [...] Newt Gingrich said, [...] "All the Occupy movements starts with the premise that we all owe them everything. Now, that {{is a pretty good}} symptom of how much the left has collapsed as a moral system in this country and why you need to reassert something as simple as saying to them, go get a job right after you take a bath." [...] Rick Santorum also told the protesters to get jobs.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, Pink {{wanted to}} call her album Heartbreak Is a Motherfucker, but her record label {{declined}} because of a fear that offensive language would affect sales. She also said {{that she did not}} want the album to look like a break-up album; [...] "There is a lot of that , but there is fun happening too and that's why I named it Funhouse in the end." [...] Pink has also stated that she sees life as a carnival: [...] "Clowns are supposed to be happy, but they are really scary. Carnivals are supposed to be fun, but really they are kind of creepy." [...] "and that's like life to me, and love. Love is supposed to be fun, but it can sometimes be really scary. And the funhouse mirrors that make you look so distorted that you don’t recognize yourself and you ask yourself, ‘How did I get here? How do I get out of here?’ But, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want to do it again. That is the same as love and life. It's a metaphor for being in love and for life." [...] This also shows in the title track [...] "Funhouse" [...] where she tells that it used to be fun. [...] "It's about when the box you’re in doesn’t fit anymore, burn that fucker down and start a new one." ...|$|E
