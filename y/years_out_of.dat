5|$|Nash {{spent five}} <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cricketing {{spotlight}} (although he dominated Melbourne district cricket, the Victorian selectors refused to select {{him and he}} never played a Sheffield Shield match).

5|$|Throughout {{the regular}} season, a {{constant}} question {{hanging over the}} Virginia Tech Hokies football team was whether or not star quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year at the school. The National Football League requires that players be at least three <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> high school before they are eligible for the NFL Draft. Vick, who had not played during his freshman year at the school, would be three <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{high school in the}} spring following the Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|After many <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the spotlight, Robertson was {{recognized}} on November 17, 2006 for his impact on college basketball {{when he was}} chosen {{to be a member}} of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.

5|$|In 2012, it was {{hypothesized}} that 15810 Arawn could be a quasi-satellite of Pluto, a specific type of co-orbital configuration. According to the hypothesis, the object would be a quasi-satellite of Pluto for about 350,000 <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> every two-million-year period. This hypothesis was disproven in 2016, when more-accurate observations of the position of Arawn were made by New Horizons.|$|E
5|$|Radio commemorations {{occur on}} Texas yearly during Museum Ship Weekend and Pearl Harbor Day. Amateur Radio {{operators}} from the Battleship Texas Amateur Radio Station (BTARS website between 8 and 3 <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> date) operate {{on those two}} occasions under the Federal Communication Commission callsign NA5DV, similar to the original callsign NADV.|$|E

5|$|There are 21 electoral wards in Trafford, {{each with}} 3 councillors, giving {{a total of}} 63 councillors with one-third elected three <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> four.

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1956, the Tories were led by former Ontario premier George A. Drew, who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John Diefenbaker. Drew was the fifth man to lead the Tories in their 21 <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> power. None had come close to {{defeating}} the Liberals; the best performance was in 1945, when John Bracken secured 67 seats for the Tories. The Liberals, though, had won 125seats, and maintained their majority. In the 1953 election, the PC party won 51seats out of the 265 in the House of Commons. Subsequently, the Tories picked up two seats from the Liberals in by-elections, and the Liberals (who had won 169seats in 1953) lost an additional seat to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of the New Democratic Party (NDP)).|$|E
5|$|Black {{was born}} in Salix, Iowa. He had his first taste of {{professional}} baseball in 1937, when he was signed by the Fairbury Jeffs of the Nebraska State League. The Jeffs were the rookie-level minor league team of the St. Louis Browns farm system. He played alongside two others who would later make the major leagues, George Bradley and Johnny Lucadello. Black pitched in 26 games for the Jeffs, posting a 5-11 record, 154 innings pitched, and a 4.85 ERA.

5|$|Bristol City council {{consists}} of 70 councillors representing 35 wards, with two per ward serving four-year terms. Councillors are elected in thirds, with elections held in three <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> every four-year period. Thus, since wards {{do not have}} both councillors up for election at the same time, two-thirds of the wards participate in each election. Although the council was long dominated by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats have grown strong {{in the city and}} (as the largest party) took minority control of the council after the 2005 election. In 2007, Labour and the Conservatives united to defeat the Liberal Democrat administration; Labour ruled the council as a minority administration, with Helen Holland as council leader.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{returned}} to Massillon in 1932, {{when he was}} 24 years old and barely two <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> college. His assignment was to turn around a Tigers team that had fallen into mediocrity over the six seasons since the departure of Stewart, Brown's old coach. In 1931, the year before Brown arrived, the Tigers finished with a 2–6-2 record. Brown's strategy was {{to build up a}} disciplined, hard-working team. He fired an assistant early on for arriving at a practice late because he had to work on his farm. No Tigers player was allowed to sit on the bench during a game; Brown made them stand. At Massillon, Brown put in an offense and blocking scheme he learned from Duke's Jimmy DeHart and Purdue's Noble Kizer. He emphasized quickness over strength.|$|E
5|$|Five <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the World Junior Championships, Martin {{had formed}} a new team and won his first provincial championship. This {{qualified}} him {{and his team of}} Kevin Park, Dan Petryk and Don Bartlett for the 1991 Labatt Brier. At the 1991 Brier, Martin finished the round robin with an 8–3 win-loss record, tying Saskatchewan for first place. Martin knocked off British Columbia in the semifinal, and then beat Saskatchewan (skipped by Randy Woytowich) with a score of 8–4 in the final. The rink was then off to the 1991 Canada Safeway World Curling Championships in Winnipeg. Martin turned the tables, going undefeated through the round robin. After beating Norway's Eigil Ramsfjell in the semifinal, Martin's team lost in the final, losing to Scotland's David Smith with a score of 2–7.|$|E

5|$|Harrison lost {{a bid for}} Senate in 1831, {{and found}} {{insufficient}} support to mount {{a run for the}} House of Representatives in 1832. His large family gave him money problems, and he remained out of public life in the early 1830s. By 1834, opposition to President Jackson was coalescing into {{what became known as the}} Whig Party. Harrison, though several <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> active politics was a war hero with roots in both North and South, and had been fired by Jackson. Thus, he looked attractive as a possible presidential candidate to the new party, something that Harrison did nothing to discourage. Harrison wrote a letter to the newspapers that won over many Whigs, assuring them of his fidelity to party principles, such as the limited power of the executive and federal subsidies for roads, canals and railroads.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, after <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the limelight, Larwood {{was elected}} to honorary {{membership}} of the MCC. The following year {{he and his family}} were encouraged by former opponent Jack Fingleton to emigrate and settle in Australia, where he was warmly welcomed, in contrast to the reception accorded him in his cricketing days. He worked for a soft drinks firm, and as an occasional reporter and commentator on Tests against visiting England sides. He paid several visits to England, and was honoured at his old county ground, Trent Bridge, where a stand was named after him. In 1993, at the age of 88, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in belated recognition of his services to cricket. He died two years later.|$|E
5|$|Mir was {{the first}} {{continuously}} inhabited long-term research station in orbit and held {{the record for the}} longest continuous human presence in space at 3,644 days, until it was surpassed by the ISS on 23 October 2010. It holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight, with Valeri Polyakov spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995. Mir was occupied for a total of twelve and a half <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its fifteen-year lifespan, having the capacity to support a resident crew of three, or larger crews for short visits.|$|E

Olds became an ace on both of his combat tours and was twice awarded the Silver Star, for the mission of August 25 and for the achievements of himself and his squadron during his combined tours.|$|E
5|$|Parslow was {{a member}} of the York team that won the 2012 FA Trophy Final and 2012 Conference Premier {{play-off}} Final in 2011–12, with victory in the latter seeing the club promoted into League Two after eight <b>years</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Football League. He missed only one match in 2012–13, in which he won the Clubman of the Year award for an unprecedented third time. Parslow was out injured for most of 2013–14, and was on loan with Conference Premier club Grimsby Town during 2014–15, playing in their penalty shoot-out defeat in the 2015 Conference Premier play-off Final. He signed for Cheltenham Town of the National League in 2015, and was part of the team that earned promotion into League Two by winning the divisional title in 2015–16.|$|E
