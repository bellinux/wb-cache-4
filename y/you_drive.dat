500|$|The Oops!... I Did It Again Tour was {{the third}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Britney Spears. It supported her second studio album Oops!...

The tour was announced in February 2000, while Spears {{was in the midst of}} the (<b>You</b> <b>Drive</b> Me) Crazy Tour. The stage was much more elaborate than her previous tours and featured video screens, pyrotechnics and moving platforms. The setlist was composed by songs from her first two studio albums, ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again as well as a few covers. Showco was the sound company, who used the PRISM system to adapt the show to each venue. Spears used a handheld microphone and a headset during the shows, while an ADAT was used to replace her voice during energetic dance routines.|$|E

The stage was less elaborate than her previous tour, Dream Within a Dream Tour, with no runway extended towards the audience, {{in order to keep the}} show faithful to the New York theatre theme. There were three video screens above the stage. Also present were several LED columned-shaped video screens in the stage. The setlist was mostly composed from songs from In the Zone ("Early Mornin'" [...] and [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] being the only songs of the album to not be on the tour). Other songs included were [...] "Boys", [...] "I'm A Slave 4 U,"and [...] "Overprotected" [...] from Britney (2001). Also included were three of her early hits, [...] "...Baby One More Time", (<b>You</b> <b>Drive</b> Me) Crazy and [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", reworked with elements of jazz and blues. The promotional photos for the tour were by Markus Klinko and Indrani. Tour promoter Clear Channel Entertainment marketed the tour to an entirely different demographic than her previous tours, changing from families and children to a more adult audience. The show was also targeted to the gay market. Promotional campaigns included were Flash animated e-mails targeted to two million people who fitted the audience description. The tour was also advertised in several radio stations and TV shows for those audiences, such as The O.C. MTV {{was chosen as}} the tour sponsor. The sponsorship was extended to advertisements in the tickets and interactive promotions in MTV.com, such as exclusive downloads, streaming video and ticket and merchandise auctions benefiting the Britney Spears Foundation.

500|$|The {{stage was}} {{designed}} by production designer Steven Cohen and production manager Rob Brenner for the HBO special. This {{was the first time}} Spears used an entire new stage design after having used a typical end-stage with a ramp and stairs at the center as on her first 3 tours (the ...Baby One More Time Tour, the (<b>You</b> <b>Drive</b> Me) Crazy Tour, and the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour). Cohen designed the main stage with an oval shape so that Spears could perform around the stage and so that it would look good from multiple camera angles. He said {{that the rest of the}} stage was created with three main components in mind: a runway, a B-stage, and a flying device over the crowd. The last was developed, as explained by Cohen, [...] "around this Cleopatra's barge concept I got into my head while designing when the movie Cleopatra was playing in the background. It needed to be elegant and stylized but also high tech, because it was going to have to be traveling on conventional motors and transport mechanisms. Plus, it had to have a big enough performance area for her and the dancers." [...] Brenner continued, [...] "I wanted to try to give the kid in the back of the house the same experience as the one in the first 10 rows." [...] The runway uniting the main stage and the B-stage was suggested by one of Spears's managers, Johnny Wright. The entire stage was built by Michael Tait from Tait Towers. Cohen said, [...] "We took a more expanded role in preparing the drawings for Michael. We wanted to retain the essence of the look of the show, both in its overall footprint and in the execution of these various pieces. [...] did a great job on executing the fine details like the hand railings and the floor lights and the MR-16 covers. When you're doing something for TV, all of those pieces are foreground pieces. The mirrors on the platforms and the floor painting made the show look better on TV." ...|$|E
