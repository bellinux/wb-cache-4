6000|$|... "Then why ask?" [...] she said. [...] "One might almost think, Charles, {{that you}} were laying a trap! Did <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> I should deceive you? You have not had your lithia powder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> {{the poor}} {{young man is}} to behave?" [...] she had said. [...] "I do not much care how he behaves," [...] Caroline had replied. But, nevertheless, she did care.|$|E
