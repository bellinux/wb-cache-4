500|$|On September 22, 2011, McCotter {{notified}} The Detroit News {{he would}} {{withdraw from the}} presidential race. He explained it [...] "was sort of death by media" [...] because of the exclusion from the presidential debates, and argued [...] "if they keep {{you out of the}} debates, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of the conversation and you can't run." [...] He then released a statement in which he endorsed Mitt Romney for president, and called on the Republican Party to unite behind Romney as the most electable candidate. [...] In the press release, McCotter also announced that he would run for re-election in his congressional district.|$|E
500|$|For the 1984 season, Audi added two-time world {{champion}} Walter Röhrl to their star line-up and Mouton {{now had a}} part-time role, competing in five WRC events. For {{the first time in}} nine years, she did not enter the Monte Carlo Rally. However, Mouton signed up to commentate the event for Radio Monte Carlo. She started her year well by finishing second at the Swedish Rally behind teammate and home favourite Blomqvist. Mouton later stated that [...] "finishing second was fantastic. When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> rallying on ice or snow in country like that it is like dancing. From {{one side to the other}} side. My dancing background helped my rallying. As soon as I started on gravel I liked it because of that. It was so nice to feel and move the car like that. Sweden, in ice and snow, like ballet!" [...] This would remain her last podium position in the World Rally Championship.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his loss}} to WBC heavyweight {{champion}} Vitali Klitschko, Dereck Chisora {{got into a}} brawl with compatriot David Haye at the post-fight press conference. Klitschko's manager Bernd Boente said [...] "with the bad experience we've had with British fighters we will now look for other countries". He then told Haye from the dais [...] "You had an offer, you didn't accept it, now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>out.</b> You cannot talk yourself back into the fight, you have no belts." [...] Chisora then called out Haye, but Haye dismissed Chisora as [...] "a loser".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} <b>you</b> <b>were!</b> Ma was awfully worried about you. When you weren't in by ten, that hateful Tom McGill said <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> calling on another--said <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> calling on some young lady. I just despise Mr. McGill. Well, I'm {{not going to}} scold you any more, Mr. Tansey, {{if it is a}} little late--Oh! I turned it the wrong way!" ...|$|R
60|$|THE GOVERNOR. You {{know as well}} as I do that if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> in {{the shops}} <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>be</b> allowed to talk.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw you gallop past, and {{wondered}} what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{in such a hurry}} about. Was it like this when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> in the woods?" ...|$|R
60|$|Arte. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> {{of charity}} with her, and {{therefore}} I shall not give your service.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall cross {{early in}} the morning to the high road, before <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of bed; and catch the day-coach, going up. Good-bye!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thirteen hundred--there <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> Kelly," [...] said Anthony, {{tearing off}} a check. [...] "Your thousand, and the $300 <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out.</b> <b>You</b> don't despise money, do you, Kelly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She got {{a second}} letter. She got it the very last day <b>you</b> <b>was</b> down here. Pat Cleary took it up to her when <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> wid Miss Kate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't I {{hear you}} say day before {{yesterday}} that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of nutmegs?" [...] he queried, after a few moments' severe reflection.|$|R
6000|$|... "A rest?" [...] he repeated. [...] "That rather belies your reputation, you know. They {{say that}} you are tireless, even when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am tired}} of {{political}} society," [...] she answered. [...] "It isn't the real thing. Now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of Parliament, though, even that has vanished. Andrew!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How is it <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> here still? This is Thursday, isn't it? We {{meant to}} have been half way home, to be {{in time for the}} matches." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{you must}} have met somebody--other men--here even, when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> with your schoolfellows, or perhaps on an {{adventure}} like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, Lawson, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> {{there on}} the Fort Smith reservation, weren't you? Wasn't that where you and Elsie camped this summer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> {{on such a}} {{business}} as that, how did you venture to risk having him along--and him a detective? How's that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How now!" [...] said Hatton, [...] "young men, you {{are over}} prompt. Her Majesty needs no swords. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of rank. Fall {{in and do}} your obeisance." ...|$|E
6000|$|The gentleman saw a {{struggling}} recollection lighten up the Minor Canon’s features, and smiling again, said: ‘What {{will you have}} for breakfast this morning? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of jam.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Cuffe," [...] {{said this}} uninviting-looking personage, {{twitching}} the stump of the maimed arm, [...] "I see <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of the flock; {{are you all}} ready for sailing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'm glad {{my friends}} are going. It will save you trouble, Jack. A match between Miss Hurst and <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> of the question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Me? Not till I'm {{running a}} Polar consumptives' {{sanatorium}} boat. I was squinting through a colloid before <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of your cradle, my son." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Miss Welse," [...] he went on, {{an added}} respect marking his demeanor, [...] "it grieves me {{to inform you}} that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of order. You had best sit down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, we {{had better}} go in. Your father will, doubtless, {{have much to say}} to you, this evening; and your mother will grudge every minute <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of her sight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He'd ask at dinner; but if I said <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> {{for the day}} {{along with}} Mr. Fenwick, he wouldn't say any more, maybe. He'd know well enough where <b>you</b> <b>was</b> gone to." ...|$|R
2500|$|... {{for which}} the player drew a caution. Three {{cautions}} and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out.</b> If your fines reached $25, special discipline might be warranted by the president.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} hear it," [...] {{his mother}} said. [...] "I always feel more {{comfortable}} when you are on that ground, as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of the track of steamers there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me?" [...] shrilled Josiah Graham. [...] "Not much I won't! You go an' earn your money, young man. Serves {{you right}} if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> o' pocket an' ain't got a cent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither do I," [...] {{admitted}} Vane. [...] "I {{suppose there}} isn't one. But they weren't sea-blue; unless {{you mean the}} depth of indigo when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of soundings. They're Irish eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] agreed Harding gravely. [...] "But if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of the way, he'd {{have a free}} hand. As you wouldn't join him, you're {{a serious}} obstacle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Admiral!" [...] I said, warmly. [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of the country. Our papers {{said that}} you had gone to Switzerland for a rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Miss Jeanne," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "I {{have only}} just heard that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>out.</b> Do <b>you</b> {{generally}} {{get up in}} the middle of the night?" ...|$|R
