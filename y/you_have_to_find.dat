500|$|Yancey {{writes that}} Christians should be {{politically}} active and should, for example, oppose abortion, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{a way to}} do it with grace... If I'm against abortion and I don't find a way to love the woman who got the abortion and even her doctor, then I don't understand the gospel." [...] Yancey recounts Jesus's Parable of the Unforgiving Servant, concluding that God is only willing to forgive us if we are willing to forgive those who have wronged us.

2500|$|On October 31, 2008, Petraeus assumed {{command of}} the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) {{headquartered}} in Tampa, Florida. Petraeus was responsible for U.S. operations in 20 countries spreading from Egypt to Pakistan—including Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. During his time at CENTCOM, Petraeus advocated that countering the terrorist threats in the CENTCOM region requires more than just counter-terrorism forces, demanding instead whole-of-governments, comprehensive approaches akin to those of counterinsurgency. One of his closest colleagues said that Petraeus knew that defeating an insurgency required living among the people, convincing them that we were better than the insurgents.

2500|$|A {{split in}} the Zetas could be {{encouraging}} for rival gangs. That in turn {{could prove to be}} a [...] "major headache" [...] for President Enrique Peña Nieto, who has vowed to reduce the violence that has killed more than 50,000 since 2006. If the Zetas break apart, drug violence in Mexico could increase, with over 10,000 cartel members fighting for control. Some security officials say that the split is proof {{of the success of the}} government crackdown, while others say that the infighting can prove to be problematic because [...] "... it's like if the HIV virus mutates. Then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> two vaccines." [...] Los Zetas are responsible for much of the violence in Mexico's drug war and they have expanded despite other cartels allying against them. A 2012 report indicated that the Zetas were present in 16 of the 31 states in Mexico, more than the wealthiest crime group, the Sinaloa Cartel.|$|E

She cannot afford to waste brains like yours, while in thousands of reeking alleys, such as that one opposite us, heathens and savages are demanding the rights of citizenship.

50|$|Buchleitner {{was born}} in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany and spent his {{childhood}} in Bad Wildbad in the secluded northern Black Forest.
