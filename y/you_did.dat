Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at <b>you?</b> <b>Did</b> you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if <b>you</b> <b>did</b> you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will.

Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E
