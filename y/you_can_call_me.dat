In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, Sue Sanders. In 2007, he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, an organisation that provides support to young, homeless and troubled LGBT people.|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} the sound of a {{motorcycle}} engine. Bob Dylan's [...] "Gotta Serve Somebody" [...] is delivered, according to Parke Puterbaugh of Rolling Stone, with [...] "the air of Old Testament-style authority it demands". James does not modify the lyrics, singing [...] "You can call me Bobby, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Zimmy". [...] "Don't Let My Baby Ride", originally by Deadric Malone and O. V. Wright, adds a bit of sensuality to the album with the line: [...] "If his jeans are too tight... you might see what you like". Other covers include Al Green's [...] "Rhymes", [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] (Jimmy Campbell and Reg Connelly, Harry M. Woods), and Otis Redding [...] "Hawg for Ya". The tempo of The Rolling Stones' [...] "Miss You" [...] is slowed down to a [...] "sensual simmer". James modified the gender mentioned in the lyrics, singing [...] "Puerto Rican boys just dying to meet you". Following [...] "Hawg" [...] are Malone's [...] "You're Gonna Make Me Cry", which features vocals by Finnigan, Sandy Jones' [...] "Walking the Back Streets", and Benny Latimore's [...] "Let's Straighten It Out". Closing the album are John Fogerty's [...] "Born on the Bayou", [...] "Come Back Baby" [...] (Ray Charles, Lightnin' Hopkins), and Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller's [...] "Hound Dog".|$|E

2500|$|Many drag queens {{prefer to}} be {{referred}} to as [...] "she" [...] while in drag and desire to stay completely in character. Some performers object to being referred to as [...] "he" [...] or by their legal name while in character. Drag performer RuPaul is an exception, as he seems to be completely indifferent to which pronoun is used to refer to him. In his words, [...] "You can call me he. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> she. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Bruner {{has said}} that school shootings in the United States occur because {{students}} are being taught the science of evolution. Bruner wrote that [...] "Evolution is a religious philosophy with propaganda supporting the religion of Atheism". Like other Young Earth creationists, Bruner believes dinosaurs and mankind walked the Earth at the same time; Bruner also believes that scientists found proof of a young Earth but have colluded to hide the evidence. Bruner wrote: [...] "The dinosaurs on the ark may have been babies and not able to reproduce. It might make sense to take the small dinosaurs onto the ark instead of the ones bigger than a bus. After the flood, the few remaining Behemoths and Leviathans may have become extinct because {{there was not enough}} vegetation on earth for them to survive to reproductive age... When the flood waters subsided and rushed into the oceans, there was no vegetation on the earth because the earth had been covered with water." [...] A television reporter asked Bruner on-camera to clarify her beliefs concerning the biblical account of Noah's Ark and whether it was filled with pairs of animals and if the entire world was covered with water. Bruner later wrote, [...] "THE ANSWER IS STILL YES, I believe the Holy Bible. I believe there was a Great Flood. How do YOU explain fossils of seashells and other sea animals on tops of mountains all over the world? How do you explain the Grand Canyon? You are very naive if you believe a tiny river carved out the Grand Canyon. I believe it took a lot more water than that to carve out the Grand Canyon and other land and rock formations formed by water erosion. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> ignorant or intolerant or whatever you want, but I did not make fun of YOUR religion." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to come," [...] Cyril replied, [...] "but, as I have never been out there before, had you not better make some pretext {{for me to do}} so.

5000|$|Cartilage-hair {{hypoplasia}} (CHH), {{also known}} as McKusick type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, is a rare genetic disorder. It is a highly pleiotropic disorder that clinically manifests by form of short-limbed dwarfism due to skeletal dysplasia, variable level of immunodeficiency and predisposition to malignancies in some cases. It was first reported in 1965 by McKusick et al. Actor Verne Troyer is affected with this form of dwarfism, as was actor Billy Barty, who was renowned for saying [...] "The name of my condition is Cartilage Hair Syndrome Hypoplasia, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Billy." ...|$|R

Come! the trees have not got it all their own way. Besides, imagine the discomforts of a human springtime, blowing hot and blowing cold, freezing, thawing, raining, and drouthing, and never being sure whether we are young or old, May or December. We should be such nuisances to one another that we should ask the gods to take back their gift, and you know very well they cannot." ...|$|R

5000|$|The fourth round {{witnessed}} women's tennis history, as {{the match}} between Kuznetsova and Schiavone broke records. The match became the longest match, {{in terms of}} time for women in a Grand Slam as it lasted for 4 hours, and 44 minutes. At 8-7 in the final set Kutznetsova had three match points, but the Italian saved all three. In the next game Schiavone broke her opponents serve but touched the net after hitting the winner, meaning the point went to Kutznetsova, when holding three break points. Kutznetsova had another three match points in the next game before a run of four games in a row where the serve was broken. Finally after breaking in the previous game and missing three match points Schiavone closed the match out to win 16-14 in the final set. Other fourth round matches saw Sevastova's run end against Wozniacki and Makarova's end against Clijsters, while Petkovic upset Sharapova in straight sets. Other upsets saw Na Li and Kvitová defeat higher seeded players. [...] "I finally feel like <b>you</b> guys <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Aussie Kim, because I've won the title" [...] Kim Clijsters, in her post final speech. In the quarterfinals Wozniacki put an end to Schiavone's run by winning a final set decider. Also going into the semifinals were Li who defeated Petkovic, Clijsters who defeated Radwańska and Zvonerava who took care of Kvitová. In the first semifinal Li caused an upset, as she saved match point, to defeat the world number one Wozniacki in three sets. As a result, Li became the first Chinese citizen to reach a Grand Slam singles final. Her opponent in the final, Clijsters, won in straight sets against Zvonerava. In the final Clijsters came from a set down to claim her first Australian Open title. It was her fourth grand slam title in her career and second consecutive slam having won the US Open in 2010.|$|R
