Salke evaluated that viewers will enjoy the [...] "clever mythology that overlap and affect each other in very interesting ways", despite the series' Sliding Doors-like script. Upon reading the script, Isaacs {{felt that it was}} [...] "incredibly hard" [...] and complicated to comprehend. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>know</b> what reality you're in? [...] That's become a [...] It was hard but I quite like hard work." [...] Isaacs later suggested that it might be too brooding for mainstream American television, and that it could potentially be the [...] "U-bend of scripts". He stated that every pilot comes from people who have [...] "amazing prestige", and that there are lots of [...] "talented people, but the head of the network chooses only one." [...] Despite such concerns, Gordon asserted that the concept of Awake was a concept that you could understand if you sat down and paid attention to it properly.|$|E

He did it again – he just pulled that one out. An individual like that: one day he could probably blow it, but the other four days he could make it. It was just unfortunate he made it against us." ...|$|E

'I believe <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>know</b> the end {{before you}} are half {{through the first}} volume,' said her mother admiringly; 'but {{of course it is}} all right, only it is a terrible {{disappointment}} and misfortune for us, and not to be looked for after all these years.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{you know}} how I feel about you, Colonel Sellers, and always have felt. It {{seems to me that}} <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>know</b> {{everything}} about everything.

6000|$|... "They {{are like}} the Aurora Borealis," [...] said the King, who always {{answered}} questions that were addressed to other people, [...] "only much more natural. I prefer them to stars myself, as <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>know</b> when {{they are going to}} appear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing. You must certainly see them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, {{really and}} truly," [...] I said at last, as deferentially as I could, [...] "I haven't known you {{long enough to}} say. But I should think, Mrs Monnerie, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> the truth." ...|$|R

[...] "I don't say he's a saint, but he's run {{the town}} pretty well, on the whole, {{and kept the}} vice where it belongs, out of sight. He's made his pile, but he's {{entitled}} to something we all are. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>know</b> where you stand with Beatty. But say, if Hubbell and his crowd--" ...|$|E

[...] And then, while Strether {{was aware of}} fearing closer quarters, though giving himself again to the harmonies, [...] "Well," [...] little Bilham went on, [...] "it IS at the worst rather good, you know.

60|$|He was the {{greatest}} man of his time, and he had much good in him; and when {{he lay on his}} death-bed he grieved much for all the evil he had brought upon the English; but that could not undo it. He had been a great church-builder, and so were his Norman bishops and barons. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>know</b> their work, because it has round pillars, and round arches, with broad borders of zig-zags, and all manner of patterns round them.|$|E

6000|$|All children, except one, grow up. They soon {{know that}} they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put {{her hand to her}} heart and cried, [...] "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!"

2500|$|He had a {{different}} sound, you know and he had such emotion and heart. And of course you recognized Frankie, just like Sinatra had that sound that you'd always recognize.

He could do it all…but again, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> that it was Frankie Laine. — Connie Haines ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! bless me, master Wilder, {{what would}} become of us all, in these {{difficult}} times, {{if we did not}} turn an honest penny in every way that offers? I have brought up several fine children in credit, and it sha'n't be my fault if I don't leave them something too, besides my good name. Well, well; they say, 'A nimble sixpence is as good as a lazy shilling;' but give me the man who don't stand shilly-shally when a friend has need of his good word, or a lift from his hand. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>know</b> where to find such a man; as our politicians say, after they have gone through thick and thin in the cause, be it right or be it wrong." ...|$|E

Oh, if you knew----!" [...] Her rising agitation stifled her utterance at the moment. [...] "I mustn't waste the precious minutes; I must get back before Oscar returns," [...] she went on, rallying again. [...] "Oh, my old friend, you are never at a loss; <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>know</b> what to do! Find me some way of putting off my marriage.

6000|$|One {{singular}} {{thing the}} house-hunter very speedily discovers is, {{that the greater}} portion of the houses {{in this country are}} owned by old gentlemen or old ladies who live next door. After a certain age, and especially upon retired tradespeople, house property, either alone or in common with gardening, exercises an irresistible fascination. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>know</b> you are going to meet a landlord or landlady of this type when you read on your order to view, [...] "Key next door but one." [...] Calling next door but one, you are joined after the lapse of a few minutes by a bald, stout gentleman, or a lady of immemorial years, who offers to go over [...] "the property" [...] with you. Apparently the intervals between visits to view are spent in slumber, and these old people come out refreshed and keen to scrutinise their possible new neighbours. They will tell you all about the last tenant, and about the present tenants on either side, and about themselves, and how all the other houses in the neighbourhood are damp, and how they remember when the site of the house was a cornfield, and what they do for their rheumatism. As one hears them giving a most delightful vent to their loquacity, the artistic house-hunter feels all the righteous self-applause of a kindly deed. Sometimes they get extremely friendly. One old gentleman--to whom anyone under forty must have seemed puerile--presented the gentle writer with three fine large green apples as a kind of earnest of his treatment: apples, no doubt, of some little value, since they excited the audible envy of several little boys before they were disposed of.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Perhaps it is,' said Christopher hurriedly, {{taking up}} his hat. 'Let me now wish you good-bye; and, of course, <b>you</b> will <b>always</b> <b>know</b> where I am, {{and how to}} find me.' ...|$|R
30|$|One thing I have {{realized}} personally {{for a while}} is that I always loved, may be because I {{grew up in a}} multilingual society where <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> there are other languages all around you, and so you had to way of opening up of other things. I have a feeling that we, it is easier for us to translate and become something else and understand. But Americans tend to be so unique, language, so just like one language and sound one way.|$|R
5000|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{praised the}} film with a {{positive}} review and three stars, particularly pleased by the performances of Postlethwaite and Griffiths—"when you look at them, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>know</b> how their characters are feeling"—and writing that the film was [...] "thick with atmosphere." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Conner, [...] "Miller {{arranges}} {{his songs}} like roller coasters; <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>know</b> where you're {{going to end}} up, but the time signatures and key changes throw you around on the way there."

5000|$|In 2009, Professor Green {{stated that}} the {{collaboration}} between him and Allen started after a conversation on Facebook:"We got chatting on Facebook and I mentioned the track, {{which turned out to}} be one of her favourite songs.

5000|$|He wasn't a big guy, {{maybe five}} seven and 185 pounds. Of Arab descent, {{he had a}} {{mustache}} like Saddam Hussein. He had {{a wife and a}} couple of kids, and a three decker townhouse on East Broadway and G. I was friendly with his daughter Louanne, who was a few years younger than me. That night, as always, he was talking in his obnoxious loud voice. Even when there were 400 people in the bar, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> Louie was there.|$|R

5000|$|The song's bright, {{calm and}} warming music, fronted by a {{distinctive}} mandolin strum, contrasts very {{sharply with the}} destructive lyrics, particularly the haunting bridge: [...] "Get the kids and bring a sweater; dry is good, and wind is better. Count the years; <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> it / Strike a match; go on and do it". The title of the album, A Few Small Repairs, also appears in the third line of the second verse of the song, [...] "'It's time for a few small repairs,' she said." ...|$|R
