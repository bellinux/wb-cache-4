40|$|Transcription begins]: UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES Tuesday 2000 Dear Mom, Got {{your letter}} today hon, it was swell {{to hear from}} you. So you got a little high New Year’s Eve, eh? I wish I had been there to get tight with you. I had a very {{exciting}} time, in the sack at ten o’clock. We didn’t get off this weekend, and don’t expect much open post from now on, as we usually fly on Sundays around here. I flew yesterday and Friday. It seemed swell {{to get back in}} the air again. My instructor is a swell guy. It’s a 2 nd Looey, name’s DeJean. Unlike most of the others around here, he seems to want to get us through. We alternate flying one day in the morning, then the next in the afternoon, with ground school alternately, too (in the P. M. when we fly mornings and vice-versa) This place is pretty crappy. The field is big, but all the buildings are temporary and filled with cockroaches and bedbugs. We haven’t had any trouble yet, but some of the other fellows have. It’s the schedule around here that drives <b>you</b> <b>nuts.</b> We get up at 5 : 30 and don’t stop sometimes until ten at night. We’re on the flight line six hours a day. I haven’t even got time to read my mail during the day, I don’t even have time to go to the john, it’s really pitiful. You know we don’t get any leave after graduation honey. Well, I’m going to try to arrange for a military wedding at the chapel here if possible. Don’t say anything to Dottie, I want to surprise her. Gosh that sure knocked the wind out of our plans, didn’t it honey. But I figured if I marry down here it will be a hell of a lot cheaper and simpler. Of course I’m still going to wait ‘til I graduate so you can be here angel. That’s the only thing we can do, because there’s no telling how long it will be before I get leave, it depends on what assignment I get from here. They’re making us co-pilots and Flight Engineers on B- 29 s now. This G. D. air corps sure gives you a raw deal. Only 13 out of 200 in 44 -K made fighters. I’d sure like to, but I doubt it, it all depends on my flying marks, and whether I’m an F/O or 2 nd Lt. Well honey, I’ve got some homework to do. Write as often as possible angel, it’s so good to hear from you, I miss you so much. I love you, my dear Mom, give my best to Nan 2 ̆ 6 Bob, and their sweet boys, and a heartful of love 2 ̆ 6 1000 kisses to you Sweetheart. I love you. Judd [Transcription ends...|$|E
