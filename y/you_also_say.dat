40|$|This book is {{a product}} of a joint {{research}} project launched in 2005 – comparative studies on the cross-cultural contacts in Asian port cities in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries}} (Masashi, p. xv) ”. It preceded two conferences in 2007 which inspired these ten articles to narrate the intensive cultural contact that happened in maritime Asia in the said time period. This volume is intended to present a new methodological framework on comparing historical Asian port cities by gearing away from the seeming dichotomy between “European versus non-European” perspectives that treat Europeans and Asians as if they are separate entities, or what he defines as a Eurocentric historical view (Masashi, p. 2). As an aim, the editor would want to establish a framework of scientific discussion through the method of comparison that would hopefully incite other approaches too.

30|$|Besides {{the basic}} {{function}} of posting a Twitter message (called “tweet”), {{and the possibility}} to follow and be followed by other users, Twitter provides several other specific features. Three of these are “replies”, “mentions” and “retweets”. Replying to a user by starting a tweet with an @ sign followed by the user name (@user) {{makes it possible to}} address a user directly via the public Twitter feed. To mention another user, works in a similar way; it also includes @user but not {{at the beginning of a}} tweet. The difference is that a reply is directed to the other user and therefore seen by him or her, while a mention is not directed at the user. <b>You</b> could <b>also</b> <b>say</b> a reply is a message for someone while a mention is a message about someone [20]. By using the retweet function a user spreads the original message from another user by resending it. While mentioning is a way of referring to another user without necessarily sharing the same opinion, a retweet can be seen as an informal recommendation of a message that another user finds important, interesting or at least entertaining. Therefore the retweet function is a key mechanism for information diffusion and raising content visibility on Twitter [36, 47].|$|R
40|$|Peshat {{is likely}} from the verb pashat (pey-shin-tet) {{reference}} number 6584. It means to strip off.

The stripped off may have been a commentary on the stripping off the added things that the rabbinates added through their traditions. Many scholars believe that peshat came into being because of the advent of Semitic language grammar and Hebrew grammar by the Rabbinates trying to combat the grammarians from Muslim, Karaite, and Christian sects. The time period of its rise was the 10 th century and continued through the 12 th century. This coincides with the Golden Age of Karaites. Peshat was used by the Karaites is very similar to today, however; the Rabbis who also claim to use Peshat, use it in a different way. The Karaites understood the peshat to be it contextual meaning and not merely the literal meaning.

50|$|In {{an article}} for Gamasutra, Nathan Toronto criticizes {{real-time}} strategy games for too often having only one valid means of victory—attrition—comparing them unfavorably to real-time tactics games. According to Toronto, players' awareness that their only way to win is militarily makes them unlikely to respond to gestures of diplomacy; the result being that the winner of a real-time strategy game is too often the best tactician rather than the best strategist. Troy Goodfellow counters this {{by saying that the}} problem is not that real-time strategy games are lacking in strategic elements (he calls attrition a form of strategy); rather, it is that they too often rely upon the same strategy: produce faster than <b>you</b> consume. He <b>also</b> <b>says</b> that building and managing armies is the conventional definition of real-time strategy, and that it is unfair to make comparisons with other genres when they break convention.|$|R
