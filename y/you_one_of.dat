[...] Although {{there is some}} truth in the literal meaning of this, Cassius Dio asserts {{that it was a}} metaphor for the Empire's strength. Marble could be found in {{buildings}} of Rome before Augustus, but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus.|$|E

[...] In the final verse, he quotes from the gospels of St Matthew and St Mark, lamenting those who [...] "gain the world and lose their soul". Author Ian MacDonald defends the [...] "accusatory finger" [...] behind such statements, saying that, within the ideology of the emerging 1960s counterculture, [...] "this is a token of what was then felt to be a revolution in progress: an inner revolution against materialism." ...|$|E

500|$|Youngs {{reported}} {{to spring training}} in Marlin, Texas with the Giants in 1917. They initially assigned him to the Rochester Hustlers, a team in the International League with which the Giants had a working relationship. Giants manager John McGraw told Mickey Doolan, {{the manager of the}} Hustlers, [...] "I'm giving <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the greatest players I've ever seen. Play him in the outfield. If anything happens to him, I'm holding you responsible." [...] In 140 games with Rochester, Youngs hit [...]356, earning himself a late-season promotion to the big league club. McGraw gave Youngs the nickname [...] "Pep" [...] due to his hustle and soon began to groom Youngs to become his successor as Giants' manager.|$|E
500|$|The lines [...] "Gabba Gabba Hey" [...] {{at the end}} of [...] "Pinhead" [...] {{were taken}} from the horror film Freaks, which the band saw in Cleveland, Ohio after their gig was cancelled. Joey's brother Mickey Leigh said that it was {{specifically}} taken from the scene where [...] "the midget groom does a dance on the banquet table and sings 'Gobble gobble, we accept <b>you,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> us' to his bride." [...] The song is an audience participation song, and during live performances, Leigh appears on stage holding a sign that bore the text [...] "Gabba Gabba Hey". [...] "Pinhead", the album's longest piece, leads into [...] "Now I Wanna Be a Good Boy", which portrays a confused adolescent wanting to be good, yet also yearning to run away from home. The next song on the album, [...] "Swallow My Pride", was a piece written solely by lead singer Joey Ramone, who states that the concept deals with their record company Sire Records; Tommy used the expression [...] "you gotta swallow your pride" [...] when signing to their record company. [...] "What's Your Game" [...] is one of the band's most melodic songs and was called [...] "wistful" [...] by Marcus. It was written by Joey about how he yearns for a girl to be herself instead of something she's not.|$|E

[...] Rodriguez replied: [...] "In a heartbeat I could tell <b>you,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> my only regrets out of everything I've ever done {{is the way that}} record was mixed. People think that was a raw and energetic record, but what they're hearing is nothing compared to what it truly was before it was glossed over and sent through the mixing mill that was Andy Wallace, who is a wonderful person and a very talented mixing engineer and has done great albums – I'm not trying to offend him....and I understand he had the pressure of the label and all the people who had dreams of it being this grandiose thing, and being played on the radio, which it was, (but) that record is ruined by the mix. [...] I just find it the most passive, plastic....It's the one record I still to this day cannot listen to." [...] The album was included in Rock Sounds 101 Modern Classics list at number 4.
