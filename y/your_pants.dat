5|$|Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Blink-182. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was {{released}} on June 12, 2001, through MCA Records. The band {{had spent much of}} the previous year traveling and supporting their third album Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band's mainstream career. The title is a tongue-in-cheek pun on male masturbation ("take off <b>your</b> <b>pants</b> and jack it"). The cover art has icons for each member of the trio: an airplane ("take off"), a pair of pants, and a jacket. The album's first, limited pressing came in three separate discs reflecting each icon and containing separate bonus tracks and joke songs.|$|E
5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} {{three on the}} US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 313,000 copies. In comparison, Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket debuted at number one and sold more than 350,000 copies in its first week. The album charted at number three, below fellow new album In the Zone by Britney Spears (number one) and above remix album Let It Be... Naked by The Beatles (number five). Blink-182 charted highest in Canada, where it debuted at number one. The album was also {{successful}} in other countries, debuting in the top ten in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over three months at Signature Sound in San Diego. During the sessions, MCA executives pressured the band {{to retain the}} sound that helped their previous album sell millions. As such, Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket continues the pop punk sound that the group honed and made famous, albeit with a heavier tone inspired by groups such as Fugazi and Refused. Regarding lyrics, the album {{has been referred to}} as a concept album chronicling adolescence, with songs dedicated to first dates, fighting authority and teenage parties. Due to differing opinions on direction, the trio worked in opposition to one another for the first time, and the sessions sometimes became contentious.|$|E

The show received a poor critical reception; the Globe and Mail wrote [...] "What could be less fun than licking a metal pole on a January {{morning with a}} crazed Shitzu scrabbling up <b>your</b> <b>pant</b> leg? According to the mostly male TV critics of middling years who write for the papers, the answer is Camilla Scott." ...|$|R

5|$|California debuted {{at number}} one on the US Billboard 200, moving 186,000 {{equivalent}} album units; it sold 172,000 copies in its first week, with the remainder of its unit total reflecting the album's streaming activity and track sales. It marked the band's second number one album and first in over 15 years, when Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket debuted at number one in 2001. It also knocked Drake's Views from the summit after having spent nine weeks at the top. The album became the band's first to top the charts in the United Kingdom, selling 24,000 copies in its debut week. The album also managed to reach higher chart positions worldwide than its predecessor Neighborhoods and outsold both its first-week and total sales in the US. As of December 2016, California has sold 408,000 units in the United States; making it the ninth best selling rock album of 2016. The album re-entered the Billboard 200 at number 17 in the week of the deluxe edition release.|$|E
5|$|Blink-182 {{consisted}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, and by 2004 had {{been regarded as}} the most successful pop punk act of the time since the releases of Enema of the State (1999) and Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket (2001). During its brief hiatus in 2002, DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back and collected several darker musical ideas he viewed unsuitable for the band; the ideas were used in supergroup Box Car Racer's self-titled album, recorded with assistance from Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy. Box Car Racer {{was intended as a}} one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band involving Barker. The side project would cause personal conflicts between DeLonge and Hoppus, the latter was {{not a member of the}} supergroup and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter on Box Car Racer was incorporated into the sound of Blink-182, who explored experimentalist elements on their eponymous fifth studio album (2003). After the success of Box Car Racer, DeLonge declined a solo recording deal offered by Geffen Records because he believed it would cast negative light on Blink-182, but it loomed over the band in addition to growing internal tension.|$|E

The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back, during which time he collected several darker musical ideas he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them into a record, Box Car Racer. The album, recorded {{with the help of}} Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, was intended as a one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit. The side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter and music on Box Car Racer edged its way into the Blink sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, an eponymous fifth studio album (2003). Geffen Records, after the success of Box Car Racer, offered DeLonge a solo recording deal, which he declined, feeling that it would cast a negative shadow over the band. Nevertheless, the possible deal loomed over the band, contributing to internal tension.|$|E

Blink-182 scored a number one album with 2001's Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket. DeLonge experimented with post-hardcore music on Box Car Racer, which formed into a full-fledged band in 2002, but dissolved the following year.

The album was the first album identified as punk rock to debut at number one in the United States. The record shipped enough units to be certified platinum, and was certified double platinum in May 2002. Shortly after the release of Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket, the Federal Trade Commission's report charged MCA and Blink-182 with marketing explicit material to children.

60|$|Before we {{left the}} light-house we were obliged to anoint our shoes {{faithfully}} with tallow, for walking on the beach, in the salt water and the sand, had turned them red and crisp.

It's absurd to ask such a thing. It's like a long distance race. You feel queer at first and your heart thumps and <b>your</b> lungs <b>pant,</b> but if you have only the pluck to keep on, you get your second wind. I'll stick to my work and wait for my second wind. If it never comes--all the same, I'll stick to my work. Two ledgers are done, and I am well on in the third.

500|$|To promote Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket, MCA Records {{released}} three singles, [...] "The Rock Show", [...] "First Date" [...] and [...] "Stay Together for the Kids", all {{of which}} were top ten hits on Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. Blink-182 performed on the Late Show with David Letterman and Late Night with Conan O'Brien in support of Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket. The band also appeared in a MADtv sketch, in which the trio stars as misfits in an all-American 1950s family (a parody Leave It to Beaver). The trio also sanctioned a band biography, Tales from Beneath Your Mom (2001), which was written by the trio and Anne Hoppus (sister of Mark Hoppus).|$|E

6000|$|To {{the eyes}} of the {{civilian}} the first-named of these famous fortifications {{is by far the most}} imposing. The Rock looks so tremendous, that to ascend it, even without the compliment of shells or shot, seems a dreadful task--what would it be when all those mysterious lines of batteries were vomiting fire and brimstone; when all those dark guns that you see poking their grim heads out of every imaginable cleft and zigzag should salute you with shot, both hot and cold; and when, after tugging up the hideous perpendicular place, you were to find regiments of British grenadiers ready to plunge bayonets into <b>your</b> poor <b>panting</b> stomach, and let out artificially the little breath left there? It is a marvel to think that soldiers will mount such places for a shilling--ensigns for five and ninepence--a day: a cabman would ask double the money to go half way! One meekly reflects upon the above strange truths, leaning over the ship's side, and looking up the huge mountain, from the tower nestled at the foot of it to the thin flagstaff at the summit, up to which have been piled the most ingenious edifices for murder Christian science ever adopted. My hobby-horse is a quiet beast, suited for Park riding, or a gentle trot to Putney and back to a snug stable, and plenty of feeds of corn:- it can't abide climbing hills, and is not at all used to gunpowder. Some men's animals are so spirited that the very appearance of a stone-wall sets them jumping at it: regular chargers of hobbies, which snort and say [...] "Ha, ha!"

500|$|More recent reviews have {{subsequently}} been positive. Website AbsolutePunk, in part {{of their}} [...] "Retro Reviews" [...] project in 2011, called Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket the band's best effort; reviewer Thomas Nassiff {{referred to it as}} [...] "a transitory record for Blink-182, but you can't tell just by listening to it on its own. It's developed and it's full – it feels holistically complete, dick jokes and all". In 2005, the album was ranked number 452 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, the Brooklyn-based {{independent}} {{record label}} Mightier Than Sword Records licensed Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket to reissue on 180-gram vinyl, with three additional 7-inch singles featuring the six bonus tracks.

The edited version of Life After Death is notable for having so many tracks omitted that it was able to be condensed to one disc in spite of being a double album.|$|E

500|$|The album had near-immediate success, {{becoming}} the first punk rock-identified record to debut at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 and being certified double platinum in May 2002. The album produced three hit singles — [...] "The Rock Show", [...] "First Date" [...] and [...] "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] — that were top ten hits on modern rock charts. Critical impressions of the record were generally positive, [...] commending the record's expansion on teenage themes; others viewed this as its weakness.

500|$|The band began proper {{tracking}} for drums soon afterwards at Larrabee Studios West and Cello Studios in Hollywood. The {{working relationship}} with Jerry Finn had been so fruitful that the same team was largely engaged for Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket, with Finn producing and Joe McGrath engineering. Finn and McGrath, meticulous in acquiring the best sound, took two days to experiment with microphone placement, different compressors, and varying EQs before committing Barker's drums to tape. The waiting [...] "drove [...] crazy," [...] and Barker recorded his drum parts in [...] "two or three days" [...] while DeLonge and Hoppus watched television upstairs. When the drums were finished, the band returned to San Diego to record the bulk of Take Off <b>Your</b> <b>Pants</b> and Jacket at Signature Sound, where they had also recorded its predecessor. While the band worked with few days off, the sessions also proved to be memorable: [...] "We took long dinner breaks, ate Sombrero burritos, watched Family Guy and Mr. Show, and laughed way too hard." [...] When MCA Records executives eventually traveled to San Diego to hear the highly anticipated follow-up, the trio played a joke by only playing them two joke songs — [...] "Fuck a Dog" [...] and [...] "When You Fucked Hitler" [...] (the subject of which later changed to a grandfather) — and the executives [...] "lost it," [...] in DeLonge's words. MCA {{put pressure on the}} band to maintain the sound that made Enema of the State sell millions; as a result, DeLonge believed the album took no [...] "creative leaps [...] bounds." [...] As such, DeLonge felt creatively stifled and [...] "bummed out" [...] with the label's limitations.|$|E
