40|$|Abstract: The {{motivation}} {{of this study}} is the recent advancement of the Straddle Carrier (S/C). Previously Straddle Carrier (S/C) system was used focusing on container lift on/off due to its lower driving speed than that of (Y/T). Shuttle Carrier is evaluated as an upgraded Straddle Carrier. Recently, however, the driving speed of (S/C) has been improved to the level of <b>Yard</b> <b>Tractor</b> and Trailer systems (Y/T), which is 30 Km per hour which makes (S/C) qualified as terminal in-yard transportation equipment. This paper, therefore, aims to evaluate three types of terminal in-yard transportation equipments such as (Y/T), (AGV) and the advanced (S/C) from economic perspective. The results revealed that by observing the total costs of equipment, (S/C) is a cheaper option than (Y/T) over 20 years, and than (AGV) over 6 years...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} the longer term impact of double cycling on port {{operations}} including crane, vessel, and berth productivity. Double cycling is a technique by which empty crane moves are converted into productive ones. We use a double cycling sequence that is operationally convenient, easy to model, and nearly optimum. We compare the performance of this sequence to those determined by a greedy and a mathematical programming strategy. A framework is developed for analysis, and a simple formula is developed to predict the impact on turn-around time. The formula is an accurate predictor of performance. We show that double cycling can reduce the requirements for <b>yard</b> <b>tractors</b> and drivers. The paper also comments on strategies for altering port operations to support double cycling such as segmenting vessel storage, and streamlining traffic flows. We show that double cycling can reduce operating time by 10 %, improving vessel, crane, and berth productivity. It can reduce by about 20 % the requirement for <b>yard</b> <b>tractors</b> and drivers. Further, for wheeled operations, we suggest a method to reduce the requirement for chassis by about 25 %. We estimate the financial impact of the these benefits, which total approximately $ 65. 00 per container moved. 1 2 ANNE GOODCHIL...|$|R

40|$|As trade among {{countries}} grows, {{the performance}} of container terminals is becoming more important than ever. In this paper, we present a 3 D real-time-visualization containerterminal simulation model based on Plant Simulation, a commercial simulation modeling and execution tool. Our model reproduces every detailed behavior of container-terminal equipment, including not only movements of <b>yard</b> <b>tractors</b> and cranes but also those of trolleys, spreaders, and other machinery. Such low-level representation enables our simulation model to be easily visualized in 3 D form and to offer real-time interactive capability.

Double cycling is a technique by which empty crane moves are converted into productive ones. We use a double cycling sequence that is operationally convenient, easy to model, and nearly optimum. We evaluate the performance of this sequence over single cycling. A framework is developed for analysis, and a simple formula is developed to predict the impact on turn-around time.

40|$|This study aims to {{optimize}} the logistics processes of container terminals. Potentially powerful pipe-flow models of container terminal logistics processes have been neglected to date and modelling of terminals is rare. Because research which adopts a pipe flow and dynamic operational perspective is rare, a case application in Alexandria, Egypt collated empirical container and information flows using interviews and company records to describe its logistics processes and model container and information flows. The methodology used includes qualitative and quantitative methods and a descriptive methodology proceeds sequentially. Primary and secondary data were presented as a pipe flow model to show interrelations between the company’s resources and to identify bottlenecks. Simulation modelling used Simul 8 software. Operational level modelling of both import and export flows simulated the actual inbound and outbound flows of containers from entry to exit. The import logistics process includes activities such as unloading vessels by quay cranes, moving containers by <b>tractors</b> to <b>yard</b> cranes to go for storage where customs procedures take place before exiting the terminal by customer’s truck. The export logistics process includes the activities associated with customers’ trucks, lifters, storage <b>yards,</b> <b>tractors</b> and quay cranes. The model {{takes into account the}} uncertainties in each activity. This study focuses on operational aspects rather than cost issues, and considers container flows rather than vessel flows. Although the simulated model was not generalized, implementation elsewhere is possible. Following successful validation of a base simulation model which reproduces the case company’s historical scenario, scenario testing empowered the case company to pro-actively design and test the impact of operational changes on the entire logistics process. The study evaluates a typical container terminal logistics system including both import and export containers in the presence of multiple uncertainties in terminal operations (e. g. quay crane operations, <b>tractor</b> operations, <b>yard</b> crane operations). Sensitivity testing and scenario analysis can empower terminal managers to make decisions to improve performance, and to guide terminal planners, managers, and operators in testing future investment scenarios before implementation.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} was an in depth investigation of emissions from a number of sources, with emphasis on two under-explored areas. One study delved into the characterization of emissions from wildland fires an increasingly important source due to climate change, and the other undertook a deeper examination of the in-use emissions from heavy duty trucks operating in the port regions of Southern California. An in-depth characterization of emissions from lab scale wildland fires was carried out, including: polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), levoglucosan, anions and cations, elemental and organic carbon. The unique aspect {{of this research was}} the comparison of data from two independent measurement methods; one method used real-time analytical methods and the other collected a sample over time and was analyzed off-line with reference methods. A side-by-side comparison of the two approaches showed significant differences and inaccuracies for many of the analyses by the Aerosol Mass Spectrometer. Further analysis enabled transformation of real time analysis to useful data. Usually marine ports have the highest emissions in a region as many of the sources have weak emission standards. In this research the emissions of criteria and toxic pollutants were measured from the engines in heavy duty trucks representative of those operating in the port regions. An important finding was the emissions measured during real world drive cycles more accurately represented the emission characteristics for the vehicles than the certification cycle or values determined from in-use compliance testing. Further, emissions from NOx control technologies were important to understand as emissions were multiple times higher for near port activities as compared with regional activity. High emissions reduction benefits from the SCR were observed but largely depended on catalyst temperature. Another important analysis completed during this thesis was the emissions factors from <b>yard</b> <b>tractors</b> in the port region for a period of over ten years. Both case studies provide additional insight into the emissions from port sources...|$|R

Os diferentes sistemas do carregamento da madeira foram aplicados aos lotes pseudorreplicados durante as estações das chuvas de 1999 e de 2000. Em 1999, dois tratamentos foram estudados: cabo do carregamento e do trator (um BMP recomendado).

5000|$|On July 21, a {{significant}} tornado and derecho event affected the northeastern United States. The event began with four weak F0 tornadoes in Indiana. Around 3:20 pm, an F1 tornado touched down in Pennsylvania and struck Kinzua Bridge State Park, destroying the 103-year-old Kinzua Bridge. Many trees were downed throughout the park. At about 7:30 pm, a long tracked supercell thunderstorm spawned {{a series of}} tornadoes along a path of 61 miles through New York and Vermont. It produced an F2 that had multiple vortices at one point, and at its strongest near Kinderhook Lake, New York produced considerable damage. A barn was completely destroyed and its contents thrown into Kinderhook Lake. A car was flipped, one person was injured, and trees were snapped as well. Another F2 tornado near Catskill, New York destroyed several homes and injured 7 people. One woman was injured in a mobile home as it was lifted into the air then smashed into the ground. Additional weak tornadoes and wind damage occurred in Vermont. The most powerful tornado {{of the day was}} an F3 that struck near the town of Ellisburg, Pennsylvania, where a farm was completely leveled. Another home was extensively damaged, and a car was thrown 600 <b>yards.</b> A <b>tractor</b> was lofted into a stand of trees as well. Widespread derecho damage occurred as well throughout the region. The derecho itself produced a very intense mesoscale convective vortex, and at times, the entire squall line was wrapped into it, creating a [...] "Super-Derecho", also known as a Landphoon. Overall, the outbreak produced 22 tornadoes.|$|R
40|$|Caspar Creek Experimental Watersheds were {{established}} in 1962 to research the effects of forest management on streamflow, sedimentation, and erosion in the rainfall-dominated, forested watersheds of north coastal California. Currently, 21 stream sites are gaged in the North Fork (473 ha) and South Fork (424 ha) of Caspar Creek. From 1971 to 1973, 65 % of the timber volume in the South Fork was selectively cut and <b>tractor</b> <b>yarded,</b> and from 1985 to 1991, 50 % of the North Fork basin was harvested, mostly as cableyarded clearcuts. Three unlogged tributaries serve as controls. Annual suspended sediment loads changed 331 % after logging the South Fork compared to 89 % for the North Fork and- 40 % to 269 % for North Fork subwatersheds. In clearcut units, storm peaks increased as much as 300 %, but as basin wetness increased, percentage peak flow increases declined. Flow increases are explained by reduced transpiration and interception. Ongoing measurements show a return of peak flows to pretreatment conditions approximately 10 years postharvest, but sediment yields have yet to recover.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} road {{building}} and timber harvest on storm flow were evaluated at the North and South Forks of Caspar Creek in north coastal California. From 1963 through 1975, {{a total of}} 174 storms that produced peak discharges larger than 0. 016 L s- 1 ha- 1 in the untreated North Fork were studied. Storms producing flows this size and larger occur about 14 times each year and about 10 percent of the time. They are responsible for 83 percent of the annual water discharge and transport 99 percent of the suspended sediment. Selection cutting and <b>tractor</b> <b>yarding</b> second-growth redwood and Douglas-fir in the 424 ha South Fork did not significantly change peak streamflows that occur about eight times a year — those larger than about 1 L s- 1 ha- 1. For flows smaller than 1 L s- 1 ha- 1, the first peaks in the fall increased by 300 percent after logging. The effect of logging on peak flow was best predicted by the percent of area logged divided by the sequential storm number, beginning with the first storm in the fall. For example, the second storm of the fall produced half the response to logging than the first storm. In 1985, {{the second stage of}} the Caspar Creek stud...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 A {{problem of}} {{interest}} to forest managers is the optimum arrangement of truck roads and landings for economical logging operations. This problem becomes more complex if,a combined yarding and swinging operation is considered. I,t is possible to formulate a mathematical model to express the cost per unit volume for a particular configuration of truck roads, landings, and swing roads arranged to accommodate this type of harvest operation. Then, any of several numerical methods may be employed to assess the sought-for optimum configuration. The parameters of interest are the truck road spacing, landing spacing, and swing road length that produce the smallest logging cost. This paper critically examines several assumptions made in formulation of the problem, including <b>yarding</b> cost computation, <b>tractor</b> movement patterns, and average yarding distance. This paper uses a numerical method not frequently employed with constrained objective functions: Newton Multivariate Gradient Iteration. A computer program was developed to implement the iteration procedure, using a Hewlett-Packard 9830 A Desktop Computer. The solution procedure reduced iterations required for convergence from several thousand experienced with exhaustive enumeration techniques to less than thirteen. The use of this gradient method, observations on its behavior, and insights into the analytical approach to a complex problem are the subjects of this paper...|$|R

Mass-wasting has been predominantly associated with roads, landings, and tractor skid trails in the South Fork. Accelerated mass-wasting and renewed sediment mobilization in the South Fork have occurred since 1998. Peak flow increases detected following North Fork logging are attributable to reduced canopy interception and transpiration. These recovered to pretreatment levels about 10 years after logging, followed by renewed increases from pre-commercial thinning. Annual sediment loads increased 89 % in the partially clearcut North Fork and 123 % to 238 % in 4 of 5 clearcut sub-basins.

40|$|Purpose Wood pellet {{heating systems}} are {{considered}} {{as an essential}} component of European plans to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The goal of this analysis was to estimate and compare the environmental impacts and the costs of the production of packed wood pellets. Two pellet production systems, using roundwood logs (case 1) and mainly sawdust (case 2), have been analysed in 2015 in Basilicata region (Southern Italy). Methods A life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis was applied to calculate the environmental impact indicators of each system, whilst a life cycle cost (LCC) analysis was implemented to evaluate the pellets’ cost production. Hence, the functional unit chosen was 1 t of produced pellets. The system boundaries considered for the purpose of the current investigation were from the tree felling to the pellet packaging. In particular, the following activities were considered: motor-manual felling and delimbing with a chainsaw, timber <b>yarding</b> with a <b>tractor</b> along the forest track, loading and transportation of the logs to the collection point, transportation of timber to the factories for a distance of 35 km, pellet production and pellet packaging in low-density polyethylene bags with a total weight of 15 kg bag− 1. Results and discussion The production of 1 t of pellets emitted about 83 kg of CO 2 eq in case 1 and 38 kg in case 2. In addition, 2. 7 kg of SO 2 eq and 0. 005 kg of PO 34 -eq were produced in case 1 and 1. 4 kg of SO 2 eq and 0. 002 kg of PO 34 -eq in case 2.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A 1. 5 ha mixed conifer {{stand in}} the Blue Mountains of Oregon was intensively {{examined}} {{to assess the impact}} of logging disturbance on soils and herbaceous vegetation. Sampling was conducted six years after much of the timber overstory was removed in a shelterwood cut and <b>yarded</b> by crawler <b>tractor.</b> A year after harvest slash was machine-piled and burned. Skid trails and other areas of disturbance were seeded with a mixture of perennial grasses. Logging impact was divided into five "disturbance classes'* as treatments: general, berm, slash fire ring, skid trail, and undisturbed. Analysis of variance was used to test treatment differences. Characteristics of skid trails were analyzed separately from those of non-skid trail areas. Soil compaction was evident on skid trails from substantially lower rates of infiltration and saturated hydraulic conductivity (SHC), and a higher average soil strength, relative to undisturbed areas. Skid trail compaction probably resulted from mixing of denser subsoils with the low-density volcanic ash soils at the surface, and from compression by tractor activity. Bulk density of skid trails was not statistically different from that of undisturbed areas. Soil densities of all classes of disturbance were generally lower than 0. 9 g/cm³. Non-skid trail areas were not compacted. Soil water conductance rates markedly differed among disturbance classes, but were considerably higher than storm intensities projected for the region. High sample variability of both infiltration and SHC rates made interpreation of statistical comparisons among treatments difficult. Some watershed protection values were diminished on the disturbed areas. Litter cover of skid trails, general disturbance areas, and berms was 27, 45, and 68 percent lower, respectively, than that of undisturbed areas. Depth of litter decreased correspondingly among the disturbed treatments. Litter was nearly absent on the fire rings. Another agent in soil stabilization, belowground biomass, was two-thirds less on skid trails, in comparision with undisturbed areas. Amounts of soil organic matter in the surface 3 cm were significantly lower for the four types of ground disturbance, relative to undisturbed areas; however, organic matter was higher at some subsurface levels of berms, fire rings, and skid trails. Bulk density of non-skid trail soils was inversely correlated with organic matter content. There were no statistically significant differences among treatments for soil water retained at four potentials, for coarse mineral fragment content, or for fine earth particle size distribution. Aboveground vegetation production of the seeded skid trails was 66 percent greater than that of undisturbed areas. Understory plant cover of skid trails and undisturbed areas was equivalent. Correlation between aboveground herbaceous production and soil strength at the 5 - 10 cm depth of skid trails was not statistically significant...|$|R
