25|$|Depending {{on whether}} selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer {{that is not}} achievable. The {{theory is that the}} extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (as far as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> go to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.|$|E

2500|$|According to Borlaug, [...] "Africa, {{the former}} Soviet republics, and the cerrado {{are the last}} frontiers. After they are in use, the world will have no {{additional}} sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, unless <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> level whole forests, which you should not do. So, future food-production increases {{will have to come}} from higher yields. And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before".|$|E

He {{grew up in a}} catholic church but has said he didn't have a personal relationship with God until about 2013. In his own words 'To cut a long story short, ...we were touring Sri Lanka and myself, AB De Villiers, Faf Du Plessis and David Miller started a little Bible study together in the national team. One of the sessions was called ‘Salvation’ {{and at the end of}} the chapter it asked you the question of whether <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> commit yourself to God. On that night all four of us committed our lives to him, this all happened in a marine boat place in Sri Lanka somewhere. Months later I got baptised along with my wife.' ...|$|E

There are a lot of things about {{yourself}} that you don't want to discuss, therefore let's discuss those that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> discuss." [...] She has blanket permission to withhold anything and everything. But she did come to discuss things. And therefore she starts discussing this, discussing that. And it's always [...] "Well, this is all right to talk about." [...] And before she's finished, she has mentioned everything. And each new item - [...] "Well, this really isn't so important that I have to withhold it. I can use the withholding permission for more important matters." [...] Simply a hypnotic technique. To make them respond to the idea of withholding, and to respond to the idea of communicating.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{received}} polarizing reviews. Rock Sound {{gave the}} album an 8/10 rating, remarking that [...] "It {{may not be}} perfect, but Korn have thrown caution to the wind and set out an impressive template for a future sound, for a band doing that nearly 20 years into their career, they deserve your respect". They do note however that the album sounds [...] "a little formulaic" [...] and [...] "monotonous" [...] at times. Spin gave the album a 7/10, saying [...] "Thing is, dubstep's slithering textures actually suit Davis' demented croon". Henry Northmore from The List gave the album a rating of 4/5 saying that [...] "the purists (both metal and dubstep) will probably hate it, but if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> have your brain assaulted from every direction by a new Frankensteinian metal/beats hybrid, you’ll find an album packed with pure adrenaline". Allmusic gave the album 4/5 saying that [...] "despite all the electronics, there’s no mistaking The Path of Totality as a Korn album...and one of their better ones to boot".|$|E
2500|$|The {{proposed}} book outraged the Goldman family, who {{criticized the}} publisher for [...] "helping a murderer get his voice out there." [...] According to lawyers for Ron Goldman's family, the Goldmans planned {{to attempt to}} garnish any earnings Simpson might get from the book. Fred Goldman, Ron's father, was awarded $33.5 million by a jury in 1997 for the wrongful death of his son. However, Simpson never paid this judgment due to a California law that prevents pensions from being used to satisfy judgments, {{and the fact that}} the bulk of his income comes from his NFL pension. Goldman described the book and television interview as [...] "an all-time low" [...] and [...] "morally reprehensible to me... to think <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> give somebody airtime about how they would murder two people." [...] Patricia Schroeder, president and chief executive of the Association of American Publishers, felt that the book would [...] "stir an awful lot of debate and make the culture take a real look at itself, and that may not be unhealthy".|$|E
2500|$|While {{the final}} mention of Elijah in the Hebrew Bible {{is in the}} Book of Chronicles, the Christian Bible's {{ordering}} of the books of the Septuagint places the Book of Malachi, which prophesies a messiah, before the Gospels [...] and means that Elijah's final Old Testament appearance is in the Book of Malachi, where it is written, [...] "Lo, I will send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes." [...] That day is described as the burning of a great furnace, [...] "... {{so that it will}} leave them neither root nor branch." [...] In Christianity it is traditionally believed that Elijah's appearance during the transfiguration of Jesus fulfilled this prophecy. Moreover, in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus identifies John the Baptist as the spiritual successor to Elijah: [...] "and if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accept it, he is Elijah who is to come." [...] Finally, the verses in Malachi are believed to indicate that Elijah has a role in the end-times, immediately before the second coming of Jesus.|$|E
