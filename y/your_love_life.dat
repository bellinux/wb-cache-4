5000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} strip her down. She's {{actually}} quite raw, womanly and sexy. There's a different side {{to her that}} doesn't come across normally in her videos. That's what I asked her to do and that's what she did. I gave her Björk a Sony Mini DV camera {{and asked her to}} shoot her own private scenes ... She asked me to make a film about her love life, so I merely gave it back to her and said, 'Film <b>your</b> <b>love</b> <b>life.</b> —Nick Knight on the video's development. [...] Tired of music videos which featured the singer looking to the camera and lip-synching throughout, Chaudoir suggested having Björk lip-synch and look into the camera only for some of the last lines. He also suggested using a track so they could move closer to her as she sings these lines or move closer before she sings them—"so it's like a reveal of her", he said. There was not a script, so some improvisation made it to the final cut. Since blue-screening and CGI work were not involved, Chaudoir did not use diffusion or consulted with post-production, and he arrived with only a few assistants—a gaffer, loader, grip, focus puller, and some electricians. [...] "Basically what I was asked to do and what I thought I'd be able to do is more or less there. It would have benefited from being simplified down to a much more bold and direct visualization of what she was trying to do. I think we were too subtle in that", Knight said.|$|E
5000|$|After {{appearing}} uncredited {{in over a}} dozen movies Hudson got his {{break in}} 1951's Hard, Fast and Beautiful. He appeared in a few other movies and TV shows before being cast as Special Agent Mike Andrews in I Led Three Lives. In 1954, while also still doing I Led Three Lives, Hudson was cast in the television serial Rocky Jones, Space Ranger as Ranger Clark. After his stint as Clark on Rocky Jones Hudsons parts started to be more in the genres of Science fiction, Fantasy, and Monster movies, especially the latter with starring roles in such films as The She Creature, The Amazing Colossal Man and, perhaps most famously, as the husband in 1958's cult classic Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. In 1964 he was cast as the doomed first Captain of the Seaview, John Phillips, in the pilot episode of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. In 1965 he was back on Voyage as a different character in an episode infamous among fans of the series due to its heavy use of archive footage from the pilot episode (specifically a scene with Hudson and Richard Basehart leaving the Nelson Institute, being chased and attacked by a helicopter and which ended {{with the death of}} Hudson's character and the car going off a cliff aflame) giving him the dubious honour of being the only person [...] "killed" [...] on that show twice. In 1966 he was cast as a reporter {{in the second part of}} the first Television appearance of Mr. Freeze in a first-season episode of Batman titled [...] "Rats Like Cheese". From then on he had several small parts in various movies and TV shows, his last part being Mr. Dunn in 1971's How's <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Life?.</b>|$|E
