500|$|Friction emerged at McLaren {{over the}} race weekend. Fernando Alonso {{publicly}} criticised the power unit provided by local company Honda. When being overtaken by Max Verstappen on lap 27, Alonso yelled [...] "GP2 engine, GP2!" [...] {{on the team}} radio, comparing his power unit with those of Formula One's feeder series. Alonso elaborated after the race, saying: [...] "I feel embarrassed when I'm racing sometimes because it's frustrating {{when you see the}} other cars making mistakes, going off the racing line, getting sideways. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror on the straight to look for them and they are already side by side with you. The deficit we have on power is like another category." [...] Team CEO Ron Dennis in turn criticised Alonso for his outspoken words, saying: [...] "It doesn't show the professionalism I would like all our drivers to show." [...] Jenson Button had expounded the problems of the power unit on team radio as well, lamenting the fact that other cars had been able to pass him into 130R corner. The row in the team, which The Daily Telegraph described as being a [...] "complete meltdown", came amidst speculation about the future of both drivers. Ron Dennis admitted publicly to not having dealt with the question of Jenson Button's role in [...] earlier, following much debate over the driver's future. However, speculation ended when Button was confirmed as a McLaren driver for 2016 just five days later. After the race, Alonso had also left his future with the team open, but made it clear a day later that he intended to end his career with the team, writing: [...] "No one should have any doubt that I have three years with McLaren and my career in F1 will end with this team, hopefully winning everything." [...] About his comments on the team radio he said: [...] "We keep working hard. We all want to win and sometimes transmit the team radios, but it should be private chats." ...|$|E

At that dinner, Brown touted Jones as [...] "what you should see every day when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror {{in the early morning}} hours... a combination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Angela Davis, Albert Einstein... Chairman Mao". Harvey Milk, who spoke at political rallies at the Temple, wrote to Jones after one such visit: [...] "Rev Jim, It may take me many a day to come back down from the high that I reach today. I found something dear today. I found a sense of being that makes up for all the hours and energy placed in a fight. I found what you wanted me to find. I shall be back. For I can never leave." ...|$|E

Jackson said, [...] "people say to me: `Okay, you've {{got to start}} eating more. You're too thin.' But when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, you see something totally different." [...] She continued, [...] "I had swung so far in one direction, I never thought I could swing {{so far in the}} other. You're losing weight and getting smaller, and I'd still say to myself I could afford to lose a little more". However, she refused professional guidance, reluctant to examination. She briefly saw a psychologist before an encounter with a spiritual guru, who aided her emotional recovery. Jackson recounted, [...] "we went to this very spiritual place in the desert... That's where I met him, this cowboy. He's in his fifties, and he's full of wisdom. He's an older man who has experienced a great deal, and he {{used to be in the}} music industry, on a smaller scale. He even understood that side of my life". She also began using coffee enemas to remove [...] "sad cells", leading to media scrutiny. The trauma lead to a brief duration of sexual questioning, saying [...] "Am I curious? I think every girl has wondered". Jackson culminated the experiences into the album's subject matter, recording over two years.|$|E

6000|$|What induced such a jolly fellow as Frank Berry {{to marry}} Miss Angelica Catacomb {{no one can}} tell. He met her, he says, at a ball at Hampton Court, where his {{regiment}} was quartered, and where, to this day, lives [...] "her aunt Lady Pash." [...] She alludes perpetually in conversation to that celebrated lady; and if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Baronetage" [...] to the pedigree of the Pash family, you may see manuscript notes by Mrs. Frank Berry, relative to them and herself. Thus, when you see in print that Sir John Pash married Angelica, daughter of Graves Catacomb, Esquire, in a neat hand you find written, AND SISTER OF THE LATE SIR GEORGE CATACOMB, OF BAKER STREET, PORTMAN SQUARE: [...] "A.B." [...] follows of course. It is a wonder how fond ladies are of writing in books, and signing their charming initials! Mrs. Berry's before-mentioned little gilt books are scored with pencil-marks, or occasionally at the margin with a!--note of interjection, or the words [...] "TOO TRUE, A.B." [...] and so on. Much may be learned with regard to lovely woman by {{a look at the}} books she reads in; and I had gained no inconsiderable knowledge of Mrs. Berry by the ten minutes spent in the drawing-room, while she was at her toilet in the adjoining bedchamber.|$|E

Though I am mightily pleased at that, I am more pleased still that among those on board was that fellow Markham. He fought like a tiger. I reckon he knew that his neck was in a noose, for he would, of course, have heard from his friends here that the matter of Faulkner's murder had been cleared up, and there was a warrant out against him. Well, he got a pistol shot in his chest, and after it was all over we found that he was pretty near gone. As soon as a lantern was put to his face two or three of the men knew him at once, and I went up to him. He was pretty well past speaking, but as I stooped over him he said, 'You have got me this time, Captain Downes, and no mistake. Well, it don't make much matter; I was getting sick of the life. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pocket of my jacket when I am gone, and you will find a letter there.
