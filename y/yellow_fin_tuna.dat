Fleet Structure Following {{the development of the}} domestic longlining in late 1990 s the tuna fleet increased to peak in 2002 and 2003 and has subsequently declined due to poor catch rate and high operation cost. During the second half of 2004 and whole of 2005, the number of licensed tuna longline vessels were actively fishing were only 12 and 9 respectively.

The main fishing ground is Indian Ocean southern part of this province.   Several source of data has been collected regularly. Data analysis comprised of monthlycatch and effort data samples based onport monitoring program during 2012 to 2015. The result showed the diclining of CPUE of <b>yellow</b> <b>fin</b> and skipjack <b>tuna</b> presumably related to fishing intensity of fleets and its variability that landed in PPP Labuhan Lombok.   The increasing CPUE of skipjack tuna in 2014 was predicted due to increasing aggregation around the FADs.

The main species concerned are the oceanic skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis and to a comparatively lesser extent the <b>yellow</b> <b>fin</b> <b>tuna</b> Neothunnus macropterus.

40|$|Plankton {{samples and}} visual census from December 1995 to December 1998 were {{obtained}} to study adult and larvae assemblages of fish at El Bajo Espíritu Santo (EBES) seamount. Tagging experiments of <b>yellow</b> <b>fin</b> <b>tuna</b> {{were carried out}} from April to September 1998. Records of tagged fish at EBES were registered until February 2000. Five oceanographic cruises were also carried out. Visual census of adult fish suggest that El Niño conditions favor migration of tropical species to EBES. Diversity index showed higher values of 4. 5 compared to non-El Niño years of 3. 5 in 1996. An increased number of species, 85, in 1998 was observed in comparison to 53 of 1996. Larval fish assemblages indicate a decreased diversity index values during El Niño conditions. However, more than 50 % of larval fishes during El Niño conditions belong to mesopelagic species of tropical affinity. Rarefaction curves of larval fish showed higher than expected number of species during non-El Niño years. Conversely, rarefaction curves of El Niño years showed lower than expected number of species. Two groups of samples were obtained from cluster analysis, corresponding to non-El Niño and El Niño conditions. Results of tagged <b>yellow</b> <b>fin</b> <b>tuna</b> showed residence on a daily basis, and homing with absence of 15 days. During El Niño the mixed layer deepened to 70 m {{in the area of}} EBES.
