500|$|On 4 September, Elliot {{sailed to}} Kowloon in the cutter Louisa for food supplies, {{accompanied}} by the small-armed schooner Pearl, and a pinnace from the Volage of Captain Smith. Upon arrival, they encountered three anchored Chinese men-of-war junks, whose presence prevented the regular supplies of food. Elliot sent interpreter Karl Gutzlaff in a small boat with two men to the centremost junk, which Elliot thought was the commanding vessel due to its size and superior equipment. Gutzlaff carried two documents that he translated from Elliot. They included demands for food shipments to be restored and a plea not to repeat the poisoning of the colony's water springs. After a Chinese spokesman read the messages, he told Gutzlaff that they lacked the authority to renew food sales but was willing to report the matter to his superiors. Gutzlaff responded, [...] "Suppose you were without food {{for any length of}} time, and debarred from buying it, would <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the case was transmitted to the higher authorities, or procure for yourself the same by every means in your power?" [...] to which they exclaimed, [...] "Certainly nobody will like to starve, and necessity has no law." [...] They then directed him to another junk where a naval officer was said to reside. The local Chinese commander was Lieutenant-Colonel Lai Enjue.|$|E

The first {{prerequisite}} to a swindle {{is to be}} objective enough to realize early on {{when you have a}} lost position and start playing for a swindle while your position still has resources.

2500|$|This {{allegation}} surfaced after Stone {{announced he}} would no longer direct the Weinstein Company's Guantanamo TV series following the revelation of the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct allegations. Stone also drew criticism for defending Weinstein the day before he announced his departure from Guantanamo at the Busan International Film Festival as well, claiming [...] "I'm a believer that <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> this thing gets to trial. I believe a man shouldn't be condemned by a vigilante system. It's not easy what he's going through, either. During that period he was a rival. I never did business with him and didn't really know him. I've heard horror stories on everyone in the business, so I'm not going to comment on gossip. I'll wait and see, which {{is the right thing to}} do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you knew}} what {{threatened}} us?" [...] Osborn remarked, rather sharply. [...] "If so, it's curious <b>you</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> I sent for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you had {{so little}} regard for me that <b>you</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> the eve {{of what was to}} be our marriage, and then, {{laughing}} at my shame, ran off to marry him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you have}} had your {{say it would be}} better if <b>you</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> after supper," [...] he said. [...] "You see, one thing at one time is quite enough for Harry, and he really isn't in the least uncivil when you {{understand}} him. Still, it's no use trying to make him listen when he doesn't want to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear child, don't be foolish. It's {{too late}} {{to go over the}} harbour tonight. They won't be expecting <b>you.</b> <b>Wait</b> <b>until</b> the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> dark?" [...] asked Clayton. [...] "Miss Porter {{must not}} see this thing done. We were to have been married, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Wyllard, [...] "I {{will come}} with you. I have left two comrades a little further down the ravine. Will <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> I bring them?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now <b>you</b> must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> Captain Villaire returns," [...] {{said the}} leader of the party in French. He will be here before daylight." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Say, Nat, don’t make {{a public}} {{exhibition}} of yourself,” he said, {{in a low}} tone. “If you’ve got anything against Dave, why don’t <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> we are alone?” ...|$|E
60|$|B. B. Young man: if <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> Mrs Dubedat comes back, {{you will}} be able to write an article on How It Feels to be Turned Out of the House.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] ejaculated Mr. Marston. [...] "A very proper thing! <b>You</b> needn't <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> Mr. Barclay {{sends you}} his order. I'll arrange your ticket." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is the truth, Citizen Representative," [...] said Phelippes. [...] "And as for {{the prisoners}} in Le Bouffay, <b>you</b> will <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the law condemns them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely <b>you</b> can <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> {{have changed}} your garments? Your life, I take it, is of more account than {{the loss of}} a few moments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> I {{call the}} porter," [...] said Roger, {{and touched the}} push-button. [...] "This gentleman will have his berth made up," [...] he went on, as the porter appeared.|$|E
6000|$|The man nodded. [...] "It {{looks that}} way now, but <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> I've fixed things up," [...] said he. [...] "Then {{if you feel like}} walking eight miles I'll go on with you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't do that!" [...] exclaimed the Shaggy Man, earnestly. [...] "It's {{against the}} Law {{to pick a}} six-leaved clover. <b>You</b> must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> get Ozma's consent." ...|$|R

2500|$|Commenting on {{fighting}} the young Ali, George Chuvalo said: [...] "He {{was just so}} damn fast. When he was young, he moved his legs and hands at the same time. He threw his punches {{when he was in}} motion. He'd be out of punching range, and as he moved into range he'd already begun to throw the punch. So if <b>you</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> he got into range to punch back, he beat you every time." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Easterfield uttered {{an exclamation}} of horror. [...] "Choose!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "What have {{you to do}} with choosing? I don't think you are much like other girls, but I did think you had enough womanly qualities to make <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> you are chosen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{know what}} to do about me?" [...] Rupert {{suggested}} with the smile Marston disliked. [...] "Well, suppose <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> you get there.

6000|$|... "Is he? Just <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> {{something}} goes wrong and you'll find out quick enough.

6000|$|... "Aye, aye," [...] said Hardy, with {{careless}} contempt; [...] "I'll {{tell him}} {{to keep out of}} your way. But I should advise <b>you</b> to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> I have sailed." ...|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{discovering}} a superior enemy in the morning, <b>you</b> should <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> dark to attack, thus hiding your lack of numbers {{and using the}} night to aid your retreat.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you?" [...] {{she asked}} once more. [...] "Can you dive {{when they come}} too close? Otherwise you could not escape if <b>you</b> <b>waited</b> here <b>until</b> I reached the bottom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lazzaro," [...] said she, {{and there}} was an {{intensity}} almost fierce in her low tones, [...] "moments are flying and you stand here reasoning with me, and bidding me weigh what is already weighed for all time. Will <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> escape is rendered impossible, until we are discovered, before you will decide to save me, and to grasp with both hands this happiness of ours that is not twice offered in a lifetime?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When you book your passage you {{can arrange}} for the buggy {{to be taken}} up,' said the storekeeper. 'You might put all the things in it. We shall put all the small items in boxes, and then lash the {{tarpaulin}} well over everything; they will travel safely enough, {{and you will have}} no trouble about them till you {{get to the end of}} the journey.

6000|$|... "You {{have spoken}} well, White Lily," [...] said she. [...] "Why should <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> {{it is their}} {{pleasure}} to pluck you. See, already the glare of their fire beats upon the tree-trunks, {{and you can hear}} the howlings of those who thirst for your blood. If you die by your own hands, they will be robbed of their spectacle, and their chief will have lost his bride. So you will be the victors in the end, and they the vanquished. You have said rightly, White Lily. There lies the only path for you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sakr-el-Bahr laughed. [...] "Thou'lt tell me next that I am afraid. Yet I should counsel <b>thee</b> to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> thou hast smelt {{blood and}} powder, and learnt {{precisely}} what fear is." ...|$|R
