2500|$|Roberts once stated: [...] "You're {{going to}} be {{unemployed}} if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> just have {{to sit around and}} wait for the muse to land on your shoulder." [...] She concentrates on one novel at a time, writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation. Rather than begin with an outline or plot summary, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting. She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. After finishing the first draft, Roberts goes {{back to the beginning of}} the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the [...] "texture and color" [...] of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.|$|E

6000|$|Lord Loring looked unfeignedly surprised. [...] "My dear fellow, do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are {{the sort}} of man who impresses a woman unfavorably at first sight? For once in your life, indulge in the amiable {{weakness}} of doing yourself justice--and find a better reason for Miss Eyrecourt's embarrassment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> won't?" [...] he queried smilingly. [...] "Well, {{on second}} thoughts, you may take your choice. Either {{you will do}} as I have bidden you, or you will sit for three days with"--Mr. Perkins' eye skimmed over the school-room to find a boy who was sitting alone--"with Cyrus Brisk." ...|$|E
6000|$|He drew a long breath. [...] "They're a bit affectionate, you know," [...] he murmured, {{stroking}} his beardless chin in hesitation. [...] "She's a hot 'un, Sissie is.

But if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{can give the}} other Johnnie a cut {{on the head with}} her letters--well, in the interests of true love, which never DOES run smooth, I don't mind letting you have a squint, as my friend, at one of her charming billy-doos." ...|$|E
6000|$|After this speech, {{he walked}} {{about the room}} in a {{confused}} manner for some minutes, and then addressed himself to Amy.

You do your little act, and because the stage is large and the house is fine, you fancy you are not of that sad brotherhood which aims to please in humbler places, with perhaps cruder means--" ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2010, Harrison {{was named}} in the 2010 All Stars {{football}} team {{as a result of}} his performances for Sligo during the 2010 season. He joined Michael Kearins (1971), Barnes Murphy (1974) and Eamon O'Hara (2002) on the list of Sligo footballers to have won All Star awards. Harrison was selected at left corner back in the All Star team rather than in his customary right corner back position. Speaking after hearing of the All Star he said [...] "when I was called out I couldn't believe it. We were jumping up and down. I'm absolutely delighted, The All-Star is a really coveted award, but <b>you</b> never <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will be up there someday, so to win one is an amazing feeling." [...] He later picked up a GPA award.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can mystify me?" [...] {{she asked}} ironically. [...] "Mr. Engelman {{has done more}} than send the flowers--he has written me a too-flattering note. And I," [...] she said, glancing {{carelessly}} at the mantelpiece, on which a letter was placed, [...] "have written the necessary acknowledgment. It would be absurd to stand on ceremony with the harmless old gentleman who met us on the bridge. How fat he is! and what a wonderful pipe he carries--almost as fat as himself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Ralph," [...] said Miriam, [...] "you {{ought to}} {{consider}} the circumstances. She is not a common Irishwoman, or German. She is an American, and has always taken her meals with the family in which she lived. I could not ask her {{to eat in the}} kitchen. You know, Mike takes his meals there since Phoebe has gone. Indeed, Ralph, I cannot expect her to do a thing that she has never done in her life, before. Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would mind it? You work with Mike in the field, and you don't mind that, and this girl is very respectable, I assure you." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a pause, {{and then}} a very mischievous ring in the voice that replied: [...] "It {{certainly}} is a personal question, and it is another blessing of this invention that you'll never know whether I am blushing or not; but I forgive you, for I never before spoke to any one I had never seen--and I suppose it's confusion. But do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would know me--the REAL one--any better? It is the real person who thinks and speaks, not the outward semblance that we see, which very often unfairly either attracts or repels us? We can always SHOW ourselves at our best, but we must, at last, reveal our true colors through our thoughts and speech. Isn't it better {{to begin with the}} real thing first?" ...|$|E

And yet--am I severe? I am willing, for instance, to overlook their raid upon a native village, and the ransom they demanded for a native inspector! I have overlooked their taking the horses out of my carriage for their own use. I am content also to believe that my fowls meekly succumb to jungle fever and cholera.

As a matter of fact, though, I think we always kept believing. ...I think they tried everything to make it even harder for us, not just the others but also the circumstances: as I said, with the damage on the car, losing radio, in these conditions, when communication is so crucial, stopping just a lap too early, not having the tires ready because communication wasn't there. Where do <b>you</b> start, <b>really?</b> I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> guys had your show {{and we had to}} really fight until the end." [...] Sebastian Vettelduring the post-race press conference. The race received widespread acclaim, with The Guardian calling it a [...] "rollercoaster". Three-time world champions Niki Lauda and Nelson Piquet stated that they had never seen a race like it. German magazine Der Spiegel deemed the race [...] "spectacular" [...] and [...] "historic" [...] due to the record-breaking 147 successful overtaking manoeuvres carried out during the race. Sebastian Vettel himself called it his [...] "toughest race ever".|$|R
5000|$|In the {{original}} short story, {{the plot is}} resolved differently. Norma presses the button, and receives the money - after her husband dies in a train incident where Arthur is pushed onto the tracks (the money was the no-fault insurance settlement, which is $50,000 instead of the $200,000 in the Twilight Zone episode).

40|$|An informational {{interview}} involves {{talking with}} people who are currently working in the field {{to gain a better understanding}} of an occupation or industry [...] and to build a network of contacts in that field. When you are considering entering or changing to a certain career path, it just makes all kinds of sense to talk to people in that field. Yet most people never do. They trust their professors, textbooks, or romantic notions about professions gleaned from TV or movies. When <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> about it, <b>you</b> miss out on an incredible opportunity if you fail to research your career field by talking to people in it. The best way to learn what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want in a career is to talk with the people in that career field. Because of the exploratory nature of informational interviews, they are particularly effective for those, such as college students, who are just embarking on their careers. They are also an excellent tool for career-changers who want to find out what’s involved in the career they are considering entering. Even for those who don’t wish to change careers but do want to change jobs, informational interviews can be a helpful way of discovering what working for other companies would be like. An informational interview is not the same as a job interview by any means, but it is probably the most effective form of networking there is. You accomplish several things when you go out on informational interviews: You obtain a great deal of information about your career field and the skills needed to do that job effectively. Yo...|$|R
6000|$|... ... For the 'Athenaeum,' I {{have always}} held it as a journal, first--in {{the very first}} rank--both in ability and integrity; and knowing Mr. Dilke is the 'Athenaeum,' I could make no mistake in my {{estimation}} of himself. I have personal reasons for gratitude to both him and his journal, and I have always {{felt that it was}} honorable to me to have them. Also, I do not at all think that because a woman is a woman, she is on that account to be spared the ordinary risks of the arena in literature and philosophy. I think no such thing. Logical chivalry would be still more radically debasing to us than any other. It is not therefore at all as a Harriet Martineau, but as a thinking and feeling Martineau (now don't laugh), that I hold her to have been hardly used in the late controversy. And, if you don't laugh at that, don't be too grave either, with the thought of your own share and position in the matter; because, as must be obvious to everyone (yourself included), you did everything possible to you to prevent the catastrophe, and no man and no friend could have done better. My brother George told me of his conversation with you at Mr. Lough's, but are you not mistaken in fancying that she blames you, that she is cold with <b>you?</b> I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> must be. Why, if she is displeased with you she must be unjust, and is she ever unjust? I ask you. I should imagine not, but then, with all my insolence of talking of her as my friend, I only admire and love her at a distance, in her books and in her letters, and do not know her face to face, and in living womanhood at all. She wrote to me once, and since we have corresponded; and as in her kindness she has called me her friend, I leap hastily at an unripe fruit, perhaps, and echo back the word. She is your friend in a completer, or, at least, a more ordinary sense; and indeed it is impossible for me to believe without strong evidence that she could cease to be your friend on such grounds as are apparent. Perhaps she does not write because she cannot contain her wrath against Mr. Dilke (which, between ourselves, she cannot, very well), and respects your connection and regard for him. Is not that a 'peradventure' worth considering? I am sure that you have no right to be uneasy in any case.|$|R

On {{the day of the}} wedding, Skylar kidnaps Heather, one of Miss Meadows's students, from her house, forcing Miss Meadows to go to Skylar's house (wearing her wedding dress) to try to stop him, only to end up a captive herself. When she manages to free Heather and struggle with Skylar over her gun, the sheriff, passing by after leaving the church, sees Heather running from Skylar's house as she shouts for help. Meanwhile, Skylar takes Miss Meadows' gun from her purse, aims it at her and asks, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can save the world? Well, try saving your self first!" [...] Just then, the sheriff arrives and fatally shoots Skylar in the head. Seeing Miss Meadows' gun still clutched in Skylar's hand, he notes [...] "it has his prints now". He and Miss Meadows proceed back to the church.|$|E
5000|$|Joining the PSD in 2000, Niculescu-Mizil {{was elected}} to {{represent}} Bucharest's Ferentari neighborhood in Parliament in 2008, and served on its committees for foreign affairs and Romanians abroad during her first term. In 2010, protesting what she saw as the [...] "fraudulent" [...] adoption of a pensions law, she appeared in Parliament in a prison uniform borrowed from the Jilava penitenciary. Prior to addressing legislators, President Traian Băsescu asked her, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> needed to create a circus, madam?" [...] In March 2012, after two years heading the Călăraşi County chapter of the PSD, she was removed from that position after clashing with the party leadership, objecting to its decision to dismiss Marian Vanghelie {{as head of the}} Bucharest party organization. Days later, she resigned from the party, alleging that it was no longer promoting advantages for ordinary people, instead advancing the personal interests of certain of its leaders. For the 2012 election, she ran on the lists of the Social Liberal Union, backed by the PSD, and won a new term. Initially assigned to the culture committee, she was later placed on the foreign policy committee. In October 2014, she received a three-year suspended sentence in a conflict of interest case that arose after she hired her mother in her parliamentary office. The following March, when a corruption investigation against Vanghelie began, she resigned from the Chamber, citing a wish not to impede the judicial process. In October 2016, her three-year suspended sentence was reduced to one year.|$|E
