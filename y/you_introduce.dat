500|$|Writer Simon Moore {{finished}} his spec script for The Quick and the Dead in late 1992, writing it as a {{homage to the}} Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, particularly the Dollars Trilogy starring Clint Eastwood. The writer decided the lead character should be a female. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>introduce</b> women {{into that kind of}} world, something very interesting happens and you have an interesting dynamic straight away," [...] Moore commented. The names of the lead villain (Herod) and the town (Redemption) were intentional allusions to the Bible. Moore considered directing his own script as an independent film and shooting The Quick and the Dead on a $3–4 million budget in either Spain or Italy.|$|E
500|$|Jack is bisexual, and is {{the first}} {{televised}} Doctor Who character to be openly anything other than heterosexual. In Jack's first appearance, the Doctor suggests that Jack's orientation {{is more common in}} the 51st century, when humankind will deal with multiple alien species and becomes more sexually flexible. [...] Within Doctor Whos narrative, Jack's sexual orientation is not specifically labelled as that could [...] "make it an issue". On creating Jack, Davies comments [...] "I thought: 'It's time <b>you</b> <b>introduce</b> bisexuals properly into mainstream television,'" [...] with a focus on making Jack fun and swashbuckling as opposed to negative and angsty. Davies also expresses that he didn't make the character bisexual [...] "from any principle", but rather because [...] "it would be interesting from a narrative point of view." [...] The bisexuality-related labels [...] "pansexual" [...] and [...] "omnisexual" [...] are also frequently applied to the character. Writer Steven Moffat suggests that questions of sexual orientation do not even enter into Jack's mind; Moffat also comments [...] "It felt right that the James Bond of the future would bed anyone." [...] Within Torchwood, the character refers to sexual orientation classifications as [...] "quaint". In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, John Barrowman explained that [...] "’s bisexual, but {{in the realm of the}} show, we call him omnisexual, because on the show, [...] also have sex with aliens who take human form, and sex with male-male, women-women, all sorts of combinations." [...] The term is also used once, in-universe, in the novel The House that Jack Built, when Ianto comments to a woman's remark about Jack, [...] "He prefers the term 'omnisexual'." ...|$|E
2500|$|James was the DJ for WWDC, a {{radio station}} in Washington, DC. Eventually he decided to pursue Albert's {{suggestion}} to him and asked the station's promotion director to get British Overseas Airways Corporation to ship in a copy of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] from Britain. Albert related what happened next: [...] "Carroll James called me up the day he got the record and said 'If you can get down here by 5 o'clock, we'll let <b>you</b> <b>introduce</b> it.'" [...] Albert managed {{to get to the}} station in time, and introduced the record with: [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, {{for the first time on}} the air in the United States, here are the Beatles singing 'I Want to Hold Your Hand.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|His [...] "One" [...] concept {{encompassed}} thinker and object. Even the self-contemplating intelligence (the noesis of the nous) {{must contain}} duality. [...] "Once you have uttered 'The Good,' add no further thought: by any addition, and {{in proportion to}} that addition, <b>you</b> <b>introduce</b> a deficiency." [...] Plotinus denies sentience, self-awareness or any other action (ergon) to the One [...] Rather, if we insist on describing it further, we must call the One a sheer potentiality (dynamis) or [...] without which nothing could exist. [...] As Plotinus explains in both places and elsewhere , {{it is impossible for}} the One to be Being or a self-aware Creator God. At , Plotinus compared the One to [...] "light", the Divine Nous (first will towards Good) to the [...] "Sun", and lastly the Soul to the [...] "Moon" [...] whose light is merely a [...] "derivative conglomeration of light from the 'Sun'". The first light could exist without any celestial body.|$|E
2500|$|Karp showed {{each of his}} {{problems}} to be NP-complete by reducing another problem (already shown to be NP-complete) to that problem. [...] For example, he showed the problem 3SAT (the Boolean satisfiability problem for expressions in conjunctive normal form with exactly three variables or negations of variables per clause) to be NP-complete by showing how to reduce (in polynomial time) any instance of SAT to an equivalent instance of 3SAT. [...] (First you modify the proof of the Cook–Levin theorem, so that the resulting formula is in conjunctive normal form, then <b>you</b> <b>introduce</b> new variables to split clauses with more than 3 atoms. [...] For example, the clause (A ∨ B ∨ C ∨ D) can {{be replaced by the}} conjunction of clauses (A ∨ B ∨ Z) ∧ (¬Z ∨ C ∨ D), where Z is a new variable which will not be used anywhere else in the expression. [...] Clauses with fewer than 3 atoms can be padded; for example, A can be replaced by (A ∨ A ∨ A), and [...] (A ∨ B) can be replaced by (A ∨ B ∨ B) [...] ).|$|E
