2500|$|Senior Human Rights Watch adviser Alison Des Forges {{said the}} lack of legal {{representation}} was a serious concern. [...] "The authorities' view {{is that this is}} a quasi-customary kind of procedure, and there never used to be lawyers, so there's no need for lawyers now. The problem with that is that little is the same except for the name. In this system, there is considerable weight given to the official side. The office of the prosecutor provides considerable assistance to the bench [...] in terms of making its determination, so <b>you</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> a level playing field." [...] There may, however, be no alternative to the Gacaca trials, she added. [...] "Obviously the problem of delivering justice after the genocide is an overwhelming problem. Gacaca may not be ideal but there is at this point no alternative.... The official explanation I think is that people did not speak openly until the Gacaca process and now many more accusations are surfacing. Also, the concession program, which requires the naming of all those who participated along with the accused , has led to a multiplication of names. [...] "How many of these are well-founded, what is the credibility of the evidence, these are very serious concerns." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{transistorized}} IBM 129 Card Data Recorder's primary {{advantage over}} other IBM keypunches {{was that it}} featured an electronic 80-column buffer to hold the card image [...] When using earlier IBM keypunches, a keystroke error required the card to be ejected by pressing the Release and Register keys, the error corrected by pressing the Duplicate key until the error column was reached, typing the correct data {{for the rest of}} that card, then pressing the Release key and manually removing the bad card from the output card stacker before it was placed in the deck (this required some practice, but quickly became an automatic action that <b>you</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> to think about).

[...] This was one of Richter's strengths, because each concert he conducted was a unique, irreplaceable event, and even though two performances could sound slightly different, both seemed just right in the moment he was playing them.

50|$|Also in this model, any object {{moving from}} the Planckbrane to the Tevbrane in the bulk would be growing, {{becoming}} lighter, and moving more slowly through time. Distance and time expand near the Tevbrane, and mass and energy shrink near it. This creates an alternate explanation of gravity's weakness in the Tevbrane: everything is lighter. An interesting {{part of this is}} that the hierarchy problem is automatically solved. The main scale on the Planckbrane would be the Planck scale. However, the change by 16 units causes the scales to change by 16 orders of magnitude. On the Planckbrane, strings would be 10−33 cm in size, but on the Tevbrane they'd be 10−17 cm. In fact, this makes the mass scale for the Weakbrane based on about a TeV. Therefore, <b>you</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> the strange range of masses and energies.

Mrs. Cadurcis, after one or two ineffectual attempts to catch him, paused and panted for breath. He took advantage of this momentary cessation, and spoke thus, 'Mother, I am in no humour for frolics.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} PUSH-PULL style rumor {{spreading}} algorithms in the mobile telephone model, {{a variant of}} the classical telephone model in which each node can participate in at most one connection per round; i. e., <b>you</b> can <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> multiple nodes pull information from the same source in a single round. Our model also includes two new parameterized generalizations: (1) the network topology can undergo a bounded rate of change (for a parameterized rate that spans from no changes to changes in every round); and (2) in each round, each node can advertise a bounded amount of information to all of its neighbors before connection decisions are made (for a parameterized number of bits that spans from no advertisement to large advertisements). We prove that in the mobile telephone model with no advertisements and no topology changes, PUSH-PULL style algorithms perform poorly with respect to a graph's vertex expansion and graph conductance as compared to the known tight results in the classical telephone model. We then prove, however, that if nodes are allowed to advertise a single bit in each round, a natural variation of PUSH-PULL terminates in time that matches (within logarithmic factors) this strategy's performance in the classical telephone model [...] -even in the presence of frequent topology changes. We also analyze how the performance of this algorithm degrades as the rate of change increases toward the maximum possible amount. We argue that our model matches well the properties of emerging peer-to-peer communication standards for mobile devices, and that our efficient PUSH-PULL variation that leverages small advertisements and adapts well to topology changes is a good choice for rumor spreading in this increasingly important setting.
