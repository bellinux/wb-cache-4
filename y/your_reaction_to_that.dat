In the present study, we aimed {{to understand how}} affective responses to a biologically salient aversive outcome administered by others are modulated by {{the extent to which}} a given individual is judged to have deliberately or inadvertently delivered the outcome. Using fMRI, we examined how neural responses to anticipation and receipt of an aversive stimulus are modulated by this fundamental social judgment. We found that affective evaluations about an individual whose actions led to either noxious or neutral consequences for the subject did indeed depend on the perceived intentions of that individual. At the neural level, activity in the anterior insula correlated with the interaction between perceived intentionality and anticipated outcome valence, suggesting that this region reflects the influence of mental state attribution on aversive expectations...|$|R

Consequently the attached paper is less a pre-publication draft than a mid-course overview of what the project has accomplished so far. Ultimately, I expect this research to yield several journal articles and a book, but the current write-up is neither a draft article nor a book prospectus. Rather, it is a “talking paper, ” designed to elicit feedback at a point when I still have time to adjust course.

5000|$|Sociologist Chris Lucerne {{states in}} her article titled “Emotions! Good or Bad”, that there are neither good nor bad {{emotions}}. However, you can judge emotions as such. According to Lucerne's theory emotion is believed to help humans express their feelings. Therefore, emotions {{are a part of}} human nature to help us communicate. In addition to Chris Lucerne’s theory, when humans experience a situation good or bad an emotion is triggered. As a result of emotion an action is followed. For example, here are a few emotions listed in Lucerne’s article in which people experience daily. The first is the emotion of happiness, which can ignite the sensation to dance. A second emotion is anger, in which the person begins to feel hot causing him or her to perspire. Finally is the emotion of sadness, which creates a sensation of feeling closed in. As a consequence of feeling closed in the person may react irrationally to make them comfortable. Chris Lucerne also states {{in her article}} [...] "that no matter what, you cannot control <b>your</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> emotion." [...] In conclusion <b>to</b> Lucernes theory <b>reaction</b> is random in expressing your feelings.|$|R

The plans of the operation were known to the Soviet defenders, who spent months building up a defense in depth to sap the strength of the attacking panzer units. The operation violated two of the three tenets for successful tank operations that Guderian had laid out in Achtung – Panzer!, namely that terrain for the operation had <b>to</b> be chosen <b>that</b> was open, and not built up with heavy defenses. Secondly, and more importantly, the strike had to be delivered in a manner that took the defenders by surprise. In light of the obvious heavy defenses the Soviets had been preparing for the attack, the operation was a clear misuse of the Panzerwaffe. The result would be a significant weakening of German panzer forces, forces that Guderian had been trying to rebuild. In a conversation with Hitler on 14 May 1943, Guderian pointed out the futility of the operation, asking, [...] "My Führer, {{why do you want to}} attack in the East at all this year?"
