50|$|His best-known book, The Probable and the Provable (1977), {{argued in}} favour of {{inductive}} reasoning <b>when</b> making up <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> for instance, <b>when</b> on a jury.

Soon the flame vanishes, and with it the whole scene is gone, though its image remains an instant in <b>your</b> <b>mind's</b> eye <b>when</b> darkness has swallowed the reality. Throughout the chamber there is the same obscurity as before, but not the same gloom within your breast.|$|R
