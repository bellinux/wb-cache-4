2500|$|In the Futurama episode, [...] "Mars University" [...] (1999), Professor Farnsworth is lecturing on {{the effects}} of quantum {{neutrino}} fields and the blackboard behind him displays an explanation of [...] "Superdupersymmetric String Theory" [...] and a diagram explaining [...] "Witten's Dog". Witten's Dog, named after Ed Witten, is a parody of the classic Schrödinger's cat paradox. Astrophysicist David Schiminovich created both the equations and the diagram, based on [...] "an equation that constrains the mass density of neutrinos in the universe". Also the episode, [...] "Law and Oracle" [...] (2011), features an extended car chase scene in which Police Officer Fry apprehends Erwin Schrödinger, who is transporting a box containing [...] "a cat, some poison and a cesium atom." [...] When asked if the cat is alive or dead, Schrödinger responds that [...] "it is a superposition of both states, until <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> and collapse the wave-function." [...] Upon opening the box, Fry finds a living cat, who attacks him, while his partner discovers [...] "there's also a lot of drugs in there." [...] It is later revealed that the cat has agreed to testify against Schrödinger.|$|E
2500|$|In The Big Bang Theory episode, [...] "The Tangerine Factor" [...] (May 19, 2008), Leonard's {{attempt to}} arrange a date with Penny results in both Penny and Leonard's seeking Sheldon's advice. [...] Sheldon advises Penny that [...] "just like Schrödinger's cat being alive and dead at the same time", her date with Leonard {{currently}} has both [...] "good and bad" [...] probabilistic outcomes. [...] The only {{way to find out}} is to [...] "open the box", in other words collapse the wave-function of an uncertain date into a specific outcome. Also, in the episode [...] "The Russian Rocket Reaction" [...] (October 13, 2011), Sheldon characterizes his relationship to Leonard as [...] "Schrödinger's friendship", in the sense that Leonard is simultaneously his friend and mortal enemy (as he may or may not attend Wil Wheaton's party). When Sheldon tries to explain the paradox to Penny, she gives an approximate description: [...] "...] there's this cat in a box and until <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it,</b> it's either dead or alive or both [...] ". Penny references it during a brief conversation with her new boyfriend in [...] "The Codpiece Topology" [...] (September 29, 2008), and Leonard references it during lunch with the guys in [...] "The Bus Pants Utilization" [...] (January 6, 2011).|$|E

The flower whose red dust {{fell in the}} box when <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> on the desk by the window in yonder room--the flower that stood in the window as a signal--the flower I myself removed, and so spoiled the miserable plot that your friends concocted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{can that}} be?" [...] he muttered, turning it over. [...] "Addressed {{to me all}} right, but there isn't a soul knows I'm here except you people. Will <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it,</b> Miss Laura?" ...|$|E
60|$|If {{you pull}} your trunk out six {{inches from the}} wall, so that the lid will stay up when <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it,</b> they always shove that trunk back again. They do it on purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{would rather}} have <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it,</b> dearest," [...] said she, turning over the parcel. [...] "I don't like to break those great seals; they look so serious. Please open it for me!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... 'Pooh! Nothing to it!' {{said the}} cat. 'You just—well, <b>you</b> just <b>open</b> <b>it.</b> Big sign over the door—"BANK." [...] That’s all.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I know you're there, and I'll {{have the}} door down if <b>you</b> don't <b>open</b> <b>it.</b> There's nobody with me," [...] shouted the manly voice of his triumphant friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it,</b> or shall I?" [...] he said; {{and as he}} spoke, {{she looked}} into his face, and saw that all {{tenderness}} and love were banished from it, and that the hard suspicious greed of the Jew was there instead.|$|E
60|$|THE ORDERLY. We {{forgot the}} doorscraper, sir. She laid {{down on the}} flags and got the chain through before she started hollerin.

"I {{have brought}} you the king's answer, mother," [...] Ronald {{said as he}} alighted; [...] "but before <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> I may {{tell you that it}} is unfavourable, though I am ignorant of the precise nature of its contents. But you must not be disappointed. Marshal Saxe bade me tell you that he {{considers}} his honour engaged in seeing you righted, and that whenever an opportunity occurs he will endeavour to move the king's mind in your favour. How is my father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say nothing," [...] I replied, [...] "till {{you have}} heard the first story. Shut up the paper-case till that time, and then decide when <b>you</b> will <b>open</b> <b>it</b> again to write to your aunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{them to the}} Poste-Restante. If {{there is}} a letter for me with the Dimchurch post-mark, I authorize <b>you</b> to <b>open</b> <b>it.</b> Read it before it comes into my hands--and then perhaps you will be satisfied?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Yes, said Wells. And old Barrett {{has a new}} way of {{twisting}} the note so that <b>you</b> can't <b>open</b> <b>it</b> and fold it again to see how many ferulae you are to get. I won't come back too.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{they don't}} {{want to come}} any more they write you a letter, and you run with it to your room and kiss it, because you don't know what is inside. Then <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it,</b> and that breaks your heart, you know." [...] She nodded her head sagaciously and smiled with tears in her eyes. [...] "Never, never, never open the letter. Keep it unopened on your breast, {{and then you can}} always think that he may come to-morrow. And if--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest Godfather,--If I {{could have}} been any good to your life by staying I would not have gone away to a distance. But now I am gone. Do not ask the reason; and if you love my father, try to prevent any one from seeking me. I could not bear my life at Florence. I cannot bear to tell any one why. Help to cover my lot in silence. I have asked that my bridal chest should be sent to you: when <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it,</b> you will know the reason. Please to give all the things that were my mother's to my cousin Brigida, and ask her to forgive me for not saying any words of parting to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "My name {{is unknown}} to you, Sir Cyril," [...] he said, [...] "but {{it has been}} said that a bearer of good news needs no introduction, and I come in that capacity. I bring you, sir, a Christmas-box," [...] and he took from a bag he carried a bundle of some size, and a letter. [...] "Before <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it,</b> sir, I will explain the {{character}} of its contents, which would take you some time to decipher and understand, while I can explain them in a very few words. I may tell you that I am the legal adviser of Mr. Ebenezer Harvey, of Upmead Court, Norfolk. You are, I presume, familiar with the name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You promise {{yourself}} a pleasant moment," [...] said he, [...] "in reading that letter; <b>you</b> will <b>open</b> <b>it</b> when alone--n'est-ce pas? Ah! a smile answers. Well, well! {{one should not}} be too harsh; 'la jeunesse n'a qu'un temps.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have the}} key of this palace," [...] said Alice; [...] "it has waited--that is, its secret and {{precious}} chamber has, for <b>you</b> to <b>open</b> <b>it,</b> these three hundred years. Do {{you know how to}} find that secret chamber?" ...|$|R
5000|$|This first {{publication}} began modestly enough, [...] "as a weekly supplemental {{section of the}} McGill undergraduate society's newspaper, the McGill Daily." [...] It [...] "was edited by Allan Latham, A.P.R. Coulborn, and A.J.M. Smith." [...] Fellow student F.R. Scott has described those days: [...] "He Smith was running the McGill Daily Literary Supplement and every Wednesday <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> up {{and there was an}} insert with some bright poems, a few articles, and book reviews. This delighted me when I was a law student because the lectures were usually so dull that you had to read something during them." ...|$|R
60|$|Has he well {{considered}} what {{an immense}} operation {{any change in}} our constitution is? how many discussions, parties, and passions, it will necessarily excite; and when <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> to inquiry in one part, where the inquiry will stop? Experience shows us, that no time can be fit for such changes but a time of general confusion; when good men, finding everything already broken up, think it right {{to take advantage of}} the opportunity of such derangement in favor of an useful alteration. Perhaps a time of the greatest security and tranquillity both at home and abroad may likewise be fit; but will the author affirm this to be just such a time? Transferring an idea of military to civil prudence, he ought to know how dangerous it is to make an alteration of your disposition in the face of an enemy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Just like Ernest's communistic notions,' {{she murmured}} in return, half audibly. 'I do declare, between them both, a plain woman hardly knows whether she's {{standing}} {{on her head}} or on her heels. I live in daily fear that one or other {{of them will be}} taken up by the police, for being implicated in some dynamite plot or other, to blow up the Queen or destroy the Houses of Parliament.' Ronald smiled again, gently, but answered nothing. 'There's another letter for you there, though, with the Exmoor coronet upon it. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it?</b> I hope it's an invitation for you to go down and stop at Dunbude for a week or two. Nothing on earth would do you so much good as to get away for a while from your ranters and canters, and mix occasionally in a little decent and rational society.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, my maidens! This is {{the time}} for the pretty who can have many chances, and for the ill-favoured who have few. Matrimony to be had-- hot, eaten, and done with as easily as berlingozzi! And see!" [...] here the conjuror held up a cluster of tiny bags. [...] "To every bride I give a Breve with a secret in it--the secret alone worth the money you pay for the matrimony. The secret how to--no, no, I will not tell you what the secret is about, and that makes it a double secret. Hang it round your neck if you like, and never look at it; I don't say that will not be the best, for then you will see many things you don't expect: though if <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> you may break your leg, e vero, but you will know a secret! Something nobody knows but me! And mark--I give you the Breve, I don't sell it, as many another holy man would: the quattrino is for the matrimony, and the Breve you get for nothing. Orsu, giovanetti, come like dutiful sons of the Church and buy the Indulgence of his Holiness Alexander the Sixth." ...|$|E
60|$|BRODIE. Your {{father is}} dead. O yes! He's dead, is he? Dead. Quite right. Quite right.... How did <b>you</b> <b>open</b> the door? <b>It's</b> strange. I bolted it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{should think}} <b>you</b> might <b>open</b> <b>it</b> at once, Thorndyke. It will {{probably}} only contain instructions, and, at any rate, {{as you have}} the coin and the word, you could come round tomorrow morning and get the chest out if you want it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Can you ask, my dear Watson? Do {{you imagine}} that I have no respect for your medical talents? Could I fancy that your astute {{judgment}} would pass a dying man who, however weak, had no rise of pulse or temperature? At four yards, I could deceive you. If I failed to do so, who would bring my Smith within my grasp? No, Watson, I would not touch that box. You can just see {{if you look at}} it sideways where the sharp spring like a viper's tooth emerges as <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it.</b> I dare say it was by some such device that poor Savage, who stood between this monster and a reversion, was done to death. My correspondence, however, is, as you know, a varied one, and I am somewhat upon my guard against any packages which reach me. It was clear to me, however, that by pretending that he had really succeeded in his design I might surprise a confession. That pretence I have carried out with the thoroughness of the true artist. Thank you, Watson, you must help me on with my coat. When we have finished at the police-station I think that something nutritious at Simpson's would not be out of place." ...|$|E
6000|$|Moreover, {{the first}} sweep of royal fury being past, his Majesty's stern {{regulations}} at Custrin began to relax in fulfilment; to be obeyed only by those immediately responsible, and in letter {{rather than in}} spirit even by those. President von Munchow who {{is head of the}} Domain-Kammer, chief representative of Government at Custrin, and resides in the Fortress there, ventures after a little, the Prince's doors being closed as we saw, to have an orifice bored through the floor above, and thereby to communicate with the Prince, and sympathetically ask, What he can do for him? Many things, books among others, are, under cunning contrivance, smuggled in by the judicious Munchow, willing to risk himself in such a service. For example, Munchow has a son, a clever boy of seven years old; who, to the wonder of neighbors, goes into child's-petticoats again; and testifies the liveliest desire to be admitted to the Prince, and bear him company a little! Surely the law of No-company does not extend to that of an innocent child? The innocent child has a row of pockets all round the inside of his long gown; and goes laden, miscellaneously, like a ship of the desert, or cockboat not forbidden to cross the line. Then there are stools, one stool at least indispensable to human nature; and the inside of this, once <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>it,</b> is a chest-of-drawers, containing paper, ink, new literature and much else. No end to Munchow'a good-will, and his ingenuity is great. [Preuss, i. 46.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you, Pere Lenegre," [...] {{continued}} the Englishman, speaking now with slow and careful deliberation, [...] "listen very attentively to the instructions I {{am going to}} give you, for on your implicit obedience to them depends not only your own life but that of these two dear women. Go at once, now, to the Rue Ste. Anne, round the corner, the second house on your right, which is numbered thirty-seven. The porte cochere stands open, go boldly through, past the concierge's box, {{and up the stairs}} to apartment number twelve, second floor. Here is the key of the apartment," [...] he added, producing one from his coat pocket and handing it over to the old man. [...] "The rooms are nominally occupied by a certain Maitre Turandot, maker of violins, and not even the concierge of the place knows that the hunchbacked and snuffy violin-maker and the meddlesome Scarlet Pimpernel, whom the Committee of Public Safety would so love to lay by the heels, {{are one and the same}} person. The apartment, then, is mine; one of the many which I occupy in Paris at different times," [...] he went on. [...] "Let yourself in quietly with this key, walk straight across the first room to a wardrobe, which you will see in front of <b>you.</b> <b>Open</b> <b>it.</b> It is hung full of shabby clothes; put these aside, and you will notice that the panels at the back do not fit very closely, as if the wardrobe was old or had been badly put together. Insert your fingers in the tiny aperture between the two middle panels. These slide back easily: there is a recess immediately behind them. Get in there; pull the doors of the wardrobe together first, then slide the back panels into their place. You will be perfectly safe there, as the house is not under suspicion at present, and even if the revolutionary guard, under some meddle-some sergeant or other, chooses to pay it a surprise visit, your hiding-place will be perfectly secure. Now is all that quite understood?" ...|$|E

60|$|There {{followed}} days {{of excitement}} centred round their money-box. Shovel introduced Tommy {{to a boy}} what said as after a bit you forget how much money was in your box, and then when <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> oh, Lor'! {{there is more than}} you thought, so he and Elspeth gave this plan a week's trial, affecting not to know how much they had gathered, but when they unlocked it, the sum was still only eightpence; so then Tommy told the liar to come on, and they fought while the horrified Elspeth prayed, and Tommy licked him, a result due to one of the famous Thrums left-handers then on exhibition in that street for the first time, as taught the victor by Petey Whamond the younger, late of Tillyloss.|$|R
