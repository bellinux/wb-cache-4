25|$|Most {{of these}} endings {{are the same}} as in Esperanto except for -i, -ir, -ar, -or and -ez. Esperanto marks noun plurals by an agglutinative ending -j (so plural nouns end in -oj), uses -i for verb infinitives (Esperanto infinitives are tenseless), and uses -u for the imperative. Verbs in both Esperanto and Ido do not {{conjugate}} depending on person, number or gender; the -as, -is, and -os endings suffice whether the subject is I, <b>you,</b> <b>he,</b> she, they, or anything else.|$|E

25|$|In Steven Johnson's book, Everything Bad Is Good for <b>You,</b> <b>he</b> {{argues that}} video games in fact demand far more from a player than {{traditional}} games like Monopoly. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, {{as well as}} how to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and HUDs. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.|$|E

500|$|A {{character}} in Somerset Maugham's 1930 novel Cakes and Ale, Alroy Kear, a sycophantic hack novelist, was widely interpreted by contemporaneous readers as a thinly veiled characterization of Walpole. [...] In {{response to a}} letter from Walpole, Maugham denied it: [...] "I certainly never intended Alroy Kear to be a portrait of <b>you.</b> <b>He</b> {{is made up of}} a dozen people and the greater part of him is myself." [...] Nine years after Walpole's death, however, Maugham admitted in an introduction to the 1950 Modern Library edition of Cakes and Ale that Walpole was indeed the model for his Kear character.|$|E

500|$|Mills' {{management}} style {{was influenced by}} a number of managers he played under, including John Barnwell, Brian Clough, Alan Hinton, Howard Kendall, Brian Little, David Pleat, Russell Slade and Neil Warnock. He learned simplicity from Clough, saying: [...] "He never did complicate anything. Football is a simple game and Cloughie was no coach, he didn't confuse us with sessions straight out of the manual". Like Clough, Mills has been praised for his man management skills and Daren Fulford, his reserve-team manager at Tamworth, said: [...] "If he felt you had made a mistake, he would give you a rollicking but if he was pleased with <b>you</b> <b>he</b> would always give kind words". Fulford also commented on Mills' thoroughness, saying he wanted information on each players' performances after the reserves played.|$|E
