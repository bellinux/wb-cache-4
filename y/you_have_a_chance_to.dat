2500|$|These {{individual}} section camps {{were predominantly}} associated with individual districts within the Chicago Area Council, and the Scouts would form their {{troops in the}} city and board a steamer vessel in Chicago for the adventure across Lake Michigan. In these first years, the Scouts would arrive at the pier in Whitehall, load their gear on trucks, and hike the 4 miles from town to Owasippe. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> visit the White Lake Lighthouse, check out the exhibit about the S.S. Carolina. In the local maritime museum there is an exhibit on the Carolina that features its Owasippe transport years. It was one of the boats bringing Scouts to Owasippe. In later years, the Scouts would travel by train around the lake and disembark at what was called [...] "Scout Station." [...] This was just a spot on the Pere Marquette railroad where they would stop and drop off the Scouts and their gear.|$|E
2500|$|During the New York printers' {{strike of}} 1963, when The New York Times {{and six other}} {{newspapers}} suspended publication, Hardwick, her husband Robert Lowell, and Jason and Barbara Epstein, saw an opportunity to introduce the sort of vigorous book review that Hardwick had imagined. Jason Epstein knew that book publishers would advertise their books in the new publication, since they had no other outlet for promoting new books. The group asked Silvers, who was still at Harper's, to edit the issue, and Silvers asked Barbara Epstein to co-edit it with him. Silvers and Epstein [...] "became an inseparable double act", editing The New York Review of Books together for the next 43 years, until her death in 2006. Silvers continued as sole editor {{until his death in}} March 2017. In later years, he described his motivation for continuing to edit the Review: [...] "I feel it's a fantastic opportunity – because of the freedom of it, because of the sense that there are marvelous, intensely interesting, important questions that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> try to deal with in an interesting way. That's an extraordinary opportunity in life. And you'd be crazy not to try and make the most of it." [...] He said on another occasion: [...] "We do what we want and don't {{try to figure out what}} the public wants." [...] Asked in 2007 about who might succeed him as editor, Silvers replied: [...] "It's not a question that's posing itself". In 2012, he added, [...] "I can think of several people who would be marvelous editors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barnard later wrote, [...] "For a {{dying man}} {{it is not}} a {{difficult}} decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> swim to the other side." [...] The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear. [...] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart {{to be used in the}} transplant attempt. The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. [...] When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. [...] Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. [...] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard. Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, [...] "Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Hall {{had been}} indelibly marked by his {{experience}} {{going through the}} Great Depression in Saskatchewan.

6000|$|... "In common cases," [...] said she, [...] "this might all {{be put off}} till we got somewhere; but it won't do now. Here you are, with everythin' in {{your own}} hands, but just get away from here, and there's an end of that. She's as pretty a girl as you'll see in a month of Sundays, and if she leaves here without your gettin' her, there's no knowing who'll snap her up. When we've got to that island, you may see her once a week, but maybe you won't. She may go away in one ship, and you in another, {{and there may be}} {{somebody}} right there--a missionary, for all I know--who'll have her before <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> put in a word." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{it would}} be {{altogether}} too much trouble for a man-of-war's-man to keep his own shaving-tools and shave himself at sea, and since, therefore, nearly the whole ship's company patronise the ship's barbers, and as the seamen must be shaven by evening quarters of the days appointed for the business, it may be readily imagined what a scene of bustle and confusion there is when the razors are being applied. First come, first served, is the motto; and often {{you have to wait}} for hours together, sticking to your position (like one of an Indian file of merchants' clerks getting letters out of the post-office), ere <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> occupy the pedestal of the match-tub. Often the crowd of quarrelsome candidates wrangle and fight for precedency, while at all times the interval is employed by the garrulous in every variety of ship-gossip.|$|E
