500|$|The film is {{loosely based}} on the actual crimes {{attributed}} to an unidentified serial killer known as the Phantom Killer; it claims that [...] "the incredible story <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> see is true, where it happened and how it happened; only the names have been changed." [...] The actual Phantom attacked eight people between February 22 and May 3, 1946 {{in or near the}} town of Texarkana, Texas, which is on the Texas border with Arkansas. Most of the murders occurred in rural areas just outside Texarkana, in Bowie County, Texas, while the film has them occurring in Arkansas. However, the general outline of the murders largely follows reality, with mostly minor artistic license taken. As in the film, the real killer was never identified nor apprehended.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Show airs {{on various}} {{networks}} worldwide; in addition, an edited {{version of the}} show called The Daily Show: Global Edition is produced each week specifically for overseas audiences. It has been airing outside of the U.S. on CNN International and other overseas networks since September 2002. This edition runs {{for half an hour}} and contains a selection of segments including one guest interview from the preceding week's shows, usually from the Monday or Tuesday episode. Noah provides an exclusive introductory monologue in front of an audience, usually about the week's prevalent international news story, and closing comments without an audience present. When aired on CNN International, the broadcast is prefaced by a written disclaimer: [...] "The show <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> watch is a news parody. Its stories are not fact checked. Its reporters are not journalists. And its opinions are not fully thought through." ...|$|E

500|$|Hooper has cited {{changes in}} the {{cultural}} and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the [...] "film <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> see is true", {{was a response to}} being [...] "lied to by the government about things that were going on all over the world", including Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, and [...] "the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War". The [...] "lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things" [...] that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by [...] "showing brains spilled all over the road", led to his belief that [...] "man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film". The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper {{while he was in the}} hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed his way through the crowd.|$|E
500|$|The book {{opens up}} with the introduction: [...] "Everything <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> see and read is a fantasy, a dream, pretend". Throughout Sex, Madonna offers poems, stories, and essays. She also uses the {{pseudonym}} [...] "Mistress Dita" [...] as a homage to German actress Dita Parlo; her friends in these stories are Bunny, Dex, Stella, Chiclet and Stranger. According to biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{a big part of}} the book is read as a letter to a pornographic magazine. As a thank you for recovering the stolen pictures during the making of the book, in the credits of the book Madonna mentioned the FBI for [...] " ... rescuing photographs that would have made J. Edgar Hoover roll over." [...] Madonna also wanted to explore the notion of power in Sex. Melcher said that the artist wanted to talk about [...] "gentle and hard, soft and violent [...] She was playing out all those elements in her book. That was reflected in the materials: uncoated, soft paper on the inside and hard metal coating on the outside." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his notebooks, Leonardo da Vinci {{wrote of}} pareidolia as a device for painters, writing, [...] "If {{you look at}} any walls spotted with various stains or {{with a mixture of}} {{different}} kinds of stones, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> invent some scene {{you will be able to}} see in it a resemblance to various different landscapes adorned with mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, wide valleys, and various groups of hills. You will also be able to see divers combats and figures in quick movement, and strange expressions of faces, and outlandish costumes, and an infinite number of things which you can then reduce into separate and well conceived forms." ...|$|E

2500|$|The O'Reilly Factor was {{generally}} pre-recorded, though on occasion it aired live if breaking news or special events were being covered (e.g., presidential addresses {{that occurred during}} prime-time and debate coverage). It was usually taped between 5:00 and 7:00 PM Eastern Time and aired weekdays at 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM. The show was recorded [...] "live to tape", meaning that the recording breaked for commercials as if the show was actually on the air while being recorded. Some guests were interviewed before the [...] "live to tape" [...] period and are slotted in the program as appropriate. He began every show with the catch phrase, [...] "Caution! <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> enter the No Spin Zone. The Factor begins right now!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1976 film The Town That Dreaded Sundown was {{released}} internationally and is {{loosely based on}} the events, despite its claim that [...] "only the names have been changed". Since the movie claimed that the [...] "story <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> see is true, where it happened and how it happened," [...] the fabricated parts created much of the myth and folklore around the murders for several decades. A cold case in Texarkana in 1948 of the disappearance of Virginia Carpenter has been speculated to {{be the work of}} The Phantom. The 2014 book The Phantom Killer: Unlocking the Mystery of the Texarkana Serial Murders, by James Presley, pointed to Youell Swinney as the culprit of all five attacks. Presley believes that there is enough evidence to close the case.|$|E

To his great surprise, he won the election by a very tight margin, defeating Chief Justice Joseph Philips (an ally of Judge Jesse Thomas and prominent slavery advocate {{in his own right}} who eventually returned to Kentucky), Associate Justice Thomas C. Browne(the eventual candidate of the Ninian Edwards faction) and militia commander James B. Moore. Coles had left Illinois on election day believing he had lost, and received the news of his victory while in Virginia recovering from bilious fever. He accordingly cleared up his land office accounts in Washington, D.C. and returned to Illinois. Madison sent him a package containing a pedometer, and a note, [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> assume new motives to walk in a straight path, and with measured steps, I wish you to accept the little article enclosed, as a type of the course I am sure you will pursue, and as a token of the affection I have so long cherished for you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Johanan counted [...] among ten {{instances}} in which Scripture refers {{to the death of}} Moses (including three in the parashah and two in the haftarah for the parashah), teaching that God did not finally seal the harsh decree until God declared it to Moses.
