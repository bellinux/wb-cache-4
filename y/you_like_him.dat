500|$|It took Levi {{approximately}} {{one year to}} record all of his dialogue {{due in part to}} his busy schedule. Levi recorded once every six weeks for six hours at a time, recording each of his lines at least twice. The actor's voice ultimately helped shape and develop Flynn's character. Howard explained, [...] "He's so smart and clever, and his adlibs are so great, and <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> straight away ... he brings that to Flynn." [...] On Levi's own influence on his character, the actor explained that Flynn's [...] "voice was really just a slight variation of [...] own". Wanting to sound [...] "more appropriate" [...] for the film's medieval setting, Levi [...] "cleaned up [...] own diction and made things a little bit more polished", referring to Flynn's accent as Mid-Atlantic. Describing Tangled as a [...] "very family friendly" [...] version of Romancing the Stone (1984), Levi studied and channelled the film's star, American actor Michael Douglas, and English legend Robin Hood. However, when Levi heard his performance in its entirety for the first time after the film's release, the actor admitted that he was ultimately dissatisfied with his performance, explaining, [...] "I felt like I sounded incredibly nasally and I was plugged up," [...] likening the experience to hearing one's voice played back on an answering machine.|$|E
500|$|Former Living Single star T. C. Carson {{was hired}} as Eugene Dix. Carson {{identified}} his role as [...] "a very by-the-book type of person but soon has {{a change of heart}} as the corpses begin to pile up." [...] The crew was enticed of Carson's casting, with Bress mentioning how his [...] "originally envisioned Woody Allen-type of character has got ten more times life than it ever had. It's got ten times the personality, this charisma that T.C. brings to it...he's just such a great presence." [...] Similarly, Perry was astonished by how Carson [...] "can take the most absurd lines and deliver them in such grammatized form with his eyes and his deep rich speaking voice." [...] Jonathan Cherry, who recently emerged in the 2003 film House of the Dead, was appointed as Rory Peters. Cherry characterized Rory as [...] "a very opposite of me whose arc goes from, 'I don't really care at all', to 'Oh my God, this is really happening!'" [...] In the script, Bress said that Rory was his favorite character to write since [...] "he's great comic relief, he's got a drug problem, he's funny, and he's all that." [...] Bress bragged that [...] "Cherry is awesome, awesome casting cause he's just so funny and the way he delivers his lines. It's like 'Oh yeah. That's good! That's better!'" [...] "What I think was surprising on him was that from all of the humor he's involved and his sort of itchiness that he has with Kat, there is some moments where he reveals how vulnerable he really is and so the shield comes down and right in there you're really becoming sympathetic to Rory. <b>You</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> at first cause he's the funny guy, but then you care about him because you realize that there's a place that humor comes from that we all share," [...] Perry appended.|$|E
2500|$|On September 23, 2011, Variety {{confirmed}} that Kelly has {{signed on to}} write original music for the Sparkle soundtrack. On April 25, 2011, Director Salkim Akli was quoted saying, [...] "Hopefully, R. Kelly will come on and {{do some of the}} music for the film. His latest music sounds like it came from a time period. Here's a guy who can write about a woman being a jeep to 'I Believe I Can Fly' and he's an artist. Whether <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> or dislike him, I love artists, and I know that he will just go deep into it and come up with something unique." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> {{and he is}} {{not really}} nice, Nuttie. Mark knows all about him; and so did I when I lived with the Delmars.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, as <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> {{at first}} {{well enough to}} bring him {{straight}} to see me, I suppose that means that now you are immensely pleased with him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b> We think {{him very}} nice. But {{then he is}} almost {{the same as a}} son here. Do you care about visiting the poor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes!" [...] she whispered, with a contemptuous mouth. [...] "Oh yes!--because <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him!</b> But {{you know}} nothing of him--nothing. How can <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> not knowing him? He may be a real bad character. How would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't know where. His {{house was}} close shut. I waited, but no person came; {{that was no}} fault of mine. This is Hugh--brave Hugh, who broke into that ugly jail, and set us free. Aha! <b>You</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> now, do you? <b>You</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> now!' ...|$|E
60|$|WINIFRED. I want to {{introduce}} you to Gerald, to see if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> He's good at the bottom, but he's very overbearing and definite.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "in a way I'm sorry. Reggie's a good fellow {{as far as}} he goes. But I {{imagined}} <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b> Why did <b>you</b> refuse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Dolores, just as {{the clatter}} ceased at a little station. 'You know you did {{walk up and down}} with him ever so long, and I am sure <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> very much.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Kitty, I'll tell you: I don't {{really know}} what to think. But I can say this: if <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> at first, and then didn't <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> and {{afterwards}} he made himself more agreeable, and you didn't mind his behaving as if you belonged to him, and you respected him, but after all didn't think him fascinating--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Nicholas flared up. [...] "Harry Riddle {{is going}} in the coach. I don't see why you can't take me sometimes. <b>You</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> better than me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He said he {{had been}} into papa's room,' said Johnnie, 'and had seen baby. He is a very good-natured gentleman. Don't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> Aunt Theodora?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was not," [...] said Hetty, with {{a little}} laugh. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him?</b> He is rather a famous man back there on the prairie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you know}} Mr. Arabin, I am sure <b>you</b> must <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> I know and <b>like</b> <b>him</b> much. Everybody that knows <b>him</b> must <b>like</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'd {{rather have}} <b>you</b> <b>like</b> Major Wild, for he owns much land, {{lives in a}} grand house, and wears the finest-laced coat in all the town. Will <b>you</b> be <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> please, Nat?" ...|$|R
60|$|BLUNTSCHLI (sceptically). You {{mean that}} <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>him</b> {{to find out}} that the story about the ice pudding was a--a--a--You know.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Did <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> on the whole?' asked Laura. 'I hope he has {{not this}} {{tremendous}} Morville temper? Oh, you don't say so. What a grievous thing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It mattered {{little that}} the girl had {{continued}} to demur--it was the mere play of her joy. [...] "I think he could make <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> in Chinese." ...|$|E
6000|$|HESTER. Do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> {{going away}} with Lord Illingworth? Of {{course there is}} {{position}}, no doubt, and money, but position and money are not everything, are they? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's all right," [...] said Redwood. [...] "He's all {{the better}} for being big. <b>You</b> wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>him</b> smaller than other people's children." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they arrived}} together. The Other Professor is--well, <b>you</b> won't <b>like</b> <b>him</b> quite so much, perhaps. He's {{a little more}} dreamy, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Margaret, you can't help {{seeing now}} that your mother's {{judgment}} was right. Holt Dalrymple once {{may have been}} very interesting and attractive for a friend, but as a prospective husband he was impossible. The worst I hear of {{him is that he}} drinks and gambles. I know <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> and I don't want to be unjust. But he has kept other and better young men away from you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I was {{chatting with}} Mr. Denver. By the way, Clara, {{now tell me}} truly, {{what do you think}} of Mr. Denver? Do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him?</b> Honestly now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Nelly, do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him?</b> Why shouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him?</b> but that's a poor word;--do {{you love}} him?" [...] She sat {{still in his}} arms without {{answering}} him. She certainly had not prepared herself for an avowal of affection, intending, as she had done, to abuse John Bold herself, and to hear her father do so also. [...] "Come, my love," [...] said he, [...] "let us make a clean breast of it: do {{you tell me what}} concerns yourself, and I will tell you what concerns me and the hospital." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{say that}} you have so much money, and hope to have more. And that you like him--Yes? Am I right? <b>You</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> very much?--hein? Is it so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a--lady, {{and he is}} a man. But <b>you</b> are <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> {{and very}} beautiful. You, too, have a lover, living close to us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember, {{they all}} said {{it would have been}} wrong. Besides, Cecil has been always <b>like</b> my brother. <b>You</b> will <b>like</b> <b>him</b> when <b>you</b> know him." ...|$|R
60|$|Scornfully he is {{determined}} upon it; he will none of your scruples; his women shall be fat as he pleases, and <b>you</b> shall <b>like</b> <b>him</b> nevertheless.|$|R
6000|$|He had {{forgotten}} its rider, till {{she looked up}} from the dogs, and said: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him?</b> It IS nice of you to be going to do us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} is," [...] Boyne ruefully admitted. [...] "But that doesn't make <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> any better. Well, if you won't tell Lottie, I'll {{give it to}} you now." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS GEORGE [leaving Soames {{and going}} {{a step or}} two nearer Hotchkiss] Why arnt <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> Sonny? Why do you hang on to a scrubby woman in the next street? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, {{we are so}} happy,' said Sir Ratcliffe, smiling; 'and yet Glastonbury is {{the best}} {{creature}} in the world. I hope <b>you</b> will <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> dear Constance.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] Cecil answered, [...] "he {{is still}} there. I know <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> Andrew, {{but he really}} isn't a bad sort, and he's quite a sportsman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't want to. I know <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> and I {{thought it}} would give you pain. Yet I {{wanted him to be}} there--I wanted him to hear." ...|$|R
