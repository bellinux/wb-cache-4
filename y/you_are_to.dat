5|$|Back in Arendelle, Anna (who has {{woken up}} from the spell) tried to track down a device known as a wishing star, which will {{have the power to}} bring her and Kristoff to {{wherever}} Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given Anna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for all that had transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing this was what the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing {{there is no point in}} killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> leave it.|$|E

On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks reached #20 on the Japan Oricon charts. It {{received}} mixed reviews. Gann {{liked the}} newly orchestrated tracks, calling them [...] "incredibly well-done orchestrations", {{and said that}} [...] "depending on how willing <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> spend money" [...] they made the album worth purchasing on their own, although he felt the other tracks offered nothing new to owners of the original soundtrack. Chris of Square Enix Music Online, however, felt that while the orchestrated tracks were well-done, {{the selection of the}} other tracks was poor and that the album as a whole was [...] "a lousy purchase for most who enjoyed Final Fantasy VIIs score".|$|E

Jim Farber from New York Daily News opined that Madonna [...] "ponders either running from, or accepting the end of, her career", whereas Adam R. Holz of Plugged In found Madonna [...] "confront confusion, fear and change". Regarding the lyrics [...] "I walk this razor's edge / Will I stand or will I fall?", Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound expressed that: [...] "When the world that you made goes onto change without you, keeping up becomes a bigger and bigger risk. If you're Madonna, you take that risk no matter how likely <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> come {{out the other side}} without stumbling." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its publication, The Shortest Way {{provoked}} {{immediate and}} passionate reactions {{from both sides}} of the debate. Some made use of it as a genuine vindication of the anti-Dissenter opinion, although speculation later occurred over whether it was ironic. The pamphlet generated a great deal of publicity over the handling of the issue by the Tory ministry. This resulted in the issuing of a warrant by the High Tory Secretary of State for the Southern Department, the Earl of Nottingham, for the arrest of Defoe on the charge of seditious libel, the order being given to [...] "… make Strict and diligent Search for Daniel Fooe and him having found <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> apprehend and seize together with his Papers for high Crime and misdemeanours and to bring him before me …" ...|$|E

500|$|Under a cloud for {{suspected}} disloyalty and treason, Stone {{was arrested}} {{just after midnight}} on February 8, 1862, on orders of Maj. Gen. McClellan, who was acting under orders from Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, dated January 28. Awaiting Stone {{near his home in}} Washington were 18 soldiers led by Brig. Gen. George Sykes. When Stone approached, Sykes stated [...] "I have now the most disagreeable duty to perform that I ever hadit is to arrest you." [...] When Stone angrily asked why, Sykes said [...] "I don't know. It's by order of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, general-in-chief of the army... I may as well tell you that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> be sent to Fort Lafayette." [...] This shocked Stone, who stated [...] "That's where they send secessionists! I have been as true a soldier to the Government as any in service." ...|$|E
500|$|Until {{the time}} of his death, reports of his having been a ringer angered Schulz. [...] While he did work in a steel mill, Schulz insisted that he did not [...] "come out" [...] of the steel mill to play {{football}}. [...] Instead, Schulz said he [...] "went into" [...] the mill to harden himself up for the football season. [...] When asked years later how he got to Michigan, Schulz recalled that, in the summer of 1904, he was working in the mill and had received several offers to play football. [...] One day, his father called to say that Fielding Yost of Michigan was in his office. [...] Schulz ran down the street and rushed into his father's office, where he was introduced to Yost. [...] His father promptly told him, [...] "Adolph, this is Mr. Yost. [...] <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> play football for him at Michigan. [...] We have made all the arrangements".|$|E
500|$|Terry's mother, Mrs. Khoo, is a [...] "thinly veiled {{stand-in}} for the [...] government", whose [...] "mother-knows-best" [...] mentality is well-meaning, but strips {{her children}} of their freedom. [...] She demands total obedience, and her repeated lines [...] "Do you know how lucky <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> have a good and responsible mother?" [...] and [...] "This is all for your own good" [...] parody the Singapore government's efforts to convince Singaporeans that government policies and actions {{is in the best}} interests of the nation. Mrs. Khoo also uses her position of power to buy off rebellion in her charges with gifts and bribes, in a pointed criticism of the government's social policies. Other characters in the film comment on this relationship [...] for instance, in one scene, Mr. Liu states that [...] "it is difficult to catch fish in Singapore, because fish in Singapore are like Singaporeans; they'll never open their mouths", poking fun at the Singaporean trait of obedience and respect for authority.|$|E

500|$|By 1762, however, Johnson {{had gained}} notoriety for his dilatoriness in writing; the {{contemporary}} poet Churchill teased Johnson {{for the delay}} in producing his long-promised edition of Shakespeare: [...] "He for subscribers baits his hook / and takes your cash, but where's the book?" [...] The comments soon motivated Johnson to finish his Shakespeare, and, after receiving the first payment from a government pension on 20 July 1762, {{he was able to}} dedicate most of his time towards this goal. Earlier that July, the 24-year-old King George III granted Johnson an annual pension of £300 in appreciation for the Dictionary. While the pension did not make Johnson wealthy, it did allow him a modest yet comfortable independence for the remaining 22 years of his life. The award came largely through the efforts of Sheridan and the Earl of Bute. When Johnson questioned if the pension would force him to promote a political agenda or support various officials, he was told by Bute that the pension [...] "is not given you for anything <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> do, but for what you have done".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Paige made {{a return}} to the West End stage {{for the first time in}} six years, as the Chaperone/Beatrice Stockwell in The Drowsy Chaperone at the Novello Theatre. The {{production}} ran for a disappointing 96 performances, although it had opened to a standing ovation from the audience and a generally optimistic reaction from critics. The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Elaine Paige is a good sport... enduring jokes about her reputation for being 'difficult' with a grin that doesn't seem all that forced.... Only the self-importantly serious and the chronically depressed will fail to enjoy this preposterously entertaining evening". Paul Taylor from The Independent was less impressed and wrote [...] "a miscast Elaine Paige manages to be unfunny to an almost ingenious degree as the heroine's bibulous minder". For her performance, Paige was nominated for a What's On Stage Award in the category of Best Supporting Actress in a Musical. She next collaborated with the duo Secret Garden in recording the song [...] "The Things <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>to</b> Me" [...] for their 2007 album, Inside I'm Singing.|$|E
500|$|Washington, {{upon his}} return to Williamsburg, was {{commissioned}} a Lieutenant Colonel in the newly created Virginia Regiment, and ordered by Dinwiddie to raise a force {{to assist in the}} completion of Trent's fort.

[...] Washington was ordered to gather up as many supplies and paid volunteers as he could along the way. By the time he left for the frontier on April 2, he had recruited fewer than 160men. [...] Moving quickly and without artillery, his force marched north and west, picking up additional militia companies along the way. On April 19, outside Winchester, Virginia, Washington received word that a large French force was descending the Allegheny. On reaching Wills Creek he met part of Trent's company, who, in addition to confirming the arrival of the French, brought a supportive message from Tanacharison. [...] To keep Tanacharison's support, Washington decided to advance rather than turning back. However, road-building went slowly, {{and by the end of}} May Washington's company had reached a place known as the Great Meadows (now in Fayette County, Pennsylvania), about [...] south of the forks. There he began construction of a small fort and awaited further news or instructions.|$|E
