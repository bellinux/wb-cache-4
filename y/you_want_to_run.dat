500|$|Walker {{released}} his twenty-third single, [...] "Say No More", for Giant in early 2001. It {{was the first}} single release from his sixth studio album of the same name, peaking at number 33 on the country chart; the only other single, the Jerry Kilgore co-write [...] "If You Ever Feel Like Lovin' Me Again", reached number 27. The latter song was promoted by Giant's parent company, Warner Bros. Records Nashville, as Giant had closed in late 2001. Walker co-produced the album with veteran producers Byron Gallimore and Blake Mevis, and session guitarist Brent Mason. The album also included a song that Walker wrote in high school, and a cover of Ritchie Valens's [...] "La Bamba." [...] Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic rated it three stars, with her review saying that [...] "the sensitivity on this album is so expressive that it makes <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> right out and hug the one you love." [...] Country Standard Time critic Mike Clark considered it a transition to a more country pop-oriented sound, describing the album as being [...] "full of bad lyrics and overwrought production clichés." ...|$|E
500|$|In a game {{in which}} Penn State {{dominated}} the line of scrimmage, the Nittany Lions rushed for 289 yards behind an offensive line that opened up significant holes, allowing Penn State to achieve their goal of rushing the football, despite not achieving offensive tackle Garry Gilliam's goal of 400 yards. Purdue's coach Darrell Hazell had opined earlier in the week that Penn State's offensive line was not as good as previous opponents Wisconsin and Iowa, and Penn State used it as motivation, dominating the line of scrimmage, which numerous offensive lineman noted was [...] "fun". Starting center Ty Howle, who noted,"It's fun, knowing you can go out there and impose your will each play. It's a lot of fun." [...] and all-conference guard John Urschel, who agreed, saying, [...] "This was a real fun game for us, with respect to coming off the ball and just hitting guys. The offensive linemen really enjoyed it. We were having a blast. When you're an offensive lineman and you're getting yards, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the ball over and over again." [...] Allen Robinson caught his 78th pass of the season with his fifth catch of the game, and in doing so topped his 77 catches from the 2012 season. Aside from offensive accomplishments, the defense was also impressive, particularly play from Jordan Lucas, who ESPN commented earlier in the week plays with [...] "swagger", and who, during the game, intercepted a pass, garnering a comment from The Patriot News that he is the [...] "top playmaker in the secondary". Despite jubilation from the victory, including one Penn State player who quipped that the sixth win made Penn State bowl eligible (the NCAA banned Penn State from bowl participation as part of sanctions imposed in the Penn State child sex abuse scandal), seniors nostalgically remembered this was their second-to-last game at Beaver Stadium. The Lions bounced back from their previous loss against Minnesota, and had not lost two consecutive games under Bill O'Brien since their first two in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Since its release, The Social Network {{has been}} cited as inspiring {{involvement}} in start-ups and social media. Bob Lefsetz has stated that: “watching this movie makes <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from the theatre, grab your laptop and build your own empire,” noting that The Social Network has helped fuel an emerging perception that “techies have become the new rock stars.” This has led Dave Knox to comment that: “fifteen years from now we might just look back and realize this movie inspired our next great generation of entrepreneurs.” After seeing the movie, Zuckerberg {{was quoted as saying}} he is [...] "interested to see what effect The Social Network has on entrepreneurship", noting that he gets [...] "lots of messages from people who claim that they have been very much inspired... to start their own company." [...] Saverin echoed these sentiments, stating that the film may inspire [...] "countless others to create and take that leap to start a new business." [...] In one such instance, the co-founders of Wall Street Magnate confirmed that they were inspired to create the fantasy trading community after watching The Social Network.|$|E

2500|$|Due to Building 20's origins as a {{temporary}} structure, researchers and other occupants felt free to modify their environment at will. [...] As described by MIT professor Paul Penfield, [...] "Its 'temporary nature' permitted its occupants to abuse it {{in ways that would}} not be tolerated in a permanent building. If <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a wire from one lab to another, you didn't ask anybody's permission [...] you just got out a screwdriver and poked a hole through the wall". Many building occupants were unaware of the presence of asbestos.|$|R

6000|$|... "Shore {{they left}} there!" [...] drawled Blinky.

5000|$|If {{you have}} a {{high-speed}} network, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> trains <b>to</b> <b>run</b> limited times a day.

6000|$|Lapham {{took out}} his watch and looked at it, and Bartley {{perceived}} that his audience was drawing to a close.

6000|$|I {{think the}} owner of this prize had a wrong opinion about him. He had an {{idea that he was}} one of those fiery, untamed steeds, but he is not of that character. I know the Arab had this idea, because when he brought the horse out for {{inspection}} in Beirout, he kept jerking at the bridle and shouting in Arabic, [...] "Ho! will you? Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away, you ferocious beast, and break your neck?" [...] when all the time the horse was not doing anything in the world, and only looked like he wanted to lean up against something and think. Whenever he is not shying at things, or reaching after a fly, he wants to do that yet. How it would surprise his owner to know this.|$|E
2500|$|The {{restrictions}} {{contained in}} contracts and regulations considerably cramped the entrepreneurial style of Zong, who complained of limits the control structure placed on him.

[...] He stopped a moment and pointed toward a {{neighboring}} cedar. [...] "We'll say that one's three feet in diameter, but, as you're standing, it will shut off a good deal more than a track three feet wide through the bush. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a line from your eye to both edges of the trunk and then carry them out behind it.

When you laugh there are six. Sometimes I have almost counted seven. But I cannot count them now. I have never read books. I {{do not know how to}} read. But Four Eyes taught me much. My grammar is good. He taught me. And in his own eyes I have seen the trouble of the hunger for the world. He was often hungry for the world.

5000|$|Much of the {{commentary}} on Kelley's work centers on {{her use of}} cars as subjects. Her low angles of perspective and emphasis on [...] "sensuous curves and luscious surfaces" [...] are seen as representing a feminine, sexualized take on a conventionally masculine area of interest. By [...] "portraying high-powered muscle cars as seductive objects of desire," [...] she [...] "brings a uniquely female perspective to these objects that are almost synonymous with youthful bad-boy hyper-masculinity."Have {{you ever seen a}} car so sexy that <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> your hands all over it, maybe even stretch out luxuriously on the hood? .... Along with pinup and boudoir photography, the dominion of male artists over car art is being left in the dust. While Robert Bechtle paints photorealistic automobiles in their natural, middle-class habitats, Kelley takes them out of context, removing their utilitarian role and elevating them to works of art, freeing her to infuse them with hyperrealistic detail.Observers state that her works resemble high-definition photographs, but that the images shown in reflection actually make the paintings seem [...] "more realistic than their photographic references." ...|$|R
