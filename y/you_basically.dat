500|$|Preliminary {{designer}} Dick Scherrer requested possible shapes {{upon which}} he could base his low radar cross-section (RCS) design. He was introduced to Denys Overholser, who recommended an aircraft with flat surfaces. Overholser later recounted his discussion with Sherrer: [...] "When Dick Scherrer asked me ... I said 'Well, it's simple, you just {{make it out of}} flat surfaces, and tilt those flat surfaces over, sweeping the edges away from the radar view angle, and that way <b>you</b> <b>basically</b> cause the energy to reflect away from the radar.'" [...] Scherrer subsequently drew a preliminary low-RCS aircraft with faceted surfaces. At the same time, Overholser hired mathematician Bill Schroeder, with whom he had a prior working relationship – in fact, it was Schroeder who trained Overholser on mathematics relating to stealth aircraft. Kenneth Watson was hired as the senior lead aircraft designer.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1990, {{an equally}} {{contentious}} discussion of vos Savant's article {{took place in}} Cecil Adams's column The Straight Dope (Adams 1990). Adams initially answered, incorrectly, that the chances for the two remaining doors must each be one in two. After a reader wrote in to correct the mathematics of Adams's analysis, Adams agreed that mathematically he had been wrong. [...] "You pick door #1. Now you're offered this choice: open door #1, or open door #2 and door #3. In the latter case you keep the prize if it's behind either door. You'd rather have a two-in-three shot at the prize than one-in-three, wouldn't you? If you think about it, the original problem offers <b>you</b> <b>basically</b> the same choice. Monty is saying in effect: {{you can keep your}} one door or you can have the other two doors, one of which (a non-prize door) I'll open for you." [...] Adams did say the Parade version left critical constraints unstated, and without those constraints, the chances of winning by switching were not necessarily two out of three (e.g., it was not reasonable to assume the host always opens a door). Numerous readers, however, wrote in to claim that Adams had been [...] "right the first time" [...] and that the correct chances were one in two.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, the Doctor {{will kill}} when given {{no other option}} and {{occasionally}} in self-defence; examples {{of this can be}} seen in The Tomb of the Cybermen, The Dominators, The Invasion, The Krotons, Spearhead from Space, The Sea Devils, The Three Doctors, The Brain of Morbius, The Talons of Weng-Chiang, The Invasion of Time, Earthshock, Arc of Infinity, Vengeance on Varos, The Two Doctors, Silver Nemesis, [...] "World War Three", [...] "The Christmas Invasion", [...] "Tooth and Claw", [...] "The Age of Steel", [...] "The Runaway Bride" [...] and most notably in Remembrance of the Daleks when he arranges for the planet Skaro to be destroyed. [...] It has been stated numerous times in the programme, beginning in 2005, that he was responsible for destroying both the Dalek and Time Lord races in order to end the Time War. Another example of the Doctor purposely taking a life is The Sontaran Experiment, where he tells his companion Harry Sullivan to remove a device from the Sontaran ship, which causes the death of the Sontaran, something the Doctor knew would happen but Harry did not. Later incarnations were more ruthless and murderous. In the 2005 episode [...] "The End of the World", the Doctor teleports Cassandra back onto the ship and does nothing to prevent her death, even ignoring her cries for help and pity. Similarly, in [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship", he strands Solomon on a spacecraft with a homing device to which several missiles have locked on, effectively consigning him to death. In situations where fixed points in history must be preserved, the Doctor is sometimes faced with hard choices resulting in the deaths of many; in The Visitation he started the Great Fire of London, and in [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] (2008) he caused the volcano above Pompeii to erupt (which killed everyone in the city except one family that he rescued but saved the rest of the world). On other occasions he is seen to be critical of others who use deadly force, such as his companions Leela in The Face of Evil and Talons of Weng-Chiang, or Jack Harkness in [...] "Utopia" [...] (2007). In the episode [...] "The Lodger" [...] (2011), a member of the Doctor's football team offhandedly mentions annihilating the team they will play next week. The Doctor looks very angry and says, [...] "No violence, not while I'm around, not today, not ever. I'm the Doctor, the oncoming storm... and <b>you</b> <b>basically</b> meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?" ...|$|E

50|$|The {{sound of}} Pridebowl {{can be said}} to be speedy, melodic punk rock with serious, {{explosive}} lyrics and catchy rhythms.

2500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} of Alone in the Dark, Boll {{explains how}} he funds his films: [...] "Maybe {{you know it}} but it's {{not so easy to}} finance movies in total.

5000|$|Regarding the song's meaning, vocalist Dave Williams explained, [...] "Every {{religion}} has a list ...

50|$|For example, if {{one had a}} {{home loan}} of $600,000 at 5% per year and an offset account where you have {{deposited}} $200,000, then you would be charged interest only on the $400,000 (i.e. $600,000 − $200,000). The new interest payable here amounts to $20,000 ($600,000 × 5% - $200,000 × 5% = $400,000 × 5%). Therefore, <b>you</b> have <b>basically</b> reduced the interest by $10,000 (200,000× 5%), {{in comparison to the}} original interest that amounts to $30,000.|$|R
5000|$|The hectic {{gameplay}} makes {{most players}} inevitably begin shouting their orders. Smith suggests {{this was not}} an intended feature.

5000|$|Computer Gaming World disliked The Eidolon. The {{reviewer}} {{stated that}} it was as difficult as Koronis Rift but with no save game feature. While praising the graphics and sound, he criticized the game for [...] "a lack of imagination. You get transported to god-knows-where ... and <b>you</b> <b>basically</b> shoot everything in sight. Is this a reasonable—let alone responsible—way to explore a new world?" [...] The magazine later described the game as [...] "one of the worst" [...] of 1986.|$|E
5000|$|Documentary filmmaker Connie Field {{assesses the}} film quite negatively: I felt Clarke was {{exploiting}} him ... not because ... {{of trying to}} reveal a person at all. ... if <b>you</b> <b>basically</b> make someone drunk {{in front of your}} camera, thats exploitative. ... Who cares if the reality is that this person does drink a lot?

50|$|All {{children}} and young people from 6 years are welcome in FOS. Race, social origin, nationality, sexual orientation, physical or cultural differences is never a basis for refusal. Also are people with any philosophical, religious or political conviction welcome as long as these principles are compatible with the vision of Open Scouting. FOS believes that a conviction is never finished, that you have to accept that a different view can and may have consequences and that <b>you</b> <b>basically</b> always {{have to be willing to}} review your vision and possibly amend it. FOS encourages a respectful dialogue about the various forms of spirituality in society. This confrontation of ideas is believed to enrich the spiritual choices of the members.|$|E
5000|$|Electric scooters and {{motorcycles}} need {{very little}} maintenance. As Wired magazine's transportation editor Damon Lavrinc reported after an experiment {{of trying to}} go six months using nothing but a Zero electric motorcycle: [...] "with only a battery, a motor, and a black box (i.e. the controller) to keep you moving, electric motorcycles are a breeze to maintain compared to a conventional motorcycle, what with all the lubricating and adjusting and tuning you have to do. <b>You</b> <b>basically</b> just worry about consumables: brake pads, tires, maybe a brake fluid flush. That’s about it." [...] Electric scooters and motorcycles equipped with regenerative braking typically have longer brake pad life because {{a significant portion of}} braking duty can be performed with the electric motor instead of the mechanical friction brakes.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{were outraged}} by Miley's performance, {{saying it was}} {{over the top and}} that {{grabbing}} her crotch and sticking out her tongue was too sexual to be on television.

After a while you can't get your breath but you still try to get your breath, so when you were trying to breathe in through your mouth you are sucking the water in, and if you try to breathe in through your nose, you are sniffing the water in.

5000|$|Popsugar from Buzzsugar gave a good {{review to}} the episode. [...] "I'll admit that I wasn't sure how the Salvatore {{brothers}} could survive this week's The Vampire Diaries.

[...] Popsugar also commented on the Elena/Damon relationship saying: [...] "Can you say sexual tension? Elena and Damon get into it while standing thisclose (in the rain, no less) as they argue about if Elena can go to save Stefan. They really have a nice mix of heat and genuine concern for each other. I guess time will only tell when/if these two get together." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pitchfork Media ranked Open Your Heart {{at number}} 30 on {{its list of}} the best album of 2012, with Ian Cohen writing: [...] "It’s risky to use their studio albums to say {{anything}} definitive about the Men at this point. So let’s just forget about narratives and evolution and appreciate Open Your Heart as a record that makes them sound capable of doing whatever the hell they want. It cycles through barnstorming classic rawk, searing punk, beer-chugging country, and muscular krautrock. If <b>you</b> <b>basically</b> like any kind of music made with guitars, there’s something for you here."
