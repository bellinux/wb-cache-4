I take it back. I take it back.'" [...] According to Simpson, the song [...] "kind of relates to the last album , but it grew with the new record. And every girl has gone through that situation.

Here Comes the Pain {{received}} more positive reviews from both IGN and GameSpot, {{both of whom}} cited the expanded season mode as an improvement, although flaws were still visible in the mode. It improved from the previous three WWF SmackDown! games, as {{it was written by}} actual WWE storyline writers. Both games also featured generic music, though the quality of it had improved. Shut Your Mouth featured little improvement to the commentary, which was then removed completely from Here Comes the Pain. WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW received a more positive review than previous games, as GameShark stated that it was [...] "a wonderful new edition to the SmackDown! family, serving up slick graphics, vastly enhanced gameplay, and lots of other bells and whistles that make the whole package shine." [...] WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 received a positive review and a 9.2/10 rating by IGN due to the additions of matches, the General Manager mode, and the ability to defend championships in exhibition mode. WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 {{received more}} negative reviews due to lack of an appealing season mode and little improvement of features, with the exceptions of the [...] "Ultimate Control moves," [...] "Struggle system," [...] and the ECW Extreme Rules matches.|$|E

[...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> turn me inside out."

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{describes}} the protagonist revealing several bedroom fantasies {{in which she}} would like to engage, asking her lover playfully to [...] "touch her body". Though the song features sexually oriented lyrics, critics deemed that the melody and playful tone of the song made them less explicit. The song's lyrics find Carey maintaining the duo keep the relationship private from the media, as she threatens to [...] "hunt him down" [...] if he shall record anything of their private life. According to Ben Ratliff from The New York Times, [...] "Touch My Body" [...] is a [...] "questionably sexy striptease: a goofy-sleazy tryst vignette", with Carey singing [...] "If there's a camera up in here then I best not catch this flick on YouTube." [...] Critic Rodman felt the song's lyrics describe the protagonist's sexual fantasies, but also serves as a warning to [...] "potential touchers: 'If you run <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> brag about our secret rendezvous / I will hunt you down.' Yikes!" [...] In an interview with Fox News, journalist Hollie McKay asked Carey if there was any literal interpretation regarding the lyrics [...] "Touch My Body / Put Me on the Floor / Wrestle Me Around / Play With Me Some More", to which she replied [...] "There is no full-blown meaning; it is just cute and it's one of those songs that makes me happy. I wasn't taking it that seriously. It was just fun experience." [...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters wrote that in the song [...] "Mariah coos soft-core phone sex fantasies over plinked piano notes, all while referencing YouTube in {{what appears to be a}} desperate grab for relevance."

500|$|Bell {{said that}} at first Anna was written plainer and more general. [...] "In {{the first draft of}} the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. She was kind of {{specific}} and very girly," [...] which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always {{wanted to be part of}} Disney animated feature, but she [...] "wanted to be a very specific type of princess", who [...] "was way more awkward than the normal princesses", not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress' own personality to the character, [...] embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a [...] "typical Disney moment", as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself would say in real life, which included some [...] "nonsensical rambling". [...] "I think I said, [...] "This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait—what?" [...] Words just spill out of her mouth too quickly and she has to backtrack." [...] Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell [...] "wanted her to also have hair in her mouth", which took inspiration from her own real life. [...] "Sometimes I wake up like that. Then you have hair in <b>your</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on." [...] Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress' biting her lip a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed.|$|E
