5|$|The {{album was}} written and {{recorded}} {{in two months}} while the band was still on tour in support of their previous record, Happiness... Is Not a Fish That <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Catch,</b> which had only been released 14 months prior. A combination of lead singer-songwriter Raine Maida's prolific songwriting {{at the time and}} lead-guitarist Mike Turner's discovery of The Age of Spiritual Machines in a bookstore hurried the completion of the album. The band only took a break from recording to organize and perform at Summersault in 2000. Unlike their previous releases, this one features a more organic, acoustic sound, and less obvious layering and electronic texturing.|$|E

2500|$|The narrator's {{conscience}} plagues him greatly as {{he finds}} himself trapped between the [...] "hatred of the empire [...] served" [...] and his [...] "rage against the evil-spirited little beasts who tried to make [...] job impossible." [...] He claims that he is [...] "all for the Burmese and all against the British" [...] {{and goes on to}} say that [...] "feelings like these are the normal by-products of imperialism; ask any Anglo-Indian official, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>catch</b> him off duty." [...] This creates a sense of empathy from the imperialists for the natives, but as they treat their conquerors badly, they start to feel less guilty and so treat them badly once more.|$|E

2500|$|By 1999, {{the group}} had sales of about 1,000,000 of their first two albums. [...] That year they {{released}} their third album titled Happiness... Is Not a Fish That <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Catch.</b> The album included such hits as [...] "Thief", a song about a young girl named Mina Kim that the band met who had cancer, as well as [...] "One Man Army" [...] and [...] "Is Anybody Home?". Legendary jazz drummer Elvin Jones was featured on the song [...] "Stealing Babies". Multi-instrumentalist Jamie Edwards was brought in 1996 for the sessions for the album and remained an unofficial member of the band until 2001 {{when he was asked}} to officially join the band to finish the album Gravity. Shortly after the completion of the record, Jamie chose to leave the band, returning briefly to stand in for Mike Eisenstein during the Canadian tour of Gravity. The band also played an eleven-song set at Woodstock 1999.|$|E
2500|$|Freight trains {{operated}} by MMA were allowed (not [...] "permitted", see below) by regulators in Canada (Transport Canada) and the United States (Federal Railroad Administration) to have Single Person Train Operation (SPTO, alternately OPTO) status (1 operator). The [...] "permit" [...] process, which requires public input, was not followed. The Canadian regulator and the MMA {{entered into a}} negotiation process at the culmination of which, sometime before {{the second week of}} July 2012, the government allowed MMA to reduce their manpower to SPTO. An average of 80 tankcars per train was carried on this route under the supervision of one person only. The Maine regulator had already allowed SPTO status before the first week of April 2012. The use of SPTO for MMA freight trains was a cost-cutting move for which the railway company has received much criticism. In May 2010, former MMA engineer Jarod Briggs of Millinocket, Maine explained to the Bangor Daily News that “so much could happen in a 12-hour shift on one of these trains, such as a washed-out track, downed trees or mechanical failure. What if the engineer onboard were to encounter a medical problem? Who is going to know about it? If there is a fire engine or an ambulance needing to get by a train or a crossing when that happens, it could take hours.” Briggs left MMA to work for another railway in 2007; while he described the lone crew member involved in the Lac-Mégantic derailment as [...] "a very good engineer, one of the better on the property", he has long expressed safety concerns about the company's overall train operations because “if you have two people watching <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>catch</b> a mistake. It was all about cutting, cutting, cutting.” ...|$|E
