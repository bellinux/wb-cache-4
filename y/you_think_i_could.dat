500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Peter Neal {{was making a}} short film {{documentary}} about the Experience, titled Experience (also known as See My Music Talking). [...] On December 19, 1967, he captured Hendrix playing an impromptu solo version of [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'". [...] The filming took place during a publicity photo session at the London studio of photographer Bruce Fleming, who had photographed the British album cover for Are You Experienced. [...] For the shoot, a twelve-string Zemaitis acoustic guitar restrung for a left-handed player was conveniently on hand. [...] Hendrix, seated on a stool against a white backdrop, sang while playing the guitar. [...] After a false start, he settles into the song, which biographer Keith Shadwick describes as [...] "100 percent country blues... s with great feeling, however artificial {{the circumstances of the}} session may have been". [...] Hendrix's acoustic guitar playing shows familiarity with the styles of Lead Belly, Robert Johnson, and Skip James. [...] Music writer Michael Fairchild compares some of his guitar techniques to those found in 1928 recordings by Tommy Johnson, such as [...] "Big Fat Mama" [...] and [...] "Big Road Blues". [...] The guitar was tuned down two whole steps (C–F–B–E–G–C), perhaps influenced by Lead Belly's twelve-string style. [...] At the end of the 3:05 performance, Hendrix laughs it off with [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do that?" [...] In addition to the 1968 documentary, the [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'" [...] performance is included in the 1973 film Jimi Hendrix and accompanying soundtrack album (re-released on Blues). [...] In the UK, it was released by Reprise Records as a single in 1973 with the Experience's adaptation of B.B. King's [...] "Rock Me Baby" [...] recorded at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 as the B-side.|$|E
2500|$|La Païva reigned {{for years}} as a popular hostess known for her lavish open houses, teas, and dinners and salon frequented largely by {{well-known}} male writers, such as Gustave Flaubert, Émile Zola, Paul de Saint-Victor, Arsène Houssaye, and others, including the painter Eugène Delacroix. The bill of fare was so lavish that she overheard two guests discussing how much she could possibly be worth. One posited 10 million francs a year, at which comment La Païva scoffed, [...] "You must be mad. Ten millions? Why that would barely yield an income of 500,000 francs. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give you peaches and ripe grapes in January on 500,000 francs a year? Why my table alone costs me more than that!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Rather," [...] replied March. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{it would}} be better for me to ride behind <b>you?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage to hold on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have a needle, Sir, in my basket, {{and thread}} too. Will {{you let me}} try to mend it for <b>you?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it neater than you could.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Godolphin did {{not become}} serious, but he became if {{possible}} more sincere. [...] "Do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do anything with it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stared at}} her in sheer perplexity. [...] "Letters!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Damn the letters! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> write any letters now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Do {{you suspect}} death? if I were to suspect death I should die now, [...] Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> walk pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, Hunterleys," [...] he suggested, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do {{something}} for the crowd on my little boat--a luncheon party or a cruise, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Mother, did <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be {{so silly}} and selfish, after I'd refused his love, {{when it was}} freshest, if not best?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no; not for them,' rejoined Mrs Squeers; 'on {{purpose for}} you against you came home. Lor! <b>you</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{have made such}} a mistake as that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] {{she begged}} earnestly. [...] "Be reasonable! How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> marry <b>you?</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{live with you}} {{up there in the}} hills?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear to stay away! Oh, James! have I {{been too}} useless and {{helpless}} for you {{even to be}} glad to see me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{listen to}} such terms!' cried the indignant lad. 'Give up the O! Why, I {{would never be}} able to face my brothers!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold!" [...] {{cried the}} clerk, more alarmed than he cared to show, [...] "that's not the price. Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{sell it for}} that price?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Any way, any way, if I {{may only}} have {{her to lie}} and look at me, it is {{happiness}} unlooked for! <b>You</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have treated her otherwise?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; breakfast! no-how can I eat now? how can <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> eat {{at such a}} time as this? Do {{you take}} yours; never mind me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{is nothing}} of the sort, father. How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do {{anything}} so foolish and wrong? Surely you must know me better than that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! why? I {{worked as}} hard as any of them. But I wanted to get away. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have stayed there all my life?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him so intently that he thought she must be pleased at his proposal. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get him back?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{understand}} how completely different it is. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be so intimate {{with him as}} I am if anything of the kind were possible?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in this case,--perhaps never,--what {{it is that}} {{a husband}} feels about his wife. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say a word against you, even to a friend?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{would not}} have <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so,--if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help it. <b>I</b> {{did not intend to}} be rough with you. When you told me that my life was disreputable--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not tell}} me that I ought to marry Tom," [...] said Ayala, almost {{standing}} off in anger from the proferred kiss. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> love him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you mean?" [...] demanded Mavering, {{getting up}} and {{standing}} over Boardman. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> accept the situation, as you call it, and live?" ...|$|E

6000|$|I onward go, I stop, With hinged {{knees and}} steady hand, to dress wounds; I am firm with each--the pangs are sharp, yet unavoidable; One {{turns to me}} his {{appealing}} eyes--poor boy!

6000|$|... "Because I like to be. It's {{easier to}} clean up for one than two, that's why. The lazy blanket-loafers! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have stood one around? No wonder they got scurvy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please don't say {{anything}} more," [...] she begged. [...] "I can't--quite bear it just now. You know, you must remember--there is my mother. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> leave her to struggle alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must believe}} me a perfect wretch if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> leave you {{in such a}} condition. But, Joseph, I {{would like to go}} back and dress myself properly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow, {{how could}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> so far insult you?" [...] says I. [...] "Well, then," [...] says he, [...] "that's a matter settled, and we go." ...|$|E
6000|$|This was {{too much}} for Mrs. Travers. [...] "I! Create it!" [...] she exclaimed, indignantly, but under her breath. [...] "How on earth do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have done it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Astonishment, dismay, {{and anger}} held me dumb between {{them for a}} few moments. Then, as the power of speech returned, I said: [...] "Confound you, Mackay! <b>You</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{possibly}} have had any hand in that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because--name of God!--you enrage me {{by refusing}} me a service well within your powers.
