500|$|The couple's daughter, Kenshi (Kataiko), {{was born}} in 999. Two years later Nobutaka died during a cholera epidemic. As a married woman Murasaki would have had {{servants}} to run the household and care for her daughter, giving her ample leisure time. She enjoyed reading and had access to romances (monogatari) such as The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter and The Tales of Ise. Scholars believe she may have started writing The Tale of Genji before her husband's death; it is known she was writing after she was widowed, perhaps {{in a state of}} grief. In her diary she describes her feelings after her husband's death: [...] "I felt depressed and confused. For some <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> existed from day to day in listless fashion... doing little more than registering the passage of time... The thought of my continuing loneliness was quite unbearable".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, {{art critic}} Camille Paglia praised {{the film in}} Glittering Images, {{comparing}} some of its scenes to works by modern painters and calling it [...] "the greatest work of art in recent memory". Paglia explained that the film's finale, [...] "has more inherent artistic value, emotional power, and global impact than anything by the artists you name. It's because the art world has flat-lined and become an echo chamber of received opinion and toxic over-praise. It's like the emperor's new clothes -- people are too intimidated to admit what they secretly think or what they might think with their blinders off. Episode III epitomizes the modern digital art movement, more so than other piece from the last 30 <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> considered using Japanese anime for the digital art chapter of the book, but it lacked the overwhelming operatic power and yes, seriousness of Lucas's Revenge of the Sith." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around 998 Murasaki married Fujiwara no Nobutaka (c. 950 – c. 1001); {{she gave}} birth to a {{daughter}} in 999. Two years later her husband died. Scholars are unsure when she started writing the novel (monogatari) The Tale of Genji but she was certainly writing after she was widowed, perhaps in a state of grief. In her diary she describes her feelings after her husband's death: [...] "I felt depressed and confused. For some <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> existed from day to day in listless fashion... doing little more than registering the passage of time.... The thought of my continuing loneliness was quite unbearable". On the strength of her reputation as an author, Murasaki entered service with Shōshi at court, almost certainly at the request of Shōshi's father, Fujiwara no Michinaga, perhaps as an incentive to continue adding chapters to The Tale of Genji. She began writing her diary after entering imperial service.|$|E
2500|$|In 1877, John Spencer-Churchill was {{appointed}} Viceroy of Ireland, with Randolph as his private secretary, {{resulting in the}} Churchill family's relocation to Dublin, a city in British-controlled Ireland. It was here that Jennie's second son, Jack, was born in 1880; there has been speculation that Randolph was not his biological father. Throughout much of the 1880s Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged, during which she had many suitors. Churchill had virtually no relationship with his father; referring to his mother, Churchill later stated that [...] "I loved her dearly - but at a distance." [...] His relationship with Jack would be warm, and they were close at various points in their lives. In Dublin, he was educated in reading and mathematics by a governess, while {{he and his brother}} were cared for primarily by their nanny, Elizabeth Ann Everest; Churchill was devoted to her and nicknamed her [...] "Woomany". In My Early Life he wrote: [...] "She had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lived." ...|$|E

Billman was {{given the opportunity to}} study art in March and April in Antwerp. The journey gave inspiration for new motifs. But above all had the harbour environments strongly reminded him of his years as a sailor. Within a year after the trip he made some of his classic black and white woodcuts with sailor motifs such as: Through the Red Sea - Changing of the guard in the stokehole (1936) and The newly signed on sailors (1936), which is one of Billman's best-known woodcuts. About the woodcut [...] Stoker watch goes over deck in the storm (1936/37) the artist said: [...] "I remember the first scene I got inspiration from. It was when the watch came up and the boat was filled with water and there they stood up to their necks in water, so to speak. That I thought, I would try to portray. But it took many <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> stored such motifs." [...] "I've experienced all my images myself", Torsten Billman often underlined.|$|E

2500|$|Freeman Dyson, a British (and later American) {{physicist}} who {{had worked}} as a young man with RAF Bomber Command from July 1943 {{to the end of the}} war, wrote in later years: [...] "For many <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> intended to write a book on the bombing. Now I do not need to write it, because Vonnegut has written it much better than I could. He was in Dresden at the time and saw what happened. His book is not only good literature. It is also truthful. The only inaccuracy that I found in it is that it does not say that the night attack which produced the holocaust was a British affair. The Americans only came the following day to plow over the rubble. Vonnegut, being American, did not want to write his account in such a way that the whole thing could be blamed on the British. Apart from that, everything he says is true." [...] Dyson later goes on to say: [...] "Since the beginning of the war I had been retreating step by step from one moral position to another, until at the end I had no moral position at all".|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Standing Bear {{decided to}} leave. He {{was no longer}} willing to endure {{existence}} {{under the control of}} an overseer. Luther sold his land allotment and bought a house in Sioux City, Iowa, where he worked as a clerk in a wholesale firm. After a brief job doing rodeo performances with Miller Brothers 101 Ranch in Oklahoma, he moved to California to seek full-time employment in the motion picture industry. In later years, Luther reflected upon his decision to leave the reservation: “Sixteen years ago I left reservation life and my native people, the Oglala Sioux, because I was no longer willing to endure existence under the control of an overseer. For about the same number of <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> tried to live a peaceful and happy life; tried to adapt myself and make re-adjustments to fit the white man’s mode of existence. [...] But I was unsuccessful. I developed into a chronic disturber. [...] I was a bad Indian, and the agent and I never got along. I remained a hostile, even a savage, if you please. And I still am. I am incurable.” [...] While Standing Bear left the confinement of the reservation, he continued his serious responsibilities and as an Oglala Lakota chief, fighting to preserve Lakota heritage and sovereignty through public education.|$|E
2500|$|In 1874, {{the family}} moved to Providence. In the fall of that year the General Conference met with Roger Williams Church. It was notable as the first General Conference at which a woman presided over the public meeting of the W.M.S. As President of the W.M.S., she was asked to make the dedicatory address at Myrtle Hall, Storer College, May 30, 1879. For this she made her first journey alone, and, {{preceding}} the dedication, gave an evening of reading to defray the expenses of the journey. Rev. A. H. Morrell invited her to preach for him one Sunday morning. This she did, and thereafter, through the years, did considerable pulpit work. On moving to Providence, Burlingame became actively identified with the W.C.T.U. movement, then only a few months old; first with the Providence Union, then as corresponding secretary of the State Union, and in 1884–1890 as president of the latter. It was during her presidency that the campaign was on which won for a period of three years, 1886–89, State Constitutional Prohibition. Into this, she threw all of her energies, as she did in 1887 into the effort to secure state suffrage for women. Through all the years she has been keenly interested in these two reform movements, and has lived to see both realized nationwide. After giving up her state office in the W. C. T. U., she was appointed, through Miss Willard's influence, National Evangelist. This gave her credentials to speak for the cause wherever she might be. As a sample of her activities we quote, “For several <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the work connected with the Presidency of the R. I. W. C. T. U., speaking once or more every Sunday, attending frequent conventions, keeping track of work at Headquarters and the interests of the local Unions, editing a semimonthly edition of the Outlook, and the monthly Missionary Helper.” ...|$|E
