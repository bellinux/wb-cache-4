[...] She asserted film had become [...] "hypnotized by the sound of its own voice." [...] She said that words should neither reduce the camera work nor repute what the camera says. Graves praised Rowland Brown ast one of the few writers or directors to go against the tide of words. She credits Brown with [...] "the first appearance of a style that remains unique in the development of motion picture dialogue [...] "both in [...] "Doorway to Hell" [...] and [...] "Quick Millions." [...] Graves illustrates Brown's style with the final scene from [...] "Quick Millions," [...] in which the gang leader, Spencer Tracy says, [...] "take <b>your</b> <b>elbow</b> out of my ribs," [...] and the lieutenant says, [...] "That's not my elbow." [...] An unseen hand pulls down a shade and the audience hears two shots. End of movie! In comparison, Graves points to Franchot Tone's [...] "pretty speech" [...] at the end of [...] "Mutiny on the Bounty," [...] suggesting the words get lost against the dramatic background.|$|E
