5|$|Command of the Amazon {{then passed}} to Captain Samuel Sutton, who was succeeded the {{following}} year by Captain William Parker. Under Parker, Amazon captured the 16-gun privateer Felix on 26 July 1803, and survived a brush with a French fleet off Cape Capet on 2 May 1804. Amazon {{was one of the}} ships {{to take part in the}} Trafalgar Campaign {{the following year}}, serving with Nelson in the Mediterranean. On one occasion in December 1804 Nelson ordered Parker to bring a consignment of live bullocks to supply the fleet off Toulon. The Amazon was a notably smart ship, and had just been repainted, so presumably the instruction to convert his ship into a floating farmyard was not received with much enthusiasm. Parker duly returned with a shipment, prompting Nelson to enquire with gentle humour 'Well, Parker, of course you would not dirty the Amazon for much for anything; have <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> a dozen and a half, or a dozen?' Parker had in fact brought sixty bullocks and thirty sheep, prompting Nelson to promise a reward for his good service.|$|E

25|$|The band's sound {{usually has}} {{elements}} of punk rock, pop and alternative rock. I Brought You My Bullets, <b>You</b> <b>Brought</b> Me Your Love, the band's debut album, features a raw sound that has guitar riffs, very energetic vocals and sometimes screaming. The album {{is considered an}} emo album with strong influences from punk rock and hardcore punk. I Brought You My Bullets, <b>You</b> <b>Brought</b> Me Your Love also has some influences from heavy metal. The second album Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge {{was one of the}} albums that launched the emo genre into the mainstream. The band's album The Black Parade lacks the post-hardcore elements featured on the first two My Chemical Romance albums and features elements of pop punk, emo and punk rock. The fourth My Chemical Romance album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys continues the band's alternative rock and pop punk sound with some new elements of power pop, pop rock and electronic rock.|$|E

After these, he came to be recognised on the street by the public, and was invited to appear on other television shows, such as Top Gear, Parkinson, Breakfast with Frost, and Question Time.|$|E

25|$|My Chemical Romance (often {{abbreviated}} as MCR) was an American {{rock band}} from Newark, New Jersey, active from 2001 to 2013. The band's best-known lineup consisted of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero, bassist Mikey Way and drummer Bob Bryar. Founded by Gerard, Mikey, Toro, Matt Pelissier, and later joined by Iero, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, <b>You</b> <b>Brought</b> Me Your Love in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records {{the next year}} and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004. Shortly after the album's release, Pelissier was replaced by Bob Bryar. A commercial success, the album was awarded platinum status over a year later.|$|E

25|$|Hauerwas {{finds the}} {{language}} of “rights” to be disturbing as it assumes that people relate to others as strangers, and lends even {{the understanding of the}} family to that of a contractual society. He argues that being part of a family, however, is not a voluntary undertaking. As such, when one is part of a family, the kinds of responsibilities each member holds are in relation to each other. Hauerwas finds that as a parent, you have a duty to your children, not just because <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> them into existence, but because the role of parent is to ensure the children are brought up {{in a way that is}} conducive to the community’s values. Thus, the issue with “rights” language is that it attempts to prevent maltreatment of individuals to the point of exclusion of familial and communal responsibility. Hauerwas’s bottom line is that there can be no real society if its members only relate in terms of noninterference. The language of rights destroys society because we regard people as strangers instead of assuming the responsibility towards them as family and members of the community that we share.|$|E

Efforts from inside the city failed, though, and Aratus quietly retreated, hoping to remain unnoticed. Cleomenes {{nonetheless}} discovered the plan and {{sent a message to}} Aratus asking about the goal of his expedition. Aratus replied that he had come to stop Cleomenes from fortifying Belbina. Cleomenes responded to this by saying: [...] "If it's all the same to you, write and tell me why <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> along those torches and ladders." ...|$|E

500|$|After the battle, Xerxes {{was curious}} {{as to what the}} Greeks had been trying to do (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. The answer was: all the other men were {{participating}} in the Olympic Games. When Xerxes asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: [...] "an olive-wreath". Upon hearing this, Tigranes, a Persian general, said: [...] "Good heavens, Mardonius, what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us? It is not for riches that they contend but for honor!" [...] (Godley translation) or otherwise, [...] "Ye Gods, Mardonius, what men have <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> us to fight against?

500|$|The play {{received}} overwhelmingly negative reviews, {{although some}} critics had minor compliments for Bara. Biographer Eve Golden described the reviews of Bara's acting as [...] "nothing less than vicious", but the commentary about the {{play as a}} whole was even more negative. Variety expected Bara to draw audiences to the theater for at least a few weeks, but said opinions in the daily press were united about how bad the play was. In The New York Times, Alexander Woollcott mocked the dialogue, which included lines such as, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> the cocaine?" [...] and [...] "You make my heart laugh and I feel like a woman of the streets." [...] Delivered seriously, this dialog drew laughter from the audience. Woollcott highlighted one particular line: [...] "I'm going to be so bad, I'll be remembered always." [...] He said Bara was bad, but not bad enough to be memorable. He credited her for speaking clearly and for not losing her composure when the audience laughed at her. Other reviewers gave Bara similarly faint praise: she had [...] "average competence" [...] or [...] "was not so bad". Some complimented her looks or her glamorous wardrobe.|$|E

500|$|Annemarie Roelofs {{recalled}} that {{critics of the}} Feminist Improvising Group were always either very positive, or very negative; {{there was never any}} middle-ground. Nicols and Roelofs said they received little support from male improvisers, who criticised their technical ability and referred to them as women, not musicians. FIG's message that [...] "anyone can do it" [...] antagonised many who value [...] "technical virtuosity" [...] and [...] "improvisational competence". Nicols said they also complained about FIG's [...] "irreverent approach to technique and tradition", while Smith suggested that they may have felt threatened by the [...] "spectacle of so many unsupervised and unpredictable women on the stage". Irène Schweizer {{recalled that}} FIG were invited to perform at the Total Music Meeting in Berlin in November 1979 because she had played at the festival before (in all-men groups). But after seeing FIG perform, the organiser asked Schweizer [...] "how come <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> such a group, they can't play, and they are not good enough." [...] Nicols said that avant-garde musician Alexander von Schlippenbach also complained about FIG being there, saying that [...] "we couldn't play our instruments" [...] and that he could have found [...] "loads of men that would have played a lot better".|$|E
