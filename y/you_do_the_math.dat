25|$|I had {{my editor}} count shots. There are 139 dance {{shots in the}} film. 111 are Natalie Portman untouched. 28 are her dance double Sarah Lane. If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>math,</b> that's 80% Natalie Portman. What about duration? The shots that feature the double are wide shots and rarely play for longer than one second. There are two {{complicated}} longer dance sequences that we used face replacement. Even so, if we were judging by time, over 90% would be Natalie Portman. And to be clear, Natalie did dance on pointe in pointe shoes. If {{you look at the}} final shot of the opening prologue, which lasts 85 seconds, and was danced completely by Natalie, she exits the scene on pointe. That is completely her without any digital magic. I am responding to this to put this to rest and to defend my actor. Natalie sweated long and hard to deliver a great physical and emotional performance. And I don't want anyone to think that's not her they are watching. It is.|$|E

5000|$|In December 2010, Close began filming Albert Nobbs in Dublin. She had {{previously}} won an Obie in 1982 {{for her role}} in the play on stage. She had been working on the film, in which she appeared alongside 101 Dalmatians co-star Mark Williams, for almost 20 years, and aside from starring in it, she co-wrote the screenplay, and produced the film. Close expressed that it became more important for her to make this film to stimulate conversations about transgender issues, [...] "There came a point where I asked, 'Am I willing to live {{the rest of my life}} having given up on this?' And I said, 'No I won't.' Some people will change their point of view, and those who are either too old, or too blinkered, to accept the beauty of difference will just have to 'die off'." [...] In the film, Close played the title role of Albert Nobbs, a woman living her life as a man in 1800s Ireland after being sexually assaulted as a young girl. While the film itself received mixed reviews, Close and Janet McTeer received rave reviews for their performances. Close's performance was noted for being her most subtle and introverted performance yet and a departure from her other roles. She received Academy Award, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and multiple critics nominations for her performance. Close was asked about the fact of not having an Oscar during the film's awards campaign, for which she answered: [...] "And I remember being astounded that I met some people who were really kind of almost hyper-ventilating as to whether they were going to win or not, and I have never understood that. Because if <b>you</b> just <b>do</b> <b>the</b> simple <b>math,</b> <b>the</b> amount of people who are in our two unions, the amount of people who in our profession are out of work at any given time, the amount of movies that are made every year, and then you're one of five.

5000|$|In June 2009, {{the island}} was {{declared}} rat-free {{for the first time}} in 229 years, although the site will be continually monitored for another two years for confirmation. In the preceding autumn, helicopters dropped brodifacoum poison onto the island from buckets for a week, which eliminated the rat population. Signs show that several species of birds, including Aleutian cackling geese, ptarmigan, peregrine falcons, and black oystercatchers, are starting to nest again on the island. [...] However, the associated nontarget mortality, i.e., the deaths of animals other than the rats, was significant. [...] Some non-target mortality was expected, but the actual quantity greatly exceeded what was predicted. The Ornithological Council reported that more than 420 birds were killed as a result of the rat eradication program. Forty-six bald eagles died (exceeding the known population of 22 bald eagles on the island); toxicological analysis revealed lethal levels of brodifacoum in 12 of the 16 carcasses tested. Of the 320 glaucous-winged gull carcasses collected, toxicology tests implicated brodifacoum in 24 of the 34 tested. Fifty-four carcasses of another 25 bird species were found. The report found that the lead contractor which the FWS used, Island Conservation, had dropped more poisonous bait than they had proposed, including bait which was intended to be saved as a backup. The FWS asked the Ornithological Council to determine if Island Conservation had exceeded the limit of their poison quantities, but the council decided not to resolve any [...] "legal questions". , FWS law enforcement is still investigating. Steve Delehanty, the manager of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge (which includes the island) said that, [...] "It was a learning experience, and we made mistakes together." [...] However, he also stated, [...] "...if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>math</b> this was a rip-roaring conservation success." ...|$|E

40|$|It {{will not}} be a {{surprise}} to hear me answer the question raised in the title of this presentation affirmatively, but I'm {{not going to let you}} go to the bar just yet. As many of you will remember, the theme of the AFIT conference last year had to do with this question, so I'm going to share what I learned from the papers presented, and what I've been thinking about as I finished up a book manuscript. Last year, Terry Neale told us about his training at Columbia University in the early post-war period. 1 It wasn't quite clear which war that was, but if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>math,</b> I think you can almost rule out the civil war. He said that Columbia at the time was full of institutionalists and they all thought the General Theory was perfectly consistent with institutionalist thought. However, in his presentation, Phil Klein argued that after Clarence Ayres, many institutionalists failed to see the commonalities, and, indeed, some institutionalists were downright hostile. Still, Phil did acknowledge that Fagg Foster recognized the similarities and I would add Dudley Dillard and Wallace Peterson as two others who consistently integrated the two approaches. 2 If one looks at it the other way around, Keynes explicitly recognized the influence of institutionalist thought on his own work. Glen Atkinson noted in his presentation that Keynes had written to John Commons that there was no economist "with whose general way of thinking I feel myself in such general accord". 3 I think the mixed reaction to Keynes can probably be explained partially because, as Terry pointed out, that secon...|$|E

40|$|According to the USDA, each year, we waste about 96 {{billion pounds}} {{of food in}} this country, {{including}} this year. At {{the same time we}} have about 40 million Americans who don’t get enough to eat. If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>math,</b> we are wasting about one and a quarter tons of food for every hungry man, woman, and child in this country. We are throwing away more than enough food than is needed to feed every hungry person in the U. S. We have already beaten hunger in America – we simply continue to allow it to exist. It doesn’t need to be that way; we let it be that way. Doesn’t it make sense to simply bridge the gap between all that excess food and the people that need it? There is a way to actually do that and it is having great success. There are two main points of large volume food waste. One is right in the fields at harvest time where produce that isn’t yet ready to be picked or doesn’t meet tight specifications is simply left behind to rot. The other is in the produce packing and distribution centers where food that is harvested goes through a grade-out process before it is packaged for shipping to grocery stores. Billions of pounds of excess food is loaded into trucks and taken to landfills and dumped as waste, although it is perfectly good to eat. Food waste is the second leading cause of methane gas in our atmosphere. Each year the Society of St. Andrew coordinates with thousands of farmers and packing facilities, tens of thousands of volunteers and thousands of feeding vital programs in all 48 contiguous states to save and distribute 30 - 40 million pounds of this healthy but excess bounty. Society of St. Andrew is recognized as our nation’s premier gleaning organization and we save and distribute fresh produce in all 48 contiguous states. Using good stewardship practices for food, and all resources, we are able to feed the hungry in America at a cost of just 2 ¢ per serving with total overhead costs of just 3. 2 %. www. endhunger. or...|$|E
