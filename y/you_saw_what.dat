500|$|In 1985, DC Comics {{acquired}} {{a line of}} characters from Charlton Comics. During that period, writer Alan Moore contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he could revamp, {{as he had done}} in his Miracleman series in the early 1980s. Moore reasoned that MLJ Comics' Mighty Crusaders might be available for such a project, so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of the Shield in a harbour. The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used, as long as readers recognized them [...] "so it would have the shock and surprise value when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> the reality of these characters was". Moore used this premise and crafted a proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled Who Killed the Peacemaker, and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC managing editor Dick Giordano. Giordano was receptive to the proposal, but opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story. Moore said, [...] "DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional." [...] Instead, Giordano persuaded Moore to continue with new characters. Moore had initially believed that original characters would not provide emotional resonance for the readers, but later changed his mind. He said, [...] "Eventually, I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough, so that they seemed familiar in certain ways, certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super-hero resonance or familiarity to the reader, then it might work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the verdict, it was {{revealed}} that Bayne had been released from prison after he had served an 18-month sentence for assault and robbery in Hamilton, just seven weeks before he murdered Nelson. He had previously been imprisoned on four occasions, following convictions for drugs charges, assault and theft. D/Supt Robertson gave a statement to the media after the verdicts were delivered, saying: [...] "Zoe Nelson was a young 17-year-old girl with everything to live for. She had many friends and a loving family in Newmains. Robert Bayne ruthlessly took her life and tried to dispose of her body in a cold-blooded attack. This was a particularly horrific crime and now that Bayne has been convicted, Zoe's family and the local community can hopefully try and move forward knowing [...] will not be a threat for a considerable period of time. He showed no remorse for his vile actions or the effect this murder had on Zoe's close family, who remain devastated by her loss. When the verdict was raised <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> he can do. So the streets will be a lot safer, and hopefully the Nelson family can move on knowing that he is behind bars." [...] Lady Dorrian said: [...] "This has been... a somewhat distressing case and a stressful one." [...] Nelson's uncle told reporters: [...] "It's a relief to know he's in prison but it's not justice. He should be tortured like he tortured Zoe." [...] Bayne's grandmother said: [...] "I am so incredibly sorry about what happened. The lives of two families have been ruined by this tragedy." ...|$|E

The strained relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had further deteriorated {{by the time}} production of Strikes Again was underway.
