500|$|In Cleveland, as {{the speech}} concluded, General Eisenhower turned to RNC Chairman Summerfield, [...] "Well, Arthur, <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> got your money's worth." [...] Mamie Eisenhower was in tears, {{and the general}} told her that Nixon was a {{completely}} honest man. The 15,000supporters waiting for Eisenhower to speak had heard the Checkers speech over the hall's public address system, and when Congressman George H. Bender took the microphone and asked the crowd, [...] "Are you in favor of Nixon?", pandemonium ensued. As the crowd below chanted, [...] "We want Nixon!", Eisenhower quickly revised his speech.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with XXL magazine, rapper Fat Joe claimed that he helped produce the track while working with producer Scott Storch. He stated: [...] "I'm pretty sure the world don't know we actually produced Candy Shop together. I produced it with him (Storch) ... Scott called me like 50 times, 100 times: 'Yo, <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> you don't want to use it? 50 Cent called me. 50 Cent want it.' I {{never had a problem}} with this dude. I was like, 'Go ahead.'" [...] When writing the song, 50 Cent stated: [...] "I attempted to be as sexual as possible, from a male perspective, without being vulgar or obscene".|$|E
6000|$|... "This is a {{good rule}} to remember," [...] said the photographer. [...] "Never open the shutter of your camera until you are certain {{you are ready to}} take the picture, and never attempt to develop a plate or a film until <b>you</b> are <b>sure</b> your {{chemicals}} are properly mixed, and until <b>you</b> are <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> have everything at hand with which to work, and until <b>you</b> are <b>sure</b> the plate or film is properly protected from the light." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{band was}} {{surprised}} at the length of [...] "A Farewell to Arms" [...] and [...] "Clenching the Fists of Dissent" [...] running over ten minutes, and wondered if their fans would [...] "be able to get their heads around" [...] what the band was doing. Record company Roadrunner Records hesitated the band's decision to open the album with a ten and a half minute song ("Clenching the Fists of Dissent"), and asked the band questions similar to [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> you don’t want to get into something a little more direct?" [...] The band disregarded the comment and believed the song set the tone musically {{for the remainder of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|Later on, {{the protagonist}} {{encounters}} a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named Lisa, and {{upon entering the}} bathroom and being locked, he obtains a flashlight and finds a creature resembling an underdeveloped fetus crying in the sink. He soon gets out, but finds out that the apparition is watching him. If the protagonist is attacked by the ghost, he reawakens in the first room of the game, beginning the loop again, but it's possible to avoid her completely. In the room, a bloody moving paper bag speaks to him, speaking of a disturbing experience, and stating the same quote seen {{at the start of}} the game - [...] "Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> the only you is you?" ...|$|E
500|$|Darla {{is first}} {{killed in the}} seventh episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In that episode, it is {{revealed}} that Darla was once romantically involved with Angel and that she made him a vampire. Angel stakes her through the heart. Benz was asked {{to return to the}} role three years later, but not on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Joss Whedon wanted her to appear on the spin-off Angel, which focused on Angel's adventures in Los Angeles. Benz said in an interview: I was shocked, really. When they sent me the script [...] I kept asking, 'Where's Darla?' I remember calling my agent asking, 'Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> they want me for this episode because I can't seem to find me?' And then I get to the last page and there I am... naked in a box. Awesome. It was exciting.|$|E

500|$|Celebrity Marilyn Monroe is {{mentioned}} numerous times throughout the song, including the famous quote [...] "I'm selfish, impatient {{and a little}} insecure. I make mistakes, I am {{out of control and}} at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> as hell don't deserve me at my best." [...] However, it has never been confirmed that Monroe actually said this. Minaj liked the track, as [...] "it spoke to me as a woman. I'm very infatuated with Marilyn Monroe. I had a moment with that song where I was like, 'Oh my God, every woman in this world needs to hear that'. No, we're not perfect. Sometimes, we think, 'What's wrong with us?' We spend so much time criticizing ourselves. I needed to hear that, 'I'm not perfect, but I'm worth it'. It resonated with me. I felt like the world needed to hear it." ...|$|E
500|$|Yoshimura {{included}} a B story of Lewis and Falsone looking for Lange's girlfriend to provide comic relief {{and so that}} the entire episode would not be confined to the subway platform location. Yoshimura wanted the two detectives to also discuss the nature of mortality and death, but deliberately included black humor in their dialogue and made sure the characters did not act [...] "teary-eyed [...] philosophical", because he believed it would be clichéd and an inaccurate depiction of how real detectives would behave. Some viewers were offended or startled by the flippant nature of the discussions about death between the two characters. Lange's girlfriend jogged behind Lewis and Falsone during {{a scene in which}} the two detectives were distracted in a discussion; Yoshimura deliberately included this in the episode to create a moment of irony. The line by Falsone to a jogger, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> you're not Sarah?", and Lewis' mocking reaction to the question, were both ad-libbed by the actors.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by her divorce from Bush lead singer, Gavin Rossdale; Stefani wrote several songs during these recording sessions to start [...] "a new chapter in her life". In an interview with Todays Matt Lauer, Stefani stated {{that the majority of}} her recent studio work would discuss her breakup with Rossdale. Billboard stated that the lyrics [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> you wanna love me? / I know that it's a lot to handle me / But {{it is what it is}} / It's all part of my broken history" [...] were [...] "ultra personal". In his description of the track, Glenn Gamboa of Newsday stated that [...] "'Asking 4 It' strikes at the heart of pop radio" [...] while Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media described [...] "Asking 4 It" [...] as [...] "the album's sole feature atop an unconvincing beat." [...] Nicholaus James Jodlowski of Reporter felt that the album's [...] "sound cools down a little", but that the track [...] "is still easy to dance to".|$|E
