5|$|As the CPL playoffs {{began on}} February 5, a February 21 {{championship}} game clash between Okafor and Alexander was pondered {{in the local}} press after the 32-team brackets were announced. The CPL playoffs began with victories over Perspectives Charter by 71–37 and North Lawndale Charter High School 75–63. Against North Lawndale, Alexander had 27 points, 15 rebounds and 5 blocks. On February 16, Curie defeated Simeon 71–64. Alexander had 16 points, 12 rebounds, and 6 blocks earning a February 19 CPL semifinals rematch against Hyde Park Academy High School who they have already beaten twice this season. Alexander and Curie won 58–56 to reach the anticipated city championship matchup with Young and Okafor at the Jones Convocation Center. Alexander had a triple double with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 blocks. The matchup was the most anticipated city championship game since at least 1998 when fellow McDonald's All-Americans Quentin Richardson of Young and Corey Maggette of Fenwick High School were both top 15 players. On February 20, Alexander improved his first place total in the Mr. Basketball USA Tracker, holding eight first place and two second place votes. Curie won the city championship 69–66 in quadruple overtime as Alexander had 20 points, 14 rebounds and 4 blocks according to Chicago Tribune and Comcast SportsNet, while the Chicago Sun-Times and Sports Illustrated credited him with just 12 rebounds. This came against Okafor who had 16 points and 9, 8 or 4 rebounds before fouling out with 2:13 remaining in regulation depending on which of the three sources <b>you</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>The</b> CPL Championship game was attended by Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel and was the lead story on the late edition of SportsCenter. Seven days later, Curie was forced to forfeit all of its wins and the CPL championship due to the academic ineligibility of seven of its players. The title will remain vacant.|$|E
500|$|In February 2007 {{the suits}} were settled {{out-of-court}} for undisclosed terms. Stephen F. DeAntonio, {{attorney for the}} plaintiffs, said that his clients felt [...] "totally vindicated." [...] W. W. Norton did not publicly retract or repudiate any of the material in Thompson's book, however, instead sending {{a letter to the}} plaintiffs stating, in part, [...] "To the extent <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> book implies that any of you were engaged in a cover-up, were incompetent, committed criminal acts, violated Naval regulations or exhibited faulty seamanship or professional ineptitude, Norton regrets the emotional distress experienced by you or your family." ...|$|E
500|$|The prince {{believed}} what he {{had been}} told by his courtiers, and also assumed that cheating had taken place; he later said that with accusations from five witnesses he believed the worst of his friend straight away. At no point had any of those concerned investigated the situation more closely, by asking others present or seeking out Gordon-Cumming's side of events, but they had believed the events as told to them by Lycett Green and Stanley Wilson. After informing the prince, the two courtiers sought out the accused man and informed him of what had been said. Coventry broke the news to him, saying that [...] "There is a very disagreeable thing that has occurred in this house. Some of the people staying here object... to the way you play baccarat", and that the accusation was that he had [...] "resorted to foul play" [...] at the game. Gordon-Cumming denied the accusation, asking [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> statements of a parcel of inexperienced boys?", and demanded to see the prince.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1959, Matos {{denounced the}} {{direction}} the revolution was taking by giving openly anti-communist speeches in Camagüey. This launched a months-long dispute between him and Castro, then Prime Minister of Cuba, When Castro replaced President Manuel Urrutia with the more radical Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado, Matos tendered his resignation {{in a letter to}} Castro. On 26 July, Castro and Matos met at the Hilton Hotel in Havana, where, according to Matos, Castro told him: [...] "Your resignation is not acceptable at this point. We still have too much work to do. I admit that Raúl [...] and Che [...] are flirting with Marxism... but you have the situation under control... Forget about resigning...
