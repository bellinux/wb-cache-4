My job as the warmer up may be simply to inform you about the acronym that people are using in my world to describe those new active water rights management regulations, because no body can manage that. The people with whom I work and who are concentrating on them call these the AW(O) RM regulations.

5000|$|Despite what it {{has brought}} to the country, kwaito faces critics. The kwaito music {{industry}} is viewed as male-dominated, especially in management.

Lebo Mathosa, {{who was one of}} kwaito’s most famous female artists and a member of Boom Shaka, noted that it is [...] "difficult because every producer that you meet in our country is male there isn’t even one female producer that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> ok <b>I</b> like that record that is produced by so and so."

5000|$|..... {{that this}} was a text-based game, the {{contents}} of the game ended up being rather serious and emotional. The game itself was a real life-or-death kind of survival adventure game. I think there was a feeling somewhere deep in my heart that said, 'I wanna try making a horror game!' But soon after that, they came out with Biohazard, so I quickly got over that phase (laughs)....the comical sub-scenarios were written to be extremely comical beyond any measurement, so I think it sorta' balances out...But <b>I</b> can <b>say</b> that since this game wasn't expected to be widely sold on the market, and also since there wasn't any profit on our part, there was a feeling that I wanted to make this game out of my sole interest. In a way, I think that 'Radical' helped me to find my own path...But then again, <b>I</b> guess <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> strayed away from the paths of normal people.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also told}} about the {{recording}} of [...] "1 Night": [...] "I wanted to send Charli something that was poppier for me. But more of a left turn for her.

5000|$|Brenner told TV {{columnist}} Gary Deeb {{that when}} ratings [...] "didn't {{go through the}} roof" [...] in the first month, many stations then decided to move the show from the more desirable 11:00 p.m. - midnight time periods {{to the middle of}} the night. Brenner added that King World [...] "started cutting our budget and started making us do a lotta pre-taped shows - and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see the handwriting. I mean - it was more than handwriting - it was chiseling on the wall." [...] King World head executive Michael King said the talent pool of available guests was [...] "somewhat of a problem. But we weren't up against Joan Rivers for the most part. We were up against the last half-hour of Carson or the first half-hour of David Letterman." [...] Ultimately, King argued, [...] "the public just didn't want to tune into David every night". In a 2009 interview with The Trentonian, Brenner said that Motown and King World [...] "ended up not liking to work with each other, and so they didn't care that the ratings were good, that the show was great and all that -- all they cared was to get away from each other. So <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> became the child of divorced parents".|$|R
5000|$|Galway was {{the first}} {{musician}} to get published with sampled sounds on the Commodore, with the theme for the Arkanoid conversion. When asked about how he did it, he answered: [...] "I figured out how samples were played by hacking into someone else's code ... OK, I admit it ... It was a drum synthesizer package called Digidrums, actually, so <b>you</b> <b>could</b> still <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{was the first}} to include samples in a piece of music. &#91;...&#93; Never would I claim to have invented that technique, I just got it published first. In fact, I couldn't really figure out where they got the sample data, just that they were wiggling the volume register, so I tried to make up my own drum sample sounds in realtime - which is the flatulence stuff that shipped in Arkanoid. &#91;...&#93; After the project was in the shops I gained access to some real drum samples, and I slid those into my own custom version of the tune. The one that's in the shops is kind of a collage of farts & burps, don't you think? &#91;...&#93; Later I was able to acquire some proper drum samples and by Game Over it got quite sophisticated." ...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{point to}} this album - and particularly, the song [...] "Milk" [...] - {{as one of}} the first songs to feature a blast beat, {{courtesy}} of Benante. When asked in 2009 if he invented the blast beat, Benante replied, [...] "If you mean that I decided to sit in my room and invent it, no it wasn’t like that. The thing was something that had been around the NY hardcore scene for ages but hadn’t been used for other things. The first time it really happened was on S.O.D’s ‘Milk’ song, so I guess <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> had a lot to do with it. Now a lot of bands are using it, and doing it really well." ...|$|E
5000|$|In December 2014, Strauss {{was interviewed}} by Wired on the Obama administration's refusal to release {{photographs}} of torture at Abu Ghraib, which Strauss had been writing about since 2004. He told the interviewer, “I want more images. In that way, I guess <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> have gotten what I want, since today’s communications environment makes more and more images available to us all the time. In photographic criticism, there have been theories that subjection to greater numbers of images makes people numb to them. I don’t believe that any more... I thought {{long and hard about}} that critique, and in the end found that it doesn’t hold up. I think we’re more capable now, in some senses, of reading images, but I don’t think our overall capacity for understanding has increased. Our capacity to process images hasn’t kept up with the pace with which they are now thrown at us, so we become subject to them.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Latin has {{no single}} words for yes and no. Their {{functions}} as intensifiers and interjections are {{taken up by}} using the vocative case.
