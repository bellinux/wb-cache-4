This young lady is my ward, and I have just brought her from a convent, where she has lived since she was three years old. She is strange and shy, of course, and I was perhaps wrong to bring her to a public place. I did it, however, out of kindness. I wanted her to enjoy herself, but I perhaps did not appreciate her sensitiveness {{and the fact that}} only a few days ago she parted with the friends with whom she has lived all her life. Now, sir," [...] he added, with a sneer upon his coarse lips, [...] "I have been compelled to answer <b>your</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> avoid a disturbance in a public place; but I promise you that if you do not make yourself scarce in thirty seconds I will send for the manager." ...|$|E

To avoid confusion, the Einstein summation convention is not adopted here. 1 Continuum Phenomenological Formulation Diffusion of things can happen when the distribution of something is non-uniform in space. If temperature is non-uniform, diffusion of heat occurs. If concentration of a species is non-uniform, diffusion of matter occurs. The simplest mass diffusion problem is the diffusion of a trace of inert gas (e. g perfume) in a environment of inert gas (air). One can easily accept the phenomenological diffusion law for the mass diffusion flux j ∗ of the trace gas: j ∗ = −D(∇X + [...] .) (1...|$|E

40|$|This {{syllabus}} {{was submitted}} to the Rhodes College Office of Academic Affairs by the course instructor. The major goal of this course is to help you identify and understand explanations of the social world and social actors that have become elevated {{to the status of}} social theory. (Theoreticians have done this by making explicit the basic assumptions and logical arguments that underpin these various world views and subjecting them to various tests of empirical verification and/or experiential veracity given events and phenomena in our own society as well as in other societies.) We hope to accomplish this goal by using lectures to present certain "classical" directions of thought in sociology and anthropology, having you undertake "critical" (in the original sense of the term) analyses of assigned readings of primary sources bringing <b>your</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> each seminar based on your reading, and having you write a series of reflective essays on your intellectual engagement with theoretical schools and their principal theoreticians...|$|E

40|$|These tips {{come from}} {{experienced}} radio reporters and video producers. Use them {{along with the}} “Interview Worksheet ” to plan and conduct your interviews. 1. Know the purpose of your interview. • What are you hoping to gain from talking to people? What {{do you want to}} find out? How do you see the information fitting into your piece? 2. Be prepared. • Research your interview subject and topic. Have questions prepared (see “Sample Questions ” sheet) and background information about the person you’re interviewing. Design <b>your</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> get the ideal quotes you’d like your interviewee to say. 3. Introduce yourself. • Put your interview subject at ease and establish again who you are. 4. Ask for his or her name. • Get the correct spelling and pronunciation if you plan to use the name in your story. 5. Listen. • Interviews can go in a different direction than the one you planned. Go with the flow. Listen for cues to interesting questions and ask follow-up questions. If you hear something you want to know more about, ask the interviewee to tell you more. 6. Make eye contact. • Don’t stare at your questions. Glance down occasionally to keep things flowing, but also engage your interviewee. This makes him or her feel more comfortable, and usually results in better answers. 7. Take notes. • Make a note of items you’d like to use in your piece so you remember where they are later. 8. Leave personal biases at the door. • Your job is to be objective and capture the interviewee’s point of view. If you ask inappropriate questions or make the person feel uncomfortable, your subject won’t be as open with you as they could be. 9. Record interesting background noise. • Make sure the sounds fit with the story. If you’re interviewing someone about the health effects of working in an office, record some office sounds, such as the person checking e-mail, rifling through papers or answering the phone. 10. Say thank you. • Send your interviewee a note thanking him or her for the interview. Be courteous. Think of everyone you talk to as a contact you may need in the future...|$|E
