5|$|Hard rock {{entered the}} 1990s {{as one of}} the {{dominant}} forms of commercial music. The multi-platinum releases of AC/DC's The Razors Edge (1990), Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (both in 1991), Ozzy Osbourne's No More Tears (1991), and Van Halen's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge (1991) showcased this popularity. Additionally, the Black Crowes released their debut album, Shake <b>Your</b> <b>Money</b> Maker (1990), which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies. In 1992, Def Leppard followed up 1987's Hysteria with Adrenalize, which went multi-platinum, spawned four Top 40 singles and held the number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks.|$|E

25|$|Tyne Tees went on air at 5pm on 15 January 1959, {{three years}} after the first British {{independent}} television station. The then-prime minister Harold Macmillan, who had been the Member of Parliament for the nearby Stockton-on-Tees for two decades, was interviewed live on the opening night. This was followed by a live variety show, named The Big Show, broadcast from a small studio.

25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for <b>your</b> <b>money</b> paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E

25|$|Each leg of The Amazing Race {{generally}} {{consists of}} teams leaving {{from the previous}} Pit Stop and traveling to a different location (often in a different country), where they perform two or more tasks, generally including one Detour and one Roadblock, before being given instructions {{to go to the}} next Pit Stop. It is each team's goal to complete each leg as quickly as possible, as the first team to check in at the Pit Stop will win a prize; the prizes have included all-expenses paid trips, new cars or other vehicles, money, entertainment provided during the Pit Stop, and recently advantages to be used during the race (see Express Pass, Salvage Pass, and Double <b>Your</b> <b>Money).</b> The last team to arrive at the Pit Stop will generally be eliminated from the competition, but occasionally the team is allowed to continue racing although they will be given a Race-imposed disadvantage in the next leg (see Non-elimination leg). When teams are otherwise not performing tasks or traveling during a leg, they are free to use their time as they see fit, although they will often resort to eating cheaply or sleeping outside a location to save their Race money.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds' {{recording}} of the song caused a minor controversy between the band and its author. Dylan's original demo of [...] "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" [...] contained the lyric [...] "Pick up <b>your</b> <b>money,</b> pack up your tent", which was mistakenly altered in The Byrds' version, by guitarist and singer Roger McGuinn, to [...] "Pack up <b>your</b> <b>money,</b> pick up your tent". Dylan expressed mock-annoyance at this lyric change in his 1971 {{recording of}} the song, singing [...] "Pack up <b>your</b> <b>money,</b> put up your tent McGuinn/You ain't goin' nowhere." [...] McGuinn replied in 1989 on a new {{recording of the}} song included on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's [...] album, adding the word [...] "Dylan" [...] after the same [...] "Pack up <b>your</b> <b>money,</b> pick up your tent" [...] lyric. McGuinn and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's 1989 recording of the song, which also featured The Byrds' former bass player Chris Hillman, was released as a single and peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1989, as well as number eleven on the Canadian country music charts published by RPM. In spite of {{the involvement of the}} Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the single release was credited to McGuinn and Hillman alone.|$|E

The band {{spent most of the}} money Sire had given them on the album's production value. The studio rent was $150 per hour, usually using the first take of a song as its final recording.

500|$|The Black Crowes {{began writing}} songs for the {{follow-up}} to their 1999 album By Your Side as free agents, having left Columbia Records through a loophole in their contract. [...] The {{decision to leave}} was driven by Columbia's promotion of By Your Side. According to band member Rich Robinson, [...] "That record was destined to fail because... just said, 'It's {{not going to do}} well... It's no use wasting time or money.'" [...] The band also was frustrated by the label's request for albums sounding similar to their first, 1990's Shake <b>Your</b> <b>Money</b> Maker.|$|E
500|$|The Black Crowes {{promoted}} By Your Side {{by performing}} on numerous television programs in North America and Europe. [...] The album debuted {{at its peak}} position of number26 on the Billboard 200 and generally received positive reviews. [...] While some critics depreciated By Your Side for its similarity to albums by Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones, most reviewers lauded The Black Crowes' return to the straightforward approach of their debut album, Shake <b>Your</b> <b>Money</b> Maker (1990). [...] Chris Robinson's singing and Rich's guitar playing also won praise from critics, though reviews of the lyrics were mixed.|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer's Chris Schilling {{commented that}} {{although}} Ancient Trader {{was not as}} comprehensive and expansive as other Xbox Live titles such as , it deserved [...] "the opportunity {{to do business with}} the big boys rather than risk getting washed away with the shovelware tide". Schilling expressed concern that [...] "a game so elegant and accomplished should have to be dredged up from the depths of Indie Games". Lorenzo Fantoni from Eurogamer Italy awarded Ancient Trader the same score as Schilling, and explained that [...] "the final result is a quite simple title, which will last long enough to make you feel happy of having invested <b>your</b> <b>money</b> in this indie title".|$|E
