2500|$|Once, when Jiang Qin was {{stationed}} in Xuancheng County (宣城縣) and was out fighting rebels in Yuzhang Commandery, Xu Sheng, {{who was then the}} Prefect (令) of Wuhu, arrested an officer under Jiang Qin and requested for permission from Sun Quan to have the officer executed. As Jiang Qin was away at that time, Sun Quan denied the request. Xu Sheng had since estranged himself from Jiang Qin. Later, during the Battle of Ruxu in 217, Jiang Qin and Lü Meng were put in charge of military discipline. Xu Sheng was constantly worried that Jiang Qin would find fault with him, but, much to his surprise, Jiang praised him instead, and Xu was very impressed by Jiang's virtuous behaviour. Jiang Qin became more highly regarded after this incident. Sun Quan later asked Jiang Qin, [...] "Xu Sheng offended <b>you</b> <b>earlier</b> on, but yet now you praise him. You wish to emulate Qi Xi, don't you?" [...] Jiang Qin replied, [...] "I heard that one should not let his personal feuds affect his official duties. Xu Sheng is loyal and hardworking, possesses both courage and talent, and is capable of leading thousands of troops. Now, we've yet to accomplish our great task, so I should help to scout for and recommend talents to serve the state instead of letting my private problems cloud my judgment." [...] Sun Quan was very pleased.|$|E

6000|$|DEAR SIR, - You {{have taken}} many {{occasions}} {{to make yourself}} very agreeable to me, for which I might in decency have thanked <b>you</b> <b>earlier.</b> It is now my turn; and I hope you will allow me to offer you my compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes. That is the class of literature that I like when I have the toothache. As a matter of fact, it was a pleurisy I was enjoying when I took the volume up; and it will interest you as a medical man {{to know that the}} cure was for the moment effectual. Only the one thing troubles me: can this be my old friend Joe Bell? - I am, yours very truly, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you let me}} {{tell you}} {{something}} about myself, my kind friends?" [...] he said,--"you have been so good to me, ma'am, you have been so kind to me, Laura--I hope I may call you so sometimes--my dear Pen and I have been such friends that I have long wanted to tell you my story such as it is, and would have told it to <b>you</b> <b>earlier</b> but that it is a sad one and contains another's secret. However, it may do good for Arthur to know it--it is that every one here should. It will divert you from thinking about a subject, which, out of a fatal misconception, has caused a great deal of pain to all of you. May I please tell you, Mrs. Pendennis?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I'd {{thought of}} it earlier, I would have taken some {{measures}} for finding her out," [...] said Mr. Irwine, [...] "but it's too late now, I fear...Well, Adam, I must go now.

60|$|Troil. Where are you, brother? now, in honour's name, What do {{you mean}} to be thus long unarmed?

[...] "If I had known what was passing {{in your mind}} I should have told <b>you</b> <b>earlier</b> that I intend to devote my life entirely to science. There are many women with a {{capacity}} for marriage, but few {{with a taste for}} biology. I will remain true to my own line, then. I came down here while waiting for an opening in the Paris Physiological Laboratory. I have just heard that there is a vacancy for me there, and so you will be troubled no more by my intrusion upon your practice. I have done you an injustice just as you did me one. I thought you narrow and pedantic, with no good quality. I have learned during your illness to appreciate you better, and the recollection of our friendship will always be a very pleasant one to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ten {{days ago}} it is. Think of it--no {{more than ten}} days. And {{it seems as if}} I had been months at Lavedan, so well have we become acquainted. In these ten days we have formed {{opinions}} of each other. But with this difference, that whilst mine are right, yours are wrong. I have come to know you for the sweetest, gentlest saint in all this world. Would to God I had known <b>you</b> <b>earlier!</b> It might have been very different; I might have been--I would have been--different, and I would not have done what I have done. You have come to know me for an unfortunate but honest gentleman. Such am I not. I am under false colours here, mademoiselle. Unfortunate I may be--at least, of late I seem to have become so. Honest I am not--I have not been. There, child, I can tell you no more. I am too great a coward. But when later you shall come to hear the truth--when, after I am gone, they may tell you a strange story touching this fellow Lesperon who sought the hospitality of your father's house--bethink you of my restraint in this hour; bethink you of my departure. You will understand these things perhaps afterwards. But bethink you of them, and you will unriddle them for yourself, perhaps. Be merciful upon me then; judge me not over-harshly." ...|$|E
60|$|Your {{letter was}} {{received}} {{in due time}} and I should have answered it immediately, but that I had mailed a letter from Julia to Jennie {{the morning of the}} receipt of yours. I thought then to wait for two or three weeks; by that time there was so much sickness in my family, and Freddy so dangerously ill, that I thought I would not write until his fate was decided. He was nearly taken from us by the bilious, then by the typhoid fever; but he is now convalescing. Some seven of the negroes have been sick. Mrs. Sharp is here on a visit, and she and one of her children are sick; and Julia and I are both sick with chills and fever. If I had written to <b>you</b> <b>earlier</b> it would have been whilst Fred's case was a doubtful one, and I did not want to distress you when it could have done no good to anyone.--I have been thinking of paying you a visit this fall, but I now think it extremely doubtful whether I shall be able to. Not being able to even attend to my hands, much less work myself, I am getting behindhand, so that I shall have to stay here and attend to my business. Cannot some of you come and pay us a visit? Jennie has not answered Julia's letter yet. Did she receive it? I was coming to the city the day it was written to hear a political speech, and {{it was too late to}} get it in the post office, so I gave it to a young man to put in the next morning. It is for this reason I asked the question.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. We may {{not come}} early, for we have to {{purchase}} two pack horses to carry them, and three tats for ourselves and our man.
