500|$|Wonderland was {{released}} for the Christmas market, and was labelled {{as a potential}} Christmas number one. Smith embarked on a promotional tour, beginning {{at the end of}} October, with magazine, television and radio appearances. Appearances included Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, Sky News Sunrise, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and The Paul O'Grady Show. Speaking about the album's promotion, Smith said [...] "t is always a struggle when a second album comes out because <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it is going to do but fingers crossed people will enjoy it. I am very proud of it. ... I am excited about going on all the shows too – especially Ready Steady Cook because I can't cook and I think it will be fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd scored it 3.5 out of 10, {{calling it}} [...] "a buggy mess." [...] He criticised the {{touchscreen}} as unresponsive, and {{the map and}} menu scrolling as [...] "sluggish". He was also {{highly critical of the}} bugs, citing a mission which couldn't be completed until the sound effects were turned off, and another which crashes when the player zooms in or out. He concluded, [...] "when it functions, The Settlers can be laid-back fun. But given that <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> far you're going to get before the next crash, why bother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you have--; {{picked him}} up, as you're always a doing with young men. Only <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to keep 'em when you've got 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw {{you with}} your friend, when you came on board the {{steamboat}} at Boulogne. Oh, no, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> noticed me! <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> I pitied <b>you.</b> And afterward, when you moved away by yourself, and stood by the place in which the engines work--you are sure you won't think the worse of me, if I tell it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's how she was. <b>You</b> could <b>never</b> be {{sure what}} she {{would be up to}} next. There are ships {{difficult}} to handle, but generally you can depend on them behaving rationally. With that ship, whatever you did with her <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> it would end. She was a wicked beast. Or, perhaps, she was only just insane." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Lily; {{you don't}} {{understand}} all that I would say. <b>You</b> have <b>never</b> <b>known</b> <b>how</b> often {{and how much}} I have thought of you; how dearly I have loved you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And thank you, my dear,' {{she added}} with a sigh, 'for making my coming home so pleasant. May <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> I dreaded the finding it full of emptiness.' ...|$|E
60|$|I raised {{myself on}} my knees, {{put my hands}} to my mouth, and shouted aloud {{at the top of}} my voice, with the utmost force of which my lungs were capable. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> hard you can shout, till you've had to shout for dear life through a storm at sea, or some other terrible natural convulsion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Confound it!" [...] said Doctor Severall. [...] "We {{are likely}} to have a flood on the top of all our troubles. That rise in the river means heavy rain up-country, and when it once begins <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> far it will go. We've had the island nearly covered before now. Well, we'll just go and see that Walker is comfortable, and then if you like we'll settle down in our quarters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you have}} made me so happy!" [...] she said tremulously. [...] "Oh, <b>you</b> can <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> happy! Nothing hurts now--nothing ever can hurt, because I know he did care." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let me do {{something}} for you, at least,' said Smike. 'You will never let me serve you as I ought. <b>You</b> will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> I think, day and night, of ways to please you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do not {{suppose that}} we have not thought of you,' {{continued}} Mrs. Woodward.' We have all done so daily. Nay, I have done so myself all but hourly. Ah, Charley, <b>you</b> will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> truly I love you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, my friends, {{our only}} {{safeguard}} is humility. Be not high- minded, but fear. Avoid every appearance of evil. Believe {{that in every}} temptation heaven and hell may be at stake: {{and that the only}} way to be safe is to do nothing wilfully wrong at all, for <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> far downward one wilful sin may lead you. The devil is not simple enough to let you see the bottom of his pitfall: but it is so deep, nevertheless, that he who falls in, may never get out again.|$|E
6000|$|... "So you could," [...] assented {{the other}} readily. [...] "It was old Colchester's notion, {{though he was}} always {{threatening}} to give her up. He couldn't stand her racket any more, he declared; {{it was too much}} of a good thing for him; he would wash his hands of her, if he never got hold of another--and so on. I daresay he would have chucked her, only--it may surprise you--his missus wouldn't hear of it. Funny, eh? But with women, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> they will take a thing, and Mrs. Colchester, with her moustaches and big eyebrows, set up for being as strong-minded as they make them. She used to walk about in a brown silk dress, with a great gold cable flopping about her bosom. You should have heard her snapping out: 'Rubbish!' or 'Stuff and nonsense!' I daresay she knew when she was well off. They had no children, and had never set up a home anywhere. When in England she just made shift to hang out anyhow in some cheap hotel or boarding-house. I daresay she liked to get back to the comforts she was used to. She knew very well she couldn't gain by any change. And, moreover, Colchester, though a first-rate man, was not what you may call in his first youth, and, perhaps, she may have thought that he wouldn't be able to get hold of another (as he used to say) so easily. Anyhow, for one reason or another, it was 'Rubbish' and 'Stuff and nonsense' for the good lady. I overheard once young Mr. Apse himself say to her confidentially: 'I assure you, Mrs. Colchester, I am beginning to feel quite unhappy about the name she's getting for herself.' 'Oh,' says she, with her deep little hoarse laugh, 'if one took notice of all the silly talk,' and she showed Apse all her ugly false teeth at once. 'It would take more than that to make me lose my confidence in her, I assure you,' says she." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{training}} for the Olympics always took place at indoor gymnasiums even though the Olympics that year took place at an outdoor stadium. A few {{months prior to the}} Olympics, Kleerekoper made us only practice outdoors because he said that <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> the weather will be the day of the Olympics and that we must be prepared for hot weather or any weather. The practice outside was very good, because we noticed that you have a lot more energy outdoors than needed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't all my fault," [...] he said. [...] "You didn't {{have to take}} a drink." [...] His voice fell to {{a pathetic}} whimper. [...] "I was showing you {{hospitality}} the best way I <b>knew</b> <b>how.</b> <b>You</b> won't <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> hurt my feelin's." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "There {{is also a}} lot {{of trial}} and error in the editing room. Even if a {{director}} has a clear vision of what he wants, until the images are actually juxtaposed and the rhythm is defined by the editing, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> really <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it will work." ...|$|R
6000|$|Tommy sang another tune. Ciccio was {{a lovely}} chap, a rare chap, a treat. He, Tommy, could quite {{understand}} any woman's wanting to marry him--didn't agree a bit with Effie. But marriage, you know, was so final. And then with this war on: <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> things might turn out: a foreigner and all that. And then--you won't mind what I say--? We won't talk about class and that rot. If the man's good enough, he's good enough by himself. But is he your intellectual equal, nurse? After all, it's a big point. You don't want to marry a man you can't talk to. Ciccio's a treat to be with, because he's so natural. But it isn't a mental treat-- ...|$|R

5000|$|He went to Korea {{with the}} 8th Fighter Bomber Group and flew a F-86 Sabres. Bassett {{was too late}} to fly any combat missions, and said, [...] "If you don’t have any challenge, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> good you are." [...] Bassett was {{promoted}} to First Lieutenant in May 1955. He returned for pilot duties at Suffolk County Air Force Base, New York, serving until April 1958 when he took the Electrical Engineering course at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.|$|E
50|$|The album itself, Last Call For The Quiet Life, {{reflects}} Buddy’s {{struggle and}} reconciliation with himself {{over the past}} few years. For him, the songs are a sort of confessional therapy, a place to channel the issues and ideas that plague his mind. One song, “Anchor,” even began as a poem Buddy had written, which was a new method of songwriting for him. The album’s title is derived from a line in the album’s first track, embodying the idea that <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> long the window of opportunity will be open. The music itself embraces a more up-tempo rock vibe that reflects Buddy’s live performance, each instrument layering together to create a buoyant but introspective indie pop vibe.|$|E
5000|$|The song also {{contains}} the bridge played in reverse. The reversed words {{are the first}} and last lines of the chorus: [...] "I don't mind the sun sometimes; the images it shows; <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> just <b>how</b> <b>you</b> look through other people's eyes." [...] The song is in the key of G major.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I fancy <b>you</b> have <b>never</b> <b>known</b> <b>how</b> much <b>you</b> bore {{about with}} you. Your modesty {{has been so}} perfect that you have not thought of {{yourself}} as more than other men. You have forgotten that you have had in your hand the disposal to some one woman of a throne in Paradise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Brave!" [...] she repudiated. [...] "I love <b>you.</b> I <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> much, how really much, I {{loved you}} as when I was losing you. And now let's work for shore. I want you all alone with me, your arms around me, while I {{tell you all}} you are to me and shall always be to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Girvin {{was next}} {{entered in the}} Grade II Risen Star Stakes on February 25. Largely {{overlooked}} at odds of 8-1, he was bumped at the start, swapped leads multiple times in the homestretch but still won by two lengths. His time of 1:43.08 for [...] miles was considered respectable, ranking as the third fastest running of the Risen Star in the past 15 years. [...] His win {{was a surprise to}} racing pundits, as he defeated the winners of both the Lecomte and Remsen Stakes. Sharp commented, [...] "We believed in this horse all along, but <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> good they are until you stack them up against the competition... We're in shock." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kevin Harvick {{scored the}} pole {{for the race}} {{with a time of}} 30.399 and a speed of 177.737 mph. He said he was [...] "just so proud of {{everybody}} on this Jimmy John’s Chevrolet team. They want to come to the race track and bring good race cars and perform well. Just real proud of that. That’s awesome. I didn’t know if we had a chance at the pole with as fast as the No. 24 (Chase Elliott) had been. But I knew if we could just run the same speed every round, that is half the battle because <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much it is going to slow down for everybody else, and it doesn’t take much to make a mistake. Really proud of everybody on our Jimmy John’s team.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed it is," [...] agreed Pris {{with equal}} solemnity. [...] "Authors are kittle cattle. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> when or <b>how</b> they will break out. Anne may make copy of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You've had {{a harder}} time of it than I supposed, my boy,' said Mr. Cope. 'Why did <b>you</b> <b>never</b> let me <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> were treated?' ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Newman {{was asked if he}} sensed that the song had something special about it in the studio. He said, [...] "Yeah. The guy I wrote it with (Steve Booker), we turned around and had massive grins on our faces thinking, 'There's something good here'. But <b>you</b> just <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> good it is, you know?".|$|R
5000|$|The song caused {{controversy}} {{among the}} Christian music world. Thiessen has stated the [...] "Some moms didn’t want their kids listening to our records and stuff, but that’s expected. People look for {{stuff like that}} sometimes just {{because they want to}} be safe all the time." [...] When asked if the band still played the song Thiessen stated [...] "We’re a little tired of it, but it’s still a fun song. You know how a lot of bands have their cliché one song about a girl, the relationship that went wrong or all that stuff? We don’t actually have any of those right now. I think we may in the future. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it goes." [...] In an interview in Detroit at the 2005 Warped Tour, Thiessen stated the song was retired from being performed live in 2002 during their Australian tour.|$|E
5000|$|If you acquire an {{interview}} to become a humane law enforcement officer, your interviewer {{will be looking for}} key personality traits and characteristics to set you aside from the other interviewees and show that you are mentally capable of performing the necessary duties. According to study.com, a person needs to exhibit these traits, [...] "Active listening, critical thinking, good judgment and decision-making, strong public speaking skills, ability to cope with high-stress situations involving animals and their owner" [...] in order to perform well. Criminologycareers.com emphasizes these characteristics along with compassion and understanding as [...] "absolute must-have abilities in order to stay safe on the job." [...] The reasons why these traits are so important is because, just like with any typical police duty, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> the perpetrator will react. Plus people can be especially emotional {{when it comes to their}} animals because they may have a strong connection to the animal.|$|E
5000|$|Pim Doesburg {{believes}} that Kostas Lamprou was an exceptional keeper. [...] "Lamprou {{is a fantastic}} keeper. I think Lamprou then it must surrender. The pipeline will still fall back to Mulder. I would always let him stand. He has a good kick, good reflexes, is mobile and {{has a very good}} series of games had, [...] " [...] said the response from Doesburg versus RTV Rijnmond. Former goalkeeper Sparta Rotterdam and PSV understands the criticism Lamprou not. [...] "They talk to him a complex that he is too small. This is ridiculous in my life has ever said I was too small. Lamprou has an incredible leaping ability, and he does it. I think he's good," [...] Doesburg continues his story. [...] "He is there now, so I would go through with it. Do not step over again. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> Mulder comes back and then plan how a defense reacts." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{have been}} picturing your movements, and have duly checked off your journey home, and {{have talked about}} you continually.
