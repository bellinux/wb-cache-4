5|$|Stossel {{has written}} three books. Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media is a 2005 {{autobiography}} from Harper Perennial documenting {{his career and}} philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel– Why Everything <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Wrong, {{which was published in}} 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Stossel's third book No, They Can't: Why Government Fails– But Individuals Succeed. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does.|$|E

500|$|The BBC {{commissioned}} a second series {{based on the}} studio audience reactions during recordings. As development on series two had reached a relatively late stage when the first had received negative reviews upon transmission, {{it was too late}} to cancel the production. The cast and crew, then, had to work on a show which they knew was widely disliked. Moffat reflects on the experience: [...] "There's no feeling on earth like working on a show that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> doomed and already tanking." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Callin' In Sick" [...] is a style {{parody of}} music popular in Seattle, Washington, most notably grunge. [...] "Everything <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Wrong" [...] is a stylistic {{pastiche}} of They Might Be Giants. Yankovic {{explained that he}} [...] "tried to write a song sort of in their style, but perhaps {{even a little bit}} more twisted". For fans of They Might Be Giants, he put [...] "little references in here and there, little allusions to other songs of theirs". Yankovic later admitted that it [...] "is a little bit harder I think to decipher exactly where the inspiration is coming from." [...] The song title is taken from the 1974 Firesign Theatre album of the same name.|$|E
500|$|Joyner {{stated the}} episode uses [...] "the {{idea of having}} what the viewers are led to believe as reality exposed as a sham". Alexander affirmed this could be {{interpreted}} as questioning [...] "the assumptions we bring to the things we see – we can capture nearly any issue from all angles and pin it to virtual glass forever, but still only own a piece of the story, the unknowable remainder filled in by our own preconceptions". Alasdair Stuart of Bleeding Cool commented it [...] "builds on this idea of the reflection that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> fake but can't look away from and internalizes it". With the plot twist, Stuart said, [...] "we're shown exactly what's been a reflection of the truth all along; everything". He also affirmed it questions [...] "our own fundamental need to be the hero or heroine of our own story".|$|E
500|$|In November 1994, Yankovic entered Santa Monica Sound Recorders in Santa Monica, California {{to begin}} {{the first of the}} Bad Hair Day sessions, which he {{produced}} himself. Recording with Yankovic were Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, and Jim West on guitar. The album was recorded in five sessions. The first session started on November 30 and yielded two originals: [...] "Callin' In Sick" [...] and [...] "Everything <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Wrong". The second session started the next day and produced the original songs: [...] "I Remember Larry", [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy", and [...] "Since You've Been Gone". The third session took place on November 5, 1995, and resulted in the original [...] "I'm So Sick of You" [...] and the parody [...] "Cavity Search". The fourth session yielded [...] "The Alternative Polka" [...] medley, and the two parodies [...] "Gump" [...] and [...] "Phony Calls". The fifth and final recording session produced [...] "Amish Paradise" [...] and [...] "Syndicated Inc.", both of which were parodies.|$|E

500|$|The concert {{began with}} a fixed {{sequence}} of six to eight consecutive Achtung Baby songs, a further sign that {{they were no longer}} the U2 of the 1980s. For the opening song, [...] "Zoo Station", Bono entered as his primary stage persona, [...] "The Fly", appearing silhouetted against a giant screen of blue and white video noise interwoven with glimpses of xerox animations of the band members. [...] "The Fly" [...] was usually performed next, with the video monitors flashing a rapidly changing array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included [...] "Taste is the enemy of art", [...] "Religion is a club", [...] "Ignorance is bliss", [...] "Watch more TV", [...] "Believe" [...] with letters fading out to leave [...] "lie", and [...] "Everything <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> wrong". (During {{the first week of the}} tour, media outlets incorrectly reported that the words shown included [...] "Bomb Japan Now", forcing the band to issue a statement denying the claim.) Before [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing", Bono channel surfed through live television programming, and during the song, as random images from television and pop culture flashed on screen, he filmed himself and the band with a camcorder.|$|E
500|$|Another game mode {{included}} in Backbreaker is the mini-game [...] "Tackle Alley." [...] In this game, the player controls {{a running back}} who starts in their own endzone. The player then attempts to score a touchdown by running up the field and evading a wave of defenders to score points. Special moves such as jukes and spins create a [...] "combo chain," [...] which multiply the player's score by an amount depending {{on the length of}} the combo chain. After a player scores, they advance to the next wave of defenders and must repeat the process. If a player is tackled before reaching the endzone, they must start over the wave and lose a [...] "life." [...] The game ends when all of the player's lives are depleted or the player passes all 100 of the waves, which become harder as the mode progresses. According to NaturalMotion, only 0.88 percent of all Backbreaker players have managed to clear all 100 levels of [...] "Tackle Alley." [...] Game producer Rob Donald states that the mini-game was meant to add an arcade feel to the game. [...] "It {{was meant to be a}} complete diversion from the more realistic main game, a complete arcade challenge...Everything about it was meant to replicate the pressure and the frustration of playing a cabinet that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> stacked against you," [...] said Donald in an interview.|$|E
500|$|In a 6 September 1777 letter, Johnson told Thrale to be [...] "punctual in annexing the dates. Chronology <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> {{the eye of}} history". However, {{the system}} of Ana allowed Thrale to group items by theme instead of by topics, like [...] "Odd medical Stories", to {{organize}} anecdotes, quotations, and stories. When Henry Thrale died while Thrale was writing Volume Three, the work became a diary for Thrale to discuss her thoughts and feelings after her loss. This volume soon began to describe Thrale's feelings for Gabriel Piozzi. Throughout the Thraliana, Thrale examines how others view her, which reveals her anxieties that she had about how she was perceived. This is especially true when she writes: [...] "Life has been to me nothing but a perpetual Canvass carried on {{in all parts of}} the World - not to make Friends neither - for I have certainly found very few - but to keep off Enemies". Thrale initially did not want to write in the sixth volume of the Thraliana, but did so because [...] "Johnson said that Pleasure might one day be made from such Nonsense, so I'll e'en finish this last Volume of Anecdote & store up no more Stuff". However she did not stop journal writing after she finished but continued to write for the remainder of her life.|$|E
5000|$|Snider's next studio album, The Devil <b>You</b> <b>Know,</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in August 2006.

2500|$|Do <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} album by American R and gospel singer Michelle Williams, {{released}} on January 26, 2004 via Sanctuary/Columbia Records. Do You Know [...] "straddles between contemporary gospel and inspirational R" [...] and {{is described as}} portraying [...] "a more intimate side of Michelle". It contains {{a greater percentage of}} mid and up-tempo songs, along with a much heavier and grander use of live instrumentation. Williams contributed lyrically to the album as she did with her debut album, co-writing a total of six songs. However, Do <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>is</b> much more diverse, lyrically, than its predecessor Heart to Yours, covering the themes of [...] "spiritual" [...] and [...] "carnal" [...] love and contains retrospective songs about Williams' career thus far, whilst still retaining the inspirational and encouraging lyrics that characterised Heart to Yours.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1977, Martin, under {{investigation}} for wrongdoing in office, {{announced that he would}} not seek a seventh term as mayor in the municipal elections set for April 1978. Tatangelo entered the six-candidate nonpartisan race with confidence. (All Texas mayors and city council members are elected without party labels on the ballot.) He visited 10,100 homes and lost 25 pounds in the campaign. Tatangelo easily won the election, which, according to Tatangelo, represented [...] "a new beginning ... a new administration, with new ideas, new things to do.

2500|$|Writing for Allmusic, critic John Bush {{wrote the}} {{compilation}} [...] "could {{well be the}} most influential document of the '50s folk revival. Many of the recordings that appeared on it had languished in obscurity for 20 years, and it proved a revelation to {{a new group of}} folkies, from Pete Seeger to John Fahey to Bob Dylan... Many of the most interesting selections on the Anthology, however, are taken from [...] artists... such as Clarence Ashley, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, and Buell Kazee." [...] In his review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau wrote [...] "Harry Smith's act of history... aces two very '90s concepts: the canon that accrues as rock gathers commentary, and the compilations that multiply as labels recycle catalogue. In its time, it wrested the idea of the folk from ideologues and ethnomusicologists by imagining a commercial music of everyday pleasure and alienation--which {{might as well have been}} conceived to merge with a rock and roll that didn't yet exist... Somebody <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> worth the 60 bucks it'll run you. So are you." [...] Jon Pareles, writing in The New York Times, said that the songs [...] "still sound marvelous and uncanny." ...|$|E

2500|$|The late {{sixteenth century}} saw the library {{go through a}} period of decline: the library’s {{furniture}} was sold, and only three of the original books belonging to Duke Humfrey remained in the collection. [...] During the reign of Edward VI, there was a purge of [...] "superstitious" [...] (Catholic-related) manuscripts. It was not until 1598 that the library began to thrive once more, when Thomas Bodley (a former fellow of Merton College, who had recently married a wealthy widow) wrote to the Vice Chancellor of the University offering to support the development of the library: [...] "where there hath bin hertofore a publike library in Oxford: which <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> apparent by the rome it self remayning, and by your statute records I will take the charge and cost upon me, to reduce it again to his former use." [...] Six of the Oxford University dons were tasked with helping Bodley in refitting the library in March 1658. Duke Humfrey’s Library was refitted, and Bodley donated a number of his own books to furnish it. The library was formally re-opened on 8 November 1602 under the name “Bodleian Library” (officially Bodley's Library). [...] There were around two thousand books in the library at this time, with an ornate Benefactor's Register displayed prominently, to encourage donations. [...] Early benefactors were motivated by the recent memory of the Reformation to donate books in the hopes that they would be kept safe.|$|E
2500|$|The Persian king Ardesher advised his lawyers, secretaries, officers, and husbandmen to [...] "marry near {{relatives}} for {{the sympathy}} of kinship is kept alive thereby." [...] The same motivation {{is given in}} ancient Arabic sources referring {{to the practice of}} marriage between paternal cousins prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia. The Kitab al-Aghani similarly features the story of Qays ibn Dharih, who was not allowed by his father to marry a beautiful maiden from another tribe because, {{in the words of the}} father felt that as rich and wealthy man he did not want his son to take the side of a stranger. There is the related consideration that a man who grows up with a cousin in the intimate setting of one extended family knows her and so may develop his own liking or love for her. There is also the benefit of knowing the qualities of the spouse: a Syrian proverb reads, [...] "Ill luck which <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> better than good luck with which you get acquainted." [...] Keeping property in the family is a final reason for cousin marriage. One of the earliest examples of this is the five daughters of Zelophehad from ancient Israel (...) who upon inheriting from their father all married their father's brother's sons. The Quranic law dictating that daughters receive a portion of the inheritance appears to have had the effect of increasing cousin marriage rate.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Fly" [...] {{made its}} live debut on 29 February 1992 in Lakeland, Florida {{on the opening}} night of the Zoo TV Tour, and it was {{subsequently}} played at every show on the tour. For Zoo TV performances, Bono portrayed his [...] "Fly" [...] alter-ego, which he had developed into a leather-clad egomaniac. He described the character's outfit as having Lou Reed's glasses, Elvis Presley's jacket, and Jim Morrison's leather pants. To match the character's dark fashion, Bono dyed his naturally brown hair black. Bono began each concert as [...] "The Fly" [...] and would continue to play the character {{for most of the}} first half of the concert. In contrast to the earnest Bono of the 1980s, the character strutted around the stage with [...] "swagger and style," [...] exhibiting mannerisms of an egotistical rock star. Bono often stayed in character away from the tour stage, including for public appearances and when staying in hotels. For performances of the song during Zoo TV, the video monitors flashed a rapidly changing array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included [...] "Taste is the enemy of art", [...] "Religion is a club", [...] "Ignorance is bliss", [...] "Watch more TV", [...] "Believe" [...] with letters fading out to leave [...] "lie", and [...] "Everything <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> wrong". Describing the visuals, the Edge said, [...] "'The Fly' is information meltdown—text, sayings, truisms, untruisms, oxymorons, soothsayings, etc., all blasted at high speed, just fast enough so it's impossible to actually read what's being said." ...|$|E
