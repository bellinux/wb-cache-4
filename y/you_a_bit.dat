500|$|F.E.A.R.s horror {{theme was}} praised by critics. Game Informer claimed that [...] "...the {{frequent}} spooky head trips that Monolith has so skillfully woven together make {{an experience that}} demands to be played." [...] IGN opined that [...] "... the environment has been so well-crafted to keep you edgy and watchful ... playing the game {{for a few hours}} straight can get a little draining." [...] GameSpot reacted similarly, calling F.E.A.R.s horror [...] "... exceedingly effective", and agreeing that it [...] "... can leave <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> emotionally exhausted after a while." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Beckinsale {{starred in}} the comic-book {{adaption}} Whiteout as a U.S.Marshal tasked with investigating a murder in Antarctica. It was filmed in Manitoba, Canada. She found the action scenes less physically demanding than those in Underworld because [...] "three pairs of trousers and a parka gives <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more protection than the latex suit." [...] The film was critically panned and a box office failure, failing to recoup its budget. With critics consensus: Beckinsale is the lovely as ever, and does her best with the material, but moribund pacing and an uninspired plot leave Whiteout in the cold. She also made a brief cameo in the prequel she appeared in flashforwards composed of footage from 2003's Underworld. Also in 2009, Beckinsale {{starred in the}} family drama Everybody's Fine alongside Robert De Niro, Drew Barrymore, and Rockwell, her Snow Angels co-star. Beckinsale was excited by {{the opportunity to work}} with De Niro, whom she had first encountered [...] "years and years ago when I just had Lily and he was putting together a reading of The Good Shepherd.". Everybody's Fine was a box office flop, failing to recoup its production budget. In May 2010, Beckinsale sat on the nine-member 2010 Cannes Film Festival jury, chaired by director Tim Burton. Unable to find a script she felt passionate about, Beckinsale kept a low profile in 2010 and 2011, opting to spend time with her daughter.|$|E

2500|$|On May 30, 2008, {{the first}} teaser trailer {{for the film}} was {{released}} on Smith's website, silentbobspeaks.com. The teaser depicts Rogen and Banks' characters as they hold auditions. In his online diary, Kevin Smith insisted it was strictly a teaser, mentioning, [...] "There ain't a frame of footage in this puppy that's in the actual flick, so feel free to watch it without fear of 'spoilers'. This {{is just a little}} something to give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a feel for the flick." [...] On July 21, however, the video was removed from the website following an order by the MPAA because it was designated a [...] "teaser trailer" [...] without passing through MPAA certification. On September 2, 2008, a red band trailer of the film was released at IGN.|$|E
2500|$|Within the story, after {{spending}} time with Luke, Noah is seen struggling {{to come to terms}} with his sexuality, and is often angry and confused. Luke and Noah's portrayers, Hansis and Silbermann, spoke with magazine The Advocate about the attention the storyline has generated. [...] "The fan response has been really great to both the individual characters and where we're taking the relationship," [...] Silbermann stated. [...] "Noah and Luke were voted top couple in a Soap Opera Digest poll. The funny thing is, a lot of people want them to be happy, but a lot want them to suffer heartache and tragedy [...] because that's what couples on daytime TV do. It's a good sign, actually." [...] Hansis said that [...] "it does throw <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> especially since this was [...] first big role on television" [...] and [...] "You go from waiting tables to doing interviews with national magazines and people saying that you changed their lives. It's definitely tricky".|$|E
