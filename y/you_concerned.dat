But you must feel that if we should hear now of any {{depredation}} about the county, we couldn't,--I at least could not,--help thinking of you. And I am told {{that there will be}} depredations, Sam. Are <b>you</b> <b>concerned</b> in these matters?" ...|$|E

You mean {{you want me}} to stay and pretend--in order that you won't be {{disturbed}} by any silly tales they tell about me? [With a wild laugh.] Good God, this is too much! Why does a man have to be maddened by fools at such a time! [Raging.] Leave me alone! You're like a swarm of poisonous flies.|$|E
6000|$|Away {{runs the}} Englishman, {{as if he}} was bewitched, and became frighted and amazed, to the {{governor}} Spaniard, and tells him they were all undone, for there were strangers landed upon the island, he could not tell who. The Spaniard pausing a while, says to him, [...] "How do you mean, you cannot tell who? They are savages to be sure."--"No, no," [...] says the Englishman, [...] "they are men in clothes, with arms."--"Nay then," [...] says the Spaniard, [...] "why are <b>you</b> <b>concerned?</b> If they are not savages, they must be friends; for there is no Christian nation upon earth but will do us good rather than harm." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am a close {{neighbor}} of yours, my good friends--you've known {{me on the}} bench a good while--I've always gone a good deal into public questions--machinery, now, and machine-breaking--you're many of <b>you</b> <b>concerned</b> with machinery, and I've been going into that lately. It won't do, you know, breaking machines: everything must go on--trade, manufactures, commerce, interchange of staples--that kind of thing--since Adam Smith, that must go on. We must look all over the globe:--'Observation with extensive view,' must look everywhere, 'from China to Peru,' as somebody says--Johnson, I think, 'The Rambler,' you know. That is what I have done {{up to a certain}} point--not as far as Peru; but I've not always stayed at home--I saw it wouldn't do. I've been in the Levant, where some of your Middlemarch goods go--and then, again, in the Baltic. The Baltic, now." ...|$|E
60|$|You {{will say}} the Jew is {{everywhere}} numerically feeble. That {{is nothing to}} the point--with the Irishman's history for an object-lesson. But I am coming to your numerical feebleness presently. In all parliamentary countries you could no doubt elect Jews to the legislatures--and even one member in such a body is sometimes a force which counts. How deeply have <b>you</b> <b>concerned</b> yourselves about this in Austria, France, and Germany? Or even in America, for that matter? You remark that the Jews were not {{to blame for the}} riots in this Reichsrath here, and you add with satisfaction that there wasn't one in that body. That is not strictly correct; if it were, would it not be in order for you to explain it and apologise for it, not try to make a merit of it? But I think that the Jew was by no means in as large force there as he ought to have been, with his chances. Austria opens the suffrage to him on fairly liberal terms, and it must surely be his own fault that he is so much in the background politically.|$|E
