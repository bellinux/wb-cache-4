40|$|The {{following}} {{conclusions from}} experiments can be mentioned. True pathogenous fungi and bacteria are {{of minor importance}} in storage. Clamp rot consists mainly of infection by secondary fungi and bacteria. The resistance <b>of</b> <b>beets</b> to these fungi depends on storage condition and on conditions during growth. Temperature and humidity are of importance during the storage <b>of</b> <b>beets.</b> If the temperature is below - 3 °C, beets freeze; if it is too high, respiratory losses are high and the beets soon start rotting. Beets dessicate easily and the storage quality <b>of</b> dessicated <b>beets</b> is poor. Harvesting and cultural methods should be directed to the storage of well ripened, healthy and undamaged beets in the clamp. Beet rot usually begins at damaged places, therefore deep topping, damaging and wounding <b>of</b> <b>beets</b> should be prevented. Storage quality is improved by early sowing and late harvesting. N, K, Mg and Na dressing showed a more distinct effect on the keeping qualities than on the beet yield. P and B dressings, however, {{did not affect the}} storage quality. On sandy soils in the Netherlands the storage quality and the yield may often be improved by rational fertilization...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Application of slanted {{diffusers}} {{is accompanied}} with irregular heating of juice- and chips mixture {{in the unit}} length, which reduces the degree of extraction of sucrose from chips and microorganisms intensive growth inside the apparatuses, increases the sucrose loss during the extraction {{and the time of}} the whole process. A method for preprocessing <b>of</b> <b>beet</b> chips prior to extraction with hot solutions of chemical agents was suggested. It was experimentally found out that the best quality indicators are inherent to the juice obtained from chips treated with a solution of 0. 05 % aluminum sulfate or with 0. 10 % bleach solution. Thermal processing <b>of</b> <b>beet</b> chips with the solutions of Al 2 (SO 4) 3 with a concentration of 0. 05 % and bleach with a concentration of 0. 10 % results in a gradual beet chips uniform heating and denaturation of the proteins, which increases the mass transfer coefficient of sugarbeet tissue, increasing its permeability. Beet chips surface washing aluminum sulfate solution reduces the solubility of the protein and pectin substances, increasing the strength and elasticity <b>of</b> <b>beet</b> chips. pH <b>of</b> the medium is stabilized, which reduces the transition <b>of</b> non-sugars from <b>beet</b> chips into the diffusion juice in the process of sucrose extraction. Combination of thermal and chemical treatment allows to stabilize the colloids of sugarbeet tissue and to heat beet chips to the optimum temperature of the diffusion process of 70 - 72 °C before entering the diffusion apparatus and to improve its structural and mechanical properties. The use of preliminary heat treatment <b>of</b> <b>beet</b> chips: improves the efficiency of diffusion processes; blocks the transition of substances of protein-pectin complex <b>of</b> <b>beet</b> chips into the raw juice, whereby their content in the diffusion juice is reduced; reduces the color of purified juice by 15. 1 %, the content of calcium salts by 31. 3 % in comparison with the standard method; -improves the purity of the purified juice by 1. 2 %. All this corresponds to the increase in the yield of sugar by 0. 3 %...|$|R
