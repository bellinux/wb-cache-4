Nevertheless, since 4 February 1824 various quarters of Callao mutinied, leading to the whole Argentine infantry of the Expedición Libertadora, together with some Chilean, Peruvians and Colombians (nearly two thousand men) going over to the royalists, raising the Spanish flag and handing over the fortresses of Callao. The mounted grenadier regiment of the Andes also revolted in Lurin on 14 February: two squadrons went over to the Callao to join the mutiny, but when they noticed that they had joined the royalists, a hundred of them, with their regiment commanders, went to Lima to join the independentists.

Therefore, this booklet {{presents}} some of my personal suggestions for giving a scientific talk (know and look at your audience, focus on the “big picture”, develop a story, use clear figures but avoid “chart junk”, stick to your allotted time, rehearse your talk but not too much, smile at your audience when you start), presenting a scientific poster (avoid as many words as possible, focus on the main points and the take-home message), writing a scientific paper (read and follow the journal’s guidelines to authors, avoid irritating the journal’s editor, “edit, edit, and edit, ” get help with your English if necessary, write {{in the first person}} to add life <b>to</b> the paper, <b>do</b> not over-reference things), and writing a research proposal (same suggestions as for writing a research paper, but focus on exactly what it is <b>you</b> are <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> <b>do).</b> I have also included comments on ethical guidelines associated with scientific publishing and proposals.

Of course, if some students work together as a group, much more output is expected. Before presenting any new results in the class, you have to write them down (including all proofs) and make them accessible to the other students and the instructor in one of the following two ways. • The preferred way is to typeset them using any software you wish and post the file on the discussion forum (as a plain text or pdf) using the course blackboard. This way, it will be much easier for you to change and update your manuscript while all postings will be availble to everyone for perusal.

Getting Started Maps are one of the many sources you may need to complete a family tree. In genealogical research, maps can provide clues to where our ancestors may have lived and where to look for written records about them. Beginners should master basic genealogical research techniques before starting to use topographic maps. Introductory books on genealogy suggest timesaving ways to plan, gather, organize, and record findings.

However, many libraries and bookstores have the latest edition of Books in Print. Its subject guide gives the titles, authors, publishers, and prices of hundreds of books on genealogy.

A brief {{discussion}} ensued there, which included references to several new (to us) resources. Though we won’t mention names or specific discussions, we did want {{to share some of}} the resources we learned about as a result of listening in: 1. At this website, Vincent Pollard has written a student guide on internet credibility that could be easily adapted to an exercise on testing/editing/using Wikipedia. 2. One contributor noted a particularly outstanding Wikipedian (not a professional historian…yet…) whose many entries have been singled out by Wikipedia as “featured” content (supposed to be the very best of all entries). To {{get a sense of what}} Wikipedia considers the best (and to appreciate this student’s work), see the entries on “List of Chinese Inventions,” “The Ming Dynasty,” “Shen Kuo,” and “Society of the Song Dynasty. ” 3. For those interested in chatting with other China history buffs (including some who regularly edit Wiki entries), you can check out China History Forum. 4. Per Hayford’s point in his pieces that Wikipedia tends to rely very heavily on a small number of sources (mainly those available online), one contributor pointed listserv members to this interesting article, “Is the Internet Bad for Science?” fromWired. In it, the author argues that conducting research online narrows the sources used.

40|$|Dear student, It’s hard {{to imagine}} a class more important, exciting, or {{daunting}} to teach than an introduction to peace, justice, and human rights. I’ll start just by pointing out that, on the one hand, “introduction” {{is a bit of a}} misnomer: it’s highly probable that every single one of you is entering this room with lots of ideas of your own about peace, justice, and human rights—some based on experiences I, your teacher, haven’t had and can’t imagine well. And yet I can say, with equal conviction, that we could spend not just one but four semesters studying peace, justice, and human rights from various angles only to come away feeling that we were still “introducing” ourselves to new ideas. We have before us a topic that everyone on this planet owns in some way, whether they have studied it formally or not, and also a topic so bottomless that one rarely comes away with a feeling of mastery. In fact, my principle aim this semester is to help you discover new and better questions about peace, justice, and human rights—ones that align with things you already cared about, perhaps, but that you wouldn’t have had the tools to ask before. What else is this class trying to accomplish? Really, it is an introduction to the academic study of peace, justice, and especially human rights, mostly through various theoretical lenses. I take it as a given that a) to study aspects of peace, justice, and human rights is a good thing in itself, and that one need not apologize for taking the time, comfort, and privilege of a college education to think really hard about these things for a semester (unless, of course, one is forgetting to acknowledge the ways in which that time, comfort, and privilege can lead to blind spots, and require both humility and self-­‐critique); and b) that academic study of these topics can equip you better to do the things you want to do with your life and make demonstrable changes in how you see the world around you—current events, yes, but also friendships, family relationships, everyday choices, and so on. In other words, what I’m saying is: if you are here because you want to read and think, without necessarily knowing what <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for peace, justice, and human rights in the world—welcome, I’m glad to have you here. If you get impatient with the idea of reading and thinking divorced from action, and want to make plans (or have plans already) for making change in the world—welcome, I’m glad to have you here. Among the specific topics we’ll grapple with are: influential philosophies of human rights and the nature of justice; historic and contemporary ways of explaining peace, war, and nonviolence; clashes between the struggle for individual rights and the work of conflict resolution; the role of human rights prior to, during, and after violent conflict; and critical perspectives on how peace, justice and human rights are generally described and pursued. Throughout the class, we will demonstrate—all of us, not just me— reasons why the study of human rights demands the linking together of different forms of disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge (in other words, this is not a philosophy class, history class, or political science class: it is a class in peace, justice, and human rights). This class cannot possibly be the same every semester it is taught, in part because you are an essential ingredient. I look forward to discovering all that we have to teach each other.
