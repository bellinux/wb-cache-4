500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> down your beer and hug. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved." ...|$|E

The message of the Companion of Sirius when it was decoded ran: [...] "I am composed of material 3,000 times denser than anything you have ever come across; a ton of my material {{would be a little}} nugget that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> in a matchbox." [...] What reply can one make to such a message? The reply which most of us made in 1914 was—"Shut up. Don't talk nonsense." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{show has}} {{featured}} {{a number of}} well-known comedians throughout its run and is notable for boosting the careers of several of these. Scott Dikkers, editor-in-chief of The Onion, describes it as a key launching pad for comedic talent, saying that [...] "I don't know if there's a better show <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> on your resume right now." [...] Steve Carell, who was a correspondent between 1999 and 2005 {{before moving on to}} a movie career and starring television role in The Office, credits Stewart and The Daily Show with his success. In 2005, the show's longest-serving correspondent, Stephen Colbert, became the host of the spin-off The Colbert Report, earning critical and popular acclaim. Colbert would host the program until he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of CBS's Late Show in 2015. Ed Helms, a former correspondent from 2002 to 2006, also starred on NBC's The Office and was a main character in the 2009 hit The Hangover.|$|E

500|$|Jude Law {{stars as}} Joseph [...] "Joe" [...] Sullivan, a.k.a. Sky Captain: He {{commands}} a private air force {{known as the}} Flying Legion. His personal aircraft is a modified Curtiss P-40. In 2002, producer Jon Avnet showed Law the teaser trailer and the actor was very impressed by what he saw. He remembers, [...] "All I got at that early stage was that he'd used pretty advanced and unused technology to create a very retrospective look." [...] Avnet gave him the script to read and some preliminary artwork to look at. Law: [...] "What was clear was also that at the center was a really great cinematic relationship, which <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> into any genre and it would work. You know, the kind of bickering [...] I always {{like to call it}} The African Queen meets Buck Rogers." [...] Avnet wanted to work with Law because he knew that the actor had [...] "worked both period, who worked both having theatrical experience, who worked on blue screen, who hadn't hit yet as a major action star." [...] The actor had just finished filming Cold Mountain (2003) and was intrigued at going from filming on real locations to working on a movie done completely on a soundstage. [...] Sky Captain would be one of three Jude Law films released by Paramount Pictures in 2004, along with the remake of Alfie (2004) and [...] Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). It also was one of six overall Jude Law films released that year.|$|E

They're racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic—you name it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rickard started {{competing}} as {{an amateur}} wrestler in Napier during the 1940s, wrestling in the national championships New Zealand wide, and later began training wrestlers himself. According to Rickard, he [...] "used to train the wrestlers and get some place or another where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> a mat down" [...] before building his own facility though [...] "the conditions generally were {{not very good at}} all". Rickard continued his training in Wellington and eventually opened one of the city's first gyms on Cuba Street.|$|E

2500|$|Orbison often excused his {{motionless}} {{performances by}} saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage, although songs like [...] "Mean Woman Blues" [...] did offer that. He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, [...] "I'm not a super personality—on stage or off. I mean, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> workers like Chubby Checker or Bobby Rydell in second-rate shows and they'd still shine through, but not me. I'd have to be prepared. People come to hear my music, my songs. That's what I have to give them." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 16 May 2012, Henry was criticised for {{comments}} made on Breakfast regarding asylum seekers. When commenting on {{a newspaper article}} about the Australian government offering families money to house asylum seekers, Henry suggested that the idea could be [...] "broadened out", saying: [...] "I mean if {{this is all about}} saving money you could broaden it out. Why not criminals? Not murderers, but low level criminals. You could - the jails could be smaller and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> them in homestay situations. The mentally ill." [...] He later suggested that asylum seekers could be housed in linen cupboards. His remarks were featured on Media Watch.|$|E
2500|$|Allen tried three {{short-lived}} television {{projects of}} his own, including {{a bid to}} bring [...] "Allen's Alley" [...] to television in a visual setting similar to Our Town. NBC apparently rejected the idea out of hand. [...] "Television is a triumph of equipment over people," [...] Allen observed after that, [...] "and the minds that control it are so small that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> them in the navel of a flea and still have enough room beside them for a network vice president's heart." [...] His other two TV tries were quiz shows. Judge for Yourself (subtitled The Fred Allen Show) was a game show incorporating musical acts. The idea was to allow Allen to ad-lib with guests à la Groucho Marx, but the complicated format had to be revamped {{in the middle of}} the run. (The star was [...] "lost in the confusion of a half hour filled with too many people and too much activity," [...] wrote Alan Havig.) ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 29, 2007, Ichiro {{collected}} his 1,500th U.S. hit, {{the third}} fastest {{to reach the}} MLB milestone behind Al Simmons and George Sisler. Ichiro had 213 hits in 2008, his eighth straight 200-hit season. This tied the 107-year-old record set by Wee Willie Keeler. Typically, Ichiro was among baseball's leaders in reaching base on an error (14 times in 2008, {{more than any other}} batter in the AL), and in infield hits (his 56 were the most in the majors). Ichiro has amassed more than 450 infield hits in his U.S. career. Detroit third baseman Brandon Inge told the New York Times, [...] "I wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> a camera at third base to see how he hits the ball and see the way it deceives you. You can call some guys’ infield hits cheap, but not his. He has amazing technique." [...] In May 2008, Ichiro stole two bases, giving him a career total of 292, surpassing the previous Seattle Mariners team record of 290 set by second baseman Julio Cruz. Cruz, who now does Spanish-language broadcasts of Mariners games, was watching from the broadcast booth as Ichiro broke his record.|$|E
2500|$|G-Unit member Tony Yayo has {{alleged that}} Ghostface had a ghostwriter for his {{critically}} acclaimed album Supreme Clientele. In {{an interview with}} Spin magazine, Yayo claimed that Far Rockaway native Lord Superb, who guested on the album, wrote a majority, if not all, of the lyrics. In an interview with hiphopdx.com Raekwon, who also appears on the album, responded saying: [...] "He [...] know damn well he [...] ain’t write that fuckin’ album. I don’t even wanna get into shit like that, because {{it just makes me}} upset that muthafuckas be running they mouth all kinda ways. But {{at the end of the}} day, I think Ghost gonna have to really say what he gotta say." [...] However, in a November 2007 interview with Rhapsody Music, Ghost responded with [...] "...'Perb [...] is Rae’s [...] man. He been in the studio a few times while we’re doing shit. He ain’t write shit. All ‘Perb contributed was a couple of lines that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> in the air. When we write, we all do that. [...] "Say this one right here" [...] or [...] "Put this one right here." [...] We all catch lines with each other ‘cause you in the studio. You got niggas around you that write. Even if he did write a verse, he could never make an album of mine. He couldn’t make an album, you feel me? I made Supreme Clientele what it is.
