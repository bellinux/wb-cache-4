30|$|To {{investigate}} the affinity of acetylated wood for organic liquids, acetylated <b>yezo</b> <b>spruce</b> wood specimens were soaked in various liquids, and their swellings {{were compared to}} those of untreated specimens. The acetylated wood was rapidly and remarkably swollen in liquids having low hydrogen bonding power such as benzene and toluene in which the untreated wood was swollen only slightly or very slowly. On the other hand, the swollen volume of wood in water, ethylene glycol, and alcohols remained unchanged or slightly decreased after the acetylation. The effect of acetylation was greater in liquids having smaller solubility parameters. The easier penetration of aprotic organic liquids into the acetylated wood {{was considered to be}} due to the reduction of polarity and the scission of hydrogen bonds in the amorphous wood constituents where the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups were substituted by hydrophobic acetyl groups.|$|R
40|$|Fungi were {{isolated}} from the beetles, Ips typographus f. japonicus and <b>Yezo</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea jezoensis) trees infested with the beetles inHokkaido, Japan.

40|$|Abstract: Forest {{communities}} {{dominated by}} Picea jezoensis (<b>Yezo</b> <b>spruce)</b> are described from across their entire distributional range in eastern Asia, including the territories of the Russian Far East and Japan. A total of 476 relevØs are used representing the following dominant types of spruce forests: pure P. jezoensis, mixed P. jezoensis and Abies sachalinensis, mixed P. jezoensis and Abies nephrolepis, and pure Picea glehnii communities. The vegetation is classified into 11 associations, 2 community types, 6 subassociations, 25 variants and 8 subvariants. Nine associations, including the Asaro heterotropoidis-Abietetum sachalinensis, Weigelo middendorffianae-Piceetum jezoensis, Lysichito-Piceetum glehnii, Swido albae-Piceetum obovatae, Oplopanaco elati-Piceetum jezoensis, Philadelpho tenuifolii-Piceetum jezoensis, Vaccinio-Piceetum jezoensis, Rhododendro aurei-Piceetum jezoensis, and Moneseto uniflorae-Piceetum jezoensis, are described {{for the first}} time. The ecology and structure of all communities are described and their syntaxonomy discussed. The communities are placed in three alliances, Piceion jezoensis, Abieti nephrolepidis-Piceion jezoensis and Pino pumilae-Piceion jezoensis, all. nov.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the affinity of acetylated wood for organic liquids, <b>Yezo</b> <b>spruce</b> wood specimens were acetylated with acetic anhydride, and their swelling in various liquids {{were compared to}} those of untreated specimens. The acetylated wood was rapidly and remarkably swollen in aprotic organic liquids such as benzene and toluene in which the untreated wood was swollen only slightly and/or very slowly. On the other hand, the swelling of wood in water, ethylene glycol and alcohols remained unchanged or decreased by the acetylation. Consequently the maximum volume of wood swollen in organic liquids was always larger than that in water. The effect of acetylation on the maximum swollen volume of wood was greater in liquids having smaller solubility parameters. The easier penetration of aprotic organic liquids into the acetylated wood {{was considered to be}} due to the scission of hydrogen bonds among the amorphous wood constituents by the substitution of hydroxyl groups with hydrophobic acetyl groups.

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{changes in}} the acoustic properties of a wooden xylophone keyboard caused by heat treatment, the resonant frequencies and logarithmic decrement of control and heat–treated specimens of <b>Yezo</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea jezoensis), Northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora S. et Z.) were evaluated by the free vibration method. A flexural vibration test {{was carried out by}} the xylophone stick free fall impact test. The changes in resonant frequency of the first mode and those of other modes by heat treatment were evaluated. And the changes in logarithmic decrement by heat treatment were evaluated. As a result of heat treatment, the resonant frequencies of the 1 st mode of all specimens were decreased, and within a species the wood specimens of higher resonant frequencies were more influenced. In the case of the specimen with a higher resonant amplitude at the 2 nd mode resonance frequency, the resonant amplitude of the 1 st mode resonance frequency was increased more by heat treatment, so that the sound became more stable...|$|R
30|$|Nakano et al. [5] and Nakano [7] {{pointed out}} that the {{dimensional}} changes with NaOH treatment are primarily due to the decreasing crystallinity along the longitudinal axis of the microfibrils, thereby inducing dimensional changes along the longitudinal axis of the wood sample because of the entropy elastic force. Considering this mechanism, we should note in Fig.  1 that a dimensional change starts at [NaOH] > 0.12, whereas the elastic modulus reduces over the [NaOH] range and its reduction is divided into two regions at [NaOH] = 0.12. Considering eluviation of matrix components such as hemicellulose was almost completed at [NaOH] < 0.03 in the present treatment, we should expect the decrystallization and the change in microfibril angle (MA) as factors related to the difference between the change in the elastic modulus and dimensional change, particularly at [NaOH] < 0.12. However, the latter is negligible for our discussion, because the change in MA induced with the NaOH treatment was from 13 to 17 ° for <b>Yezo</b> <b>spruce</b> [13] so that such a slight change in this MA region had little influence on the longitudinal modulus [14]. This implies that the decrystallization induced with the NaOH treatment has different effect on the change in the elastic modulus and dimensional change, particularly at [NaOH] < 0.12.|$|R

Nine species of ophiostomatoid fungi including one new species were identified. They were Ceratocystiopsis minuta, Ceratocystis polonica, Ophiostoma ainoae, O. bicolor, O. cucullatum, O. europhioides, O. penicillatum, O. piceae, and a new species described here as O. japonicum.

40|$|A-horizon windrowing, {{removing}} the entire A-horizon soil (both A 1 - and A 2 -horizons), {{is a method}} of site preparation to initiate natural regeneration of <b>Yezo</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea jezoensis (SIEB. et ZUCC.) CARRIERE) in the boreal forests of Hokkaido. Soil properties in an area treated with A-horizon windrowing and in a non-disturbed area were compared 15 years after the soil treatment. In the treated areas, the (A 1) - and (A 2) -horizons were much thinner than the A 1 - and A 2 -horizons in the non-disturbed areas. Minimum air capacity, coarse pore space, and the water percolation rate of the upper horizon soil in the non-disturbed area were greater {{than those of the}} upper horizon soil in the treated area. Concentrations of total C, mineralizable soil N, and total N in the (A 1) - and (A 2) -horizons in the treated areas were much lower than those in the A 1 - and A 2 -horizons in the non-disturbed areas, respectively. There were no clear differences in the concentration of plant available P, exchangeable K, exchangeable Ca, exchangeable Mg, and CEC between the soil in the non-disturbed areas and the treated areas. Although an A-horizon development process had been taking place, it would take much longer than 15 years before top soil which is similar to the original (including the thickness of the horizon) is developed again in the areas treated with A-horizon windrowing. 北海道の亜寒帯林では，エゾマツ（Picea jezoensis (SIEB. et ZUCC.)
