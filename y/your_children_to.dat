2500|$|Neville Hawcock for the Financial Times praises Dawkins' {{clarity in}} {{explanation}}: [...] "He really {{is very good}} at this. The chapter on rainbows has the clearest explanation of how they appear that I’ve ever seen." [...] Of the myths Dawkins uses Hawcock writes: [...] "These, straw gods set up for Dawkins to knock down, are not up to the job of accounting for reality but at least give McKean some great subject matter." [...] Meghan Cox Gurdon writing for the Wall Street Journal says: [...] "His tone throughout alternates between real delight over how things work and avuncular pity for the people who persist in seeing an author behind the machinery of the universe... There is no plan, winks Mr. Dawkins, nor any divinity. There is just the 'magic' of the universe unfolding. If that is the view you wish <b>your</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> have of the cosmos, then The Magic of Reality will suit you very well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alstat was {{an early}} {{champion}} {{of the rights of}} women, including their education and their place in academia. In the 1930s, he worked with Trude Weiss-Rosmarin, teaching courses on Jewish History and Modern Jewish Problems at [...] "The School of the Jewish Woman," [...] the institution she created on New York's Upper West Side, under the auspices of Hadassah. Weiss-Rosmarin, and those who worked with her, felt that [...] "Jewish women had been short-changed...and saw education was the remedy." [...] "As an intellectual feminist," [...] Weiss-Rosmarin promoted the study of the liturgy, learning the meaning and history of the prayers, [...] "to stimulate attendance of women at synagogue." [...] Through classes in history, philosophy, customs, and ceremonies, Alstat, along with the other well-known rabbis who taught at this school, helped promote this vision of increased education, not only for the women of that time, but also so that they could help their children. As Weiss-Rosmarin put it, [...] "If you want <b>your</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> grow up as educated Jews, you yourself must become educated." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 17th century, Miguel Sánchez {{interpreted}} the Virgin as addressing herself {{specifically to the}} Indians, while noting that Juan Diego himself regarded all the residents of New Spain as his spiritual heirs, the inheritors of the holy image. The Virgin's own words to Juan Diego as reported by Sánchez were equivocal: she wanted a place at Tepeyac where she can show herself:"as a compassionate mother to you and yours, to my devotees, to those who should seek me for the relief of their necessities". By contrast, {{the words of the}} Virgin's initial message as reported in Nican Mopohua are, in terms, specific to all residents of New Spain without distinction, while including others, too:"I am the compassionate mother of you and of all you people here in this land, and of the other various peoples who love me, who cry out to me [...]." [...] The special but not exclusive favour of the Virgin to the indigenous peoples is highlighted in Lasso de la Vega's introduction:"you wish us <b>your</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> cry out to , especially the local people, the humble commoners to whom you revealed yourself" ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1922, Talcott {{had left}} the {{newspaper}} business and was working for The Hydrox Company, the largest ice cream company in Chicago. [...] He was described in some sources as [...] "head of the city's largest ice-cream manufacturing concern," [...] but he described himself in February 1922 as the company's advertising manager. He wrote an article that was published in The Soda Fountain in February 1922 urging ice cream manufacturers and vendors to adopt a sales campaign to promote winter sales of their products {{as an aid to}} good health. [...] Talcott wrote that [...] "the combined ice cream interests of the country should be able in the same way to get the people, men, women and children to stand on the corners and eat ice cream in a snowstorm for the sake of improved health, increased vitality, and strengthened constitution obtainable from eating plenty of the delicious product." [...] Talcott {{went so far as to}} proffer several potential slogans for use in promoting winter sales. [...] Talcott's slogans included the following:"HARDEN YOURSELF TO ENDURE COLD -- EAT PLENTY OF ICE CREAMICE CREAM IS A GREAT HARDENER -- EAT IT OFTEN ALL WINTERICE CREAM FOR LUNCH ON SCHOOL DAYS WILL ENABLE <b>YOUR</b> <b>CHILDREN</b> <b>TO</b> ENJOY THESE RUGGED, WINTRY DAYSFIGHT COLD WITH COLD -- EAT ICE CREAMTHE BLASTS OF WINTER HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON CHILDREN THAT EAT ICE CREAM" ...|$|E
