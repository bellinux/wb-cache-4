40|$|The magnocellular system {{plays an}} {{important}} role in visual motion processing, controlling vergence eye movements, and in reading. <b>Yellow</b> <b>filters</b> may boost magnocellular activity by eliminating inhibitory blue input to this pathway. It was found that wearing <b>yellow</b> <b>filters</b> increased motion sensitivity, convergence, and accommodation in many children with reading difficulties, both immediately and after three months using the filters. Motion sensitivity was not increased using control neutral density filters. Moreover, reading-impaired children showed significant gains in reading ability after three months wearing the filters compared with those who had used a placebo. It was concluded that <b>yellow</b> <b>filters</b> can improve magnocellular function permanently. Hence, they should be considered as an alternative to corrective lenses, prisms, or exercises for treating poor convergence and accommodation, and also as an aid for children with reading problems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{simulation}} algorithm {{to assess the}} gradual yellowing vision of the elderly, which refers to the predominance of yellowness in their vision due to aging of the ocular optic media. This algorithm employed the spectral transmittance property of a <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> to represent the color appearance perceived by elderly people with yellow vision, and modeled {{the changes in the}} color space through a spectrum change in light using the <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> effect. The spectral reflectivity data of 1269 Munsell matte color chips were used as reference data. Under the standard conditions of a D 65 illuminant and a 10 ° observer of 1964 CIE, the spectrum of the 1269 Munsell colors were processed through the <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> effect to simulate yellow vision. Various degrees of yellow vision were modeled according to the transmittance percentage of the <b>yellow</b> <b>filter.</b> The color differences before and after the <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> effect were calculated using the DE 2000 formula, and the color pairs were selected based on the color difference function. These color pairs are distinguishable through normal vision, but the color difference diminishes as the degree of yellow vision increases. Assuming 80 % of yellow vision effect, 17 color pairs out of (1269 x 1268) / 2 pairs were selected, and for the 90 % of yellow vision effect, only 3 color pairs were selected. The result of this study can be utilized for the diagnosis system of gradual yellow vision, making various types of test charts with selected color pairs...|$|R

50|$|C-41 film {{consists}} of an acetate or polyester film base, onto which multiple emulsions are coated. Each layer is only sensitive to a certain color of visible light.

Beneath the blue layer is a <b>yellow</b> <b>filter,</b> composed of dyes or colloidal silver. All silver-based photographic emulsions have some sensitivity to blue light, regardless of what other colors they may be sensitized for.

40|$|Background <b>Yellow</b> <b>filters</b> are {{sometimes}} recommended {{to people with}} low vision. Our aim was investigate the effects of three commercial <b>yellow</b> <b>filters</b> on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity (with and without glare) and reading (without glare) under conditions of forward light scatter (FLS). Method Fifty-five healthy subjects were assessed with Corning Photochromic Filters (CPFs) 450, 511 and 527 and a filter producing FLS. The effects on log MAR visual acuity, Pelli–Robson contrast sensitivity with and without glare, and reading (measured with MNRead charts) without glare were determined. Results Statistically {{significant differences were found}} between the overall effect of glare and between CPFs for visual acuity and contrast sensitivity.

40|$|There are {{two types}} of Oxford Filter; blue filters enhance short {{wavelength}} light and yel,low enhance long wavelength light. These filters have previously been shown to improve reading performance, vergence eye movements and perception of visual form and motion. In this thesis the effects of such filters were examined in both an unselected primary school population, and in a clinical population of children with identified visual and/or reading difficulties. A school based visual screening study established that just over 40 % of children identified a filter as beneficial when viewing text. These children reported a significantly higher number of visual symptoms and had significantly reduced convergence and accommodation eye movements compared to non-filter choosers. A further trial of filter use revealed that those using blue filters made significant improvements in accommodative function and in spelling ability. A cross-over, randomised controlled trial was conducted in the clinical sample with psychometric, orthoptic and psychophysical assessments administered before and after filter use. Poor readers made significant improvements in reading following filter use, but a smaller dyslexic group were not found to improve their reading. Performance on a Matrices task significantly improved after using <b>yellow</b> <b>filters</b> specifically. There was also evidence that children with reduced saccades improved their spelling with the use of <b>yellow</b> <b>filters,</b> but had reduced spelling following blue use. Although filters impacted upon both orthoptic and literacy measures these improvements appear not to be causally linked. A random dot kinematogram task (RDK) revealed a correlation between magnocellular functioning under blue and yellow lighting conditions and reading; lower reading was associated with poorer RDK thresholds. This association was specific to reading and not evident in relation to dyslexia. Visual search accuracy was also shown to improve significantly after the use of blue and <b>yellow</b> <b>filters.</b> Together these findings have implications for the treatment of orthoptic abnormalities and literacy performance.

40|$|Much {{of image}} {{processing}} and vision uses 3 sensors because we ourselves have trichromatic vision. However, some solutions to vision problems use additional hardware {{not available to}} ourselves {{in order to get}} the best performance. For example, the idea of placing a coloured filter in front of a vision system, and capturing two images: one with-and another one without the filter has recently been revisited in the context of the illumination estimation problem. It was shown that the plus-filter illuminant estimation is easier to solve and so it is easier to estimate and discount illumination compared with traditional methods. In this paper we propose that this two image approach is in fact plausible for human visual processing. Indeed, a little known and little explained optical fact is that the light striking the central part of the retina is pre-filtered with a <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> (the macular pigment) but no pre-filtering occurs to light striking other parts of the retina. Since the world we see is a composite of several images taken at different fixation points we argue that the visual system in principle has access to two images: normal RGBs + RGBs measured through a <b>yellow</b> <b>filter.</b> Experiments demonstrate that the illumination estimation performance that is possible starting with the human vision system sensitivities is excellent and as for machine vision is much better than the non plus-filter algorithms. We discuss the wider relevance of this result to the vision and imaging community...|$|R
