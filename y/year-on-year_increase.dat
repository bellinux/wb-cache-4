50|$|There is a {{perception}} that cargo transport by ship is low in air pollutants, because for equal weight and distance {{it is the most}} efficient transport method, according to shipping researcher Amy Bows-Larkin. This is particularly true in comparison to air freight; however, because sea shipment accounts for far more annual tonnage and the distances are often large, shipping's emissions are globally substantial. A difficulty is that the <b>year-on-year</b> <b>increasing</b> amount shipping overwhelms gains in efficiency, such as from slow-steaming or the use of kites. The growth in tonne-kilometers of sea shipment has averaged 4 percent yearly since the 1990s. And it has grown by a factor of 5 since the 1970s.

It makes recommendations for the use of building portfolio age in strategic asset management. The current trend across this sample of NHS Trusts may be typical of the whole NHS built asset portfolio and suggests that most Trusts need to invest between 0. 5 and 1. 5 per cent of income (depending upon current critical backlog levels and Trust age profile) to simply maintain critical backlog levels. More robust analytics for building age, condition and risk-adjusted backlog maintenance are required...|$|R

50|$|As {{chairman}} of the MMTB Bell recommenced the conversion of cable trams, introduced all-night and Sunday morning trams (to the ire of the religious community), and returned successive surpluses.

Under Bell, the MMTB investigated the possibility of introducing of PCC trams to Melbourne, although only one, prototype tram 980, was ever built. Also resulting from Bell's travels in the USA was a larger role for buses in the MMTB, with some cable tram routes converted to diesel bus. Although this path was not completely successful, as the Bourke Street cable tram routes, which were closed in 1940 and were the last cable tram routes, suffered with buses unable {{to cope with the}} heavy loadings; their conversion to bus was deemed unsuccessful and in 1943 {{the decision was made to}} reintroduce electric trams to Bourke Street.|$|R
