500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 79, based on 24 professional critic reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Dan Martin from NME compared the album to Green Day's American Idiot, positing that [...] "it's {{a piece of}} work that will challenge every preconception <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> about the people who made it." [...] Tim Karan of Alternative Press called The Black Parade [...] "MCR's whole raison d'etre rolled up into one mega-decibel calling card". Ed Thompson of IGN stated, [...] "The Black Parade is a rock and roll gem that celebrates everything that was over the top about the 1970s rock scene." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone praised the classic rock feel of the album. Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "On their third studio album, a musical H-bomb of an effort, the Jersey quintet combine the rock-opera pomp of Queen with the darker, dirtier tones of their screamo past: Call it a Bro-hemian Rhapsody. Even without its broad concept — a dying cancer patient seeks revenge and redemption — Parade stands {{as one of the most}} cohesive, engaging rock records of 2006." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention (...) and said, [...] "In prog, a good sense of humor means so much." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Lucky Day" [...] is a pop song {{featuring}} {{an upbeat}} rhythm and synths. The song has gathered comparisons to the Katy Perry song [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] (2010) and music by David Guetta for its dance themes. In the introduction Roberts sings [...] "Could it be my lucky day?"; the track continues with [...] "Just light the first spark, {{and watch the}} fireworks explode. Boom, Boom, Baby", {{in what has been}} described by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy as a [...] "60s-swing-meets-East-London vibe". Roberts' voice has been described by Katherine St Asaph of Pop Dust as a [...] "springy" [...] vibrato, with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises. Roberts sings about falling in love with someone, as she sings: [...] "Aah, say that you love me, say that you need me too... best <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had.</b> It could be so easy, for you to please me, baby. So how come you tease me?". Roberts discussed the track on her blog, commenting that its lyrical content alludes to a boy that initially does not share the same feelings as his partner, [...] "but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing". Roberts described it as a [...] "romantic reference" [...] with a [...] "down-beat track underneath", and in contrast called the top-line of the track [...] "quite cute and girly". A remix of the song was producer by band White Lies, and debuted on The Guardian. The 90s-themed concept incorporates house music, with [...] "chunky" [...] beats and [...] "twinkly" [...] synths to the original instrumental of the song.|$|E
500|$|The Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra {{felt all}} of the album's tracks were strong, and wrote [...] "Every track plays like a {{potential}} hit single, and that's exactly what fans will love about 'E=MC²'. Expect it to soundtrack much of the summer and beyond." [...] Los Angeles Times staff writer, Richard Cromelin, gave the album two out of four stars, noting its [...] "alternatives to the glass-shattering flamboyance of her early '90s youth." [...] He concluded in his mixed review of the album, [...] "Of course, consistency isn't so important when an album is assembled {{as a series of}} singles rather than a cohesive work. Fortunately for Carey, the tabloid-tailored real-life back story {{on one side and the}} producer's craft on the other matter more than the art of singing in this particular fairy tale." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times felt the album didn't level up to par with Carey's previous release, writing [...] "Much of the record sounds like urban-radio imitations, without the peculiarities and effective hooks of 'Mimi'. Maybe emancipation isn't a continuing procedure; maybe it only comes once." [...] Writing for PopMatters, Evan Sawdey rated E=MC² four out of ten discs, describing it as a [...] "shallow imitation of its predecessor". Sawdey concluded his review on a mixed note, stating [...] " [...] the second act of Mariah's comeback doesn't wisely expand her sound: it instead succumbs to the blueprint so carefully laid out by its predecessor, a pointless remake that exists only because it has to. If <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> a doubt as to its formulaic nature, you need to look no further than its title. Long live the Diva." [...] Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone questioned why she limited her vocal abilities throughout the record, [...] "nearly every song confines Carey to four-note verses, offering little room for her glorious range." [...] Journalist Eric Henderson, writing for Slant Magazine, graded the album three out of five stars, and concluding with, [...] "Such are the rewards of an album like 'E=MC²', in which one does reach a solution, but not before Mariah bends over backward to show her work." [...] The album finished in the top-ten of several [...] "best of 2008" [...] lists, ending at number four on an official poll held by Billboard, eight by The Detroit News, and number ten by The San Diego Union-Tribune. Robert Christgau picked out one song from the album, [...] "Touch My Body", as a [...] "choice cut" [...] (...) [...]|$|E

[...] Clinton later stated, [...] "I thought the definition included any activity by , where [...] was the actor and came in contact with those parts of the bodies" [...] which had been explicitly listed (and [...] "with an intent to gratify or arouse the sexual desire of any person").

2500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 5 out of 10, arguing of the trust/fear system [...] "it {{is nowhere near}} {{as much of a}} neat {{gameplay}} innovation as the hype had some people believe [...] As a squad based game it would work far better if <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> to care a great deal for anyone's survival.

2500|$|Still embittered by the {{perceived}} betrayal, Paine tried to ruin Washington's reputation by {{calling him a}} treacherous man who was unworthy of his fame as a military and political hero. He sent a stinging letter to Washington, in which he described him as an incompetent commander and a vain and ungrateful person. Paine never received a reply, so he contacted his lifelong publisher, the anti-Federalist Benjamin Bache to publish this Letter to George Washington in 1796. In this scathing publication, Paine wrote: [...] "the world will be puzzled to decide whether you are an apostate or an impostor; whether you have abandoned good principles or whether <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> any." [...] He further wrote that {{without the aid of}} France, Washington could not have succeeded in the Revolution and had [...] "but little share in the glory of the final event." [...] He also commented on Washington's poor character, saying that Washington had no sympathetic feelings and was a hypocrite.|$|E

[...] "Boasting three of the biggest stars from the worlds of hip-hop and R, 'Run This Town' {{was never going to be}} a flop, but neither is it a roaring success. Kanye's slick rapping ("Reebok baby, you need to try some new things, have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> shoes without shoestrings?") and Rihanna's [...] "hey-hey" [...] chorus hook make Jay-Z seem surplus to requirements, which surely can't have been the aim.

2500|$|Quicksilver was {{originally}} {{presented as a}} mutant capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running {{at the speed of}} sound, exposure to the High Evolutionary's Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at supersonic speeds of up to Mach 10 and resist the effects of friction, reduced oxygen, and kinetic impact while moving at super-speeds. Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating cyclone-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the speed of thought, because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material, and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants. It has been revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> a day where you are at the ATM and you are in a hurry because you're running late but the person in front of you doesn't know how to use the ATM and they're taking forever? Now imagine what it must be like to spend every day surrounded by people who don't know how to use the ATM." ...|$|E
