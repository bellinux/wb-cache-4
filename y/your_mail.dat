[...] "We had no thought of the end when it came," [...] the nun went on. [...] "So quickly, so peacefully, she left us.

What can you expect but just {{punishment}} for your insolence,--say, a lance between your shoulders while you stoop to drink, as Sigfried had for daring to tame Brunhild? And more, what right have you to come here, and so win {{the hearts of the}} ladies, that the lady of all the ladies should say, 'If aught happen to my poor boy,--and he cannot live long,--I would adopt Hereward for my own son, and show his mother what a fool some folks think her?' So, my lord, put on <b>your</b> <b>mail</b> shirt to-morrow, and take care of narrow ways, and sharp corners.

[...] "You will remember, nephews, that I was against this ride of Rosamund's to seek flowers, or I know not what, at St. Peter's shrine, nine miles away, but as the maid had set her heart on it, and there are but few pleasures here, why, I let her go with the pair of you for escort. You will mind also that you were {{starting}} without <b>your</b> <b>mail,</b> and how foolish you thought me when I called you back and made you gird it on. Well, my patron saint--or yours--put it into my head to do so, for {{had it not been}} for those same shirts of mail, you were both of you dead men to-day. But that morning I had been thinking of Sir Hugh Lozelle--if such a false, pirate rogue can be called a knight, not but that he is stout and brave enough--and his threats after he recovered from the wound you gave him, Godwin; how that he would come back and take your cousin for all we could do to stay him. True, we heard that he had sailed for the East to war against Saladin--or with him, for he was ever a traitor--but even if this were so, men return from the East. Therefore I bade you arm, having some foresight of what was to come, for doubtless this onslaught must have been planned by him." ...|$|E

His name does not matter--it is best forgotten; but he fled from Spain to England for reasons of his own, and took that of the country whence he came--Castile, or Castell. Also, as it is not lawful for Jews to live in England, he became converted to the Christian faith--seek not to know his motives, they are buried with him. Moreover, he converted me, his only child, who was but ten years old, and cared little whether I swore by 'Father Abraham' or by the 'Blessed Mary.' The paper of my baptism lies in my strong box still. Well, he was clever, and built up this business, and died unharmed five-and-twenty years ago, leaving me already rich. That same year I married an Englishwoman, your mother's second cousin, and loved her and lived happily with her, and gave her all her heart could wish. But after Margaret's birth, three-and-twenty years gone by, she never had her health, and eight years ago she died. You remember her, since she brought you here when you were a stout lad, and made me promise afterwards that I would always be your friend, for except your father, Sir Peter, none other of your well-born and ancient family were left. So when Sir Peter--against my counsel, staking his all upon that usurping rogue Richard, who had promised to advance him, and meanwhile took his money--was killed at Bosworth, leaving you landless, penniless, and out of favour, I offered you a home, and you, being a wise man, put off <b>your</b> <b>mail</b> and put on woollen and became a merchant's partner, though your share of profit was but small. Now, again you have changed staff for steel," [...] and he glanced at the Scotchman's sword that still lay upon a side table, [...] "and Margaret has loosed that rock of which I spoke to her." ...|$|E
