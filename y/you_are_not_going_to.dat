There is a duty on {{the part}} of the rich to the poor and to the needy, but <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> help people express that duty and satisfy it if you punish them fiscally so viciously that they leave this city and this country. I want London to be a competitive, dynamic place to come to work." ...|$|E
500|$|Arguably the {{highlight}} of the year was the defeat of the Centre Praying Colonels by a score of 24 to 0. It was Centre's first loss to a southern team since 1916. A story goes that tackle Bill Fincher sought to knock Centre quarterback [...] "Bo" [...] McMillin out of the game, taking with him brass-knuckles or [...] "something equally diabolical." [...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're a great player Bo...I feel awful sorry about it because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be in there very longabout three minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|McMillin {{also had}} his only loss {{to a team}} from the South, to Georgia Tech by a 20–0 score. Tech tackle Bill Fincher {{reportedly}} tried to knock McMillin {{out of the game}} with brass knuckles or [...] "something equally diabolical." [...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're a great player Bo...I feel awful sorry about it because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be in there very long—about three minutes." [...] The Atlanta Constitution reported, [...] "McMillin's forward passes outdid anything of the kind seen here in many years, but Tech seemed to know where they were going". According to one writer, [...] "Even the great [...] "Bo" [...] McMillin was powerless against the Tech players".|$|E

500|$|The song is {{a breakup}} lament {{dealing with the}} theme of commitment. Its title refers to the turning point of a {{relationship}}. The lyrics address a relationship {{in a state of}} tension and uncertainty: [...] "We've reached the climax / We're together / Now we're undone / Won't commit so we choose to run away / Do we separate?" [...] Usher sings in a pleading falsetto and a plaintive tone on the song, alternating restrained vocals and anguished howls. In an interview for V-103, Usher stressed that [...] "Climax" [...] focuses more on the complication of relationships rather than sex, saying that [...] "it's really about the ultimate experience or lack thereof. Or the finale of an experience of love and life. When you're in a relationship and it has kinda reached the climax of where it can go, you gotta let it go if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> commit." [...] He viewed that his falsetto vocals and the song's tone give the song a sexual feel with music that works as a [...] "double entendre".|$|E

2500|$|Si Bogs, napaka-wise na player, napakautak (Bogs, was a {{very wise}} player, headstrong). Kung ang tao ni Bogs nu'ng nasa Crispa pa kami, medyo parang linta, nagtitinginan na kami ni Bogs (While we were {{teammates}} with Crispa, if Bogs' man was sticking to him like a leech, Bogs and I will have this eye-contact). Ako na ang bahalang magbigay ng screen sa kanya (I'll {{be the one to}} provide a screen for him). Si Bogs, pag dinepensahan mo iyan sa buong game, di ka makakatapos, mauubos ka sa foul (With Bogs, if you try to guard him for an entire game, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> finish, you are going to foul-out). Kapag nag-fake iyan, siguradong susunod ka, tiyak tatalon ka (If he fakes, for sure you are going to bite). Ang galing ng kamay niya (He's got great hands)." ...|$|E

2500|$|To the {{statement}} that the Kansas science standards {{had nothing to do}} with intelligent design but were only about teaching evolution in a [...] "balanced" [...] way, Borofsky responded: [...] "It really is ID in disguise. The entire purpose behind all of this is to shift it into schools...at least that is the hope/fear among some science teachers in the area. The problem is, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be dogmatic in Darwinism that means you inevitably have to point out a fault or at least an alternative to Darwinism. So far, the only plausible theory is ID. If one is to challenge Darwin, then one must use ID. To challenge Darwin is to challenge natural selection/spontaneous first cause...which is what the Kansas board is attempting to do. When you do that, you have to invoke the idea of ID." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of her quotable comments, Alice's {{most famous}} {{found its way}} to a pillow on her settee: [...] "If you can't say {{something}} good about someone, come sit right here by me." [...] To Senator Joseph McCarthy, who had jokingly remarked at a party [...] "Here's my blind date. I am going to call you Alice," [...] she sarcastically said [...] "Senator McCarthy, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> call me Alice. The truckman, the trashman and the policeman on my block may call me Alice, but you may not." [...] She informed President Lyndon B. Johnson that she wore wide-brimmed hats so he couldn't kiss her. When a well-known Washington senator was discovered to have been {{having an affair with a}} young woman less than half his age, she quipped, [...] "You can't make a soufflé rise twice."
