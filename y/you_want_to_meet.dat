The Portland Mercury {{said the}} restaurant was a [...] "kinda retro-y bar... popular with a young college-y, drinkin', party crowd". One Portland resident described the club as [...] "the {{kind of place where}} you can go with your sophisticated friends and look at the Daddy-O decor. Or you can go on a date and snuggle in a corner where the lighting is low. And if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> new people you can stroll through there and see people whose faces you've never seen before, which is a rare thing in Portland." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{at first}} {{appearing}} as an immature prankster, Lionel's second stint saw the character {{develop into a}} more sensitive character with [...] "little-boy-lost" [...] vulnerability. John Leigh described Lionel as likeable, stating; [...] "Lionel is this great trier. That's why people have latched on to him. He doesn't have all the swankiness of the doctors â€“ their money and their looks. A lot of people always see themselves as falling a bit short of the mark and everyone does in some way. People identity with this struggle." [...] Leigh {{found it difficult to}} understand how Lionel attracted women, saying, [...] "Lionel is the sort of person <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> when you're ready to settle down. He's a nice guy. You can trust him. He can cook. He can fix things. None of these things is exciting to a young woman." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You can {{appreciate}} the fact, therefore," [...] Peter Ruff continued, [...] "that as his friend and well-wisher I can scarcely disclose his whereabouts without his permission. Will you tell me exactly why <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> him again?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} these {{harrowing}} subjects are brought in altogether too much," [...] said the lady. [...] "There are enough of them in real life, without filling all the novels with them. It's terrible the number of beggars you meet on the street, this winter.

60|$|He {{liked it}} amazingly. He quite forgot the {{conclusion}} {{at which he}} had arrived respecting society a year ago, drawn from his vast experience of the single party which he had then attended. Feelings are different when you know a great many persons, and every person is trying to please you; above all, when there are individuals whom <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet,</b> and whom, {{if you do not}} meet, you become restless.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} seen your friend Lockett, Bob; I mean the younger one. He {{commands}} the Antelope now, you know.

[...] Knox also said that a policewoman [...] "was saying 'Come on, come on, remember' and then - slap - she hit me. Then 'come on, come on' and - slap - another one".|$|R

5000|$|John Thompson, {{president}} of the Mackenzie Institute, a Toronto think tank, summarized the young suspects stating [...] "These are kids at a transition, between Islamic society and Western society.
