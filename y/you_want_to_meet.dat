The Portland Mercury {{said the}} restaurant was a [...] "kinda retro-y bar... popular with a young college-y, drinkin', party crowd". One Portland resident described the club as [...] "the {{kind of place where}} you can go with your sophisticated friends and look at the Daddy-O decor. Or you can go on a date and snuggle in a corner where the lighting is low. And if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> new people you can stroll through there and see people whose faces you've never seen before, which is a rare thing in Portland." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{at first}} {{appearing}} as an immature prankster, Lionel's second stint saw the character {{develop into a}} more sensitive character with [...] "little-boy-lost" [...] vulnerability. John Leigh described Lionel as likeable, stating; [...] "Lionel is this great trier. That's why people have latched on to him. He doesn't have all the swankiness of the doctors – their money and their looks. A lot of people always see themselves as falling a bit short of the mark and everyone does in some way. People identity with this struggle." [...] Leigh {{found it difficult to}} understand how Lionel attracted women, saying, [...] "Lionel is the sort of person <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> when you're ready to settle down. He's a nice guy. You can trust him. He can cook. He can fix things. None of these things is exciting to a young woman." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You can {{appreciate}} the fact, therefore," [...] Peter Ruff continued, [...] "that as his friend and well-wisher I can scarcely disclose his whereabouts without his permission. Will you tell me exactly why <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> him again?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} these {{harrowing}} subjects are brought in altogether too much," [...] said the lady. [...] "There are enough of them in real life, without filling all the novels with them. It's terrible the number of beggars you meet on the street, this winter.

They work up with the northwesterly current, but I expect the wind will have carried them back against it. No, I don't want to see no icebergs." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{liked it}} amazingly. He quite forgot the {{conclusion}} {{at which he}} had arrived respecting society a year ago, drawn from his vast experience of the single party which he had then attended. Feelings are different when you know a great many persons, and every person is trying to please you; above all, when there are individuals whom <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet,</b> and whom, {{if you do not}} meet, you become restless.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} seen your friend Lockett, Bob; I mean the younger one. He {{commands}} the Antelope now, you know.

[...] Knox also said that a policewoman [...] "was saying 'Come on, come on, remember' and then - slap - she hit me. Then 'come on, come on' and - slap - another one".|$|R

5000|$|John Thompson, {{president}} of the Mackenzie Institute, a Toronto think tank, summarized the young suspects stating [...] "These are kids at a transition, between Islamic society and Western society.

5000|$|Atanas {{was born}} in Varna, Bulgaria. You could easily tell that he is from Varna due {{to the way he}} speaks.
