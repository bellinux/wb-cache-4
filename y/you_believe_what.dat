2500|$|Trump recalls {{some of his}} romantic exploits, [...] "Beautiful, famous, successful, married — I’ve {{had them}} all, secretly, the world’s biggest names." [...] Trump {{reflects}} on how such exploits made him feel at the time, [...] "Oftentimes when I was sleeping {{with one of the}} top women in the world I would say to myself, thinking about me as a boy from Queens, 'Can <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I am getting?'" [...] He explained that he was successful in his endeavors with women due to some unknown quality he possessed, [...] "The women I have dated over the years could have any man they want; they are the top models and most beautiful women in the world. I have been able to date (screw) them all because I have something that many men do not have. I don’t know what it is but women have always liked it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There you go, Margery! D'you {{mean to say}} <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> {{this fellow}} says? He ought to be horsewhipped. He knows my opinion of him.|$|E
5000|$|But, says Jesus, since <b>you</b> do not <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> Moses wrote, how are <b>you</b> {{going to}} <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I say?" [...] (...) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I wish I thought so," [...] Nancy exclaimed. [...] "Hugh, <b>you</b> always <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>believe.</b> And the children. How can you bear to {{part with}} them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't, Mrs. Travers. Why are you terrifying {{yourself}} like this? If <b>you</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I say {{listen to}} me asking Jorgenson. [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have done}} this,' pursued the other, with her eager look, {{regardless}} of the interruption. 'Do I speak and look as if I really had? Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I am saying?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{saw nothing}} of the kind! A person that can lie like that deserves no one's respect. I ask you all to answer me. Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> this reptile has said?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cynthia!" [...] he called; {{and when}} he came up with her he asked: [...] "What's the reason we can't make it true? Why can't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> mother wants me to make you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> haven't <b>believed</b> <b>what</b> I {{have already}} told you," [...] {{retorted}} Lightfoot. [...] "I don't like telling things {{to people who}} won't believe me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} <b>you</b> will <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I {{have to tell}} you, Miss Townshead," [...] he commenced, and stopped when the rancher turned towards him, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, when I {{was a boy}} <b>you</b> wouldn’t <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I had to eat," [...] {{said the}} skipper; [...] "not if I took my Bible oath on it, you wouldn’t." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} that <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> you say. Whether {{when you are}} back at Rome, where there are women as fair as the Queen of the Essenes, you will continue to believe it, is another matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How you deceive yourself! I am {{sure you}} are honest, I am sure <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> you say, but will you {{remember}} what I am going to tell you? The time will come, before very long, when you will feel doubts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do {{not doubt}} either of you, or rather I do not doubt that <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> you say. All {{would be right}} if I could bring myself to credit that such a force as that you speak of can {{possibly}} exist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' you ain't {{never seen}} bad luck," [...] Edwin {{concluded}} triumphantly. [...] "You're {{just as bad}} as Granser and his germs. <b>You</b> <b>believe</b> in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> don't see. Go on, Granser." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I bear you no grudge, Madame," [...] I replied. [...] "I {{asked you}} a {{question}} concerning the veracity of my family, and I beg that <b>you</b> will <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I say." ...|$|R
5000|$|For his part, Luang Poh Loh is philosophical, advising [...] "Do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>believe</b> in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{because you}} don't know that I am now doing {{business}} with your father. Yes, I am in fact doing exactly what {{he wants me to}} do. I've broken my promise to you. That's the sort of man I am. And now--aren't you afraid? If <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> that dear, kind, truthful old lady says you ought to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall not. I am {{every day}} growing more {{accustomed}} to--fonder of you. You know I am too English {{to get up}} a vehement friendship all at once; but you are {{so much better than}} common--you are so different to every-day young ladies--I esteem you, I value you; you are never a burden to me--never. Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On my honor, I {{saw nothing}} but this single sentence, 'By the love I bear <b>you,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I say.' No more, as I am a gentleman. I know the hand, I guess the purport of the letter, {{and as a}} friend of Sydney, I earnestly desire to help you, if I can. Is this the matter upon which you want advice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{too tired}} to argue, Ralph," [...] she replied, turning her head away from him. [...] "I ask <b>you</b> to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I say. I can't marry you; I don't want to marry you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You hear that, Mary? Mary, do {{you hear}} What this gentleman says? Won't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>what</b> nearly {{happened}} to you must have happened to poor Aggie that night? For God's sake--for her sake--Mary, won't you believe?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Whilst Clarkson {{states such}} views in his columns {{and in public}} appearances, his public persona does not {{necessarily}} represent his personal views, as he acknowledged whilst interviewing Alastair Campbell saying [...] "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I write, any more than <b>you</b> [...] <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say".|$|R
6000|$|... "Not his, barber? If he have fairly {{purchased}} his hair, the {{law will}} protect him in its ownership, even against {{the claims of the}} head on which it grew. But it cannot be that <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> you say, barber; you talk merely for the humor. I could not think so of you as to suppose that you would contentedly deal in the impostures you condemn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor old gentleman, he ain't {{over and}} above well. Went to bed early last night with a headache, and this morning I been {{to see him and}} he don't look well. There's a lot of this Spanish {{influenza}} about. It might be that. Lots o' people have been dying of it, if <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> you see in the papers," [...] said Mrs. Meecher buoyantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, he ain't turned black," [...] {{admitted}} Mrs. Meecher with regret. [...] "They {{say they}} turn black. If <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> {{you see in}} the papers, that is. Of course, that may come later," [...] she added with the air of one confident that all will come right in the future. [...] "The doctor'll be in to see him pretty soon. He's quite happy. Toto's sitting with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What nonsense!" [...] Ralph exclaimed indignantly. [...] "The idea of my {{taking a}} wife. <b>You</b> mustn't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> Captain O'Connor says, Miss Regan; except, of course," [...] he added slyly, [...] "when {{he is saying}} pretty things to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to think," [...] he gravely answered. [...] "It starts in like a big war, the biggest {{the world has ever}} seen. If <b>you</b> can <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> the papers say, the Germans have decided to eat up France." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, <b>you</b> can <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I tell <b>you.</b> If {{you don't}} give up this love affair, {{you will make}} Mother wretched {{to the end of}} her days. Believe me, my dear, the past, {{whatever}} it was, can't be buried--it can't indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{found no}} chance to talk with her, however, for Mrs. Harkey kept near them during her visit. Once, while Mrs. Jim ran out {{to look at the}} pies, Mrs. Smith whispered: [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> they say about Sarah. She's just as kind as can be--I know she is. She's looking down this way every day, and I know she'd come down instanter if you'd send for her. I'm going up that way, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seein' <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> you believe, then you'd be for compoundin' the felony," [...] Daughtry retorted, the {{habitual}} obstinate {{tightening of}} his brows showing which way his will set. [...] "Me, sir, I'm only a ship's steward, an' it wouldn't mean nothin' at all bein' arrested for dog-stealin'; but you, sir, a captain {{of a fine}} steamer, how'd it sound for you, sir? No, sir; it'd be much wiser for me to keep the dog that followed me aboard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{though you}} might not be willing to accept any man's hand merely on a {{question}} of fortune, surely the fact that our marriage would be in every way suitable as regards money should not set you against it. Of my own love for you I will not speak further, as I do not doubt that <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I say; but should you not question your own feelings very closely before you determine to oppose the wishes of all those who are nearest to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He does, he does," [...] cried Frances, eagerly; [...] "he wishes <b>you</b> every happiness; <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> {{he tells}} you; every word is true." ...|$|R
60|$|Phil.--As {{we return}} to our inn I hope you will both be so good as give me your views {{of the nature of}} this function, so {{important}} to all living things; tell me what you know, or <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe,</b> or <b>what</b> others imagine they know.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{knew you}} had not lost him. <b>You</b> <b>believed</b> <b>what</b> Mr. Prescott told you, until we came." [...] Muriel flushed and hesitated, for this {{was as far as}} she would go. Even in her anger, she would not taunt her beaten rival with defeat. [...] "Now," [...] she continued, [...] "you must see what you have done. You have made your father suffer terribly; I think you have {{weakened}} his mind, and, if I hadn't turned the pistol, you would have made him kill an innocent man. He seems too dazed and shaken to realize what he meant to do, but the thing was horrible." ...|$|R
