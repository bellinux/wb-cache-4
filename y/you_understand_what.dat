500|$|Critics {{generally}} agreed that Ensemble re-created the Halo universe's aesthetic well. Gillen said knowledge of the game universe could alleviate some issues of player ignorance regarding units' actions: [...] "It's not just the geek thrill of seeing a Scarab in action—it's that <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> the Scarab means on the battlefield (trouble)," [...] he wrote. [...] "We know which characters are best against tanks, and which are probably best in special vehicles." [...] Nguyen said that, although the core units meshed well, the inclusion of Ensemble-developed units gave Halo Wars {{the feeling of a}} generic science-fiction title. While giving the game a mixed review, Anderson said that the authentic-looking units and environments went a long way to integrating the game {{with the rest of the}} series. Wilcox commented that with the Halo-inspired menu system and Rippy's score, [...] "before the campaign even begins, the message is clear: this is still very much a Halo game." [...] Overall, Halo Wars was judged a fitting final game for Ensemble.|$|E

2500|$|After {{losing his}} {{re-election}} bid for Mayor to George Voinovich in 1979, Kucinich initially kept {{a low profile}} in Cleveland politics. He criticized a tax referendum proposed by Voinovich in 1980, which voters eventually approved. He also struggled to find employment and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he stayed with a friend, actress Shirley MacLaine. During the next three years, Kucinich worked as a radio talk-show host, lecturer, and consultant. It was a difficult period for Kucinich financially. Without a steady paycheck, Kucinich fell behind in his mortgage payments, nearly lost his house in Cleveland, and ended up borrowing money from friends, including MacLaine, to keep it. On his 1982 income tax return, Kucinich reported an income of $38. When discussing this period, Kucinich stated, [...] "When I {{was growing up in}} Cleveland, my early experience conditioned me to hang in there and not to quit... It's one thing to experience that as a child, but when you have to as an adult, it has a way to remind you how difficult things can be. <b>You</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> people go through." ...|$|E

Jackson stated, [...] "I think it's important to let others know that {{certain things that}} you may have experienced in your life, and that they're not alone, and that <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> they're going through, and that they can make it through." [...] Joel Lyans included it among [...] "The New Soundtrack of Social Consciousness," [...] writing, [...] "Here, Janet does what she does best: demonstrates a coy and shy demeanor before ripping into a confident and empowered voice for those who are afraid to speak up and speak out about a situation that plagues millions of women." [...] Several media reports related its theme with President Bill Clinton's infidelity to Hillary Clinton with Monica Lewinsky. Jackson clarified it to be about her own experience, saying, [...] "President Clinton? People have said that to me.

2500|$|After Bell and Watson {{discovered}} on June 2, 1875, that {{movements of the}} reed alone in a magnetic field could reproduce the frequencies and timbre of spoken sound waves, Bell reasoned by analogy with the mechanical phonautograph that a skin diaphragm would reproduce sounds like the human ear when connected to a steel or iron reed or hinged armature. On July 1, 1875, he instructed Watson to build a receiver consisting of a stretched diaphragm or drum of goldbeater's skin with an armature of magnetized iron attached to its middle, and free to vibrate {{in front of the}} pole of an electromagnet in circuit with the line. A second membrane-device was built for use as a transmitter. This was the [...] "gallows" [...] phone. A few days later they were tried together, one {{at each end of the}} line, which ran from a room in the inventor's house, located at 5 Exeter Place in Boston, to the cellar underneath. Bell, in the work room, held one instrument in his hands, while Watson in the cellar listened at the other. Bell spoke into his instrument, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> I say?" [...] and Mr. Watson answered [...] "Yes". However, the voice sounds were not distinct and the armature tended to stick to the electromagnet pole and tear the membrane.|$|E
2500|$|After much {{criticism}} and numerous delays, RIM officially launched BlackBerry 10 and two new smartphones based off the platform, the BlackBerry Z10 and Q10, on January 30, 2013. The BlackBerry Z10, the first BlackBerry smartphone running BlackBerry 10, debuted worldwide in January 2013, going on sale immediately in the U.K. {{with other countries}} following. A marked departure from previous BlackBerry phones, the Z10 featured a fully touch-based design, a dual-core processor, and a high-definition display. BlackBerry 10 had 70,000 applications available at launch, which the company expected would rise to 100,000 {{by the time the}} device made its debut in the United States. In support of the launch, the company aired its first Super Bowl television advertisement in the U.S. and Canada during Super Bowl XLVII. In discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an off-the-shelf platform such as Android, Heins noted, [...] "If you look at other suppliers' ability to differentiate, there's very little wiggle room. We looked at it seriouslybut if <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> the promise of BlackBerry is to its user base it's all about getting stuff done.

Very little time to consume and enjoy contentif you stay true to that purpose you have to build on that basis. And if we want to serve that segment we can't do it on a me-too approach." [...] Chief Operating Officer Kristian Tear remarked [...] "We want to regain our position as the number one in the world", while Chief Marketing Officer Frank Boulben proclaimed [...] "It could be the greatest comeback in tech history. The carriers are behind us. They don't want a duopoly" [...] (referring to Apple and Samsung).|$|E

2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
