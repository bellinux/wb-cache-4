500|$|Reagan {{feels that}} Armageddon is {{inevitable}} and it's dangerous {{when you have a}} President who thinks that way since he's the one who can call for the pushing of the button. He sees himself in his personal drama, I think, increasingly as a religious leader and he has public lunches with some of these very powerful evangelists, Pat Robertson and The 700 Club for instance. In other words, you have the church stroking Reagan and saying [...] "Yes, yes, aren't they saying nasty things about you, they must be communists. Therefore they threaten both you and me.

2500|$|When {{constitutional}} amendments were being {{considered in the}} 1960s, {{the role of the}} monarchy was not strenuously questioned, as it was deemed to be [...] "no great priority in the present round of constitutional changes." [...] This statement was reflected in the four opinion polls conducted in 1970, which showed that the monarchy was favoured by two thirds of those questioned. The Canadian Institute of Public Opinion asked nationally: [...] "Do you think Canada should continue to pay allegiance to The Queen, or do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> become a republic with an elected president?" [...] To this, 50% opted for retention of the status quo, 33% favoured a republic, and the remainder declined to answer. Further, the answers differed by region: in Quebec, 46% wished for a republic as against 23% for monarchy, while in Ontario the monarchy was favoured well above the national average, and support was even higher in the western provinces. Older persons (over 50 years) were the strongest advocates for the monarchy than any other age group, although those in their 20s also gave their preference for the Crown. Similarly, another poll that year revealed that in Canada, exclusive of Quebec, the monarchy was of no issue to 37% of the populace, and a further 41% rated themselves as loyalists, although many of the older responders [...] "recognised that youth had different ideas which might have an effect in the future." ...|$|E

5000|$|Neither the U.S. nor the Chinese {{government}} provided Hawkins {{money for}} his return trip to North America. Rather, a wealthy Oklahoma City oilman, M. H. Champion, paid for Hawkins' ticket after Hawkins' mother, Carley Sallee Jones, made a public plea for assistance. Champion also promised Hawkins a job after his return to America. Hawkins landed in Los Angeles, California, on March 2, 1957. He had defected {{for more than three}} years and spent more than seven years in East Asia. On June 23, 1957, he was interviewed by Mike Wallace, and explained his decision to defect and his motivations for eventually returning to the United States. The following week, Wallace interviewed World War II veteran and Medal of Honor recipient Charles E. Kelly. Wallace described how Hawkins had been [...] "accepted back into his community," [...] and asked Kelly, [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> treat U.S. Army turncoats?"

5000|$|Liu Yun hesitated {{and did not}} {{immediately}} follow Dong's suggestion. That night, Guo Chongwei secretly met Zhang, and enticed him into merging his guards with Guo Chongwei's. Liu Yun became fearful, but was {{no longer able to}} act at this point. Guo Wei then wrote a letter to Liu Yun, stating that he was being coerced into his actions by the army; he also summoned Feng back to the capital and left Zhao and Wang to accompany Liu Yun. When Feng went to bid him goodbye, Liu Yun stated: [...] "Why we had the confidence to come is that you, Lord, has been chancellor for 30 years, and therefore we do not suspect you. Now Guo Chongwei has stripped me of my guards, and we are in danger. What do <b>you,</b> Lord, <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> do?" [...] Feng fell silent. Liu Yun's officer Jia Zhen (賈貞) gazed at Feng and considered killing him. Liu Yun, however, stated, [...] "You should not act rashly. This {{has nothing to do with}} Lord Feng." [...] Guo Chongwei thereafter moved him to a side mansion, and killed several of his close associates, including Dong, Jia, Liu Fu (劉福), and Xia Zhaodu (夏昭度).|$|R

5000|$|Dennis O'Flaherty, {{winner of}} the Victoria Cross for his {{outstanding}} bravery, has returned home to his local village {{to take part in}} a recruitment campaign. In conversation with General Pearce Madigan, the local squire, O'Flaherty admits that he had not told his Fenian mother that he would be fighting for the British side in the war, not against it. Madigan says he must explain to her why the war is being fought, and that even Republicans should help in the struggle against German oppression. O'Flaherty says he's no idea why the war is being fought, he just joined up to get away from home, but one thing he's become convinced of is that patriotism is part of the problem: [...] "You'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race". His mother appears, horrified to discover he's being fighting for the British. But she's even more horrified when Dennis' girlfriend, Teresa, arrives, expecting that the V.C. comes with a large payout in cash. She's dismayed to learn that the government may only give him a pension if he is wounded first. Still, she thinks it will be worth it, even if he does have to be badly wounded. Dennis says he's sick of life in provincial Ireland. Since he's experienced France, he never wants to come back. He hopes he can get a French wife. Teresa is outraged. When Mrs O'Flaherty discovers that her son gave Teresa a valuable gold watch, she launches into a tirade and the two women berate each other mercilessly. O'Flaherty says he can't wait to get back to the peace and quiet of the trenches. General Madigan sympathises, commenting, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have got an army without conscription if domestic life had been as happy as people say it is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|My dear child, if the {{landlord}} {{of our house}} was {{in the habit of}} pulling the roof down upon our heads, and putting gunpowder under the foundations to blow us up, do <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> know what he meant, even though he never spoke a word? He would be very wrong in behaving so, of course: but one thing would be certain,--that he did not intend us to live in his house any longer if he could help it; and was giving us, in a very rough fashion, notice to quit. And {{so it seems to me}} that these poor Spanish Americans have received from the Landlord of all landlords, who can do no wrong, such a notice to quit as perhaps no people ever had before; which says to them in unmistakable words, [...] "You must leave this country: or perish." [...] And I believe that that message, like all Lady Why's messages, is at heart a merciful and loving one; that if these Spaniards would leave the western coast of Peru, and cross the Andes into the green forests of the eastern side of their own land, they might not only live free from earthquakes, but (if they would only be good and industrious) become a great, rich, and happy nation, instead of the idle, and useless, and I am afraid not over good, people which they have been. For in that eastern part of their own land God's gifts are waiting for them, in a paradise such as I can neither describe nor you conceive;--precious woods, fruits, drugs, and what not--boundless wealth, in one word--waiting for them to send it all down the waters of the mighty river Amazon, enriching us here in the Old World, and enriching themselves there in the New. If they would only go and use these gifts of God, instead of neglecting them as they have been doing for now three hundred years, they would be a blessing to the earth, instead of being--that which they have been.|$|R

For you there is a bottle of dye for your hair, a mixture for darkening your skin, and clothes--the latter such as would be worn by a workman. Charlie is to wear a girl's dress, at which he is mightily offended; nor is Agnes better pleased, for a boy's suit has been sent for her. My disguise is simply a long cloak with a hood, such as is worn by the wives of small traders. Katarina explained that it had been thought better to change the sex of Agnes and Charlie, so that, when a hue and cry is raised for a missing woman, with a girl of fourteen, and a boy of ten, no one should associate the woman with two lads and a little girl, whom they passed in the street, as being the party for which search is being made.

60|$|My Lords, I {{am really}} ashamed to mention so scandalous a thing; {{but let us}} put a case: let us suppose that we had accused Mr. Hastings of instigating the Rajah of Berar to fall upon {{some of the country}} powers, and that the {{evidence}} we produced at your bar to prove it was, that an officer had taken two nudjeeves, who declared they were instigated by Mr. Hastings to go into the service of that Rajah: could you bear such a thing? would you suffer such evidence to be produced? or do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have so little regard for our own reputation as to venture to produce such evidence before you? Again, we have charged Mr. Hastings with committing several acts of violence against the Begums. Let us suppose our proof to be, that two persons who never appeared before nor since, that two grenadiers in English uniforms, (which would be a great deal stronger than the case of the nudjeeves, because they have no particular uniform belonging to them,) that two English grenadiers, I say, had been taken prisoners in some action and let go again, who said that Mr. Hastings had instigated them to make war upon the Begums: would your Lordships suffer such evidence to be produced before you? No. And yet two of the first women in India are to be stripped of all they have in the world upon no better evidence than that which you would utterly reject. You would not disgrace the British peerage, you would not disgrace this court of justice, you would not disgrace human reason itself, by confiscating, on such evidence, the meanest property of the meanest wretch. You would not subject to the smallest fine for the smallest delinquency, upon such evidence. I will venture to say, that, in an action of assault and battery, or in an action for the smallest sum, such evidence would be scouted as odious and contemptible, even supposing that a perfect reliance might be placed upon its truth. And yet {{this is the sort of}} evidence upon which the property, the dignity, and the rank of some of the first persons in Asia are to be destroyed,--by which a British guaranty, and the honor and dignity of the crown of Great Britain, and of the Parliament itself, which sent out this man, are to be forfeited.|$|R
