500|$|Monthly teen {{magazine}} Seventeen called Purr's bottle design [...] "cute". Miriam Lacey of Popsugar's spin-off website BellaSugar {{gave the}} perfume a favorable review {{and said it}} smelt [...] "like a fancier, less chemical-laden version" [...] of fruit-scented body sprays. In her review, Lacey also called Purr an [...] "upside-down" [...] fragrance, because unlike most perfumes which [...] "open with their prettiest notes and then end with a relatively generic bottom accord", Purr has a [...] "really nice caramel and sweet patchouli dry down that fans of Angel will adore, but to get there, you have to sit through a bunch of fruity opening notes". Lacey observed that its scent only lasted about 2 hours; {{she thought it would}} be better to spray it onto your hairbrush, [...] "since the oils on <b>your</b> <b>scalp</b> will help it last longer".|$|E
500|$|Greater success {{came later}} in the year when Streep starred in the drama Sophie's Choice (also 1982), portraying a Polish {{holocaust}} survivor caught in a love triangle between a young na√Øve writer (Peter MacNicol) and a Jewish intellectual (Kevin Kline). Streep's emotional dramatic performance and her apparent mastery of a Polish accent drew praise. William Styron wrote the novel with Ursula Andress in mind for the role of Sophie, but Streep was determined to get the role. Streep filmed the [...] "choice" [...] scene in one take and refused to do it again, finding it extremely painful and emotionally exhausting. The scene in which Streep is ordered by an SS guard at Auschwitz to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp, is her most famous scene, according to Emma Brockes of The Guardian who wrote in 2006: [...] "It's classic Streep, the kind of scene that makes <b>your</b> <b>scalp</b> tighten, but defter in a way is her handling of smaller, harder-to-grasp emotions". Among several acting awards, Streep won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, and her characterization was voted the third greatest movie performance of all time by Premiere magazine. Roger Ebert said of her delivery, [...] "Streep plays the Brooklyn scenes with an enchanting Polish-American accent (she has the first accent I've ever wanted to hug), and she plays the flashbacks in subtitled German and Polish. There is hardly an emotion that Streep doesn't touch in this movie, and yet we're never aware of her straining. This {{is one of the most}} astonishing and yet one of the most unaffected and natural performances I can imagine." [...] Pauline Kael on the contrary called the film an [...] "infuriatingly bad movie" [...] and thought that Streep [...] "decorporealizes" [...] herself, which she believed explained why her movie heroines [...] "don't seem to be full characters, and why there are no incidental joys to be had from watching her".|$|E

6000|$|... "Why do you torment Deerslayer, redmen?" [...] {{she asked}} [...] "What has he done that you trifle with his life; {{who has given}} {{you the right to}} be his judges? Suppose one of your knives or tomahawks had hit him; what Indian among you all could cure the wound you would make. Besides, in harming Deerslayer, you injure your own friend; when father and Hurry Harry came after <b>your</b> <b>scalps,</b> he refused to be of the party, and staid in the canoe by himself. You are tormenting a good friend, in tormenting this young man!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hurry," [...] said a gentle, {{soothing}} {{voice at}} his elbow, [...] "it's wicked {{to be so}} angry, and God will not overlook it. The Iroquois treated you well, and they didn't take <b>your</b> <b>scalp,</b> though you and father wanted to take theirs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes!--with a {{mother-in-law}} who is {{a perfect}} Turk and Tartar, for all I hear--with Indian war-whoops howling all around you and with a danger of losing <b>your</b> <b>scalp,</b> or of being eat up by a wild beast every time you went to church." ...|$|E
60|$|Nay, then, we'll try if {{a string}} round <b>your</b> <b>scalp</b> {{and a few}} twists of a {{drumstick}} will make you find your tongue,' said Saxon, pushing his face up {{to that of the}} prisoner, and staring into his eyes with so savage an expression that the man shrank away affrighted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not they, ma'am! I'm as sartin as they're {{living and}} free as I am that I'm {{standing}} here. I know these Injuns' ways. Ef they had caught 'em they'd jest have brought 'em here {{and would have}} fixed up two posts, jest out of rifle range, and would have tied them there and offered you the choice of giving up this place and <b>your</b> <b>scalps</b> or of seeing them tortured and burned under your eyes. That's their way. No, they aint caught 'em alive, nor they aint caught 'em dead neither; for, ef they had they'd have brought their scalps to have shown yer. No, they've got away, though it beats me to say how. I've only got one fear, {{and that is that}} they might come back before the Injuns have gone. Now I tell ye what we had better do--we better keep up a dropping fire all night and all day to-morrow, and so on, until the redskins have gone. Ef the young uns come back across the lake at night, and all is quiet, they'll think the Injuns have taken themselves off; but, if they hear firing still going on, they'll know well enough that they're still around the house." ...|$|R

It's true that your sex will most likely save you from the torments, but it will not save your liberty, and may not save <b>your</b> <b>scalp.</b> I wish you had not come, my good Judith; it can do no good to me, while it may do great harm to yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Hurons {{hold the}} pride of the Delawares; the last of the high blood of the Mohicans is in their power," [...] {{returned}} the scout; [...] "I go to see what can be done in his favor.

60|$|God knows, {{the task}} will be hard: but no noble task was ever easy. This task will wear away your lives, {{and the lives}} of your sons and grandsons: but for what purpose, if not for tasks like this, were lives given to men? Ye shall cease to count <b>your</b> thousand-pound <b>scalps,</b> the noble of you shall cease! Nay the very scalps, as I say, will not long be left if you count only these. Ye shall cease wholly to be barbarous vulturous Chactaws, and become noble European Nineteenth-Century Men.

6000|$|... "Which way do {{you want}} to go?" [...] the slave asked him in a short time. [...] "It is getting light enough now for me to see your face, and it will never do for you to meet any one. Your head is still swollen, and there are marks of bruises and cuts all over the <b>scalp.</b> <b>Your</b> {{appearance}} will attract attention at once, and if any saw you who had heard of last evening's doings you would be at once suspected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, burn you, maybe. But it ain't likely {{but what}} they'll adopt you; {{and if they}} do they'll take you down to the river, and wash you and scrub you, so's to get all the white man off, and then pull out your hair, a hair at a time, till there's nothing but the scalp-lock left, so that <b>your</b> enemies can <b>scalp</b> you handy; and then you're just as good an Indian as anybody, and nobody can pick on you, or anything. The thing is how to find the canal-boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which bess, eh--HIS scalp, or your'n? If he VERY much friend when {{he comes}} in, his scalp muss come off, or your'n. Yes, juss so. Dat de way.

6000|$|... "Lord, sir," [...] he said, [...] "it's queer to see {{you here}} again, {{specially}} when I thinks as how I saw you first, and you a dead 'un to all purposes, with your mouth open, and Miss Beatrice a-hanging on to your hair fit to pull <b>your</b> <b>scalp</b> off. You never was nearer old Davy than you was that night, sir, nor won't be. And now you've been spared to become a Parliament man, I hears, and much good may you do there--it will take all your time, sir--and I think, sir, that I should like to drink your health." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have spoken}} as a man, and like one who, under wiser schooling, {{would have been}} brought to better things. Hold your head down, and draw in your legs; their {{formation}} might tell the truth too early. Keep silent as long as may be; and it would be wise, when you do speak, to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings, which will serve to remind the Indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be. If, however, they take <b>your</b> <b>scalp,</b> as I trust and believe they will not, depend on it, Uncas and I will not forget the deed, but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hearken to reason, lad, and don't cry out afore you {{understand}} a case," [...] returned the unmoved Hurry; [...] "the savages <b>scalp</b> <b>your</b> fri'nds, the Delawares, or Mohicans whichever they may be, among the rest; and why shouldn't we scalp? I will own, {{it would be}} ag'in right {{for you and me}} now, to go into the settlements and bring out scalps, but it's a very different matter as concerns Indians. A man shouldn't take scalps, if he isn't ready to be scalped, himself, on fitting occasions. One good turn desarves another, the world over. That's reason, and I believe it to be good religion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] exclaimed Umqua, [...] "you are a lucky girl. I see by my son's {{look and}} manner {{that he intends}} to take you for his wife. I suppose he has gone away just now, for I saw he was in haste, to <b>scalp</b> <b>your</b> father, and your brother, and Bounding Bull, and all his tribe. After that he will come home and take you to his wigwam. Rushing River is very brave and very kind to women. The men laugh at him behind his back--they dare not laugh before his face--and say he is too kind to them; but we women don't agree with that. We know better, and we are fondest of the kind men, for we see that they are not less brave than the others. Yes, you are a lucky girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, Sarpent, I {{see how it}} is; that name's to stick, and in time I shall get to {{be known}} by it instead of Deerslayer; well, if such honours will come, the humblest of us all {{must be willing to}} abide by 'em. As for <b>your</b> looking for <b>scalps,</b> it belongs to your gifts, and I see no harm in it. Be marciful, Sarpent, howsever; be marciful, I beseech of you. It surely can do no harm to a red-skin's honour to show a little marcy. As for the old man, the father of two young women, who might ripen better feelin's in his heart, and Harry March, here, who, pine as he is, might better bear the fruit of a more Christianized tree, as for them two, I leave them {{in the hands of the}} white man's God. Wasn't it for the bloody sticks, no man should go ag'in the Mingos this night, seein' that it would dishonor our faith and characters; but them that crave blood can't {{complain}} if blood is shed at their call. Still, Sarpent, you can be marciful. Don't begin your career with the wails of women and the cries of children. Bear yourself so that Hist will smile, and not weep, when she meets you. Go, then; and the Manitou presarve you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now God bless you! You {{have shown}} a spirit that I like; {{for it is the}} gift of youth, more {{especially}} one of warm blood and a stout heart. But believe the warning {{of a man who has}} reason to know all he says to be true. You will have occasion for your best manhood, and for a sharper wit than what is to be gathered in books, afore you outdo the cunning, or get the better of the courage of a Mingo. God bless you! if the Hurons master <b>your</b> <b>scalp,</b> rely on the promise of one who has two stout warriors to back him. They shall pay for their victory, with a life for every hair it holds. I say, young gentleman, may Providence bless your undertaking, which is altogether for good; and remember, that to outwit the knaves it is lawful to practise things that may not be naturally the gift of a white skin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brother," [...] said Bough of the Oak, again placing {{himself before}} the captive, [...] "you have a stout heart. It {{is made of}} stone, and not of flesh. If our hearts be of dog's meat, yours is of stone. What you say is true. The pale-faces DID come at first {{in two or three}} canoes, and there were but few of them. We are ashamed, for it is true, A few pale-faces drove toward the setting sun many Injins. But we cannot be driven any further. We mean to stop here, and begin to take all the scalps we can. A great chief, who belongs to no one tribe, but belongs to all tribes, who speaks all tongues, has been sent by the Great Spirit to arouse us. He has done it. You know him. He came from the head of the lake with you, and kept his eye on <b>your</b> <b>scalp.</b> He has meant to take it from the first. He waited only for an {{opportunity}}. That opportunity has come, and we now mean to do as he has told us we ought to do. This is right. Squaws are in a hurry; warriors know how to wait. We would kill you at once, and hang <b>your</b> <b>scalp</b> on our pole, but it would not be right We wish to do what is right. If we ARE poor Injins, and know but little, we know what is right. It is right to torment so great a brave, and we mean to do it. It is only just to you to do so. An old warrior who has seen so many enemies, and who has so big a heart, ought not to be knocked in the head like a pappoose or a squaw. It is his right to be tormented. We are getting ready, and shall soon begin. If my brother can tell us a new way of tormenting, we are willing to try it. Should we not make out as well as pale-faces, my brother will remember who we are. We mean to do our best, and we hope to make his heart soft. If we do this, great will be our honor. Should we not do it, we cannot help it. We shall try." ...|$|E
6000|$|About him was luxury, {{rich and}} delicate. One votary {{was having a}} violet-ray facial treatment, the next an oil shampoo. Boys wheeled about miraculous {{electrical}} massage-machines. The barbers snatched steaming towels from a machine like a howitzer of polished nickel and disdainfully flung them away after a second's use. On the vast marble shelf facing the chairs were hundreds of tonics, amber and ruby and emerald. It was flattering to Babbitt to have two personal slaves at once--the barber and the bootblack. He would have been completely happy if he could also have had the manicure girl. The barber snipped at his hair and asked his opinion of the Havre de Grace races, the baseball season, and Mayor Prout. The young negro bootblack hummed [...] "The Camp Meeting Blues" [...] and polished in rhythm to his tune, drawing the shiny shoe-rag so taut at each stroke that it snapped like a banjo string. The barber was an excellent salesman. He made Babbitt feel rich and important by his manner of inquiring, [...] "What is your favorite tonic, sir? Have you time to-day, sir, for a facial massage? <b>Your</b> <b>scalp</b> is a little tight; shall I give you a scalp massage?" ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{agriculture}} first, {{because the}} bronze hatchet enabled men {{to make such}} openings in the forest as neolithic man had never ever dreamed of. For {{the first time in}} the history of our race, whole tracts of country at once began to be cleared and cultivated. Stone Age tillage was the tillage of tiny plots in the forest's depths; Bronze Age tillage was the tillage of fields and wide open spaces in the champaign country. The Stone Age knew no specials implements of agriculture as such; its tomahawk was indiscriminately applied to all purposes alike of war or gardening. You <b>scalped</b> <b>your</b> enemy with it, or you cut up your dinner, or you dug your field, or you planted your seed-corn, according as taste or circumstances directed. But while the Bronze Age men had axes to hew down the wood, they had also sickles and reaping-hooks to cut their crops, and a sort of hoe or scraper to till the soil with. Specialisation reached a very high pitch. All the remains of the Bronze Age show us an agricultural people by no means idyllic in their habits to be sure, and not all disposed to join the Peace Preservation Society, but cultivating large stretches of wheat or barley, grinding their meal in regular mills, and possessed of implements of considerable diversity, some of which I shall proceed to notice later.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true. My wish {{is to cut}} off the pale-faces. This must be done, or the pale-faces {{will cut}} off the Injins. There is no choice. One nation or the other must be destroyed. I am a red man; my heart tells me that the pale-faces should die. They are on strange hunting-grounds, not the red men. They are wrong, we are right. But, Bourdon, I have friends among the pale-faces, and it is not natural to scalp our friends. I do not {{understand}} a religion that tells us to love our enemies, and to do good to them that do harm to us--it is a strange religion. I am a poor Injin, and do not know what to think! I shall not believe that any do this, till I see it. I understand that we ought to love our friends. Your squaw is my daughter. I have called her daughter--she knows it, and my tongue is not forked, like a snake's. What it says, I mean. Once I meant to <b>scalp</b> <b>your</b> young squaw, because she was a pale-face squaw, and might be the mother of more. Now I do not mean to scalp her; my hand shall never harm her. My wisdom shall tell her to escape from the hands of red men who seek her scalp. You, too; now you are her husband, and are a great medicine-man of the bees, my hand shall not hurt you, either.

6000|$|The {{greatest}} difficulty was {{to procure}} the Sioux interpreter. There was but one {{man to be}} met with at St. Louis who was fitted for the purpose, but to secure him would require much management. The individual in question was a half-breed, named Pierre Dorion; and, as he figures hereafter in this narrative, and is, withal, a striking specimen of the hybrid race on the frontier, we shall give a few particulars concerning him. Pierre {{was the son of}} Dorion, the French interpreter, who accompanied Messrs. Lewis and Clark in their famous exploring expedition across the Rocky Mountains. Old Dorion was one of those French creoles, descendants of the ancient Canadian stock, who abound on the western frontier, and amalgamate or cohabit with the savages. He had sojourned among various tribes, and perhaps left progeny among them all; but his regular, or habitual wife, was a Sioux squaw. By her he had a hopeful brood of half-breed sons, of whom Pierre was one. The domestic affairs of old Dorion were conducted on the true Indian plan. Father and sons would occasionally get drunk together, and then the cabin was a scene of ruffian brawl and fighting, in the course of which the old Frenchman was apt to get soundly belabored by his mongrel offspring. In a furious scuffle of the kind, one of the sons got the old man upon the ground, and was upon the point of scalping him. [...] "Hold! my son," [...] cried the old fellow, in imploring accents, [...] "you are too brave, too honorable to <b>scalp</b> <b>your</b> father!" [...] This last appeal touched the French side of the half-breed's heart, so he suffered the old man to wear his scalp unharmed.|$|R
