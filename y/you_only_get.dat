5|$|Those {{lyrics are}} crazy. I {{listen to that}} like, 'What was she doing?' Pharrell's just so creative, I {{remember}} back then, and he's always kind of been the same. He's always so positive and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' <b>You</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E

Spin magazine's Josh Kun wrote that Aguilera suggested Eminem [...] "Must talk so big / To make up for smaller things".

500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the album's lead single, [...] "You Get What You Give", drew much attention—particularly its bridge, as it {{contained}} insults directed at Beck, Hanson, Courtney Love, and Marilyn Manson. Alexander stated in a 1998 Billboard {{interview that the}} song's lyrics are [...] "mostly about remembering to fly high and be completely off your head {{in a world where}} we can't control all the elements. You have to maintain balance because <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> what you give." [...] Spin compared the song to Sister Sledge's [...] "Lost in the Music", while Gerber noted that the it is virtually expletive-free.|$|E

[...] "My Daddy had open-heart surgery today. And after long hours, and lots of tears, they healed his broken heart, and mine," [...] she announced through her official Twitter account. She stated that she hoped the song would inspire her younger fans to appreciate their parents.

500|$|For either team {{to play in}} the {{national}} title game, that team had to end up ranked No. 1 or No. 2 {{at the end of the}} regular season. Since the Bowl Championship Series was formed in 1998, 9of the 14teams were unbeaten going into the championship game. [...] The only time {{the national}} champion has not been unbeaten during that stretch was in 2003 when LSU and USC claimed a share of the title as each finished with one loss. [...] Ohio State tackle Kirk Barton would later say [...] "There’ll probably be two undefeated teams at the end of the road and if you’re not one of them you’re probably not going to be playing for the championship.

500|$|I'm writing {{short stories}} right now, that's what I do between novels, and I love them. I'm very devoted to it. You know, it's funny. There {{seems to be}} some sort of law that <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> to be celebrated for one or the other. And then a couple of people will break it. Updike did. They didn't review his story {{collections}} by saying, [...] "Well, these are nice, but he's a novelist." [...] Or review his novels by saying, [...] "Well, too bad he can't do the longer stuff." [...] Other people tend to get patronized on one end or the other—and I'll take it. I have a very happy life as a novelist. But the story collections I've published are tremendously important to me. And many of the uncollected stories—or yet-to-be-collected stories—are among my proudest writings. They're very closely allied, obviously, to novel writing. But also very distinct, and, you know, there's no need to choose.|$|E

500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, this could be the first record in a long time that's got a little bit of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But I think every song came out great. I was concerned some would sound similar, and every one is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record. When you have one guy doing most of the writing <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E

2500|$|Ruddock {{went back}} to Japan in 1966 {{specifically}} to learn Aikido, travelling six weeks by sea. He first saw Ueshiba about four days after he started regular training. [...] "He was {{the real reason for}} my Aikido pilgrimage to Japan. I had read quite a bit about this miraculous old man and having seen the pictures – I wanted the real thing. I knew what he did was special and wanted to be like that too – but I did not feel the same 'Wow – this is something else!" [...] kind of response that others report. I was impressed and intrigued – but not overawed. My journey to Japan was a personal spiritual quest and I realised that this man was someone <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> to be around once – he was a true mystic. Over the coming months and years I was to see him on a daily basis (when he was in Tokyo). As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. I had made a huge effort by modern standards to be there to learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] for no good reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced that this man was incredible." ...|$|E
