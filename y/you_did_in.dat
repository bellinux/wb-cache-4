It's a devastating end to a beloved character, but I would argue with anyone who said it wasn't a fitting end."

500|$|Fellini was {{particularly}} taken with Basehart, who reminded {{the director of}} Charlie Chaplin. Upon being introduced to Basehart by Cortese, Fellini invited the actor to lunch, at which he was offered the role of Il Matto. When asked why by the surprised Basehart, who had never before played {{the part of a}} clown, Fellini responded: [...] "Because, if you did what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Fourteen Hours you can do anything." [...] A great success in Italy, the 1951 Hollywood drama starred Basehart as a would-be suicide on a hotel balcony. Basehart, too, had been greatly impressed by I Vitelloni, and agreed to take the role for much less than his usual salary, in part because he was very attracted by Fellini's personality, saying: [...] "It was his zest for living, and his humor." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 1863, {{when the}} {{military}} cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania was dedicated, Everett, by then widely renowned as the finest orator in the country, was invited to be the featured speaker. In his two-hour formal oration he compared the Battle of Gettysburg to battles of antiquity such as Marathon, and spoke about how opposing sides in previous civil wars (such as the War of the Roses and the Thirty Years' War) were able to reconcile their differences afterward. [...] Everett's oration {{was followed by the}} now far more famous Gettysburg Address of President Lincoln. For his part, Everett was deeply impressed by the concise speech and wrote to Lincoln noting [...] "I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> two minutes."

The regular directors were Shonda Rhimes, Krista Vernoff, Stacy McKee, William Harper, Debora Cahn, Allan Heinberg and Peter Nowalk. At the conclusion of season five, T.R. Knight was released from his contract, following a disagreement with Rhimes. When asked to make a 'flashback' appearance in season six, Knight declined. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Stevens depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled {{to appear in the}} final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. The season's two-hour opener showed the doctors of Seattle Grace Hospital, grieving the loss of their deceased friend, O'Malley. The special's writer, Vernoff, commented: [...] "It's heartbreaking.

The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers told him and St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward.

Lu Su had all along regarded Lü Meng with contempt, but someone told him, [...] "General Lü's fame and glory are increasing day by day.

[...] Lü Meng then said, [...] "The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is nonetheless a person with the might of bears and tigers. How can you not make preparations beforehand?" [...] Lü Meng then proposed five strategies to Lu Su {{on how to deal with}} Guan Yu.

Stump recalled: [...] "There was a couple times there was paparazzi that got us outside and didn't put two and two together". The decision to keep recording a secret was partially so that the group members had the option to not make the record if the sessions did not work out. Keeping the secret was difficult, especially for a group so visible on social media; Hurley stayed away from Twitter, and all members got {{as far away from}} one another in public as possible. Rumors began to swirl in late 2012 after a friend of the band tweeted that the band {{was in the process of}} recording new material, though each member of the band was quick to deny any chance of a reunion. The band remained tight-lipped until the very end; when the Chicago Tribune asked Wentz a week prior to the announcement whether a Fall Out Boy reunion was happening, he replied: [...] "It's not." [...] Plans nearly went sideways when Wentz went to dinner with rapper 2 Chainz to discuss plans for the [...] "My Songs Know What <b>You</b> <b>Did</b> <b>in</b> the Dark (Light Em Up)" [...] video. Following the conversation, 2 Chainz posted to Instagram a photo of Wentz and himself with the caption [...] "Fall Out Boyz feat. 2 Chainz?"

Stump recalls he wrote [...] "somewhere near 25%" [...] of the lyrics, the most since on Take This to Your Grave.|$|E
