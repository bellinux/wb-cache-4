60|$|Therefore, my friends, be {{not ashamed}} to have felt acutely. Be not ashamed to feel acutely still, till all danger is past, or even long after all danger is past; when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{what might have}} been, and what it might have brought, ay, must have brought, if not to you, still to your {{children}} after you. For so you will show yourselves worthy descendants of your forefathers: so you will show yourselves worthy citizens of this British empire. So you will show yourselves, as I believe, worthy Christian men and women. For Christ, the King of kings and subjects, sends all sorrow, to make us feel acutely. We do not, {{the great majority of}} us, feel enough. Our hearts are dull and hard and light, God forgive us; and we forget continually what an earnest, awful world we live in--a whole eternity waiting for us to be born, and a whole eternity waiting to see what we shall do now we are born. Yes; our hearts are dull and hard and light; and, therefore, Christ sends suffering on us to teach us what we always gladly forget in comfort and prosperity--what an awful capacity of suffering we have; and more, what an awful capacity of suffering our fellow-creatures have likewise. We sit at ease too often in a fool's paradise, till God awakens us and tortures us into pity for the torture of others. And so, if we will not acknowledge our brotherhood by any other teaching, He knits us together by the brotherhood of common suffering.|$|E
6000|$|If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{your own}} education, I am {{sure it will}} not be the full, vivid, {{instructive}} hours of truantry that you regret; you would rather cancel some lack-lustre periods between sleep and waking in the class. For my own part, I have attended a good many lectures in my time. I still remember that the spinning of a top is a case of Kinetic Stability. I still remember that Emphyteusis is not a disease, nor Stillicide a crime. But though I would not willingly part with such scraps of science, I do not set the same store by them as by certain other odds and ends that I came by in the open street while I was playing truant. This is not the moment to dilate on that mighty place of education, which was the favourite school of Dickens and of Balzac, and turns out yearly many inglorious masters in the Science of the Aspects of Life. Suffice it to say this: if a lad does not learn in the streets, it is because he has no faculty of learning. Nor is the truant always in the streets, for if he prefers, he may go out by the gardened suburbs into the country. He may pitch on some tuft of lilacs over a burn, and smoke innumerable pipes to the tune of the water on the stones. A bird will sing in the thicket. And there he may fall into a vein of kindly thought, and see things in a new perspective. Why, if this be not education, what is? We may conceive Mr. Worldly Wiseman accosting such an one, and the conversation that should thereupon ensue:- ...|$|E

"Nay, nay," [...] said Adam, {{broadening}} {{his chest}} and throwing himself back in his chair, {{as if he were}} ready to meet all inferences, [...] "nobody has ever heard me say Mr. Irwine was much of a preacher. He didn't go into deep speritial experience; and I know there s a deal in a man's inward life as you can't measure by the square, and say, 'Do this and that 'll follow,' and, 'Do that and this 'll follow.' There's things go on in the soul, and times when feelings come into you like a rushing mighty wind, as the Scripture says, and part your life in two a'most, so <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> yourself as if you was somebody else. Those are things as you can't bottle up in a 'do this' and 'do that'; and I'll go so far with the strongest Methodist ever you'll find. That shows me there's deep speritial things in religion. You can't make much out wi' talking about it, but you feel it. Mr. Irwine didn't go into those things--he preached short moral sermons, and that was all. But then he acted pretty much up to what he said; he didn't set up for being so different from other folks one day, and then be as like 'em as two peas the next. And he made folks love him and respect him, and that was better nor stirring up their gall wi' being overbusy. Mrs. Poyser used to say--you know she would have her word about everything--she said, Mr. Irwine was like a good meal o' victual, you were the better for him without thinking on it, and Mr. Ryde was like a dose o' physic, he gripped you and worreted you, and after all he left you much the same." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was these}} {{thoughts}} regarding the living, {{far more than}} any great poignancy of grief respecting the dead, which affected Harry Esmond whilst in prison after his trial: {{but it may be}} imagined that he could take no comrade of misfortune into the confidence of his feelings, and they thought it was remorse and sorrow for his patron's loss which affected the young man, in error of which opinion he chose to leave them. As a companion he was so moody and silent that the two officers, his fellow-sufferers, left him to himself mostly, liked little very likely what they knew of him, consoled themselves with dice, cards, and the bottle, and whiled away their own captivity in their own way. It seemed to Esmond as if he lived years in that prison: and was changed and aged when he came out of it. At certain periods of life we live years of emotion in a few weeks--and look back on those times, as on great gaps between the old life and the new. You do not know how much you suffer in those critical maladies of the heart, until the disease is over and <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> it afterwards. During the time, the suffering is at least sufferable. The day passes in more or less of pain, and the night wears away somehow. 'Tis only in after days that we see what the danger has been--as a man out a-hunting or riding for his life looks at a leap, and wonders how he should have survived the taking of it. O dark months of grief and rage! of wrong and cruel endurance! He is old now who recalls you. Long ago he has forgiven and blest the soft hand that wounded him: but the mark is there, and the wound is cicatrized only--no time, tears, caresses, or repentance, can obliterate the scar. We are indocile to put up with grief, however. Reficimus rates quassas: we tempt the ocean again and again, and try upon new ventures. Esmond thought of his early time as a novitiate, and of this past trial as an initiation before entering into life--as our young Indians undergo tortures silently before they pass to the rank of warriors in the tribe.|$|E

500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that <b>you</b> kind of <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things you wish you could change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" [...] peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.|$|R

Then the next one was [...] "Great Expectations" [...] and we definitely knew where we were going with album." [...] Fallon said the band had tried to emulate the sound of soul music from the late 1950s, because [...] "back then it seemed like there was a genuine feeling of excitement going on that I don’t think is necessarily happening right now. It seems like when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> that era {{a lot of it is}} embodied in that Memphis sound, so it’s just a giant celebratory thing." [...] Bassist Alex Levine noted that in addition to being inspired by soul music, he used to use a 1959 Fender Bassman. Lyrically, the song is an elegy for a friend who died while the band was elsewhere performing a gig.|$|E
