500|$|Squab pie {{has been}} the subject of poetry. In [...] "The Squab-Pie. A Devonshire Tale" [...] {{published}} in 1827, John Taylor uses verse to tell of the captain of a ship in Plymouth who forgot to get meat for his trip. A boy on the ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny, though it was not meant to be his. Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral is that if <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is a sin to cook on a Sunday, you should not be still having a big meal by getting a baker to cook for you.|$|E
500|$|The judge heard out the owners; after expressing initial reluctance, he {{took the}} job for seven years at a salary of $50,000, on {{condition}} he could remain on the federal bench. During Landis's time serving as both judge and commissioner, he allowed a $7,500 reduction in his salary as commissioner, to reflect his pay as judge. The appointment of Landis was met with acclaim in the press. [...] A tentative agreement was signed by the parties a month later—an agreement which itemized Landis's powers over baseball, and which was drafted by the judge. [...] The owners were {{still reeling from the}} perception that baseball was crooked, and accepted the agreement virtually without dissent. [...] Under the terms of the contract, Landis could not be dismissed by the team owners, have his pay reduced, or even be criticized by them in public. He also had nearly unlimited authority over every person employed in the major or minor leagues, from owners to batboys. [...] The owners waived any recourse to the courts to contest Landis's will. Humorist Will Rogers stated, [...] "on't kid yourself that that old judicial bird isn't going to make those baseball birds walk the chalkline". [...] Player and manager Leo Durocher later stated, [...] "The legend has been spread that the owners hired the Judge off the federal bench. Don't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> They got him right out of Dickens." ...|$|E
2500|$|Down 3–2 in the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals {{against the}} rival New Jersey Devils, Messier confronted the New York media and {{publicly}} guaranteed a Game 6 victory. With fans and players {{on both sides}} reading the news headline, it then became a feat comparable to Babe Ruth's called shot and Joe Namath's Super Bowl III guarantee, and he backed it up by scoring a natural hat trick {{in the third period}} on an empty net goal with ESPN commentator Gary Thorne boasting, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it?!</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it?!</b> He said we will win game six and he has just picked up the hat trick!" [...] It helped the Rangers erase a two-goal deficit. The Rangers {{went on to win the}} series in a thrilling seventh game double overtime nail biter.|$|E

2500|$|... "Please Please Me" [...] is a {{song and}} the second single {{released}} by English rock group the Beatles in the United Kingdom, {{and the first to}} be issued in the United States. It was also the title track of their first LP, which was recorded to capitalise on the success of the single. It was originally a John Lennon composition (credited to Lennon–McCartney), although its ultimate form was significantly influenced by George Martin. John Lennon: [...] "Please Please Me is my song completely. It was my attempt at writing a Roy Orbison song, would <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it?</b> I wrote it in the bedroom in my house at Menlove Avenue, which was my auntie's place".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the front}} page of the Texarkana Gazette on Monday, May 6, a {{headline}} stated that the entire area was fighting jitters. Captain Gonzaullas helped fuel the hysteria when he announced on the radio Tuesday evening that Texarkanians should [...] "Oil up their guns and see if they are loaded. Put them out of the reach of children. Do not use them unless it's necessary, but if <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is, do not hesitate." [...] When asked what advice he could give to quiet the town's fear, he responded [...] "I'd tell them to check the locks and bolts on their doors and get a double-barreled shotgun to take care of any intruder who tried to get in." [...] Another part of the hysteria came from the killer being called a [...] "Phantom".|$|E
2500|$|While Fromme {{pointed the}} gun at Ford, several people heard a [...] "metallic click" [...] sound. As the red-robed Fromme shouted, [...] "It wouldn't go off", Secret Service agent Larry Buendorf grabbed the gun, forced it from Fromme's hand, and {{brought her to the}} ground. On the ground, Fromme said, [...] "It didn't go off. Can <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it?</b> It didn't go off". One of the Secret Service agents shouted [...] "get down, let's go". Secret Service agents then half-dragged Ford away from Fromme towards the east {{entrance}} of the Capitol, until Ford yelled in protest, [...] "Put me down! Put me down!" [...] Ford continued his walk to the California state house, entered, and then met with California governor Jerry Brown at 10:06a.m. for 30minutes without mentioning the assassination attempt until they were through talking business. Ford, who later indicated that he was not scared, concluded, [...] "I thought I'd better get on with my day's schedule".|$|E

2500|$|Ruslan Obiang, {{a son of}} the President, is Equatorial Guinea's sports {{minister}} and president of a top soccer club, the [...] "Panthers". He has lived in Spain, where he encouraged firms {{to do business in}} his country. Several Spanish businessmen have complained about the consequences of these deals. One Spaniard who had paid $200,000 to secure a contract to build soccer stadiums described a system that involved bribes at every turn. After paying bribes for years, however, his deal eventually fell apart when he refused to pay any more in bribes to Ruslan Obiang and his associates. The businessman was critical of business in the country, saying officials exploit as much money as possible until moving on to another contractor. The businessman also noted that he had been threatened on several occasions, both with violence, and trumped-up rape charges that could have resulted in him being imprisoned. His report claimed that there is no avenue for justice in the nation, since [...] "he corruption is absolute and endemic; there is nobody you can turn to." [...] After the deal collapsed, one of his business partners was visited at his Portugal home by men in dark suits who staked outside his home for several days as a threat and then visited him in his office. Herein they warned him that if he reported his story to the media or any authorities there would be consequences. He concluded: [...] "You sign a contract with the son of the president and <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is worth something. You have no idea {{what is going to happen}} to you. We had to flee the country. We were afraid for our lives." ...|$|E
