500|$|Alex Trickett of BBC Sport gave it 85% and stated, [...] "If {{you like}} pure {{simulation}} stick with world number one Tiger Woods, but if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> for a wackier round of golf, let your favourite Italian plumber {{come to the}} fore." [...] Likewise, Marc Saltzman of The Cincinnati Enquirer gave it four stars out of five and stated that, [...] "One of the game's greatest assets is its intuitive control scheme. Novice and seasoned players {{will be able to}} pick up and play with little trouble. There are customizable options for manual or automatic swing modes." [...] However, the only negative review came from Alex Porter of Maxim, who gave it a score of four out of ten, saying, [...] "Golfing game standards like club selection, power meter, and control of backspins and topspins satisfy, but the sometimes-clunky controls and confusing camera perspectives will leave you teed-off." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1896 Hearst {{dispatched}} Bierce to Washington, D.C. to foil this attempt. The {{essence of}} the plot was secrecy; the railroads' advocates hoped to get the bill through Congress without any public notice or hearings. When the angered Huntington confronted Bierce {{on the steps of}} the Capitol and told Bierce to name his price, Bierce's answer ended up in newspapers nationwide: [...] "My price is one hundred thirty million dollars. If, when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> to pay, I happen to be out of town, you may hand it over to my friend, the Treasurer of the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Army places strict {{restrictions}} on personal firearms carried onto Fort Hood and other bases. Military weapons are {{used only for}} training or by base security. Personal weapons bought on base are required to be secured at all times and must be registered with the provost marshal. Specialist Jerry Richard, a soldier working at the Readiness Center, said he felt this policy left the soldiers vulnerable to violent assaults: [...] "Overseas <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> for it. But here you can't even defend yourself." [...] Jacob Sullum, an opponent of gun control, described the base as a [...] "gun-free zone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the video}} Voris {{admitted}} {{it may have}} been a mistake on his part not to have brought this information to the public earlier, but that he did not feel it necessary to provide all the details in order to proclaim the Gospel. [...] "I did not do it to deceive, but because I did not understand the necessity. Now, I do," [...] he said. At the end of the video, he says, [...] "We will never cease to declare these truths, the glories of the Catholic faith, regardless of what happens. If this is all threatened because of revelations of my past sins, then please pray that the will of God be done. Thank you for your prayers, your support and your understanding, as well as the measure of forgiveness <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> to extend." ...|$|E

2500|$|Asked whether NST [...] {{facilitates}} [...] "new intervals or harmonies that aren't {{readily available}} in standard [...] tuning", Fripp responded, [...] "Yes, that's part of it. [...] It's more effective. [...] It's a more rational system, but it's also better sounding—better for chords, better for single notes." [...] To build chords, Fripp uses [...] "perfect intervals in fourths, fifths and octaves", so avoiding minor and major thirds. Quartal and quintal harmony was stressed {{from the beginning of}} Fripp's teaching of Guitar Craft. Fripp began a 1986 course with these directions: [...] "Now, pick a note from the following series—. When you are ready—do not be in any hurry, but when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> play your note, then pick others and play them as the situation demands it. Your first note will be the first intentional note you have played in a week." ...|$|E
