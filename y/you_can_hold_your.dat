500|$|The {{sky hook}} used to rescue Bond {{at the end}} of the film was a rescue system used by the United States {{military}} at the time. At Thunderballs release, there was confusion as to whether a rebreather such as the one that appears in the film existed; most Bond gadgets, while implausible, often are based upon real technology. In the real world, a rebreather could not be so small, as it has no room for the breathing bag, while the alternative open-circuit scuba releases exhalation bubbles, which the film device does not. It was made with two CO2 bottles glued together and painted, with a small mouthpiece attached. For this reason, when the Royal Corps of Engineers asked Peter Lamont how long a man could use the device underwater, the answer was [...] "As long as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> <b>your</b> breath." ...|$|E
500|$|Peggy and Frank {{were married}} {{on-screen}} on 1 April 1999. A [...] "hen night" [...] was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a [...] "massive" [...] {{party in the}} show's Albert Square to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Windsor admitted {{she had been so}} nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, [...] "I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous – we were both very nervous. The day you stop getting nervous <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> <b>your</b> hands up. It shows you care." [...] The soap wedding was filmed in Harrow, North West London in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: [...] "It {{is one of the best}} weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot of people who do not want to see Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, there are certainly shocking revelations back at the Vic." [...] In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.|$|E

[...] It was reported that forty people had fainted listening to the readings while holding their breath.

The last fainting occurred on May 28, 2007, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, where 5 people fainted, one of whom fell and hit his head on the door while trying to leave the auditorium. Since then audio recordings of his readings of the story have been circulated on the Internet. In the afterword of the latest edition of [...] "Haunted," [...] Palahniuk reported that [...] "Guts" [...] had been responsible for 73 fainting events.|$|E

40|$|To {{a teacher}} of {{intellectual}} property, it is fascinating {{to listen to a}} day of debate about a thing called 2 ̆ 2 property 2 ̆ 2 that everyone seems to agree is something that one <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> or hide or fence off. To teach intellectual property—to think seriously about intellectual property—you have to brush aside a vision of concrete, tangible things in which the possessor might be vested with a number of rights, the 2 ̆ 2 bundle 2 ̆ 2 of rights so dear to our discourses. And you have to step away from the marvelous vision that private ownership of property, and lots of it, is the very fundament of a democratic and free society, not because the vision is wrong—on the contrary, it has much to recommend it—but because, in teaching intellectual property, it is largely beside the point. Intellectual property, as I like to tease and maybe even teach my students, might best be described as a system of rights in things that are not really there, which is why I often describe the proprietary rights that intellectual property rules vest as owning what doesn 2 ̆ 7 t exist. It is precisely because intellectual property involves rights in intangible things that it is so difficult to justify intellectual property rules with the same arguments used to justify a system of property rights in things that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> in <b>your</b> hand or hide from your neighbor or fence off...|$|R

30|$|How long <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> <b>your</b> breath? During {{a breath}} hold, what causes you to finally {{give up and}} resume breathing? Although {{there are reports of}} yogis being buried alive and {{surviving}} {{for long periods of time}} (days or weeks) these are mostly anecdotal and may not represent actual occurrences. I like to show my students a film clip from 1929 in British-controlled India of a yogi buried for an hour and a half, after which he is disinterred and is undamaged by the experience. I then ask students to hold their breath as long as possible. Prior to the breath-hold, they are free to hyperventilate a bit if they wish, breathing in and out deeply five or six times. Most untrained humans <b>can</b> only <b>hold</b> their breath for about a minute or so after which the urge to breathe (air hunger or dyspnea) becomes so overwhelming that they must resume breathing.|$|R
40|$|Today, the use {{of surface}} mount {{connectors}} to increase the component density of printed circuit boards is growing as a total percentage of connectors processed in various printed circuit boards. Resources have been channeled to develop various requirements pertaining to the design and processing of surface mount connectors. This paper summarizes {{some of the key}} developments in relation to the evolution of the pager design. Pagers have become small, cheap and reliable. With the drive towards smaller and slimmer pagers with increased functions, a two-printed-circuit-board-construction is needed for design flexibility due to the great variations in language and feature sets. What <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> in <b>your</b> hand, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> drop. Therefore the pager (and the connector inside) must be mechanically rugged enough to take the various impacts in the course of its useful life and continue to function as designed. 2 To minimize the void area in the pager, the board-to-board connector stacked height is driven down to the height of the tallest components. Besides switching from through-hole to surface mount technology, connector density has been moved from 1. 27 mm to 1. 0 mm, and gradually to 0. 8 mm and 0. 5 mm pitch {{in order to meet the}} demands for miniaturization. Added to that, connectors also switched from pin-and-socket to blade-on-beam design technology to meet the demand for a robust system that can withstand physical shocks suffered by smaller, denser and more complex pagers. In conclusion, connectors will continue to evolve and remain one of the key elements in the evolution of packaging and interconnect solutions for pagers...|$|R

Anyone close to me knows I do my fair share, and so do hundreds of thousands of other people in our society. I wanted to use my thesis exhibition opportunity to work within the context of human/object relationships. Through experimenting with installation and display of gathered and manipulated materials, I attempted to convey a more delicate and admirable take on several methods of accumulation. Having accepted my own inclination to acquire, I began exploring various relationships between people and their things. Antique malls and yard sales were visited with a different kind of discerning eye. Why do we buy the things we buy and keep the things we keep? What is it about possessing that has so many of us hooked? My thesis exhibit loosely addressed these questions. I worked with mostly borrowed, salvaged, or thrifted items, characteristic of my personal favorite means of acquiring. The exhibit consisted of seven pieces exploring various means of accumulation that worked together to encourage a new perspective for viewers to understand collective tendencies. Confronting and exploiting these tendencies was personally therapeutic and worked to bring light to behaviors that deserve more positive attention. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
