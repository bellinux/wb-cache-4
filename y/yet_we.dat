Even if this had been reported from many different places, so that one would have to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, <b>yet,</b> <b>we</b> would not accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people... An eclipse is visible in one country but not in the other one; in one place it is total, in the other one only partial.|$|E
25|$|Compound verbs {{composed}} of a noun and verb are comparatively rare, and the noun is generally not the direct object of the verb. In English, compounds such as *bread-bake or *car-drive do not exist. <b>Yet,</b> <b>we</b> find literal action words, such as breastfeed, and washing instructions on clothing as for example hand wash.|$|E

Antony Martial gave United an early lead, <b>yet</b> <b>Wes</b> Morgan equalised. Despite dominating possession, United were unable to force a winner. United kept their Champions League hopes alive with a 1-0 away victory over Norwich City. Juan Mata scored the winner.|$|R

25|$|One {{inference}} {{from the}} Kievan {{theory is that}} Edgar Ætheling and St. Margaret were, through their mother, first cousins of Philip I of France. The connection seems too notable to be omitted from contemporary sources, <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> have no indication that medieval chroniclers were aware of it.

25|$|Incompatibilism may occupy any of {{the nine}} {{positions}} except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to soft determinism. Position (1) is hard determinism, and position (2) is libertarianism. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that D implies FW is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that FW implies D is untrue. Position (9) may be called hard incompatibilism if one interprets ? as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. Compatibilism itself may occupy {{any of the}} nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to compatibilism is {{that some form of}} determinism is true and <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> have some form of free will, position (3).|$|E
25|$|A similar defense {{comes from}} Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived {{the theory of}} epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not {{play a role in}} {{physical}} states. Jackson argues that {{there are two kinds of}} dualism. The first is substance dualism that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is property dualism that says that body and soul are different properties of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not <b>yet).</b> <b>We</b> can know everything, for example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, but we will never know how the bat experiences that phenomenon.|$|E

500|$|The {{interest}} in Leonardo's genius has continued unabated; experts study and translate his writings, analyse his paintings using scientific techniques, argue over attributions {{and search for}} works which have been recorded but never found. Liana Bortolon, writing in 1967, said: [...] "Because of the multiplicity of interests that spurred him to pursue every field of knowledge... Leonardo can be considered, quite rightly, {{to have been the}} universal genius par excellence, and with all the disquieting overtones inherent in that term. Man is as uncomfortable today, faced with a genius, as he was in the 16th century. Five centuries have passed, <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> still view Leonardo with awe." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the [...] "February Revolution" [...] of 1917, Tsar Nicholas II {{was forced}} to abdicate and {{political}} turmoil followed. Victoria wrote to Queen Marie of Romania in February 1917 that their home was surrounded by a mob, [...] "yet heart and soul we are with this movement of freedom which at the time probably signs our own death warrant ... We personally are losing all, our lives changed at one blow and <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> are almost leading the movement." [...] By March 1917, the revolution had spread all over Petrograd (Saint Petersburg). During this period Victoria, almost 41 years old, discovered she was again pregnant, which worried her because of her previous miscarriages and difficult pregnancies.|$|E
500|$|According to The Irish Times, [...] "Flame & Citron {{has sparked}} an emotive public debate in Denmark that has drawn {{all sorts of}} pseudo-experts out of the {{woodwork}} to debate the portrayal of the period and the two true-life figures".

500|$|The charioteer {{was usually}} either {{a family member}} of {{the owner of the}} chariot or, in most cases, a slave or a hired professional. Driving a racing chariot {{required}} unusual strength, skill, and courage. <b>Yet,</b> <b>we</b> know the names of very few charioteers, and victory songs and statues regularly contrive to leave them out of account. Unlike the other Olympic events, charioteers did not perform in the nude, probably for safety reasons because of the dust kicked up by the horses and chariots, and the likelihood of bloody crashes. Racers wore a sleeved garment called a xystis. It fell to the ankles and was fastened high at the waist with a plain belt. Two straps that crossed high at the upper back prevented the xystis from [...] "ballooning" [...] during the race.|$|E

In March, he fell ill with bronchitis, and emerged from bed only {{for a meeting with}} Salisbury and other Conservative leaders on the 26th. As it became clear that this might be his final sickness, friends and opponents alike came to call. Disraeli {{declined}} a visit from the Queen, saying, [...] "She would only ask me to take a message to Albert." [...] Almost blind, when he received the last letter from Victoria of which he was aware on 5 April, he held it momentarily, then had it read to him by Lord Barrington, a Privy Councillor.
