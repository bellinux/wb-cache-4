[...] Vicki Lutas had a mostly negative review for the song saying [...] "at {{the end of the}} day it does sound like something you could have made up when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> school", though she did praise the backing track for being [...] "dark, eerie and cold in a chilling way; in an infectious way". However she pointed out that [...] "the vocal arrangement and the actual vocals themselves do nothing more for the song", and respected that [...] "it's a brave song choice, but it's hap-hazard vocal line seems to scream... C-R-I-N-G-E.".|$|E
500|$|At first, Myst had no music, {{because the}} Millers {{did not want}} music to {{interfere}} with the gameplay. After a few tests, they realized that the background music did not adversely affect the game and, in fact, [...] "seemed to really help the mood of certain places that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> in the game." [...] Robyn Miller ended up composing 40 minutes of synthesized music that was used in the game and later published as Myst: The Soundtrack. Mixing and effects were done on an E-mu Proteus MPS synthesizer. The soundtrack was recorded over the course of two weeks' evenings. Initially, Cyan released the soundtrack via a mail-order service, but before the release of Mysts sequel, Riven, Virgin Records acquired the rights to release the soundtrack, and the CD was rereleased on April 21, 1998.|$|E

2500|$|Bierstadt {{told his}} guide, [...] "I must get {{a study in}} colors; it will take me fifteen minutes!" [...] The weather, however deteriorated, was impressive, and the view in front of Bierstadt {{included}} storm clouds drifting low over [...] "sharp pinnacles and spires and masses of broken granite". Rays of sunlight broke through the cloud, and flowing down a mountain were [...] "ribbons {{of water from the}} last hard shower [...] reflecting back the sunshine."

It's always identical, whether the movie ends up working or not. I think when you watch the dailies, the film that you shoot every day, you're very excited by it and very optimistic about how it's going to work. And when you see it the first time you put the film together, the roughest cut, is when you want to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and just go away. And then it gradually, maybe, works its way back, somewhere toward that spot <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> before." ...|$|E

2500|$|On May 6, 2015, the NFL {{published}} a 243-page report regarding the deflation of footballs {{used in the}} previous season's AFC Championship Game. The report concluded that, more likely than not, Brady was at least generally aware of the intentional deflation. On May 11, Brady was suspended for four games by the NFL for his involvement based on [...] "substantial and credible evidence" [...] that Brady knew Patriots employees were deflating footballs and that he failed {{to cooperate with the}} investigators. On May 11, Troy Vincent—NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations—penned a letter to Brady that stated in part: [...] "Your actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football." [...] Vincent's letter further stated: [...] "With respect to your particular involvement, the report established that there is substantial and credible evidence to conclude <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> least generally aware of the actions of the Patriots' employees involved in the deflation of the footballs and that it was unlikely that their actions were done without your knowledge. Moreover, the report documents your failure to cooperate fully and candidly with the investigation, including by refusing to produce any relevant electronic evidence (emails, texts, etc.), despite being offered extraordinary safeguards by the investigators to protect unrelated personal information, and by providing testimony that the report concludes was not plausible and contradicted by other evidence." [...] Brady, through the NFL Players Association, officially appealed the suspension on May 14.|$|E
2500|$|The stadium {{has also}} been criticized for its lack of fan noise. During a Sunday Night Baseball {{telecast}} in 2012, commentator and former Red Sox manager Terry Francona spoke about the different atmospheres in {{the old and new}} stadiums saying that [...] "As a visiting team, especially for the Red Sox, by the time the (national) anthem was over, you couldn't wait {{to get back in the}} dugout. Now (there is) a little different (kind) of fan sitting around down there by the dugout." [...] Games at the new stadium do not feature the same deafening crowd moments and often sound eerily silent. The lack of fan noise was noticeable in the 2012 playoffs as well, with thousands of unsold seats for Game 5 of the ALDS and Games 1 and 2 of the ALCS. [...] "This is a very easy place to play now", said Quintin Berry of the Detroit Tigers, the Yankees' ALCS opponents. [...] "Coming from Oakland, the fans there were so rowdy. It was easier to come here." [...] In his autobiography [...] "The Closer", the Yankees' longtime relief pitcher Mariano Rivera wrote these comments about the new stadium's atmosphere: [...] "It doesn’t hold noise, or home-team fervor, anywhere near the way the old place did. The old Stadium was our 10th man—a loud and frenzied cauldron of pinstriped passion, with a lot of lifers in the stands. Maybe I’m wrong, but it's hard to see that the new place can ever quite duplicate that. Derek Jeter echoed this sentiment in a September 2014 article in New York magazine, Jeter said he missed the original Yankee Stadium: [...] "It was a different feel. The new stadium, it's second to none—all the amenities. For the players, it really doesn’t get any better. The old stadium, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the stadium, in the stands, the only place you could see the game was in your seat. Now there's so many suites and places people can go. So a lot of times it looks like it's empty, but it's really not. The old stadium, it was more intimidating. The fans were right on top of you." ...|$|E
