60|$|What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> Why, he was {{rolled over}} {{on to his}} feet so gently that he just gasped with surprise. It didn't seem {{possible}} that such a great paw could be so gentle.|$|E
60|$|Oh, dear! what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> A wasp {{flew out}} and stung her lips; then both wasp and box vanished, and May {{was left to}} cry alone, with a sharp pain in the lips that said the unkind words.|$|E
6000|$|How {{the fellow}} {{came to be}} a {{shipowner}} {{at the same time}} was quite a tale. He came out third in a home ship nearly fifteen years ago, Captain Eliott remembered, and got paid off after a bad sort of row both with his skipper and his chief. Anyway, they seemed jolly glad {{to get rid of him}} at all costs. Clearly a mutinous sort of chap. Well, he remained out here, a perfect nuisance, everlastingly shipped and unshipped, unable to keep a berth very long; pretty nigh went through every engine-room afloat belonging to the colony. Then suddenly, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened,</b> Harry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Why?' I says. 'Never you mind,' says he. 'Well, who is he?' I asks. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happens</b> then? He <b>thinks</b> {{hard for}} a spell, rolls his eyes, and says: 'Search me. I've forgotten.' 'Know where he lives?' I asks him. 'Nope,' he says.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> ladies?" [...] {{and she sat}} herself down, filling an arm-chair {{with her}} goodly person. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> has <b>happened</b> to me to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|ALICE. 'Take care, Amy, or I shall {{begin to}} believe that your father was right. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> would <b>happen</b> if I were to leave you to him!' ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{knowing what}} to do the poor magpie had to agree, and flying back, with a heavy heart, he threw one of his young ones out of the nest. The fox seized it in his mouth and ran off in triumph, while the magpie, though deeply grieved for the loss of his little one, found some comfort in the thought that only a bird of {{extraordinary}} wisdom would have dreamed of saving the rest by the sacrifice of the one. But what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> Why, a few days later, Michael the fox might have been seen sitting under the very same tree, and a dreadful pang shot through the heart of the magpie as he peeped at him from a hole in the nest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, if you haven't {{taken any}} of Gumley's pills you don't know what you've missed," [...] went on Spud, {{with a wink}} at the others. [...] "Why, {{there was a man}} over in Rottenberg who was flat on his back with half a dozen fatal diseases. The doctors gave him just three days to live,--three days, think of it! His wife nearly cried her eyes out. Then along came this Gumley man with a trunk full of his Red Pills for Red-Blooded People. He didn't exactly know if the dying man was red-blooded or not, but he took a chance and gave the fellow sixteen pills, four after breakfast, four after dinner, four after supper and four on retiring, and the next day, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> That man {{got up and went to}} work, and he's been at his Job ever since." ...|$|E
60|$|What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened</b> this morning? Two wedding-presents arrived. The {{first was}} a very nice fish slice and fork in a case. It was from dear old Mrs. Jones Beyrick, on whom we really had no claim whatever. We all think it so kind of her, and such a nice fish-slice. The other was a {{beautiful}} travelling-bag from Uncle Arthur. Stamped in gold upon it were the letters M.C., I said, 'Oh, what a pity! They have put the wrong initials.' That made mamma laugh. I suppose one soon gets used to it. Fancy how you would feel if it were the other way about, and you changed your name to mine. They might call you Selby, but you would continue to feel Crosse. I didn't mean that for a joke, but women make jokes without intending it. The other day the curate drove up in his donkey-cart, and mother said, 'Oh, what a nice tandem!' I think that she meant to say 'turn- out'; but papa said it was the neatest thing he had heard for a long time, so mamma is very pleased, but I am sure that she does not know even now why it should be so funny.|$|E
60|$|AMAH. More {{better you}} stay here, Daisy. Perhaps {{you get into}} trouble if you go out. They ask you why you go out,--why <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{something}} <b>happen</b> to your husband.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> has <b>happened?</b> The ground {{looks very}} much cut up," [...] {{she said in a}} {{confidential}} tone, as new to her as her previous observation of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> has <b>happened</b> to Basil?" [...] asked Dorian, {{holding up}} his Burgundy against the light, and {{wondering}} how {{it was that he}} could discuss the matter so calmly.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{occasion}} {{seems to}} bring that something out," [...] the lawyer remarked. [...] "When I proposed the separation, and mentioned my reasons, I expected to find some difficulty in persuading Mrs. Presty {{to give up the}} adventurous journey with her daughter and her grandchild. I reminded her that she had friends in London who would receive her, and got snubbed for taking the liberty. 'I know that as well as you do. Come along--I'm ready to go with you.' It isn't agreeable to my self-esteem to own it, but I expected to hear her say that she would consent to any sacrifice for the sake of her dear daughter. No such clap-trap as that passed her lips. She owned the true motive with a superiority to cant which won my sincerest respect. 'I'll do anything,' she said, 'to baffle Herbert Linley and the spies he has set to watch us.' I can't tell you how glad I was that she had her reward on the same day. We were too late at the station, and we had to wait for the next train. And what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> The two scoundrels followed us instead of following Mrs. Linley! They had inquired no doubt at the livery stables where we hired the carriage--had recognized the description of us--and had taken the long journey to London for nothing. Mrs. Presty and I shook hands at the terminus the best friends that ever traveled together with the best of motives. After that, I think I deserve another glass of wine." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{think all}} {{of the stuff that}} you've heard at this point has been from one side of this, and it's been {{somebody}} putting spin on it, like, 'here's what happened.' No, that's your version of what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened.</b> I haven't heard from anybody yet that actually sat in the room. There are quite a few folks at Human Head that I really like. Chris Rhinehart is one of the nicest guys I have ever met in this industry. He's somebody I would consider a friend. I love hanging out with him. This isn't anything to do with anything personal. I love that guy. I like a lot of the folks up there. It just has to do more with what the product looks like and if it's good enough. As we said in our last update, it's not good enough. It's not where it needs to be. When we have more info than that, we'll let you know.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Sitting {{here by the}} fire, you and me, as one to another, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> will <b>happen</b> {{after the}} war? Are we {{to go back to}} being as we were?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shot at us!" [...] {{burst out}} the ruffled Kid. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think's</b> been <b>happening?</b> <b>Think</b> an {{aeroplane}} ran into my ear and took {{half of it}} off? Think the noise was somebody opening bottles of pop? Think those guys that sneaked off down the road was just training for a Marathon?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Robert Barnard: [...] "Bravura {{performance}} on a classic situation. St Mary Mead regulars figure in the case, pleasantly diversified by fashionable seaside hotel guests and the film crowd. If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> what <b>happens</b> to the body after death is unlikely, try the more 'realistic' P.D. James' An Unsuitable Job for a Woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thomasin here broke in, still weeping: [...] "He said he {{was only}} going on a sudden short journey; but if so why did he want so much money? O, Clym, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> will <b>happen?</b> I am afraid that you, my poor baby, will soon have no father left to you!" ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with ESPN {{in the fall of}} 2009, Gardner described his passion for the quarterback position: [...] "With me, you better prepare for everything <b>you</b> <b>think</b> could <b>happen</b> because anything can happen when I've got the ball in my hands. I've got the ball in my hands every play, and it's my show." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Jimmy,' {{cried the}} Boy Novelist, 'what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> has <b>happened!</b> A black cat {{has just come}} into my apartment.

6000|$|... "I do like pretty {{clothes and}} think I'd {{like to meet}} smart people. The trouble is, they would know I didn't belong where they belonged and might leave me out. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that would <b>happen,</b> Jim?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Sean has {{deteriorated}} {{to the point}} of dementia. David is helping with his writing and deceiving the studio into thinking that Sean is still able to work. Fuzzy tries to get Howard a movie role but the producer refuses to cast him because of the rumor that he has AIDS. The same rumor got him fired from his role on Other People. Paul is back in the hospital following a seizure. David takes Sean for a walk but has to take him home when Sean urinates in a fountain at a park in front of a woman with her two young children. That night Willy catches Fuzzy checking himself for swollen glands and they talk about their fear of dying. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happens</b> when we die?" [...] Fuzzy asks. [...] "We get to have sex again" [...] is Willy's reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not, I beg," [...] said Mr. Lavender, [...] "remind {{me of that}} episode. I {{sometimes}} think," [...] he went on as dreamily as his hunger would permit, [...] "that {{being forced}} to deprive oneself awakens one's worst passions; that is, of course, speaking rather as a man than a public man.

6000|$|While {{the family}} {{were in this}} confusion, Charlotte Lucas came {{to spend the day}} with them.

What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> has <b>happened</b> this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him." ...|$|R
3000|$|... ‘The lesson I {{have planned}} {{will help the}} {{children}} to use {{a wide range of}} Tough’s language functions. The Picture talk activity, which is similar to Newstelling, encourages the children to report on past and present experiences, and also projecting and predicting (e.g. ‘How do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the shells feel when they get washed up on the beach?’ ‘What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> would <b>happen</b> if there were a creature living in the shell and it got washed up on the beach?’). Through questioning the children they may use many of Tough’s language functions.|$|R
40|$|What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happens</b> when we die? “Hecate is {{the goddess}} of death…” “Either you are reborn or you {{dissolve}} into nothingness…” “Maggot food!” “They go to heaven. ” These {{are only a few}} of the answers provided by CB’s friends as he mourns the death of his pet beagle. In “Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead,” an unauthorized parody of the Peanuts comic strip by Charles Schulz, playwright Bert V. Royal continues Charlie Brown’s (CB’s) story into adolescence where the beloved blockhead – an icon of American youth – encounters modern threats to childhood’s innocence. Loss of Innocence jumps into Royal’s world and explores how teenage students address alcohol, drugs, sexual activity, and prejudice on a daily basis. The project looks into our generations’ views of morality, insignificance, and rejection – hoping to bridge gaps based on religion, gender, and social differences. This poster presentation outlines Royal’s play, the SIUC staged performance, and the director’s vision that inspired the production...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> had <b>{{happened}}?</b> Why, Mr. Man's boy Tommy's dog Towser {{had happened}} along {{just in the}} nick of time, so far as I was concerned, and dear me! how he was jumping into Mr. Foxy Fox! Talk about fighting! I never heard such a row. As I afterward learned, nearly every member of our club was awakened by the racket, and you might have searched them all without finding anything like pity for Foxy.|$|R

30|$|Personality was {{assessed}} among 79 adolescents {{at one point}} in time using the NEO Personality Inventory—Revised (NEO-PI-R) and the temperament and character inventory (TCI). Six months later, adolescents were asked to write down the most positive or the most negative event that had happened to them in the last 3  months. Adolescents were explicitly instructed to answer the following questions within their narratives: What happened? Who were involved? Why do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it <b>happened?</b> How did you feel when it <b>happened?</b> How do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the involved persons felt? The descriptions were quantified using a computational method in which the latent semantic analysis algorithm generates a semantic representation of the narratives.|$|R

60|$|When {{he reached}} the tall hickory tree, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> was <b>happening?</b> Why, those big, fat nuts were {{rattling}} {{down to the ground}} on every side, just as if Old Mother West Wind was shaking the tree as hard as she could. But Old Mother West Wind wasn't there at all. No, Sir, there wasn't even one of the Merry Little Breezes up in the tree-tops. The big fat nuts were rattling down just on account of the dreadful quarrel of Striped Chipmunk's two foolish cousins, Happy Jack and Chatterer.|$|R
