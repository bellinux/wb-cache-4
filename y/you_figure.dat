5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. <b>You</b> <b>figure</b> out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} social network, they called it microblogging, {{but it was hard}} to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time <b>you</b> <b>figure</b> out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E
500|$|In another article, Jocelyn Vena from MTV News {{thought that}} the video was [...] "the perfect homage" [...] to the singer's Sex book and her Erotica (1992) days, {{describing}} it as [...] "crunchy, sexy and edgy". Idolator's X. Alexander compared {{the concept of the}} video, along with its scenes of homoeroticism, to her 1990 music videos for [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Justify My Love". Sophie A. Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter noted references to the music video for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] (1989). E! contributor Nathalie Finn commented: [...] "Madonna doesn't need a song to tell us she's ready to dance all night—just one look at her and <b>you</b> <b>figure</b> she could outlast the average partyer under any circumstances". She added that the references to her old work, as well as the half-nude men indicated that [...] "it isn't just the girls 'who wanna have some fun'." ...|$|E

500|$|Enema of the State {{has been}} called an {{accurate}} representation of middle-class teenage life, especially {{at the time of}} its release. Entertainment Weekly called it the [...] "perfect encapsulation of the American adolescent male mind-set circa 1999." [...] Nitsuh Abebe of New York describes the immense popularity of the record with adolescents in an article measuring its influence: [...] "After <b>you</b> <b>figure</b> in singles, videos, CD-R burns, copies on repeat in friends' cars and finished basements, this was apparently enough to create blanket immersion among America's twenty-some million teenagers." [...] Alternative Press has ranked Enema of the State among Jerry Finn's top production work, and UK-based music magazine Rock Sound rated it number 2 on their list of [...] "101 Modern Classics" [...] in 2012, writing, [...] "Enema didn't just bring pop-punk to the masses, it marked a complete shift in how music television, radio and the world at large viewed it." [...] In 2011, The New York Times credited the record with [...] " [...] punk's already playful core and [...] it a shiny, accessible polish," [...] calling it [...] "among the catchiest music of the time." [...] "In a literal sense, many indie bands evolved not from Velvet Underground or Sonic Youth, but Smash, Dookie, or Enema of the State—records that served as beginner's manuals and inspired musicians in great numbers to buy their first guitar," [...] said Ian Cohen of Pitchfork Media in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Pinto's {{first film}} of 2015 was Terrence Malick's Knight of Cups, an {{experimental}} film that featured an ensemble cast including Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman, and Antonio Banderas. She played Helen, a model with whom Bale embarks on a [...] "dalliance". She talked about acting without a script: [...] "It {{is definitely a}} bit nerve-racking {{on the first day}} because you don't know where you are going to go. But once <b>you</b> <b>figure</b> that out, then it doesn't really matter. It is actually very relaxing. It is fun and liberating. It is an experience that I completely embrace". Premiering at the competition section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, the film received average to mixed reviews from critics. The film was released in the United States in March 2016. She was among the 100 narrators of Unity (2015), a documentary that explores the relationships between Earth's species. Her third release of that year was the Colombian action film Blunt Force Trauma, in which she starred opposite Ryan Kwanten and Mickey Rourke as a woman looking for her brother's murderer. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter criticised the film, stating that it [...] "takes itself much more seriously than viewers will." [...] In 2015, Pinto worked on Andy Serkis' Jungle Book, a motion capture adventure fantasy film based on Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. She will portray Mowgli's adoptive mother in the film.|$|E
2500|$|Butler was {{scheduled}} to have made his directorial debut in January 1979 with Adrift & Beyond, but it never came to fruition. Butler turned down Coppola's offer to direct the photography for Apocalypse Now (1979). Butler has worked in films during the 2000s, such as Frailty (2002) and Funny Money (2006). Bill Paxton, {{the director of the}} former film, said, [...] "I was excited when Bill Butler who was the cinematographer on such classic films as Jaws and The Conversation came aboard as my director of photography for Frailty. And I really picked his brain, always asking 'how did you do this shot?' and 'how did <b>you</b> <b>figure</b> that out?'" [...] Bill Butler recounts his initial conversations with Paxton about the script: [...] "I liked the direction he wanted to take, and he inspired me to share his vision. It was a great collaboration." ...|$|E

2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the first thing you do is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. <b>You</b> <b>figure,</b> the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, the Lakers won {{the title}} again; however, O'Neal and Bryant began feuding during the season. O'Neal came into {{training}} camp out of shape, which disappointed Jackson and also Bryant, who worked hard over the offseason {{to improve his}} game. Bryant was leading the league in scoring as 2001 began, and Jackson said Bryant was playing the best ball of his career. O'Neal was shooting below 50 percent during stretches, and his free throw shooting was in the 20 percent range. O'Neal said of the Lakers in January, [...] "When {{it was clear that}} everything went through me, the outcome of it was (a record of) 67–15, playing with enthusiasm, the city jumping up and down and a parade. And now we're 23–11. <b>You</b> <b>figure</b> it out ... I don't know why anybody else would want to change – other than selfish reasons." [...] Bryant responded that it was a different year and the roster had undergone some changes and [...] "things change, things evolve, {{and you just have to}} grow with that change." [...] Lakers assistant coach Bill Bertka said a key factor was the team's defense after losing Fisher for most of the season. O'Neal requested a trade after a blowout win against the Phoenix Suns where Bryant scored 38 and O'Neal scored 18. Jackson commented that their actions were [...] "juvenile" [...] and they should appreciate each other and play as a team. Bryant would be criticized for forcing his offense and not involving his teammates enough. Even O'Neal's stepfather was overheard yelling at Bryant to pass the ball during a game. Bryant told Jackson that the [...] "(triangle) offense is so simple. It doesn't display my talent ... it doesn't give me what I have to have for my game." [...] According to Bryant, the team's defense was the issue and not his increased role in the offense. [...] Bryant said that [...] "scoring shouldn't affect (O'Neal's) defense", while O'Neal maintained that [...] "if the big dog ain't me, then the house won't get guarded – period." [...] Due to O'Neal's sensitivity toward criticism, Jackson overlooked O'Neal's shortcomings while maintaining his criticism of Bryant. West told O'Neal that he also had personal rivalries when he played with all-time greats Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor, but O'Neal needed to [...] "stop being a baby ... put the team's success first." ...|$|E

"Yes," [...] Grace continued, [...] "it seems familiar--as {{though you}} and I had ridden {{together}} {{through such a}} country once before; I even seem to know those great redwoods well.

5000|$|Jeff Giles in the New York Times Book Review is full in his praise [...] "Pobby and Dingan is an {{enormously}} touching, imaginative and unexpected novel that just glows {{in your hands}} ...

5000|$|Siskel & Ebert {{originally}} {{thought they would}} have to miss reviewing the film as they could not get a screening but, as Ebert explained, [...] "... a strange thing started to happen. People started telling me they really liked Val Kilmer's performance in Tombstone, and I heard this every where I went. When you hear this once or twice, it's interesting, when you hear it a couple of dozen times, it's a trend. And when you read that Bill Clinton loved the performance, <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> <b>you</b> better catch up with the movie." [...] Ultimately, Ebert recommended the movie while Siskel did not.|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> must <b>figure</b> {{the street}} full of running figures, of doors {{slamming}} and fights for hiding-places. <b>You</b> must <b>figure</b> the tumult suddenly striking on the unstable equilibrium of old Fletcher's planks and two chairs--with cataclysmic results. <b>You</b> must <b>figure</b> an appalled couple caught dismally in a swing. And {{then the whole}} tumultuous rush has passed and the Iping street with its gauds and flags is deserted save for the still raging unseen, and littered with cocoanuts, overthrown canvas screens, and the scattered stock in trade of a sweetstuff stall. Everywhere there is a sound of closing shutters and shoving bolts, and the only visible humanity is an occasional flitting eye under a raised eyebrow {{in the corner of}} a window pane.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{have some}} {{pleasure}} in telling you. Soon {{after the last}} snow fell, two rustlers came up this trail--there were more of them, but they stayed down by the big one.
