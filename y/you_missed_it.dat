500|$|Lacroix {{felt that}} with Unbreakable TNA [...] "truly {{cemented}} the formula needed for delivering great pay per views." [...] He concluded with [...] "TNA's Unbreakable PPV was an astounding buffet of action, {{catering to the}} variety of tastes among professional wrestling fans." [...] Lacroix also commented [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> get the replay. Don't think, just do it [...] the main event is well worth the price." [...] The main event was given Lacroix's highest match rating of 10 out of 10 in his review. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to the opening Six Man Tag Team match. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout was ranked with a 7.5 out of 10, while a 7 out of 10 {{was given to the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship contest. Commenting on the main event, Lacroix spoke of it as a [...] "certified match of the year candidate." [...] Going onto describe in detail: [...] "Unbreakable came to a close with mind-boggling main event, featuring a three-way dance between Samoa Joe against AJ Styles against X Division champion Christopher Daniels for the championship title. Now, this is the part where I go into a detail review of the match, but I'm not going to that. Fact is there is no review that could do justice in describing just how stellar this bout was." [...] Regarding the Four Way Elimination match, Lacroix believed Johnny Candido's participation was [...] "a nice gesture", but wonder [...] "if they could have come up with something else, preferably outside of the match." ...|$|E
6000|$|The purser said, [...] "Mr. Smith, <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> {{further than}} any man on board. We {{traveled}} two hundred and eight miles yesterday." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't be satirical, but congratulate {{yourself}} on your opportunity of seeing an awfully funny gathering. I wouldn't have <b>you</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it</b> for the world. It's the most characteristic thing out." ...|$|R
5000|$|A typical joke of Vernon's: [...] "We {{lived in}} a small town built on a one-way street. If <b>you</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> have to drive {{all the way around the}} world to get back" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{interrupt}} <b>you,</b> <b>miss.</b> <b>It's</b> true that I {{ran away}} into the garden. I can guess who followed me. How did she find her way to me and Mr. Morris, in the dark?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you catch}} it?" [...] said the face, reappearing. [...] "Dear me, <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it!</b> Never mind. You {{can get it}} at the grocer's. Ask for Bailey's Granulated Breakfast Chips. Tootles takes them for breakfast with a little milk. Be certain to get Bailey's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look," [...] said he, {{pointing}} to the west; [...] "did you ever see such a setting sun as that? Did you ever see such blood-red colour?" [...] The light was very wonderful, for the sun had just gone down and all the western heavens were crimson with its departing glory. In the few moments that they stood there gazing it might almost have been believed that some portentous miracle had happened, so deep and dark, and yet so bright, were the hues of the horizon. It seemed as though the lands below the hill were bathed in blood. The elm trees interrupted their view, {{so that they could}} only look out through the spaces between their trunks. [...] "Come to the stile," [...] said he. [...] "If you were to live a thousand years you might never again see such a sunset as that. You would never forgive yourself if <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> just that you might save three minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Truth is, Daun's was an {{intricate}} case just now; needing, above all things, swiftness of treatment; what, of all things, {{it could not}} get from Daun. His denunciations on that burnt Suburb were again loud; but Schmettau continues deaf to all that,--means [...] "to defend himself by the known rules of war and of honor;" [...] declares, he [...] "will dispute from street to street, and only finish {{in the middle of}} Polish Majesty's Royal Palace." [...] Denunciation will do nothing! Daun had above 100,000 men in those parts. Rushing forward with sharp shot and bayonet storm, instead of logical denunciation, it is probable Daun might have settled his Schmettau. But the hour of tide was rigorous, withal;--and such an ebb, if <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> in hesitating! NOVEMBER 15th, Daun withdrew; the ebbing come. That same day, Friedrich was at Lauban in the Lausitz, within a hundred miles again; speeding hitherward; behind him a Silesia brushed clear, before him a Saxony to be brushed. [...] "Reason weighty" [...] enough, think Daun and the Austrian Gazettes! But such, since you have missed the tide-hour, is the inexorable fact of ebb,--going at that frightful rate. Daun never was the man to dispute facts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, thank <b>you,</b> <b>miss!</b> <b>It's</b> ever so good. I'll {{take the}} berries to your mother, {{and bring her}} more {{whenever}} she likes," [...] said the child gratefully, as she walked away munching the gingerbread, and smiling till there were little rainbows in her tears.|$|R
5000|$|Christine Horton of Den of Geek wrote, [...] "Ultimately, 'Blind Love' {{is a bit}} of a {{throwaway}} episode, and if <b>you</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it,</b> it won't {{make any}} difference to the rest of the season. But you can't help but feel like this is one final hurrah before things take a much darker turn for the remainder of the season." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Baby Blossom," [...] said Old Man Shaw falteringly, [...] "are you {{quite sure}} you'll be {{contented}} here? Out there"--with a vague sweep {{of his hand}} towards horizons that shut out a world far removed from White Sands--"there's pleasure and excitement and all that. Won't <b>you</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it?</b> Won't <b>you</b> get tired of your old father and White Sands?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't {{do not to}} see that, Kitty," [...] said Mrs. Ellison, who, as usual, had {{arranged}} {{the details of the}} excursion, and now announced them. [...] "It's one of the principal things here, and your Uncle Jack would never be satisfied if <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it.</b> In fact, it's a shame to have left it so long. I can't go with you, for I'm saving up my strength for our picnic at Château-Bigot to-morrow; and I want you, Kitty, to see that the colonel sees everything. I've had trouble enough, goodness knows, getting the facts together for him." [...] This was as Kitty and Mr. Arbuton sat waiting in Mrs. Ellison's parlor for the delinquent colonel, who had just stepped round to the Hôtel St. Louis and was to be back presently. But the moment of his return passed; a quarter-hour of grace; a half-hour of grim magnanimity,--and still no colonel. Mrs. Ellison began by saying that it was perfectly abominable, and left herself, in a greater extremity, with nothing more forcible to add than that it was too provoking. [...] "It's getting so late now," [...] she said at last, [...] "that it's no use waiting any longer, if you mean to go at all, to-day; and to-day's the only day you can go. There, you'd better drive on without him. I can't bear to have you miss it." [...] And, thus adjured, the younger people rose and went.|$|E

5000|$|In {{one of the}} few {{negative}} reviews, Hank Stuever of The Washington Post {{said that}} Mad Men [...] "has importance sickness, and its idea of levity is to inject moments of utter callousness." [...] Stuever lamented that once [...] "a TV show was just a TV show. It was on when it was on; if <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it.</b> You certainly wouldnt build your life around talking about it or telling other grownups they had to watch old episodes of it in order to catch up.

2500|$|... "Photography is {{not like}} painting," [...] Cartier-Bresson told the Washington Post in 1957. [...] "There is a {{creative}} {{fraction of a second}} when you are taking a picture.
