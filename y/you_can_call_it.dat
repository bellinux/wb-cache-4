500|$|As governor, Huntsman listed {{economic}} development, health-care reform, education, {{and energy}} security as his top priorities. He oversaw {{tax cuts and}} advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so {{that the government would}} not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down. In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, [...] "I'm comfortable with a requirement – <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> whatever you want, but at some point we're {{going to have to get}} serious about how we deal with this issue".|$|E
500|$|Nevermind was {{mastered}} on {{the afternoon}} of August 2 at The Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California. Howie Weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the appointed time in the studio; by the time Nirvana, Andy Wallace, and Gary Gersh arrived, Weinberg had mastered most of the album. One of the songs mastered at the session, a hidden track called [...] "Endless, Nameless" [...] intended to appear at the end of [...] "Something in the Way", was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album. Weinberg recalled, [...] "In the beginning, {{it was kind of a}} verbal thing to put that track at the end. Maybe I misconstrued their instructions, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> my mistake if you want. Maybe I didn't write it down when Nirvana or the record company said to do it. So, when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so CDs, albums, and cassettes, it wasn't on there." [...] When the band discovered the song's omission after listening to its copy of the album, Cobain called Weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake. Weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of [...] "Something in the Way" [...] and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album.|$|E

[...] Meelz of ThisGoesIn concluded that [...] "Numb" [...] is a single quality track, [...] "which we can see seeping through the radio {{in the latter half}} of 2012– with the mantra of letting your problems go and dance." [...] The Lanterns Alex Antonetz wrote that both [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Euphoria" [...] are future Charlie Bear fare. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush commented that the song is perfect for the clubs. Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labeled [...] "Numb" [...] together with [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as essential tracks on Looking 4 Myself. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust wrote that the single's production is appropriate for an Usher and Swedish House Mafia collaboration, though criticised its lack of originality. Despite this, Unterberger commended the song, writing [...] "it does have the mind-numbing, body-activating effect the song is so explicitly searching for" [...] and even though <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> [...] "an EDM cash-in [...] Usher was embracing club music way before most of his American pop star peers hopped on the bandwagon".|$|E

500|$|The Braves {{opened the}} third inning with {{back-to-back}} singles by Ozzie Virgil and Terry Blocker. Hershiser responded by striking out opposing pitcher Rick Mahler and Ron Gant and then retiring Jeff Blauser on a flyball to left. In the seventh inning, a double by Andrés Thomas was followed with an error by Franklin Stubbs, giving the Braves runners at first and third. Hershiser loaded the bases with an intentional walk before retiring Mahler and Gant again. Gant's flyball sent Gibson to the outfield wall. Hershiser felt this was his worst outing of his six consecutive complete games saying: [...] "It was the worst I've thrown {{in the last five}} or six starts,...I was really inconsistent. I didn't have good stuff or location. I couldn't establish a pattern. I had to work hard adjusting and got away with pitches I wouldn't have if I was going badly." [...] The Dodgers' only run came in the ninth inning on what newspapers described as a successful hit and run play in which Mike Marshall on a 2-2 count doubled Kirk Gibson in from first base. However, as recalled by Marshall: [...] "Let me tell you, it wasn't a hit-and-run. [...] Gibby was probably going with two strikes. [...] We never would hit-and-run with us. [...] <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a run-and-hit." [...] Orel and wife Jamie, scheduled induced labor for the following day, an off day for the Dodgers.|$|E

2500|$|In {{its early}} days, Rutgers athletes were known informally as [...] "The Scarlet" [...] in {{reference}} to the school color, or as [...] "Queensmen" [...] {{in reference to}} the institution's first name, Queen's College. In 1925, the mascot was changed to Chanticleer, a fighting rooster from the medieval fable Reynard the Fox (Le Roman de Renart) which was used by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales. At the time, the student humour magazine at Rutgers was called Chanticleer, and one of its early arts editors, Ozzie Nelson (later of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet fame) was quarterback of the Rutgers team from 1924 to 1926. The Chanticleer mascot was unveiled at a football game against Lafayette College, in which Lafayette was also introducing a new mascot, a leopard. However, the choice of Chanticleer as a mascot was often the subject of ridicule because of its association with [...] "being chicken." [...] In 1955, the mascot was changed to the Scarlet Knight after a campus-wide election, beating out other contenders such as [...] "Queensmen", the [...] "Scarlet", the [...] "Red Lions", the [...] "Redmen" [...] and the [...] "Flying Dutchmen." [...] Earlier proposed nicknames included [...] "Pioneers" [...] and [...] "Cannoneers". When Harvey Harman, then coach of the football team, was asked why he supported changing the Rutgers mascot, he was quoted as saying, [...] "You can call it the Chanticleer, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a fighting cock, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> any damn thing you want, but everybody knows it's a chicken." [...] Harman later is said to have bought the first [...] "Scarlet Knight" [...] mascot costume for the 1955 season, which was to be his final season as football coach at Rutgers.|$|E

About the compositions from the war, he wrote: 'My work from this period has got a sort of gravity, a doggedness here and there, which makes it clearly to realize as grown amid disasters. For me, personally, that is the ethical significance of it: they are constructions of the mind, in a time that 'mind' (if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>call</b> <b>it</b> that way) is used almost exclusively for destructive purposes.’ ...|$|R

[...] His method of making the anime more realistic normally includes smaller and weaker robots as compared to giant robots. Also, he used trucks to transport the robots in his show instead of having them walk long distances. He commented on the size of the robot that 4 metres is the limit in size where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>call</b> <b>it</b> something that is piloted by the pilot instead of the pilot wearing a mechanical suit.|$|R
2500|$|Merrily We Roll Along (1981), {{with a book}} by George Furth, is one of Sondheim's more {{traditional}} scores; Frank Sinatra and Carly Simon have recorded songs from the musical. According to Sondheim's music director, Paul Gemignani, [...] "Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility." [...] Although Merrily closed after 16 performances, its score has been subsequently recorded. Martin Gottfried wrote, [...] "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs... But [...] {{that there is nothing}} ordinary about the music." [...] Sondheim and Furth have revised the show since its original production, and Sondheim later said: [...] "Did I feel betrayed? I'm not sure I would put it like that. What did surprise me was the feeling around the Broadway community – if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> that, though I guess I will {{for lack of a better}} word – that they wanted Hal and me to fail." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{summarizing}} the biographical works on Gandhi, Blema S. Steinberg concluded she was decidedly non-ideological. Only 7.4% (24) {{of the total}} 330 biographical extractions posit ideology {{as a reason for}} her policy choices. Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties. Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: [...] "I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term...we used the word [...] because it came closest to {{what we wanted to do}} here – which is to eradicate poverty. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all." [...] Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by Hindustan Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra as [...] "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century." [...] Her campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao (Eng: Remove Poverty), has become the iconic motto of the Indian National Congress. To the rural and urban poor, untouchables, minorities and women in India, Gandhi was [...] "Indira Amma or Mother Indira." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sara Firth, a London-based {{correspondent}} with RT {{resigned in}} protest over the network's {{coverage of the}} MH17 disaster. Shortly before resigning, she tweeted, [...] "RT style guide Rule 1: It is ALWAYS * Ukraine's fault (* add name as applicable)". She told the Guardian [...] "I walked into the newsroom {{and there was an}} eyewitness account making allegations [...] and analysis, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> from our correspondent in the studio. It was just appalling, {{in a situation like that}} where there are families waiting to be informed and a devastating loss of life." [...] She also noted that [...] "There is bias against Russia but you don’t counter wrong by doing even more wrong" [...] and stated [...] "I have always said it's better to have RT than to not have that perspective, but actually with a story like this and the way they misreport it, it's quite dangerous, I don’t want to be party to it." [...] In follow-up interview she said [...] "In Ukraine, you’re taking a very small part of a much wider story, totally omitted the context of the story, and so what you wind up with on air is outright misinformation." [...] Calling RT [...] "mass information manipulation" [...] Firth said [...] "they have a very clear idea in their mind of what they’re trying to prove." [...] She also stated that [...] "The worst-kept secret is that RT is blatant propaganda. I’m one in a very long line of people who have left for the same reason." ...|$|E

5000|$|The film's origins {{date back}} to 1992, when Pitt, who was not yet well-known, got a script from {{producer}} Lawrence Gordon; three years later, Pitt suggested Ford as Tom O'Meara, which {{at that time was}} more of a character role. Ford agreed, though that meant the script had to be rewritten to create a fuller role for Ford and a more complicated relationship between the characters played by the two men. It was Ford's suggestion to bring Pakula in as director. Principal photography started in February 1996, with the script [...] "still in flux"; according to The New York Times, [...] "ego clashes, budget overruns and long delays plagued the project." [...] Screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen was brought on board to provide rewrites to the script during filming. Pitt [...] "threatened to quit early in the shoot, complaining that the script was incomplete and incoherent" [...] and later [...] "denounced the movie as 'the most irresponsible bit of film making - if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> even <b>call</b> <b>it</b> that - that I've ever seen." ...|$|R
5000|$|James Parker of the New York Times {{noted in}} his review of Under the Dome that the novel {{contains}} lines that are [...] "stinkers", which made him feel [...] "the clutch of sorrow." [...] Regarding King's [...] "pulp speed" [...] output, James Parker noted: [...] "We shouldn’t be too squeamish about the odd half-baked simile or lapse into B-movie dialogue." [...] The review in the New York Post states that Under the Dome [...] "shares some of The Stand’s faults, like a left-field disaster ... that works almost as a Diabolus Ex Machina, randomly wiping out half the cast. In both novels, the climactic [...] "battle"—if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> really <b>call</b> <b>it</b> that—pales to the buildup. King is better at characters and situations than causes and reasons. But at least The Stand feels like a saga .... I won’t reveal {{the secret of the}} Dome, except to say that the payoff is more Star Trek (original series) than epic." [...] John Dugdale, in a review for The Sunday Times wrote: [...] "King's inability to raise his game—to relinquish the methods of his more straightforward tales of the paranormal—prevents you taking his socio-political vision seriously. The simple division of characters into goodies and baddies, the use of magic, the homespun style, the sentimental ending, the vital role played by a dog in defeating the forces of evil—all of these belong in fiction for older children, not the grown-up novels he's bent on emulating." ...|$|R

5000|$|Since its release, [...] "Jesus of Suburbia" [...] has {{received}} universal critical acclaim. People magazine called the song [...] "epic" [...] and a [...] "magnificent nine-minute rock opera." [...] It is often {{recognized as one}} of Green Day's greatest songs. It was voted the greatest Green Day song of all time in a Rolling Stone readers poll in September 2012. Magnet considered the song underrated, saying [...] "Some will look at this choice and sniff, “How the hell <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> that underrated?” ... But how in the world <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> “overrated” when the five-movement, nine-plus-minute song bobs and weaves its way through standard-issue pop punk (“Jesus Of Suburbia”), a piano-laced interlude (“City Of The Damned”), the slobbering, thundering middle section (“I Don’t Care”), acoustic mid-tempo connective tissue (“Dearly Beloved”) and an outsized, anthemic curtain call (the spectacularly good “Tales Of Another Broken Home”), all in service of a tale of bored rebellion as nuanced as Pete Townshend’s Quadrophenia and as powerful as any of Paul Westerberg’s snot-nosed teenage character studies?".|$|R
60|$|This was {{the sense}} that Mavering professed to have {{received}} from it, when he {{jumped out of the}} beach wagon in which he had preceded the other carriages through the weird forest lying between the fringe of farm fields and fishing-villages on the western shore of the island and these lonely coasts of the bay. As far as the signs of settled human habitation last, the road is the good hard country road of New England, climbing steep little hills, and presently leading through long tracts of woodland. But at a certain point beyond the furthest cottage you leave it, and plunge deep {{into the heart of the}} forest, vaguely traversed by the wheel-path carried through since the island was opened to summer sojourn. Road <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> remembering its curious pauses and hesitations when confronted with stretches of marshy ground, and its staggering progress over the thick stubble of saplings through which it is cut. The progress of teams over it is slow, but there is such joy of wildness in the solitudes it penetrates that; if the horses had any gait slower than a walk, one might still wish to stay them. It is a Northern forest, with the air of having sprang quickly up in the fierce heat and haste of the Northern summers. The small firs are set almost as dense as rye in a field, and in their struggle to the light they have choked one another so that there is a strange blight of death and defeat on all that vigour of life. Few of the trees have won any lofty growth; they seem to have died and fallen when they were about to outstrip the others in size, and from their decay a new sylvan generation riots rankly upward. The surface of the ground is thinly clothed with a deciduous undergrowth, above which are the bare, spare stems of the evergreens, and then their limbs thrusting into one another in a sombre tangle, with locks of long yellowish-white moss, like the grey pendants of the Southern pines, dripping from them and draining their brief life.|$|R

[...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune also gave the film two stars and said, [...] "I was disappointed as much as I was thrilled because 'The Lost World' lacks a staple of Steven Spielberg's adventure films: exciting characters. ... Even in the original 'Jurassic Park,' the dinosaurs - not to mention the human beings - had more distinct personalities than they have here. Save for superior special effects, 'The Lost World' comes off as recycled material." [...] Conversely, Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times saw improved character development over the original, saying, [...] "It seemed such a mistake in Jurassic Park to sideline early on its most interesting character, the brilliant, free-thinking and outspoken theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) with a broken leg, but in its most inspired stroke, The Lost World brings back Malcolm and places him front and center," [...] <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a pleasure to watch such wily pros as Goldblum and Attenborough spar with each other with wit and assurance." [...] The dinosaurs were even more developed as characters, with Stephen Holden of The New York Times saying, [...] "The Lost World, unlike Jurassic Park, humanizes its monsters in a way that E.T. would understand." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B grade; he remarked, [...] "Mr. T-Rex was cool in the first Spielberg flick, sure, but it wasn't until was in San Diego that things got crazy-cool.
