Go to the north, and you find him dwindled to a Duke of Lancaster; turn to the west of that north, and he pops upon you in the humble {{character}} of Earl of Chester. Travel a few miles on, the Earl of Chester disappears, and the King surprises you again as Count Palatine of Lancaster. If you travel beyond Mount Edgecombe, you find him once more in his incognito, and he is Duke of Cornwall... every one of those Principalities has the apparatus of a Kingdom for the jurisdiction over a few private estates, and the formality and charge of the Exchequer of Great Britain for collecting the rents of a country squire. Cornwall is the best of them.|$|E

There's been some lunar transient events reported {{in the vicinity of}} Aristarchus." [...] Astronomers in Bochum, West Germany, had observed a bright glow on the lunar surface—the same sort of eerie luminescence that has intrigued Moon watchers for centuries. The report was passed on to Houston and thence to the astronauts. Almost immediately, Michael Collins reported back: [...] "Hey, Houston, I'm looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and there's an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence." ...|$|E

She has credited Celia Franca, the Artistic Director, as being an important influence and coach during her development as a ballet dancer. She was promoted {{to the rank of}} principal dancer in 1965. Early in her career, she struggled with her weight. In an interview with Rose Eichenbaum, Van Hamel said, [...] "I think there is a small window in your career when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> control." [...] She explained she was [...] "about three pounds too heavy" [...] and used weight as [...] "a way of rebelling against all the forces that controlled my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor wanted Asgard in {{this film}} {{to have a more}} natural look than its predecessor. To achieve this, crews filmed the coast of Norway with an Arri Alexa camera for three days in a helicopter, {{capturing}} six hours of footage. Double Negative then embedded their CG rendering of Asgard on shots of the natural landscape. Double Negative visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, [...] "The benefit of that is that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> real world terrain to work with – so you have buildings that have to convey natural features. Then from there we went in there populating the terrain with different buildings." [...] For scenes taking place on Svartalfheim, production filmed in Iceland with Double Negative adding ruins, mountains, Dark Elf ships, and skies.|$|E
500|$|Michigan {{entered the}} game as the No. 5-ranked team in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. Media outlets {{projected}} the team as favorites to win the Big Ten conference, and as contenders for a national championship. Michigan featured a strong senior class of offensive tackle Jake Long, tailback Mike Hart, and quarterback Chad Henne, each of whom had decided {{to stay in school}} rather than declare eligibility for the NFL Draft. The players attributed their decision to several factors, such as Michigan having lost their last three games to rival Ohio State and the Wolverines' streak of three consecutive bowl losses. The three also desired to finish their college careers on a high note. Mark Schlabach of ESPN.com stated that [...] ", along with receivers Mario Manningham and Adrian Arrington, gives Michigan what could potentially {{be one of the most}} explosive offenses in college football". Prior to the season, the team named Hart and Long as captains, along with linebacker Shawn Crable, a fifth-year senior. [...] Michigan aimed to open the game in a three-receiver formation, which has the potential to spread the opposing defense out; Michigan coach Lloyd Carr noted that [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> of the skill that we have at the wide receiver positions and can spread a defense out, that's [...] positive." [...] At the same time, Michigan was anticipated to run only a limited selection of plays from this set, to limit the ability of their upcoming opponents to develop an effective game plan against them. Michigan's defense, which led the FBS in run defense in 2006, lost seven starters from the previous season, including four All-Americans (cornerback Leon Hall and defensive linemen Alan Branch, David Harris, and LaMarr Woodley), each of whom were drafted in the first two rounds of the 2007 NFL Draft. Wolverines linebacker Chris Graham, a senior, expected the defense to be defined by speed, noting that each position on the defense was [...] "loaded in speed".|$|E

To survive you have to grow. To grow you have to diversify... When a company is diversified into various fields, it is rarely seriously vulnerable to {{the ups and downs}} that ravage individual business.

2500|$|Additionally, in {{the same}} addendum, a {{critical}} analysis of their work made by post-doc Urs Schreiber, and affirmed by the Bogdanovs as [...] "very accurate", was included {{with the exception of}} the concluding remark [...] "Just to make sure: I do not think that any of the above is valid reasoning", thus inverting the meaning from criticism into ostensible support. [...] Moreover, a comment by physicist Peter Woit written as, [...] "It's certainly possible that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> new worthwhile results on quantum groups", was translated as [...] "Il est tout à fait certain que vous avez obtenu des résultats nouveaux et utiles dans les groupes quantiques" [...] ("It is completely certain that you have obtained new and useful results on quantum groups") and published by the Bogdanovs in the addendum of their book.|$|E

2500|$|A {{day after}} the Columbine High School {{massacre}} in Littleton, Colorado on April 20, 1999, Stern's comments regarding the incident drew criticism from some listeners.

[...] Hundreds complained to KXPK, the show's affiliate in Denver. Stern argued his comments were taken out of context, and accused critics of being overly sensitive. [...] "I dared to ask if kids had sex. So what? That's how I think. I had zero intent to make fun of the situation. The point in making that comment was an attempt to try to understand a motive. We didn't know anything about motives [...] and were trying to consider all possibilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first line}} of the third quatrain extends the conceit of the Platonic theory, {{the idea that the}} {{perceptions}} of reality are merely reflections of the essential reality of forms. Platonic theory suggests that our perceptions are derived from this world of forms in the same way shadows are derived from the objects that are lit. The metaphor of shadow was often employed to help explain the illusory quality of perception and the reality of forms, both by Renaissance Platonists and by Plato himself in his book, Symposium. In the sonnet, spring can only offers shades of the beauty of the youth. The youth is presented as the ideal Beauty, the form, from which all other beautiful things come. This idea is summarized in line thirteen of the sonnet: [...] "In all external grace <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> part." [...] This line finds the youth to be the exclusive source of all beautiful things, expanding his [...] "domain" [...] even further than the first quatrains in which the youth {{is said to be the}} source of the legendary figures of Adonis and Helen.|$|E

Described as [...] "gripping", it is a [...] "story of personal growth". She had faced a lot of fear free soloing, BASE jumping and sky diving and felt that she could offer people advice about facing fear in general.
