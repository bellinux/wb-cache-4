One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>this</b> is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

500|$|Despite his {{scholarly}} {{achievements and}} the global importance of his work, Achebe never received a Nobel Prize, which some observers viewed as unjust. When Wole Soyinka was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature, Achebe joined the rest of Nigeria in celebrating the first African ever to win the prize. He lauded Soyinka's [...] "stupendous display of energy and vitality", {{and said he was}} [...] "most eminently deserving of any prize". In 1988 Achebe was asked by a reporter for Quality Weekly how he felt about never winning a Nobel Prize; he replied: [...] "My position is that the Nobel Prize is important. But it is a European prize. It's not an African prize... Literature is not a heavyweight championship. Nigerians may think, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>this</b> man has been knocked out. It's nothing to do with that." ...|$|E
500|$|By 4:00 in {{the morning}} the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or {{gathered}} nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be [...] "electricity in the air". One commented: [...] "There was a certain beauty {{in the aftermath of the}} riot... It was obvious, at least to me, that a lot of people really were gay and, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>this</b> was our street." [...] Thirteen people had been arrested. Some in the crowd were hospitalized, and four police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken. Inspector Pine had intended to close and dismantle the Stonewall Inn that night. Pay phones, toilets, mirrors, jukeboxes, and cigarette machines were all smashed, possibly in the riot and possibly by the police.|$|E

It's going to be the best one, I hope... Well, I would say that, but I really do feel that, and I feel this is going to be very different. This is Wolverine. This is not Popeye. He's kind of dark...

500|$|In any case, Biden {{would not}} run {{again for the}} {{presidency}} until his 2008 campaign, twenty years later. This time {{he made it to}} the Iowa caucuses, but withdrew after a poor showing. [...] Meanwhile, Biden and Kinnock had become close friends after the plagiarism incident. Meeting in August 2008, after Biden had been chosen by Democratic nominee Barack Obama as his running mate, Biden introduced Kinnock to his Senate staff by saying: “Hey, you people! Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> guy? He used to be my greatest speechwriter.” [...] Obama and Biden proceeded to win the general election against the Republican ticket of John McCain and Sarah Palin; Biden's 1988 campaign lapses were never a significant issue in the race, and Biden invited Kinnock to the inauguration. Additionally, Biden also won the Delaware Senate election the same year, and would've been the longest serving Senator in Delaware history, had the McCain/Palin ticket been elected. In 2015, Biden considered a possible 2016 presidential bid, but declined it on October 21, 2015, the same year his son Beau died of brain cancer. As his term expired in 2017, he is currently considering a possible presidential bid for the 2020 election.|$|E
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>this</b> is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
