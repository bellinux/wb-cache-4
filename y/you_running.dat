500|$|In {{the season}} opener at #12 California, he caught one pass for 28yards and made two rushing {{attempts}} for 16yards. Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To be honest with you, I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I think if you asked Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver [...] He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can hurt <b>you</b> <b>running</b> the ball or catching it. Everywhere you look, he's a problem." ...|$|E

2500|$|During Richard Nixon's presidency, critics accused Rather of biased {{coverage}} against him. At a Houston {{news conference}} in March 1974, Nixon fielded a question from Rather, still CBS's White House correspondent, who said, [...] "Thank you, Mr. President. Dan Rather, of CBS News." [...] The room filled with jeers and applause, prompting Nixon to joke, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>running</b> for something?" [...] Rather replied, [...] "No, sir, Mr. President. Are you?" [...] His question accused Nixon of not cooperating with grand jury investigation and House Judiciary Committee {{in relation to the}} Watergate scandal.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{scored the}} game 7.2 out of 10. He was {{critical}} of the general gameplay, which he argued [...] "quickly boils down to <b>you</b> <b>running</b> from room to room, killing anything that pops up along the way." [...] He was also critical of the creature design, which he felt was [...] "largely recycled from last year's game, which is disappointing. The way the monsters in the last game were based on various methods of execution was interesting, but retrofitting them to fit Baltimore street crime seems cheap." [...] He concluded [...] "The Suffering: Ties That Bind has its moments, {{but most of these}} moments are the same sorts of moments that you saw in last year's game. If you're a fan of the previous game and you're looking for more of the same, Ties That Bind fits the bill, but more expansion on the themes of the first game would have made for a much more interesting final product." ...|$|E
