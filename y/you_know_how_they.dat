Later that month, producer David Banner told NeonLimeLight.com that the album will [...] "bring people back to the clubs" [...] and that it will [...] "change the way people look at R". He also revealed details of a song that he and Brown recorded for the album, saying: [...] "When I tell you, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> don't play that much R in the club no more?...The song that me and Chris made, they are going to play it like they used to play Jodeci. Like they used to play Keith Sweat. The song that me and Chris made is so jamming". On January 7, 2012, Brown revealed via his official Twitter account that there was only two weeks left of recording sessions for the album, tweeting [...] "LAST TWO WEEKS of me finishing FORTUNE! I'm excited for all the fans to hear my real music". The tweet was soon followed up by another, with the singer tweeting [...] "Dub step records on my album sounding crazy!!!!". However, the tweet was later removed, suggesting that Brown gave away too much details about the album.|$|E

If the gold had been, as you say, lost amongst the rocks, I do think they would have still watched the place.

Well, se√±or, I am ready to try it, but I am not a very good swimmer." ...|$|E

Very likely Mrs. Dowey met Mrs. Twymley and Mrs. Mickleham quite casually in the street, and meant to do no more than the time of day; then, naturally enough, the word camouflage was mentioned, and they got heated, but in the end Mrs. Twymley apologised; then, in the odd way in which one thing leads to another, the winkle man appeared, and Mrs. Dowey remembered that she had that pot of jam and that Mrs. Mickleham had stood treat last time; and soon they were all three descending the area stairs, followed cringingly by the Haggerty Woman.|$|E
