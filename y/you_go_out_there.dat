After the first verse, Tony Thompson starts playing the drums, which moves along the rhythm of the song. Towards the end, Madonna sings the song like a soul singer and the song ends with a gasp of breath. The song was recorded at Power Station Studio in Manhattan, New York. Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. I was very much into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record." ...|$|E

On 28 April 1965 it was broadcast by Rediffusion TV, with Springfield opening each half of the show accompanied by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas and Motown's in-house band, The Funk Brothers. The associated Tamla-Motown Revue featuring The Supremes, The Miracles and Wonder had started in London in March, and according to The Supremes' Mary Wilson, the tour was a flop: [...] "It's always... disheartening when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and you see the house is half-full... but once you're on stage... You perform as well for five as you do for 500." [...] Wickham, a fan of the Motown artists, booked them for the Ready Steady Go! special and enlisted Springfield to host it. In 1966 Springfield released three additional UK Top20 hits: [...] "Little By Little" [...] and two dramatic ballads – one written by Carole King: [...] "Goin' Back" [...] and [...] "All I See Is You," [...] written by Ben Weisman & Clive Westlake, which also reached the US Top20.
