30|$|Forest {{management}} planning requires long-term forecasts of resource flows (Baskerville 1986). Whether the {{forest management plan}} is focused on timber flows (Clutter et al. 1983; Baskerville 1986), carbon offsets (Birdsey 2006; MacLean et al. 2014), or other ecosystem services (Pretzsch et al. 2008), forest growth and <b>yield</b> <b>models</b> {{play a key role}} in the forest management process (Clutter et al. 1983; Weiskittel et al. 2011 a).

30|$|We have updated our {{calculations}} made in Inoue and Kamaya (2003, 2004) of {{the dust}} photoelectric heating in the IGM with the new model {{of the dust}} photoelectric yield by Weingartner et al. (2006). This new <b>yield</b> <b>model</b> {{takes into account the}} effect of the photon and electron transfer in a grain, the photoelectric emission from inner shells of grain constituent atoms, the Auger electron emission, and the secondary electron emission. A comparison with the previous <b>yield</b> <b>model</b> by Weingartner and Draine (2001) shows that the new yield is smaller than the old one for ∼ 100 eV photons. This reduction of the yield is due to the photon/electron transfer effect and reduces the electric potential on grains and the heating rate significantly. For example, if we integrate over the grain size with the standard MRN distribution, the dust photoelectric heating rate with the new <b>yield</b> <b>model</b> is a factor of 2 – 4 smaller than that with the old <b>yield</b> <b>model.</b> The photoelectric heating rate is more important in lower density medium. If the dust-to-gas ratio in the IGM is 1 % of that in the Milky Way and the size distribution is the standard MRN model, the dust heating rate dominates the HI and HeII photoionization heating rates when the gas number density is less than ∼ 10 - 6 cm- 3, even with the new <b>yield</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Typically, when {{different}} forms of growth and <b>yield</b> <b>models</b> are considered, they are grouped into convenient discrete classes. As a heuristic device, I chose to use a contrasting perspective, that all growth and <b>yield</b> <b>models</b> are diameter distribution models that merely differ in regard to which diameter distribution is employed and how the distribution is projected to future conditions. I describe different diameter distributions, whether they are the classical contmuous diameter distributions, the implied distributions of whole-stand models, or the discrete diameter distributions of size-class or individual tree models. There are also intermediates between these types of diameter distributions. Aggregation vs. disaggregation describes the alternate poles for how diameter distributions can be projected to future conditions. There are intermediates between these extremes, as well. There are several alternatives that vary from the classical paradigms. One alternative is a continuous analog to stand table projection that employs a “distribution modifying function ” to project diameter distributions in time. One discrete variant of stand table projection is termed “non-naWe ” size class models, as they relax {{one or more of}} the assumptions of size class models. An “individual tree kernel ” model is one that uses a simple kernel function to distribute probability around an individual tree, rather than concentrate the probability at the measured diameter, as in typical individual tree models. Other variants are mentioned. These variants suggest that there is an infiite universe of alternative growth and <b>yield</b> <b>models,</b> and the classic labels for types of growth and <b>yield</b> <b>models</b> do not embrace these alternatives...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. My {{objective}} {{is to examine the}} expected utility of general classes of forest growth models for answering questions regarding the sustainability of forest management. Six classes of forest models are reviewed: Forest Yield Models; Ecological Gap Models (population succession); Ecological Compartment Models (resources fluxes); Process/Mechanistic Models; Vegetation Distribution Models; Hybrid Models. The review reveals structural shortcomings in several classes of models as potential tools for evaluating questions of sustainable forest management. For example, the great disadvantage of Forest <b>Yield</b> <b>Models</b> is that they are not linked to the underlying causes of productivity (the carbon and nutrient cycles, the moisture regime, and climate). <b>Yield</b> <b>models</b> implicitly assume that environmental conditions remain constant. This assumption is clearly unsuitable for evaluating climate change scenarios, which are crucial for long-term sustainability considerations. Hybrid models hold the greatest promise, because they are predicated on producing an operational process model with useful products on yield for the manager (e. g., PipeQual, Stand-BGC). The hybrid modelers base as much of their system on causal process models as is practical, and openly embrace relevant empirical results from <b>yield</b> <b>models</b> to complete the system...|$|R

Subsequently, cyclic deformations near the crack tip have been simulated employing the Strip <b>Yield</b> <b>model</b> in conjunction with a novel method based on Westergaard’s complex potential.
