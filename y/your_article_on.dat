If you should be in England before this, I should be delighted to see you here on the top of Falstaff's own Gad's Hill. It is a very pretty country, not thirty miles from London; and if you could spare a day or two for its fine walks, I and my two latest dogs, a St. Bernard and a bloodhound, would be charmed with your company as one of ourselves.|$|E

40|$|<b>Your</b> <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> human {{dispersal}} in {{the late}} Pleistocene epoch (Nature 485, 23; 2012) overlook the significance of now-submerged archaeological sites on the continental shelf during this period (126, 000 – 11, 000 years ago). It is wrong to assume that these were completely destroyed by the sea and that the interpretation of human movements must rely on proxy data, such as DNA or evidence from islands. More than 3, 000 prehistoric sites on the seabed have been found and mapped, {{and in some cases}} excavated. They range in age from 500, 000 to 5, 000 years old, and at locations from the present-day shoreline out to a depth of 130 metres. These sites were extensive, often located on key travel routes and more attractive than arid hinterlands to human settlers. Marine archaeologists have recovered in-context stone artefacts, animal remains and human fossils from such sites. Some materials, including food remains, organics, bone, DNA and plants, are better preserved underwater than on land. Questions of early human dispersal will not be resolved until continental shelves are fully investigated — spurred by advances in modern oceanographic technology (see [URL]...|$|R

I met Herbert Spencer the other Sunday at George Eliot's, whither I had at last bent my steps. G.H. Lewes introduced me to him as an American; {{and it seemed to}} me that at this fact, coupled with my name, his attention was aroused and he was on the point of asking me if I were related to you. But something instantly happened to separate me from him, and soon afterwards he went away. The Leweses were very urbane and friendly, and I think that I shall have the right dorénavant to consider myself a Sunday habitué. The great G.E. herself is both sweet and superior, and has a delightful expression in her large, long, pale equine face. I had my turn at sitting beside her and being conversed with in a low, but most harmonious tone; and bating a tendency to aborder only the highest themes I have no fault to find with her....|$|E

Now, sir, the 'value' of any piece of labor, that is to say, the quantity of food and air which will enable a man to perform it without losing actually any of his flesh or his nervous energy, is as absolutely fixed a quantity as the weight of powder necessary to carry a given ball a given distance.

The authors found that 1200 mg of gabapentin 2 hours prior to operative debridement of burn wounds led to a signifi-cant decrease in pain in the immediate 24 -hour postoper-ative period, as measured by the visual analog score and by patient-requested morphine consumption.

There are at least two reasons for this, one being we simply can’t model human creativity and that we are unable to predict major events and their consequences; just two major examples that most modellers did not see coming – the fall of the wall and the attendant collapse of supply from Russia (and its rise) and the rise of China. </p...|$|E

40|$|<b>Your</b> <b>article</b> <b>on</b> {{love and}} {{relationship}} {{deals with a}} very important issue (“Love makes the world go round,” Feb. 15, Page 1). It is now widely accepted that romantic relationships and dating are normative among adolescents and young people in Nepal. In our qualitative study of urban and rural young males and females using same sex researchers — in perhaps the first study of dating practice among Nepali youth — almost all of our respondents reported that young people in Nepal form partnerships with the opposite sex while they are in school or college or even at the community level. Most participants had a very positive attitude towards dating which they think allows them to share love, feelings, pleasure and problems with their partners, although sexual abuse and violence were also reported. We found that young males and females engage in dating for different reasons. Girls tended to want long-term relationship (e. g. marriage), whereas most urban boys concentrated more on short-term goals such as physical beauty and sex. Our study also suggests that young males nearly always make the first move and encourage girls to go on dates. This suggests that young females {{are less likely to be}} able to share the feeling of love with partners and that males are the decision-makers and hold positions of power and prestige. There is a rural-urban divide regarding the places used for dating among young people. Most urban participants liked crowded places such as restaurants, zoos, cottage inns, public transport, hotels, cinemas and parks. Rural participants seem to go to quieter areas such as the jungle, schools, temples and riversides, though some rural boys might go to nearby towns. Surprisingly, urban participants claim that hugging and kissing in public is possible in public dating places such as parks these days. Some also revealed that young people are more likely to engage in sex if dating takes place in isolated places. These findings highlight that partnership formation, romantic relationships and dating practice are common among young people in Nepal. They believe that these activities usually lead to some form of sexual intimacy. With this knowledge in mind, we would like to stress the importance of incorporating the concept of dating in both formal and informal education. Effective sex and relationship education which include the issues of intimacy, relationships, and communication in addition to details about sexuality could enhance the skills of the youth in decision making. Such education should address how emotions, sexual desires and information interact in various situations to ultimately result in safer sexual behaviour...|$|E

"When <b>your</b> first <b>article</b> <b>on</b> visualised numerals {{appeared}} in Nature, I thought of writing {{to tell you}} of my own case, of which I had never previously spoken to any one, and which I never contemplated putting on paper. It becomes now a duty to me to do so, for it is a fourth case {{of the influence of}} the clock-face. [In my article I had spoken of only three cases known to me.--F. G.] The enclosed paper will give you a rough notion of the apparent positions of numbers in my mind. That it is due to learning the clock is, I think, proved by my being able to tell the clock certainly before I was four, and probably when little more than three, but my mother cannot tell me the exact date. I had a habit of arranging my spoon and fork on my plate to indicate the positions of the hands, and I well remember being astonished at seeing an old watch of my grandmother's which had ordinary numerals in place of Roman ones. All this happened before I could read, and I have no recollection of learning the numbers unless it was by seeing numbers stencilled on the barrels in my father's brewery.|$|R

I was showing the scheme to G., shortly after <b>your</b> first <b>article</b> appeared, <b>on</b> {{the piece of paper}} I enclose, and he changed the diagram to a sea-serpent [most amusingly and grotesquely drawn.--F. G.], with the remark, 'If you were a rich man, and I knew I was mentioned in your will, I should destroy that piece of paper, in case it should be brought forward as an evidence of insanity!' I mention this in connection with a paragraph in your article." ...|$|R
