Behindwoods said: [...] "He has done away with every trace of sophistication in his body language and even handles the sickle with consummate ease. He looks every inch a hot blooded youngster from some rural part of Tamil Nadu [...] appears seasoned in the romantic scenes...Uninformed people might not {{believe that this is}} the young man’s big screen debut. Look out for this guy...". Sify said: [...] "It’s hard to believe that it is Karthi’s debut film as he is just spectacular. His expressions, anger, laughter and anguish are all so realistic that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> fire in him." [...] Rediff called his performance [...] "excellent", and [...] "...one of the top performances of 2007". Karthi received several accolades for his performance, including the Filmfare Award for Best Actor in Tamil.|$|E

Ray Richmond from the Los Angeles Daily News branded the show a [...] "Friends clone", but praised Carey, calling him [...] "the season's quirkiest, most uproarious talent". He also {{thought that he}} was [...] "immensely lovable". Richmond added [...] "The pilot never quite clicks, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> potential. And spread inside an Ellen/Grace Under Fire sandwich, it'll be difficult for it to miss." [...] Lon Grahnke from the Chicago Sun-Times thought the show would be a [...] "probable hit" [...] based on the [...] "Pilot". He also observed that the show is [...] "a Cleveland variation of Friends, and thought the early time slot was a turn off, as it required the language to be toned-down. David Zurawik from The Baltimore Sun awarded the episode a C+ and branded it [...] "a blue-collar Friends.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{number of}} the show {{received}} the most disparate reviews from critics.

[...] He was also pleased that Rory was given solo lines, and Sugar was [...] "being embraced as a part of the group". Lynch thought that [...] "Amber Riley and Chord Overstreet harmonize surprisingly wonderfully", and gave this [...] "easily the most fun {{number of the}} episode" [...] an [...] "A−". Stanhope said that [...] "the energy is infectious and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> sparks between the former pair", but the performance was [...] "way too much of a copycat" [...] of the original Grease scene, while Flandez said that the two leads [...] "lacked chemistry" [...] and that the number was [...] "inexplicable". VanDerWerff was similarly unimpressed: [...] "dumb and unnecessary". Chaney wrote that the number [...] "was a high-energy, cute way for the show to mark its comeback", but said that Rory [...] "sounded flat" [...] on one of his lines, and Sam [...] "couldn’t quite hit" [...] the ending high note in the song, and graded it a [...] "B".|$|E

500|$|... "Acrobat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{personal}} songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness, contradictions, and inadequacy. The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see / If you just close your eyes / <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and I certainly have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position." [...] Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the [...] "aggressive and venomous" [...] song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying [...] "Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past." ...|$|E

2500|$|Academy Award nominee, screenwriter and {{director}} Josh Olson, most {{famous for his}} screenplay for A History of Violence, made a video review of Sorcerer for the Trailers from Hell webseries in 2007. He praised the movie highly, stating that it is Friedkin's best effort ("Sorcerer is Friedkin {{at the top of}} his game") and was [...] "at least equal to the original." [...] He also applauded the atmosphere, which he said had [...] "a wonderful tone to it and a real sense of dread and desperation [...] it's tight and suspenseful, every scene grabs you by the collar, and it's beautifully shot. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> humidity down there in South America. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> sweat on the sticks of dynamite." [...] He concluded the review by saying that the only aspect in which the movie failed was the fact that it came out around the same time as Star Wars. Olson felt that [...] "the movie deserved a huge audience" [...] as well as fantasizing that [...] "somewhere there's an alternate universe where Sorcerer is a massive game-changing hit in Hollywood and I'm doing Trailers from Hell commentary on some unknown cult classic called Star Wars. In that world Hollywood has spent the next 30 years making smart, edgy movies for grown-ups, the literacy rate is 100%, we haven't been in a war since Vietnam and world hunger is just a memory." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gordon Murray {{analysed}} {{the car in}} Motor Trend 07/1990: [...] "It's {{the lack}} of weight that makes the Ferrari so exciting.

It really does shake about. And, of course, once you excite the chassis the door panels start rattling and squeaking. Whereas the other cars feel taut and solid, this one's like a big go-kart with a plastic body on it." [...] He severely criticized the old racing technology: [...] "It's not even '60s technology, from a frame point of view, it's '50s twin-tube technology, not even a spaceframe. It's only got local frames to hold the bulkhead to the dash, attach the front suspension, rear suspension and rollbar. And then you have the marketing Kevlar glues in with a quarter inch of rubber." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the review}} for The Body Politic, Ed Jackson said the {{screenplay}} was [...] "spiked with hilarious one-liners", described the love scene as [...] "a luminous study in gentle eroticism, almost painfully intimate", {{and the film}} as [...] "a treat that is both soft-centred and sugar-coated", [...] "handsome, well-constructed", and [...] "much more dense than the simple propaganda that it might at first resemble." [...] Michael Musto wrote in The Saturday Review that [...] "Lesbianism isn't exploited for angst a la Children's Hour, or touched upon then summarily dropped as in Personal Best; it's handled [...] tenderly and optimistically, if not with a lot [...] of [...] levity and wit." [...] Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post praised the film highly, calling it [...] "astonishingly polished and nuanced"; and although {{some aspects of the}} cinematography were criticized, remarked [...] "Donna Deitch's first feature, touches something about love that few movies even hint at — not the tremulousness, or the hiding and jousting (although there is that), but the way the attraction of two lovers warps the world around them, throws it out of whack." [...] In the Los Angeles Times, Sheila Benson wrote that although it was not [...] "easy to sympathize with her character", Charbonneau was a [...] "magnetic presence" [...] and both she and Audra Lindley gave [...] "crackerjack performances"; stating [...] "although <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> budget limitations with every truncated scene, it's clear that Deitch is adept with actors and with the camera". In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert [...] gave Desert Hearts {{two and a half stars}} for the simplicity and directness of the film, but noted the surprising power of the romantic scenes. In City Limits, Amanda Lipman wrote that it was [...] "a passionate, lovingly shot romance" [...] and that [...] "one of the most important differences between [...] and most heterosexual romances is the equality with which it treats each of its central characters." [...] Geoff Brown in [...] The Times praised the film wholeheartedly, including both actors in the leading roles, writing [...] "Fuelled by vibrant performances and an expert script that articulates feelings without ascending into wordy clouds, Desert Hearts rises far above such pigeon-hole categories as the nostalgic period drama or the lesbian love-story. Deitch's film is a passionate, beautifully controlled drama about making choices and exercising the heart: in a word, about living." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{matter of}} fees is important, {{far beyond the}} mere {{question}} of bread and butter involved. Properly attended to, fuller justice is done to both lawyer and client. An exorbitant fee should never be claimed. As a general rule never take your whole fee in advance, nor {{any more than a}} small retainer. When fully paid beforehand, you are more than a common mortal if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> same interest in the case as if something was still in prospect for you, as well as for your client. And when you lack interest in the case the job will very likely lack skill and diligence in the performance. Settle the amount of fee and take a note in advance. Then you will feel that you are working for something, and you are sure to do your work faithfully and well. Never sell a fee note--at least not before the consideration service is performed. It leads to negligence and dishonesty--negligence by losing interest in the case, and dishonesty in refusing to refund when you have allowed the consideration to fail.|$|E

6000|$|Let {{me point}} out to you, in the first place, {{with respect to this}} {{important}} matter of the movements of the heart and the course of the blood in the body, that there {{is a certain amount of}} knowledge which must have been obtained without men taking the trouble to seek it--knowledge which must have been taken in, in the course of time, by everybody who followed the trade of a butcher, and still more so by those people who, in ancient times, professed to divine the course of future events from the entrails of animals. It is quite obvious to all, from ordinary accidents, that the bodies of all the higher animals contain a hot red fluid--the blood. Everybody can see upon the surface of some part of the skin, underneath that skin, pulsating tubes, which we know as the arteries. Everybody can see under the surface of the skin more delicate and softer looking tubes, which do not pulsate, which are of a bluish colour, and are termed the veins. And every person who has seen a recently killed animal opened knows that these two kinds of tubes to which I have just referred, are connected with an apparatus which is placed in the chest, which apparatus, in recently killed animals, is still pulsating. And you know that in yourselves <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pulsation of this organ, the heart, between the fifth and sixth ribs. I take it that this much of anatomy and physiology has been known from the oldest times, not only as a matter of curiosity, but because one of the great objects of men, from their earliest recorded existence, has been to kill one another, and it was a matter of considerable importance to know which was the best place for hitting an enemy. I can refer you to very ancient records for most precise and clear information that one of the best places is to smite him between the fifth and sixth ribs. Now that is a very good piece of regional anatomy, for that is the place where the heart strikes in its pulsations, and the use of smiting there is that you go straight to the heart. Well, all that must have been known from time immemorial--at least for 4,000 or 5,000 years before the commencement of our era--because we know that for as great a period as that the Egyptians, at any rate, whatever may have been the case with other people, were in the enjoyment of a highly developed civilisation. But of what knowledge they may have possessed beyond this we know nothing; and in tracing back the springs of the origin of everything that we call [...] "modern science" [...] (which is not merely knowing, but knowing systematically, and with the intention and endeavour to find out the causal connection of things)--I say that when we trace back the different lines of all the modern sciences we come at length to one epoch and to one country--the epoch being about the fourth and fifth centuries before Christ, and the country being ancient Greece. It is there that we find the commencement and the root of every branch of physical science and of scientific method. If we go back to that time we have in the works attributed to Aristotle, who flourished between 300 and 400 years before Christ, a sort of encyclopaedia of the scientific knowledge of that day--and a very marvellous collection of, in many respects, accurate and precise knowledge it is. But, so far as regards this particular topic, Aristotle, it must be confessed, has not got very far beyond common knowledge. He knows a little about the structure of the heart. I do not think that his knowledge is so inaccurate as many people fancy, but it does not amount to much. A very few years after his time, however, there was a Greek philosopher, Erasistratus, who lived about three hundred years before Christ, and who must have pursued anatomy with much care, for he made the important discovery that there are membranous flaps, which are now called [...] "valves," [...] at the origins of the great vessels; and that there are certain other valves in the interior of the heart itself.|$|E
