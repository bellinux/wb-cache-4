40|$|The {{right kind}} of house Cue: Goats are, by nature, hardy animals that do not get sick easily. However, if goats do become sick they often fail to recover, and may die, so keeping them healthy is very important. One factor in keeping goats healthy is {{providing}} the right type of housing for them. Above all, farmers need to keep their goat pens clean. If goats are sleeping on dung {{which has not been}} cleared up, internal parasites such as worms can easily be spread around the flock. Ventilation is also very important. If a goat house is poorly ventilated, the goats may get stressed, which can make them more vulnerable to illness. They {{are also more likely to}} catch pneumonia or other bronchial diseases. Goat houses need to be big enough to prevent over-crowding. It can also be a good idea to have separate houses for the young goats, since this will prevent them being bullied by the adult males. So what kind of housing is suitable for goats? Patrick Mphaka put that question to Alexander Bukhu, senior veterinary officer for Mpemba area, in southern Malawi. In Malawi, the word for a goat house is a khola. IN:		?Good housing for goats should have ? OUT:		? very vigilant mostly on hygienic point of view. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 24 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Alexander Bukhu, senior veterinary officer in Mpemba area, southern Malawi, emphasising the need for good hygiene in goat houses. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Bukhu	Good housing for goats should have a dry floor, light and good ventilation. There are three types of kholas. The most recommended one is the ideal housing for goats but require a lot of nails and timber. There is also brick khola. Very expensive. Baking bricks requires large quantities of firewood. And there is another one, mud khola. These kholas are easy to build and the materials are cheap and locally available. Mphaka	Out of those three types of kholas that you have told us about how the goats can be housed, which one would you recommend is the best kind of housing for the goats? Bukhu	The best khola should be poled, roof thatched for good ventilation, and enough light. Other than the brick khola and the mud one, the most recommended is poled because it is raised so that even cleaning is not a big problem. Mphaka	I understand there are a number of considerations which you have to have when you are constructing a khola. For instance the one which you are saying you use poles and it is raised, what can you say about the advantages? Bukhu	The poled one is self cleaning because the droppings they just go right away from the top down on the ground whereby the farmer can easily come and collect without any problems. And it lessens the labour of the farmer to go in and out every day to sweep the khola. Mphaka	Since you are using the poles, we are aware that due to deforestation not many areas probably can have the necessary poles to construct the poled khola. In such a situation is there any better way of still making sure that given the worst situation which you have that it?s not the recommended one, you can still try your best that the goats must be as comfortable as possible in such a khola? Bukhu	Comfortability of that khola is not all that okay because there is time where by the weather becomes very hot whereby <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> control of that situation. And mud kholas, if not constructed properly, if the rains come, let?s say it is a windy, they might even destroy the khola. Mphaka	So if one has got a mud khola, what would you recommend in terms of how they should do the thatching so that the water does not wet the wall leading to its consequent falling down? Bukhu	In such a case, we might even advise the farmer to buy a plastic sheet to cover the roof, then on top to put on more grass. But still the farmer has to work extra hard in removing all the dung on daily basis if he can afford. Mphaka	What?s the advantage of making sure that you remove the dung from the khola? Bukhu	If the dung remains on the floor, they might accumulate and some of the bacteria can get advantage of that. Mphaka	And once the bacteria get advantage of the situation, what are the consequences? Bukhu	Definitely, the goats will become sick. When the goat is sick it becomes very expensive to treat the goat. Mphaka	So it?s better to prevent than to cure. Bukhu	Yes. But bear in mind that the farmer is supposed to be very vigilant mostly on hygienic point of view. End of track. Advantages and disadvantages of wooden, brick and mud-brick houses, importance of hygiene, such as clearing away dung...|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{describes the}} issue of domestic violence. Domestic violence is considered {{as one of the}} biggest and most hidden forms of violence in our society. Perhaps it can be found all around us and it is not related to women only but also men and also cases of domestic violence against children and seniors are increasing. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the views and attitudes of the public about domestic violence, because the opinion about this increasingly important issue and the informed society has an impact on early detection and follow-up of the cases of domestic violence. The theoretical part of this bachelor thesis summarizes the basic information as what the domestic violence is, what are its signs, forms, dynamics, prejudices and myths. Vulnerable people, violent people and causes and prevention of domestic violence are briefly outlined here. At the end of the theoretical part assistance for victims of domestic violence is listed by the helping institutions and organizations and a review of current legislation of the Czech Republic, which is related to the topic. In the research part of the bachelor thesis there are two hypotheses set on the target. Hypothesis no. 1 "The public perceive domestic violence as a private matter in which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> interfere," and hypothesis no. 2 "The public is not informed about the ways how to help victims of domestic violence". The survey for the purpose of this thesis was made out of using a quantitative research and was made in January 2014. For the data collection public survey was used in the selected location, which is Vltavotýnsko. The survey was conducted by questionnairy. The sample was 400 respondents who were approached randomly. The only criterion for completing the questionnaire was adulthood reaching. 337 of 400 distributed questionnaires were returned, which is more than 80 percent return. The questionnaire in the thesis was compiled on the basis of the scientific literature and it contains the basic information that the public should know about domestic violence. Questionnaire was divided into two parts. The first part examined the respondents' awareness about domestic violence and the second part the awareness of the respondents about the help to the victims of domestic violence. Answers to questions were summarized in tables and graphs with a spreadsheet program Microsoft Excel first. Subsequently, due to the fact that the vast majority of data acquired through questionnaires were categorical, adequate statistical evaluation methods were chosen. Statistical analysis of the results of the survey was conducted in SPSS. The research showed that the public in Vltavotýnsko is relatively well informed about what is domestic violence, and only a small percentage of respondents perceive domestic violence as a private matter. Thus, the hypothesis no. 1 "The public perceive domestic violence as a private matter in which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> interfere," <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been confirmed. Conversely, the public is not sufficiently informed about the ways how to help victims of domestic violence, who to turn to for help when they become victims of domestic violence by themselves or when they are asked for help, and it means that the hypothesis of no. 2 "The public is not informed about the ways how to help victims of domestic violence" has been confirmed. Furthermore, the survey results showed that the education of the respondents, their age, the place where they live and whether they are men or women has some impact on awareness, attitudes and opinions of the respondents. This thesis can be used as an informational or educational material for the general public and thus to contribute to its greater awareness about domestic violence and the resulting research data can be served to raise the awareness of the institutions that provide assistance to victims of domestic violence...|$|R
50|$|In 1643, she {{received}} a proposal from Count Henry of Nassau. According to a letter of Christina, Henry was a rich and beautiful Prince who was well liked by Maria Euphrosyne. She left the decision to her father, however: he was uncertain as to whether Henry could support her, and in 1645, after Christina stated that she was fully capable of arranging a marriage for the same status for her relative in Sweden, he denied Henry. On 15 March 1645, Maria Euphrosyne was engaged to the Queens favorite Count Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, and on 7 March 1647, she married him in the Royal Chapel of Tre Kronor (castle) in Stockholm. The marriage was arranged by Christina. Traditional myth has regarded this as a triangle drama: Christina and Maria Euphrosyne were both {{believed to have been}} in love with Magnus Gabriel, and in the end, Christina gave up the plans of marrying him herself, and gave him to her cousin with the words: I give to <b>you</b> what I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> myself. A famous play has been written about this drama. It is not known how much of this legendary triangle drama is true, however. According to Maria Euphrosyne herself, the purpose was to show them both her favor. Magnus Gabriel had, according to her own memoirs, fallen in love with her at the age of eighteen, and due to the love letters exchanged by them during their marriage, at least Maria Euphrosyne certainly had strong feelings of affection for him. The marriage <b>has</b> however <b>not</b> been described as happy. At the wedding, Christina granted her several states, among them her grandmothers favorite residence Höjentorp, which was also to be her favorite, as well as a great personal allowance, which was later confirmed by her brother upon his succession. In 1653, Magnus Gabriel lost his favor with Christina and was expelled from court, and she tried to act as a mediator. Maria Euphrosyne had a close relationship with her brother Charles, and did what she could to support his planned marriage with Christina.|$|R
