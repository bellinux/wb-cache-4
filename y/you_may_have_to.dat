500|$|In the Academy Award winning Errol Morris {{documentary}} The Fog of War, Robert McNamara recalls {{an anecdote}} he read about Sherman during the Civil War, {{in which the}} mayor of Atlanta pleaded with Sherman for mercy before he torched {{the city to the}} ground, to which Sherman responded, [...] "War is cruelty." [...] McNamara uses the story as a parallel to the usage of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, while he was Secretary of Defense, to illustrate the ninth lesson of the film: [...] "In order to do good, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> engage in evil." ...|$|E
500|$|Miami's Cuban {{community}} {{came together}} {{as never before}} for the campaign, taking the opportunity to register thousands of voters who had never taken part in politics in the city. Bryant actively campaigned to the Cuban community, telling them at a rally, [...] "You came here {{to get away from}} one sin ... and it breaks my heart that if Miami becomes another Sodom and Gomorrah <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> leave here, too." [...] A Cuban social worker [...] suggested the cause was representative of an older generation of Cuban emigres, worried that their children were being lost in the depravity of Miami. Miami's archbishop wrote a letter against the gay rights ordinance, and ordered it to be read aloud in all Catholic churches.|$|E

2500|$|... "A trim, grim, vicious, and {{incredibly}} effective action movie with no cut comic-relief bit players, no winks at the audience, and no stars. Just a powder keg of a premise (lifted {{in part from}} Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo), in which a quasi-terrorist group's killing spree culminates in the action described in the title. Carpenter's mastery of wide-screen and almost uncanny talent at crafting suspense and action sequences make Assault such a nerve-racking experience that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> reupholster your easy chair after watching it at home." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arthur C. Parker, Secretary of the Society of American Indians from 1911 to 1915, {{regarded}} McKenzie as the [...] "father of the movement." [...] McKenzie {{respected the}} Society's mantra of [...] "for Indians and by Indians" [...] and understood Indians' distrust of Whites. McKenzie downplayed {{his role as}} [...] "Local Representative" [...] for the Society and worked behind the scenes. He wrote to Parker, [...] "Whatever I may say is subject to two suspicions: First that my race prevents me understanding the situation. Second, that I may have some ulterior motive." [...] "I am always embarrassed by {{doubt in my mind}} as to whether I shall act and speak, or whether I shall contribute most by silence. Everyone who says anything to me tells me to proceed and that the Indians have confidence in me and I am glad and believe that is so, even though doubtful as to what extent that confidence involves action." [...] While Parker was determined that the Society should be run by Indians, it did not diminish his desire for McKenzie's counsel and assistance in managing the organization. In short time, Parker was overwhelmed with the volume of Society work and contemplated resigning. McKenzie exhorted him to stay with the Society, noting [...] "it is not impossible that you are the only man who can save the situation and that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it by constant correspondence, keeping all in touch one with the other, and keeping all satisfied that equal justice is being arranged for." [...] Parker teamed with McKenzie to manage the Society and navigate politics. Responsibilities included publications, planning conferences, drafting and lobbying legislation and membership services.|$|E
2500|$|By the 83rd Minnesota Legislative Session Lindner {{had already}} faced an ethics {{complaint}} before. This {{was a result}} of his reaction to the request of Rep. Paymar. His first complaint stemmed from a May 2000 incident after the Republican Party took control of the House and some members felt that the prayers opening the session were becoming too sectarian. [...] "For many, things went too far when House leaders recently brought in a choir to open the day's session with a musical rendition of the Apostles' Creed." [...] In light of this Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) who is Jewish said [...] "I would like {{to be part of that}} moment where a religious leader gets up before us and has a prayer. But I would like that to be non-denominational, and I would like it to be respectful of who I am." [...] In response to his and others' concerns a rule was passed [...] "requiring that in the future, prayer be non-denominational." [...] In responding to Paymar, Lindner said [...] "You know, we're told there's one God and one mediator between God and man. That man is Jesus Christ. And most of us here are Christians. And we shouldn't be left not able to pray in the name of our God....And if you don't like it, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> like it-Or just don't come. I don't come sometimes for some prayers here....We have that privilege, and you need to exercise it. But don't impose your irreligious left views on me." [...] Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), called on Lindner [...] "to rethink his comments. When Lindner refused to reply, Entenza put forth a 'protest of dissent' petition asking the House Ethics Committee to reprimand Lindner. It was signed by 60 House members, including eight Republicans." [...] Later “The ethics panel found the comments ‘regrettable’, but took no disciplinary action.” ...|$|E
