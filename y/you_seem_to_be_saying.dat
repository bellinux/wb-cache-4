50|$|Hall: <b>You</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effervescent tonight.|$|R
50|$|Shall make <b>you</b> what <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|R
60|$|HARRY. [Breezily.] Hulloa, Harold, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{taking it}} easy.|$|R
60|$|BRIGADIER (<b>to</b> MACAIRE). <b>You</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a gentleman}} of {{considerable}} intelligence.|$|R
60|$|Lady Bracknell. My nephew, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{displaying}} {{signs of}} triviality.|$|R
5000|$|... c. <b>You</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> impatient. - <b>seem</b> <b>is</b> a raising <b>to</b> subject verb.|$|R
5000|$|<b>You</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a bit of}} {{an artist}} at heart. You can become an {{engineering}} draughtsman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{getting on}} {{well with the}} swells, if you mean the Merrifields, {{especially}} Wilfred, if that is his name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} very pleasant here," [...] said Mrs. Kenton, cautiously. [...] "You're enjoying yourself--I mean, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> getting so much stronger." ...|$|R
60|$|MISS SUSAN. If {{you have}} hurt them. Oh, sir, {{how is it}} {{possible}} for any one <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as silly as <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{glad you}} are so well satisfied, sir,' was his calm remark. 'I didn't expect it. <b>You</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite in good spirits.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A most admirable sentiment, {{my young}} friend, which <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing {{your best to}} live up to. Not a line written, I see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you must}} have been but a boy when you came here," [...] {{returned}} the Englishman, [...] "for <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> not yet middle-aged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite {{understand}} the sacrifice <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> making <b>to</b> Mr. Vimpany," [...] she confessed. [...] "Will you tell me, dear, what it means?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} got on very well, Bertie, with Mrs. Dias. I did not hear what you <b>were</b> saying, but <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing stunningly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{in great}} spirits," [...] said Sir Mallaby approvingly. [...] "It's {{pleasant}} {{to hear your}} merry laugh again, isn't it, Miss Milliken?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no gentleman, [...] "You {{wear your}} boots so wide; [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> some cunning hunter, [...] "You wear the horn so syde."[A] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a little}} {{difficult}} <b>to</b> understand why <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> content with track-grading. One would fancy it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unusually hard work," [...] said the girl.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{there was}} a great deal of noble feeling in them, and a great deal of abominable nonsense. <b>You</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very anxious <b>to</b> reform society?' ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. M. I didn't get in till half-past eleven. 'Had {{a look at}} you then, and <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{sleeping}} as soundly as a condemned criminal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{tell him}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> punctual. Punctuality is {{the soul of}} business. Hope I won't find your friend as {{independent}} as <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be!</b> <b>You</b> are quite sure, are you, that I can do nothing for you? I have both money and influence." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here {{the gentleman}} laughed, and said, [...] "No, I'm not captain; but <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an honest sort of boy. I don't {{know where the}} captain is." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{laughed and}} said: [...] "Out there, to me, [...] You looked so weather-browned, And brown in clothes, <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] Made of the dusty ground!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{are quite}} right,' he said, with decision. 'Georgina's {{principles}} are not mine. Excuse my remarking it, but <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a young lady}} of unusual penetration.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} was; I felt {{that you have}} been badly treated. But I only meant to stay a minute or two, and <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> busy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you please," [...] {{added the}} Rector, [...] "as <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a seriously {{disposed}} young woman, you may attend family worship {{in the hall}} this evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not so sure}} as <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that Olaf has {{not gone}} beyond the ridge," [...] {{observed}} Leif to Karlsefin, after the men had left them.|$|R
6000|$|... "All we know is, what I {{suppose you}} knew long ago, that her most {{intimate}} friend, next <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{an old friend}} of ours, named Thurnall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{played against}} you, for the Free Foresters last summer. In passing <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a bit of}} a free {{forester}} yourself, dancing in among my nesting pheasants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good, Wampus. <b>You</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the man I want, for I <b>am</b> going <b>to</b> California in an 'Autocrat' car, {{by way of}} the Santa Fe Trail and--and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{reckoned}} I {{might catch}} him before dinner-time. <b>You</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sort of feared {{to speak to}} him yourself. I'm your friend, Amelius--and I'll speak for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Austin, at least, {{never told}} me what <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so sure about--and it is {{scarcely}} likely that he will ever do so now," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{has great}} resolution,' said Cherry, 'but he always <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me {{a sort of}} Christian panther of the wilderness; and <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> getting him into a cage.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Her {{commander}} {{must be a}} dull fellow, if he refuse it to so proper a lad! But <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{too well}} instructed {{for any of the}} meaner births." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To-morrow," [...] Letitia told him, [...] "my aunt arrives {{for a day}} or two. You {{are almost}} as popular with her, you know, as <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with Sylvia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Upon my word, O'Blareaway, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better {{acquainted with}} my matters than I am. Don't you think, on the whole, it might <b>be</b> better <b>to</b> {{mind your own}} business?' ...|$|R
