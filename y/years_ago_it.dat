5|$|Differences in songs, {{genetics}} and morphology {{suggests that the}} Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late Pleistocene, about 100,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> {{is likely that the}} initial colonisation was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western caldera of São Miguel, where both eastern and western song types are found.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica is geologically varied, {{dating from}} the Precambrian era, with some rocks formed more than 3billion <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> is {{composed}} of a metamorphic and igneous platform which {{is the basis of}} the continental shield. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as sandstones, limestones and shales laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the Transantarctic Mountains. In coastal areas such as Shackleton Range and Victoria Land some faulting has occurred.|$|E
5000|$|Haplogroup U4 has {{its origin}} between 21,000 and 14,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>Its</b> {{distribution}} {{is associated with}} the population bottleneck due to the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|R

50|$|The Akan caldera {{was formed}} 31,500 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>Its</b> {{elongated}} shape {{is due to}} its incremental formation during major explosive eruptions, from the early to the mid-Pleistocene periods.|$|R
5|$|In 2008, the British Antarctic Survey {{reported}} a volcanic eruption under the Antarctica ice sheet 2,200 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> {{is believed to}} be that this was the biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years. Volcanic ash deposits from the volcano were identified through an airborne radar survey, buried under later snowfalls in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.|$|E
5|$|In Mesoamerica, wild {{teosinte}} {{was transformed}} through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize, more than 6,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> gradually spread across North America {{and was the}} major crop of Native Americans {{at the time of}} European exploration. Other Mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of locally domesticated squash and beans, while cocoa, also domesticated in the region, was a major crop. The turkey, {{one of the most important}} meat birds, was probably domesticated in Mexico or the U.S. Southwest.|$|E
5|$|The Toba {{eruption}} (the Toba event) {{occurred at}} what is now Lake Toba about 75000±900 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> was the last {{in a series of}} at least four caldera-forming eruptions at this location, with earlier calderas having formed around 788000±2200 years ago.

5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> {{formed the}} relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years ago, has nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas {{such as those that}} can be seen at Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Green Lake formed {{initially}} as {{a northern}} inlet of San Antonio Bay. As the Guadalupe River shifted westward about 2,500 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>it</b> deposited silt, developing a delta that prograded into San Antonio Bay. Around 2,200years ago the delta discharge extended completely across the bay, severing the northern extension from the system, which formed present-day Green Lake. Pottery and burial grounds {{found in the}} area suggest a presence of Karankawa Indians {{at the time of}} formation. Middens uncovered north of the lake contained shells from the brackish water-species of rangia clams (rangia cuneata).|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} habitats of {{this species}} were the semi-arid savanna, thornveld, and light woodland typical of southern Africa. When settled agriculture arrived in its range about a thousand <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>it</b> adapted to cultivated land, and since the arrival of settlement, it has moved into towns. The Cape sparrow prefers habitats with an annual rainfall of less than , though in desert areas it is usually found near watercourses or watering holes. While it occurs in urban centres, it prefers parks, gardens, and other open spaces, and has a low reproductive success in more built-up areas.|$|E
5|$|The seventh episode {{features}} Stéphane Quême, {{otherwise known}} as DJ Falcon, who spoke of first meeting Daft Punk when the duo began recording their debut album Homework. Quême noted that the group's sound had changed since their debut, and that each of their albums had had a distinct influence. He also felt that the recording of Random Access Memories was such that a producer could potentially sample a track from {{it in the same}} way that Daft Punk themselves had sampled older records in their previous albums. Quême concluded that the duo were always sincere and although their first single was released 20 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>it</b> still felt modern.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis, part of a {{geological}} formation known as the Blue Lias. This consists of alternating layers of limestone and shale, laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210–195million <b>years</b> <b>ago).</b> <b>It</b> {{is one of the}} richest fossil locations in Britain. The cliffs could be dangerously unstable, however, especially in winter when rain caused landslides. It was precisely during the winter months that collectors were drawn to the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils.|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} biped is the bolosaurid Eudibamus whose fossils date from 290 million <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>Its</b> long hindlegs, short forelegs, and {{distinctive}} joints all suggest bipedalism. The species became extinct {{in the early}} Permian.|$|R
5|$|Through {{studies of}} the present cloud {{structure}} and geology of the surface, combined {{with the fact that}} the luminosity of the Sun has increased by 25% since around 3.8billion <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>it</b> is thought that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4billion years ago was more like that of Earth with liquid water on the surface. The runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water and the rise of the levels of greenhouse gases that followed. Venus's atmosphere has therefore received a great deal of attention from those studying climate change on Earth.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to most mountain ranges in British Columbia, the Itcha Range represents an inactive shield volcano. This highly dissected volcanic edifice {{consists of a}} variety of rock types, including basanite, hawaiite, trachyte, rhyolite, phonolite and alkali olivine basalt. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity. Two stages of eruptive activity have been identified at the volcano along with three sub-phases that are limited only to the first stage of development. The main body of the Itcha Range is between 3.8and 3.0million years old and thus over two million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>it</b> passed the most active shield stage of life. A period of dormancy lasting for almost a million years followed, which was interrupted by the post-shield stage of volcanism 2.2to 0.8million years ago. More recent volcanic activity in and around the Itcha Range might have occurred in the last 340,000years to produce cinder cones.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow {{was first}} {{described}} by Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller in 1776, as Loxia melanura. Some other earlier biologists described the Cape sparrow in Loxia or Fringilla, {{but it has}} otherwise been regarded {{as a member of}} the genus Passer along with the house sparrow and other sparrows of the Old World. Within this genus, morphological comparisons and geography were insufficient to elucidate to which species the Cape sparrow is most closely related. Mitochondrial DNA phylogenies have strongly suggested that the Cape sparrow is among the most basal members of its genus, having diverged from the rest of the genus during the late Miocene, over 5million <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> is genetically closest to the southern grey-headed sparrow and the other grey-headed sparrows of Africa and the saxaul sparrow of Central Asia, so these species may be sibling species of the Cape sparrow or similarly early offshoots.|$|E
