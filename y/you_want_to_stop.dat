Brenda Blethyn was hired to play Mrs Bennet, whom Moggach {{believed to be the}} unsung heroine of the film; Wright explained that it was [...] "a tricky part , as she can be very annoying; <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> her chattering and shrieking. But Brenda has the humour and the heart to show the amount of love and care Mrs Bennet has for her daughters." [...] Wright convinced veteran actress Judi Dench to join the cast as Lady Catherine de Bourgh by writing her a letter that read [...] "I love it when you play a bitch. Please come and be a bitch for me." [...] Dench had only one week available to shoot her scenes, forcing Wright to make them his first days of filming.|$|E
2500|$|According to Juju, {{the song}} expresses [...] "lurking {{strength}} while in pain," [...] {{and has a}} message that [...] "in situations beyond your control, {{you have to stay}} strong, no matter what happens," [...] and believes the lyrics are about the feelings of [...] "being confused and in pain." [...] Juju explained the title of the song as relating to the point in a relationship where [...] "you don't want a happy ending, and there is no future, where <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> spending time together, immediately." [...] During recording and performances of the song, Juju felt it easy to imagine the feelings of the song's protagonist. Her favorite section of the song is the bridge (the section beginning with the lyrics amai kako no kioku nante).|$|E
2500|$|... "Adieu" [...] ("Farewell"), is a 1960s-inspired pop song, {{featuring}} a double bassline and [...] "stomping" [...] percussion in the vein of Bo Diddley. It was released as the album's first single on September 19 and topped CBC Radio 3's The R3-30 singles chart for two consecutive weeks in November. Lyrically, [...] "Adieu" [...] deals with what Martin {{describes as the}} phase of [...] "the break-up where you really just want the other person to disappear... <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> thinking about them", though she also clarifies that [...] "it's a general break-up song, it doesn't talk about one person in particular". A music video for the song, directed by Jérémie Saindon, features Niels Schneider as Martin's boyfriend whose infidelity provokes her to enact revenge on his various partners, and eventually him as well. The concept {{was inspired by the}} 1960s sitcom Bewitched and styled with touches of both retro and modern.|$|E

2500|$|Since 1868, {{the pope}} was plagued first by facial {{erysipelas}} {{and then by}} open sores on his legs. Nevertheless, he insisted on celebrating daily Mass. The extraordinary heat of the summer of 1877 worsened the sores {{to the effect that}} he had to be carried. He underwent several painful medical procedures, which he undertook with remarkable patience. He spent most of his last few weeks in his library, where he received cardinals and held papal audiences. On 8 December, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, his situation improved markedly to the point that he could walk again. By February, he could say Mass again on his own in standing position, enjoying the popular celebration of the 75th anniversary of his first communion. Bronchitis, a fall to the floor, and rising temperature worsened his situation after 4 February 1878. He continued joking about himself: when the Cardinal Vicar of Rome ordered bell-ringing and non-stop prayers for his recuperation, the pope asked, [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> me from going to heaven?" [...] He told his doctor that his time had come. Pope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878, aged 85, concluding the longest pontificate in papal history, after that of St. Peter, whom tradition holds had reigned for 37 years. His last words were, [...] "Guard the church I loved so well and sacredly", as recorded by the cardinals kneeling beside his bedside. His body was originally buried in St. Peter's grotto, but was moved in a night procession on 13 July 1881 to the Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls. When the cortege approached the Tiber River, a group of anticlerical Romans screaming [...] "Long live Italy! Death to the Pope! Death to the Priests!" [...] threatened to throw the coffin into the river but a contingent of militia arrived to prevent this. The simple grave of Pius IX was changed by his successor, John Paul II, after his beatification.|$|E

"My brother {{must have}} the second sight," [...] {{declared}} Elspeth, gaily, [...] "for he saw you coming before you came"; and she told what had happened, while Grizel looked happily at Tommy, and Tommy looked apprehensively at her. Grizel, he might have seen, was not wearing the tragic face of sacrifice; it was a face shining with gladness, a girl still too happy in his nobility to think remorsefully of her own misdeeds. To {{let him know that}} she was proud of him, that was what she had come for chiefly, and she was even glad that Elspeth was there to hear. It was an excuse to her to repeat Corp's story, and she told it with defiant looks at Tommy that said, [...] "You are so modest, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> me, but Elspeth will listen; it is nearly as sweet to Elspeth as it is to me, and I shall tell her every word, yes, and tell her a great deal of it twice." ...|$|E

6000|$|Another {{excellent}} {{piece of}} material for obtaining excitement in Germany is the simple domestic perambulator. What you may {{do with a}} [...] "kinder-wagen," [...] as it is called, and what you may not, covers pages of German law; after the reading of which, you conclude {{that the man who}} can push a perambulator through a German town without breaking the law was meant for a diplomatist. You must not loiter with a perambulator, and you must not go too fast. You must not get in anybody's way with a perambulator, and if anybody gets in your way you must get out of their way. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> with a perambulator, you must go to a place specially appointed where perambulators may stop; and when you get there you must stop. You must not cross the road with a perambulator; if you and the baby happen to live on the other side, that is your fault. You must not leave your perambulator anywhere, and only in certain places can you take it with you. I should say that in Germany you could go out with a perambulator and get into enough trouble in half an hour to last you for a month. Any young Englishman anxious for a row with the police could not do better than come over to Germany and bring his perambulator with him.|$|E
