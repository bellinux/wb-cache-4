He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became {{principal}} of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, [...] "When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and you look like <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lawyer; {{would you like to}} do law?' I said, 'Fine, if you want to give me the scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law." ...|$|E
500|$|Wenger {{clarified}} Vieira's future {{after the}} match: [...] "My intention is clear: {{to keep him}} [...] The challenge {{in front of us}} is hugely difficult and we need a complete focus. I'm not resigned to let the story go on. It has all to be sorted out before the season." [...] He added that if Vieira chose to leave, the club could sufficiently replace him: [...] "We've worked very hard {{in the last five years}} to get good young players in and you saw that today." [...] Reyes, who was named man of the match, was frustrated at his missed chance early in the second half, but continued: [...] "I set one up and then scored myself so I was much happier." [...] Bergkamp was impressed with Fàbregas's performance in the match: [...] "Normally at 17, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bit unsure when you step out. But with players like Cesc, the way he has developed in one year is quite amazing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well; I don't know. A man likes {{sometimes}} {{to be sure}} how the land lies. Mr. Morton looks so cross that I thought that perhaps the very fact of my dancing with <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> offence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Somesing, somesing--yés!" [...] he cried; [...] "énough for {{a son of}} a reech man--not énough for an orphan. Besides, I sought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{learn to}} <b>be</b> <b>an</b> artist; I did not sink <b>you</b> <b>might</b> learn to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> workman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mad? You know I'm not mad! But I think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little {{sympathetic}} sometimes, Olive!" [...] {{said her}} friend, kissing her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he said. [...] "You're a prodigiously uncivil fellow. You {{disappoint}} me, sir. I {{had formed}} {{the notion that}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gentleman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “A clown and a gymnast,” said Barton Reeve slowly. “Well, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> clown, {{if you got}} funny, {{but what}} do you know about gymnastics?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Strikes me {{that another}} disreputable dog {{went for a}} walk, too,' said the Nilghai. 'What made you get up so early? Torp said <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> buying <b>a</b> horse.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> holding <b>a</b> {{piece of}} wood with your fingers, and then in trying to cut it with the chisel, the chisel might slip and cut your fingers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lane," [...] he said, [...] "don't {{forget that}} I warned <b>you</b> there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little trouble about to-night. If {{you feel the}} {{slightest}} hesitation about involving yourself--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What? In {{wishing to}} be a boy, that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> missionary?" [...] said Ethel. [...] "Not in being quite so cross at home?" [...] she added, laughing.|$|E
6000|$|... "You look pale and--tired {{about the}} eyes," [...] said Daffy, {{leading the way}} into the drawing-room. [...] "Thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bit off it, that's all. No offence, Madge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You're overmodest, Alec. If you weren't, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great man. Now, I make a {{point of}} telling my friends that I'm indispensable, and they take me at my word.' ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{revelations of}} the {{minister}} depressed Somerset a little, {{and he did}} not stay long. As he went to the door Woodwell said, 'There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> worthy man--the deacon of our chapel, Mr. Havill--who would like to be friendly with you. Poor man, since the death of his wife he seems to have something on his mind--some trouble which my words will not reach. If ever you are passing his door, please give him a look in. He fears that calling on <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> intrusion.' ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the basic}} method of playing is {{persistent}} across time zones, {{the details of}} particular awards and objectives are themed towards the current time, for example, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> awarded with <b>a</b> ray gun in the future, whilst in the present day <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> awarded with <b>a</b> magnet. This provides variety, and helps facilitate a wider set of goals.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{should you}} like to be, Lillo? <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> scholar. My father was a scholar, you know, and taught me a great deal. That {{is the reason why}} I can teach you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a disgustingly serious fellow," [...] Charnock rejoined. [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bit sympathetic, because I've had a nasty knock. My {{creditors}} {{have come}} down on me, and I'm going to be married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Chief {{was afraid}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little {{difficult}} about an interview. Those pressmen are an infernal nuisance, anyway. What about sneaking into Downing Street at about midnight, in a cloak and slouch hat, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most unfortunate! But {{for these}} {{difficulties}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> second Milton. You leave your wife behind, I suppose," [...] said Bella, completing her sketch and shutting the book.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Meeson, what is it? Have {{you come}} {{to ask me to}} lunch?" [...] asked Mr. John Short. [...] "Do you know I {{actually}} thought that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> client." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must {{apologize}} to you," [...] he said, [...] "for addressing you as 'lad.' I {{had no idea}} that you <b>were</b> <b>a</b> full-grown captain, still less that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> soon <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{little less}} sardonic. Now {{here is the}} next problem: '5.

6000|$|... "Whad I {{was going}} to say was this," [...] he said. [...] "Lemme show you 'ow to scrap. Jest lemme. You're ig'nant, you ain't no class; but <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very decent scrapper--very decent. Shown. That's what I meant to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|Like one {{telling him}} amusing gossip, 'I thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little troubled if you went, John. Sometimes your mind--not often, but {{sometimes}} {{if you are}} agitated--and then you think you see--people who aren't here any longer. Oh dear, oh dear, help me with these bonnet strings.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You a post-captain in His Majesty’s navy!” the old {{man said}} scornfully. “Do you think to take me in with such a tale as that? <b>You</b> <b>might</b> {{possibly}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very junior lieutenant.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could hardly}} be vexed with you, {{whatever}} happened, after all you have done for me. I was only thinking," [...] I made shift to answer. [...] "Still, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> little more civil, Sally." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand, Ivan. Of course I {{have all}} along felt sure you <b>were</b> <b>a</b> {{political}} prisoner; and I thought, perhaps, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> student in Switzerland, which {{would account for}} you having ideas different to other people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, if I didn't think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bit {{taken with}} her!' {{she said with}} an arch {{simplicity}} which could hardly be called unaffected. 'Knowing the set of your mind, from my little time with you years ago, nothing you could do in this way would astonish me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> President, I suppose," [...] {{said the}} Warden, rather contemptuously,--"a four years' potentate. It {{seems to me}} an office about {{on a par with}} that of the Lord Mayor of London. For my part, I would rather be a baron of three or four hundred years' antiquity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are back}} earlier than I expected, Mark. You told me before you started {{that the wind}} was in the east, and that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> long time getting to Amsterdam unless it changed. I have been {{watching}} the vane on the church, {{and it has been}} pointing east ever since.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And well <b>you</b> <b>might.</b> I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> gardener. I dig the ground, {{and plant}} {{things that are}} to live and grow. My works don't all moulder away, and rot in the earth. You see that spade in the centre?' ...|$|R
