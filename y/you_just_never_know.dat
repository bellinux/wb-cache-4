Within an artistic discourse where the context ―social, political or otherwise― is of primary concern, my practice neighbours that of artists including as Francis Alÿs, Barbara Kruger, Cathy Busby, and Jenny Holzer, who each deploy {{a variety of methods}} and tactics that disrupt social spaces and text- based rhetoric.
