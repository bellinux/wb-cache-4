500|$|His next album, {{entitled}} M-1015 (1984), {{was more}} frenetic and pumping than his previous releases, having embraced the recently developed genre of Hi-NRG, {{but it also}} included elements of electro and rap. The major figures behind the album had been Kessie and Morey Goldstein, and Sylvester himself had not written any of the tracks. The album also contained increasingly sexually explicit lyrics, in particular in the songs [...] "How Do <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Your</b> Love" [...] and [...] "Sex". That year, he also entered into a relationship with an architect named Rick Cramner, and together they {{moved into a new}} apartment in the hills, where Sylvester decorated his powder room with posters and memorabilia of Divine, the drag queen, actor and singer whom he had briefly known when they were in The Cockettes. In 1985, he fulfilled a lifelong ambition by working with the singer Aretha Franklin; he and Jeanie had been invited to provide backing vocals on Franklin's album Who's Zoomin' Who?.|$|E
500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it {{is nothing short of}} miraculous to see a movie which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. I speak of the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their love, being too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E

500|$|Other {{members of}} the Enterprise crew include James Doohan as chief {{engineer}} Montgomery Scott, Walter Koenig as navigator Pavel Chekov, and Nichelle Nichols as Uhura, the communications officer. Uhura was supposed to give a dramatic speech in Klingon during the film, but midway through production the element was scrapped and a scene where Uhura is speaking garbled Klingon, surrounded by books, was added for extra humour. Nichols protested the scene, wondering why there were still books in the 23rd century, but accepted the change since {{it would be the}} last Star Trek film she would appear in. Nichols was more uncomfortable with some of the dialogue's racial undertones. Her character was originally to speak the line, [...] "Guess who's coming to dinner," [...] as the Klingons arrive on the Enterprise, but refused to say the part and it was given to Koenig's character instead. Nichols also refused to say the line [...] "yes, but would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> daughter to marry one [...] ", and it was dropped from the film altogether. George Takei also returned as former helmsman Hikaru Sulu, though his character is now commander of the USS Excelsior, which includes former Enterprise yeoman Janice Rand (again played by Grace Lee Whitney) as a communications officer.|$|E
500|$|... "West Coast" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from contemporary music critics. Michael Nelson of Stereogum commented, [...] "This {{is just a}} haunting, hypnotic piece of music that sends chills {{up and down my}} entire skeleton, especially when the tempo shifts downward on the chorus". Nylon writer Liza Darwin deemed the track [...] "silky-smooth" [...] and [...] "total ear candy". Lauren Valenti of Marie Claire lauded the song as [...] "a slice of retro heaven". The track was noted by Stern to be [...] "revolutionary" [...] {{in the sense that it}} sounded [...] "entirely different from anything being offered in pop music at the moment" [...] and deemed it [...] "the very antithesis of everything radio in 2014". Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club named [...] "West Coast" [...] as the album's most accomplished track and [...] "the one song on Ultraviolence that gets the formula of Lana Del Rey right". AltSounds deemed the track as one of Del Rey's best works and one of the best singles released in 2014. The publication went on to opine, [...] "when songs defy descriptions, and artists defy expectation, they tend to stick around long after the 'pop hits' and divas have suck back into obscurity". Oyster journalist Jerico Mandybur commented, [...] "there's no denying that the song has excellent aural pulling power, especially if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> odes to LA mysterious, darkly surfy and dripping in femme fatale".|$|E
500|$|Peter Timmis of Cross Rhythms gave Move nine stars {{out of ten}} squares, commenting that [...] " [...] If <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> rock soulful and gospel-tinged then 'Move' is {{an album}} you'll want to check out". Glenn McCarty of Crosswalk.com said that [...] "As always, Third Day plays to its strength... to craft accessible, {{interesting}} country rock. When it clicks, the result is arm-hair-raising good. Move, unfortunately, doesn't produce that reaction often enough... Move feels a little too safe, or, said another way, a little too static". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel said that [...] "Move may not be Third Day’s best effort in their large discography, but it’s certainly {{a treasure trove of}} hooky rock. After more than 15 years, this band still has something to say, and they say it well". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining [...] "Move showcases some of the best Third Day has to offer. Whether it's better than Revelation or some of their other previous installments (like Wire or Conspiracy No. 5) is something to leave up to the listener to decide, but it does feel safe enough to say that Third Day's Move is a dozen tracks of southern rock goodness". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, saying [...] "Whether accompanied by sharp-edged electric or slippery resonator guitars, a kids choir or the Blind Boys of Alabama, Third Day's Southern rock remains grounded in the band's faith".|$|E

2500|$|Film critic Robbie Collin gave Arrival {{five out}} of five, calling it: [...] "introspective, {{philosophical}} and existentially inclined – yet it unfolds in an unwavering tenor of chest-tightening excitement.

2500|$|Commenting on the result, Graham Bartram, chief vexillologist at the Flag Institute, {{told the}} BBC: [...] "There's often a {{fundamental}} misunderstanding of flags by politicians. It isn't the design {{but what it}} shows about their history and means to them. Saying you like a flag because of its design is like saying <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> family because they are all handsome or beautiful. You love them because of who they are, unconditionally. Flags are a bit like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nellyville {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 70, based on 15 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Wayne Franklin of PopMatters held low {{expectations for the}} album prior to listening to it, following Nelly's feud with rapper KRS-One, but found its music to be [...] "incredible". Wayne lauded the track [...] "Air Force One", describing it as an [...] "unbelievable ode" [...] to hip hop, while noting several other songs as stand-outs. Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, noting [...] "Hot in Herre", [...] "Dilemma" [...] and [...] "Roc the Mic" [...] as [...] "three well-calculated, standout moments". Birchmeier praised [...] "Hot in Herre"'s production, [...] "Roc the Mic"'s hip hop composition and the [...] "Dilemma"'s interpolation of Patti LaBelle's [...] "Love, Need and Want You". RapReviews.com's Steve Juon gave Nellyville an 8.5 out of ten, citing the album's consistency and production, praising [...] "Hot in Herre" [...] for its Midwestern drawl and [...] "harmonious musical flow". Giving the album a B+, Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly praised several new additions to Nelly's vocal style, summarizing: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> rap loose and funny, Nelly's the man for you".|$|E
