5|$|You made me very low-spirited last night, by your {{manner of}} talking—You are my only friend—the only person I am {{intimate}} with.—I {{never had a}} father, or a brother—you have been both to me, ever since I knew you—yet I have sometimes been very petulant.—I have been thinking of those instances of ill-humour and quickness, and they appeared like crimes. <b>Yours</b> <b>sincerely,</b> Mary.|$|E
500|$|The German {{invasion}} of Norway in 1940 led to Andersen's life once more taking a turn into illegal activities. His furniture workshop {{was used as}} a weapons depot by the Norwegian resistance movement, and he took part in looting German military stores. He was first arrested by the Germans after he had responded to rumours that he was a Nazi by writing the Norwegian national socialist party Nasjonal Samling's official publication Fritt Folk and stating that [...] "although I have done many wrong things in my life, a Nazi I am not. <b>Yours</b> <b>sincerely</b> Johs. S. Andersen". The letter was published unedited by the newspaper, although Andersen was later arrested by the occupying authorities and sentenced to one year in prison, after spending half a year in detention. Using techniques he had learned during his earlier criminal career, Andersen managed to be transferred to prison hospital during his time in detention. While there he acquired false x-ray images and tuberculosis germs to fake illnesses in other captured resistance men who {{were on their way to}} interrogation. He also infected a German interrogator with malaria by contaminating his insulin. At night, he would sneak out of the hospital and operate in Oslo, amongst other activities breaking into Nasjonal Samling offices and stealing documents, copying them and having them shipped to the United Kingdom together with evidence of torture in Nazi-run prisons. He served the last part of his sentence in Fuhlsbüttel near Hamburg, Germany. [...] His wife was also active in resistance work, dealing with propaganda and espionage. Author Egil Ulateig doubts the veracity of Andersen's prison exploits, which are based mostly on Andersen's own testimony.|$|E
2500|$|In 1936 Himmler {{selected}} former Lieutenant General Paul Hausser to {{be appointed}} Inspector of the SS-VT with the rank of Brigadeführer, he set about transforming the SS-VT into a creditable military force that equaled the regular army and transformed the officer selection system. The school was opened in 1936 by Adolf Hitler and would use the regular army training methods and used former army officers as instructors to train their potential officers to be combat effective. Because of their backgrounds, some of the cadets required basic training in non-military matters. The cadets were issued books on etiquette that contained instructions on table manners [...] "Cutlery is held only in the fingers and not with the whole hand" [...] and even the correct way to close a letter [...] "Heil Hitler! <b>yours</b> <b>sincerely</b> XXXX". Instruction was also given on Nazi ideology during lectures, {{with a mixture of}} athletics and military field exercises.|$|E
