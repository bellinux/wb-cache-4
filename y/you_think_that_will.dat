40|$|Q: How are {{unwanted}} noise and dc offsets getting into my precision amplifier circuit? A: On each birthday when I was young, {{my dad would}} {{take me to the}} toy store to pick out my present. He always vetted the toy, saying something like, “Now really, {{what are you going to}} do with that? ” Or, “How long do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> last? ” I sometimes think that he wanted to make sure that he would enjoy my choice as well. His questions forced me, even at an early age, to think critically about the decisions and choices I was making. Some of my favorite childhood toys were: an erector set and a Radio Shack 101 project electronics kit, but my earliest kit, the one that sparked my interest in electronics, was a crystal radio set. I tuned in AM radio stations and magically plucked them from the airwaves … with no batteries or power supply! How cool was that? How did it work? Some 40 + years later, who would think that I would tie that crystal radio set into an op amp RAQ? Actually, it wasn’t hard. A crystal radio uses a PN junction to rectify an RF signal envelope to produce a detected voltage. Did you know that some op amps can do the same thing? All op amps feature some variation of a differential pair front end. Depending on the current flowing in the diff pair, and the unwanted RF signal frequency and strength, the diff pair can actually act as a high-frequency detector...|$|E

40|$|Rhodesian land deeds {{in modern}} Zimbabwe Cue: For {{much of the}} last century the Fengu people living north west of Bulawayo had an unusual {{advantage}} over most Africans in Zimbabwe; they held title deeds for their land. These deeds were recognised by successive white settler governments, and helped the Fengu to keep their land when other people were forced to move, in making way for settler farms. How they obtained those deeds is a story that involves {{one of the most famous}} settlers of all, Cecil John Rhodes. Busani Bafana spoke to Michael Ndondo, the current chief of the Fengu, and asked him about their unusual possession of title deeds, and how it was affecting his people during the modern period of land resettlement. IN:		? Well it has been a long ?? OUT:		? ? the government is going to do. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 43 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Chief Michael Ndondo on his hopes for the Fengu people in Zimbabwe. Transcript Ndondo	Well it has been a long and bitter battle for the Xhosa people in Zimbabwe. From as early as 1927 the then government of Rhodesia wanted the Xhosa people in Mbembesi to be moved. It was at a time when most African people were being removed from the fertile areas of the country, which were also in the highvelt, moved to low lying areas, with low productivity, and the Xhosa people were asked to leave, but then they resisted. Then they claimed that they had been given this land by Cecil John Rhodes, and what they were claiming was rightfully theirs, because they had been made to leave their own land, to which they had property rights, in the Cape Colony in South Africa. The government then decided to give them plots equal to those which they had left in South Africa. It was then that 177 ten acre plots were demarcated for them. Bafana	We understand the Xhosa people are some of the few in Zimbabwe who have access to title deeds. Could you fill us in on how they came about acquiring these title deeds? Ndondo	Well, in 1938 there was what was known as the Bullock Commission, which carried out a survey on the property rights of the Xhosa people in Zimbabwe. And they claimed the land that they had originally held in the Cape Colony in South Africa. It was then that the Fengu Location Land Distribution Act was put in place, offering 177 plots to those who were entitled to them, and it is the same act by which we still hold those title deeds. Bafana	And how has your ownership of the title deeds benefited you in the way that you are actually using your land today? Ndondo	Well in the first place the ownership of the title deeds has been the cornerstone of our resistance to being moved by successive white settler governments. Because having title to the land, it was legally impossible for them to remove us. Bafana	Today, there is a very big debate about land redistribution, and in fact the government of Zimbabwe has introduced what is called the Fast Track System. How has this affected your people if at all? Ndondo	Well some of the descendants of the title holders, decided to go for resettlement, because there was better land. The rest remained, but the land holding in Mbembesi is communal. People are not necessarily doing their farming activities on those plots to which they claim titles. It has always been a communal set-up. Bafana	And so how do many of them actually use the land? Ndondo	We use the land for both tillage and pastoral farming. Bafana	And looking into the future, what do you hope will actually happen as far as the issue of land management in this area, given that some of the people have moved from their original lands? Ndondo	Well the current land use plan is for a communal type of land use, and we have made a request to government to extinguish those title deeds, so that we live together in a communal set-up. Bafana	And do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> happen? Ndondo	Yes I?m positive that is what the government is going to do. End of tape. For {{much of the last}} century the Fengu people living near Bulawayo in Zimbabwe, have held title deeds to their land. In this report the chief of the Fengu explains how the title deeds have helped them, and how his people are responding to the current land redistribution programme in Zimbabwe...|$|E
