500|$|In his {{biography}} of the author, Bare-Faced Messiah (1987), Russell Miller characterized Typewriter in the Sky as one of Hubbard's works which [...] "would come {{to be regarded as}} classics", along with Fear and Final Blackout. In a biography of Hubbard written by Kent State University professor Donald M. Hassler in The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (1988), he noted, [...] "Typewriter in the Sky (1940/1951), which anticipates plot gimmicks now popular among experimental metafictionists, ought to be taken seriously by the critics who will evaluate his strange genius". In a review upon the 1995 re-release of the book, Ann Patterson-Rabon of the Spartanburg Herald-Journal concluded: [...] "A short novel, 'Typewriter' is a perfect afternoon read: quick, fun and only as deep as <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> go." [...] Sandy Bauers of Knight News Service called the 1995 audio publication of the work [...] "swashbuckling fun".|$|E
500|$|In 1962, HMV persuaded Barbirolli to return. With the Hallé he {{recorded}} a Sibelius symphony cycle, Elgar's Second Symphony, Falstaff and The Dream of Gerontius, Schubert's Ninth Symphony, Vaughan Williams's A London Symphony, and works by Grieg and Delius. With other orchestras, Barbirolli recorded {{a wide range}} of his repertoire, including many recordings still in the catalogues in 2012. Of these, his Elgar recordings include the Cello Concerto with Jacqueline du Pré, Sea Pictures with Janet Baker, and orchestral music including the First Symphony, Enigma Variations and many of the shorter works. His Mahler recordings include the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies (with the New Philharmonia) and Ninth Symphony (with the Berlin Philharmonic). With the Vienna Philharmonic, {{he recorded}} a Brahms symphony cycle, and with Daniel Barenboim, the two Brahms Piano Concertos. He made three operatic sets for HMV: Purcell's Dido and Aeneas with Victoria de los Ángeles (1966), Verdi's Otello with James McCracken, Gwyneth Jones and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (1969), and a set of Madama Butterfly with Renata Scotto, Carlo Bergonzi and Rome Opera forces that has remained in the catalogues since its first issue in 1967. The impact of the last was such that the head of the Rome Opera invited him to come and conduct [...] "any opera <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> name with as much rehearsal as you wish." [...] HMV planned to record Die Meistersinger with Barbirolli in Dresden in 1970, but following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 he refused to conduct in the Soviet bloc, and his place was taken by Herbert von Karajan.|$|E

500|$|A. O. Scott of At The Movies also {{compared}} his {{viewing of}} the film to {{the first time he}} viewed Star Wars and he said [...] "although the script is a little bit... obvious," [...] it was [...] "part of what made it work". Todd McCarthy of Variety praised the film, saying [...] "The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in Avatar, and it's very much a place worth visiting." [...] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review. [...] "The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> mention," [...] he stated. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded Avatar a three-and-a-half out of four star rating and wrote in his print review [...] "It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine thought that the film was [...] "the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought the film has [...] "powerful" [...] visual accomplishments but [...] "flat dialogue" [...] and [...] "obvious characterization". James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars; he wrote [...] "In 3-D, it's immersive– but the traditional film elements– story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc.– are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2½-hour experience." ...|$|E
