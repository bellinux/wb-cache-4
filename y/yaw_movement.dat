50|$|There {{are three}} primary ways for an {{aircraft}} {{to change its}} orientation relative to the passing air. Pitch (movement of the nose up or down, rotation around the transversal axis), Roll (rotation around the longitudinal axis, that is, the axis which runs {{along the length of}} the aircraft) and <b>Yaw</b> (<b>movement</b> of the nose to left or right, rotation about the vertical axis). Turning the aircraft (change of heading) requires the aircraft firstly to roll to achieve an angle of bank (in order to balance the centrifugal force); when the desired change of heading has been accomplished the aircraft must again be rolled in the opposite direction to reduce the angle of bank to zero. Lift acts vertically up through center of pressure which depends on the position of wings. The position of the centre of pressure which will change with changes in the angle of attack and aircraft wing flaps setting.|$|E
50|$|A basic {{means of}} {{controlling}} an aircraft with disabled flight controls, discovered through crew experience, is by {{making use of}} the position of the engines. If the engines are mounted under the centre of gravity, {{as is the case in}} most passenger jets, then increasing the thrust will raise the nose, while decreasing the thrust will lower it. This control method may call for control inputs that go against the pilot's instinct: when the aircraft is in a dive, adding thrust will raise the nose and vice versa. Additionally, asymmetrical thrust has been used for directional control: if the left engine is idled and power is increased on the right side this will result in a yaw to the left, and vice versa. If throttle settings allow the throttles to be shifted without affecting the total amount of power, then yaw control can be combined with pitch control. If the aircraft is yawing, then the wing on the outside of this <b>yaw</b> <b>movement</b> will go faster than the inner wing.

Therefore all of the power from the engines {{can be used for}} lift (force), whereas a single rotor helicopter uses some of the engine power to counter the torque. An alternative is to mount two rotors in a coaxial configuration. The first successful tandem rotor helicopter was built by Nicolas Florine in 1927.|$|R

The addition of the guard rails also had the effect of stiffening the frame made up of the rails and bearer bars, thereby limiting lateral movement of the rails under train passage. The guard rails were continuous across the CESuRa system, connected to the bearer bars using machined pins, and connected to the guard rail of the adjacent span through a sliding mechanism. These provisions were meant to limit the frame action contribution of the guard rails in order to promote distributed curvature of the track-rail frame under <b>yaw</b> <b>movements</b> while also accommodating surge movements.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tire {{blow-out}} (TBO) is {{very likely}} to trigger dangerous accidents particularly when the car operates at high speed. Usually, TBO {{at one of the}} wheels results vehicle’s <b>yawing</b> <b>movement,</b> forcing driver in panic to turn the steering-wheel abruptly as he or she does with the normal operation. Unfortunately, this tends to improperly steer the vehicle in imbalance due to serious variation of steering characteristics after TBO and causes it rollover or spinout as a consequence. Basically, this paper addresses the blown tire model (BTM) based on the UniTire model we developed and applied in CarSim to perform some simulations to study the vehicle’s kinetic behavior after TBO. Finally, the Vehicle’s steady-state steering characteristic after TBO is presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{first one}} was that the pilot flying, the Captain, had accidentally {{selected}} the reverse beta range for the propellers {{with the intention of}} losing energy to correct the airspeed, regain the descent path or shorten the landing as much as possible, as the reverse beta mode acted as powerful brakes. During that time, an asymmetry occurred, which could have caused an undesirable behavior or could have caused the plane to reach its desired speed. In either case, it is necessary at that moment to de-select reverse beta range. Then the pilot would have pushed the levers energetically back to their normal use range by increasing the thrust, which would explain the change in the engine noise. Asymmetry in the power levers movement, or in the operation of the propeller mechanism, or even in the position of the propeller levers, would then have led to asymmetry between the engines, to an extent that would have led to a violent <b>yaw</b> <b>movement,</b> inducing a sharp roll to the left, possibly associated with a stall of the left wing, then a dive. The pilot {{would not have been able}} to regain control of the aircraft, which would have been both too slow and too near the ground at that moment. This hypothesis was supported by testimonies from numerous eyewitnesses and routine in-flight procedure violations in the airport.|$|E

This wireless control system will control the cylinder linear actuator that {{is added to the}} ATV. Nowadays, the usage of ATV gives much benefit to their field of work with their design and is dedicated to huge driveability on irregular ground track as well as on paved road. The main problem of the ATV involves the steering control (yaw control), which cannot rotate easily and needs high forces to control the movement of ATV. <b>Yaw</b> <b>movement</b> is very limited when driven manually, since it requires high forces to move the steering.

In this project, the modelling of ATV by using system identification technique is conducted. The model will then be compared to its derived mathematical model. Then, the design of a wireless control system is required to solve the problem, which results in an easy rotation of 45 ° to the left and right with precise, accurate and lightweight <b>yaw</b> <b>movement</b> and verification using MATLAB/Simulink.

40|$|<b>Yaw</b> <b>movements</b> are {{the most}} {{frequently}} occurring and largest head movements a listener makes when localising; however, previous research has not resolved whether yaw-based head movements are used in elevation localisation. A series of experiments was devised to investigate the impact of head movement on the elevation localisation response accuracy (LRA) of human listeners. The experiments were conducted using a laser-guided pointing response method, as this was found to allow listeners to more accurately and consistently report a perceived source location than either verbal or graphical methods. 2 kHz low-pass filtered noise with and without a 6 kHz half-octave bandpass component were both shown to suppress pinna cues, and were therefore used to more clearly separate the effect of head movements. Head movements were found to improve azimuth and elevation LRA for noise sources. Depending on stimulus and situation, head movements were shown to make an improvement of up to 8. 5 ˚ in elevation LRA. Head movement improved LRA more for the 2 kHz/ 6 kHz filtered noise than it did for broadband noise; when pinna cues are impaired the significance of head movement cues increases. Both forced <b>yaw</b> <b>movements</b> and free movements significantly improved the elevation LRA. Further experimentation was undertaken {{to determine whether the}} improvement in elevation LRA with head movement was caused by greater accuracy when a source is positioned in the listener’s median plane (a static cue), or by the act of moving the head (a dynamic cue). It was found that the static cue did not provide greater accuracy for sources close to the median plane, and hence it was concluded that dynamic cues increased the elevation LRA for yaw head rotations. For octave and half-octave bandwidth sources, static elevation LRA is lower when the listener has turned to face the source. <b>Yaw</b> head <b>movement</b> improved elevation LRA for high frequency continuous signals, which suggests that dynamic interaural level differences are utilised. Head movements do not improve elevation LRA for programme items with less than an octave bandwidth. For octave programme items, head movements significantly improve elevation LRA, while static LRA shows no improvement; head movement cues are effective at narrower bandwidths than pinna cues. By detailing the nature of head movement cues, one can better inform the localisation model, creating a more accurate representation of the human localisation system...|$|R
30|$|Where {{there is}} {{significant}} <b>yaw</b> <b>movement,</b> part of the yaw rotation is manifested as a distributed curvature along the track bridge and part as concentrated rotations at the ends. The extent of each is governed by the lateral bending stiffness of the frame {{made up of the}} (longitudinal) rails and the (transverse) bearer bars. The fasteners that connect the rails to the bearer bars allow some rotation, and if fasteners with no longitudinal restraint are used, then the rotation is essentially free, so that system is flexible and promotes distributed curvature along the track bridge. Guard rails mounted rigidly in the track panel provide more frame action, make the track bridge stiffer, and thus force more of the total rotation into the concentrated rotations at the ends of the track bridge.|$|E

This implies that skeletal-based surgical planning could aggravate the occlusal interference or result in postoperative occlusal discrepancy. Thus, this planning should focus on maintaining the skeletal symmetry of the mandibular body, ramus, and chin areas [9, 10]. Another purpose of skeletal-based segment mobilization is to minimize the inter-bony interference in mandibular proximal/distal segments. If maxillary surgery is included and a <b>yaw</b> <b>movement</b> of the maxilla is applied, the distal segment of the mandible can be moved to minimize the inter-segment interference [11].

Self-steering bogies {{have been used in}} large numbers of hauling locomotives primarily in the USA to reduce flange wear and improve adhesion. However, the steering performance of self-steering bogies is reported to deteriorate under traction. This article compares several bogie types and proposes a new design of steering bogie featuring forced steering combined with control of the bogie <b>yaw</b> <b>movement</b> or actuated yaw forced steered bogie (AY-FS). The bogie stability of a force steered bogie is improved by yaw actuation using a negative derivative control of the bogie yaw misalignment. An additional benefit of the bogie design is that actuators and control sensors for the AY-FS bogie can be mounted on the vehicle body rather than on the bogie frame. The article presents simulation results for a yaw actuated force steered bogie under traction curving conditions. The AY-FS bogie is compared with rigid and force steered bogies and is shown to give superior performance at high traction adhesion levels during curving. The curving performance improvements achieved depend on the curvature, lateral forces on the vehicle, the traction load, and the rail friction. The greatest curving performance advantages occur in tighter curvatures with high traction loads and low rail friction and with high lateral forces to the inside rail such as would result from coupler loads on pulling locomotives...|$|E

DB systems can also be easily implemented in conventional braking systems. For instance, electronic stability programs, electronic stability control (ESC), and direct yaw moment control (DYC) are widely used in heavy-duty vehicles, which apply DB or driving torques on wheels such that the vehicle active safety can be greatly improved [4 – 6]. By contrast, AS systems can generate an external <b>yaw</b> <b>movement</b> by actively turning the vehicle wheels in a small range [7].

As a result, the Ornicopter {{does not require a}} tail ro-tor or a similar anti-torque device. In order to limit the loads that arise on the blades due to forced flapping, and to prevent con-trollability problems, some amount of blade flap-ping freedom is required.

Basic trim equations for the alternative con-figuration are derived, based on a planar model of a rigid blade rotating at constant tip speed.
