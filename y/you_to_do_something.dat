[...] The mélodies were {{performed}} by Jane Bathori and conducted by Darius Milhaud. [...] Delage had gotten Bathori to agree to perform it {{late in the year}} before. In a letter to her dated 27 September 1924, he wrote: [...] "My publisher had to send you my seven little things in the hope they would interest you.... They are a bit basic for your great virtuosity, but that could tempt <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> good with them".|$|E
500|$|If the {{candidate}} was manic, {{he was also}} dedicated and filled with good humor, {{and he had a}} particular genius for getting media attention. He spent long hours registering voters and shaking hands at bus stops and movie theater lines. He took whatever opportunity came along to promote himself. He thoroughly enjoyed campaigning, and his success was evident. With the large numbers of volunteers, he had dozens at a time stand along the busy thoroughfare of Market Street as human billboards, holding [...] "Milk for Assembly" [...] signs while commuters drove {{into the heart of the}} city to work. He distributed his campaign literature anywhere he could, including among one of the most influential political groups in the city, the Peoples Temple, an organization that Milk attended regularly. Milk's volunteers even took thousands of brochures and because the Peoples Temple leader, Jim Jones, was a politically powerful individual in San Francisco, Milk encouraged Temple members to work his phones, spoke at the Temple and later wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter defending Jones character. Milk's relationship with the Temple was not entirely similar to other politicians' in Northern California. According to The San Francisco Examiner, Jones and his parishioners were a [...] "potent political force", helping to elect Moscone (who appointed him to the Housing Authority), District Attorney Joseph Freitas, and Sheriff Richard Hongisto. (Jacobs, John [...] [...] "S.F.'s Leaders Recall Jones the Politician", The San Francisco Examiner, p.C.) [...] Milk spoke at the Temple ("Another Day of Death", Time, December 11, 1978.) and defended Jones in a letter to President Jimmy Carter in 1978. [...] (In that letter he called Jones [...] "a man of the highest character," [...] and criticized outspoken Temple defectors for trying to [...] "damage Rev. Jones' reputation" [...] with [...] "apparent bold-faced lies".) (Coleman, Loren (2004), The Copycat Effect, Simon & Schuster, p.68.). [...] However, When Milk learned Jones was backing both him and Art Agnos in 1976, he told friend Michael Wong, [...] "Well fuck him. I'll take his workers, but, that's the game Jim Jones plays." [...] But to his volunteers, he said: [...] "Make sure you're always nice to the Peoples Temple. If they ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> do it, and then send them a note thanking them for asking you to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Formed in 1998, 40 Below Summer {{had made}} a name for {{themselves}} by performing heavily across their native New Jersey and New York. In late 2000, the band's self-released CD Side Show Freaks found its way to No Name Management (known for acts such as Slipknot and Mudvayne). After partnering with No Name, numerous record label showcases on both coasts followed, with up to fifteen prominent labels showing interest in the band. They eventually signed with Warner Music Group's London-Sire. In March 2001, 40 Below Summer travelled to Los Angeles to commence recording their major label debut with famed heavy metal producer GGGarth (Rage Against the Machine, Mudvayne, Kittie). Lead guitarist Jordan Plingos recalled [...] "I think the first thing that we clicked with Garth about was that he was relaxed. He wasn't like, 'let's go, guys, let's go!' He was more like, 'get comfortable, get settled in.' His whole thing is bringing out the best in you, so pressuring <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> doesn't help. He was all about us, which was amazing", while vocalist Max Illidge said [...] "He’s a lot of fun. He’s crazy too. Definitely a crazy little fucker, but he’s a lot of fun and a very talented guy. He definitely helped unlock some doors inside of me." ...|$|E
