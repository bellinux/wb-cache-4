5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{purchased}} the film rights to Gary K. Wolf's novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? shortly after its publication in 1981. Ron W. Miller, {{then president of}} Disney, {{saw it as a}} perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were hired to write the script, penning two drafts. Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in 1982, but Disney declined as his two previous films (I Wanna Hold <b>Your</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>and</b> Used Cars) had been box office bombs. Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van Citters as animation director, Paul Reubens voicing Roger Rabbit, Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant, and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit. The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner, the then-new CEO of Disney. Amblin Entertainment, which consisted of Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, were approached to produce Who Framed Roger Rabbit alongside Disney. The original budget was projected at $50 million, which Disney felt was too expensive.|$|E

25|$|In close-quarters {{fighting}} {{there is}} no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from your fingers in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.|$|E

500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People {{come up to you}} in the street and shake <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E
500|$|Tennant {{started to}} write the song when he was staying at his cousin's house in Nottingham while {{watching}} a gangster film. Just {{when he was going}} to sleep he came up with the lines: [...] "Sometimes you're better off dead, there's a gun in <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> it's pointing at your head". The lyrics were inspired by T.S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land, particularly in the use of different narrative voices and arcane references. The song's lyrics are largely concerned with class, inner-city pressure. Tennant later said that some listeners had assumed the song referred to prostitutes, but was actually, [...] "about rough boys getting a bit of posh." ...|$|E

He was onstage {{for nearly an hour}} but failed to complete half of the songs. He claimed that his poor performance was due to his left hand having fallen asleep and told the audience it felt [...] "like having stuff on <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> you can't get it off". Smith's performance was reviewed as [...] "undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician" [...] and an [...] "excruciating [...] nightmare". A reporter for the online magazine Glorious Noise wrote, [...] "It would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics universally acknowledged, {{but gave}} mixed {{opinions}} on, the game's {{high level of}} difficulty. This sentiment was epitomized by Sliva's comment that [...] "Don't Starve will never, ever hold <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> I both love it and hate it for that." [...] For example, he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game's camera system obscuring needed objects. Meunier stated that [...] "survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge," [...] but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game's cons. Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that [...] "learning is half the fun and even the smallest victory {{makes you feel like}} you’re winning with a capital FU." [...] Reviewers also felt that players' levels of satisfaction would depend heavily on their levels of commitment to survival.|$|E
500|$|Britain was not {{unaware of}} French {{preparations}} at Toulon {{and along the}} Mediterranean coast, but despite sustained efforts by British agents in France the destination of the French fleet was unknown. Egypt was not seriously considered by the British government: when Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas suggested it, he was urged by Foreign Secretary Lord Grenville to think [...] "with a map in <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> with a calculation of distances." [...] Letters reached London and St. Vincent at the Tagus describing extensive preparations right along the French and Italian Mediterranean coastlines, but the distances between the base in the Tagus and Toulon prevented any sustained observation of French movements. Urgent orders were sent from Lord Spencer at the Admiralty to Vice-Admiral Earl St. Vincent, commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet at the Tagus, to despatch a squadron to investigate {{under the command of}} Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson. Nelson had returned to the fleet three days earlier at Lord Spencer's order, following recovery in Britain from the loss of an arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in July 1797.|$|E
500|$|Following the show's cancellation, Cuoco {{said that}} she {{preferred}} working sitcoms rather than dramas. She felt the [...] "18-hour days {{where you want to}} kill yourself" [...] did not leave her with enough time to have a life outside of work and the demanding shooting schedule did not allow her enough time to work with Combs, Milano, and McGowan. Cuoco also said she only understood her performance on the show after watching the final cuts of the episodes with the special effects and animations; she explained: [...] "But when you are working, you are waiting and waiting, and then things are invisible, and things are being thrown, and nothing's in <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> I'm like so confused and always asking everyone, 'What's happening?'". She also voiced her contempt for the outfits given to her for the character's magical transformations. She said she cried when she first saw her superhero costume for the season eight episode [...] "Battle of the Hexes", which originally included a cape. A writer from WE tv listed Billie's superhero look as one of the show's [...] "sexiest and most bizarre outfits". Cuoco {{said that she}} also disliked the black vinyl outfit and wig that she wore during her first two episodes.|$|E

In an interview with The New York Times, Tom Ascheim said that [...] "the show's quirky appeal extended far beyond Noggin's target audience. 'The simplicity is really understandable by my two-year-old, but my ten-year-old really giggles at Oobi. Andrew Dalton of The Stir stated {{that he was a}} fan of the show himself, adding that Oobi is [...] "just happy to be simple and gleeful, and that actually makes it more appealing to sit and watch as a grown-up." [...] The San Diego Union-Tribunes Jane Clifford felt that it could be enjoyed by viewers of all ages, remarking that [...] "if as a kid you ever drew eyes or a mouth on <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> then 'talked' to a friend, you'll relate to this show." [...] Oppositely, Rebecca Brayton of WatchMojo.com felt that while Oobi [...] "had the intentions to build academic skills in children ... it left their parents empty-handed." [...] Evan Levine of The Star Democrat stated in his review that [...] "it is certainly fun for preschoolers {{to be able to make}} their own Oobis, and they’ll no doubt relate to some of the issues discussed … parents, however, may find that the show wears thin quickly and feels a little forced." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thompson went on {{to become}} a fierce critic of Nixon, both during and after his presidency. After Nixon's death in 1994, Thompson {{described}} him in Rolling Stone as a man who [...] "could shake <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> stab you in the back at the same time" [...] and said [...] "his casket [...] have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. [...] was an evil man—evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it." [...] Following Nixon's pardon by Gerald Ford in 1974, Hunter ruminated on the approximately $400,000 pension Nixon maneuvered his way into, by resigning before being formally indicted. While The Washington Post was lamenting Nixon's [...] "lonely and depressed" [...] state after being forced from the White House, Hunter wrote that 'f there were any such thing as true justice in this world, his [...] rancid carcass would be somewhere down around Easter Island right now, in the belly of a hammerhead shark.' There was however one passion shared by Thompson and Nixon: a love of football, discussed in Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72.|$|E
