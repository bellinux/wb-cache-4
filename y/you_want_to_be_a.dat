500|$|Hillman {{also had}} a hand in writing the album's opening track, [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star". [...] With its satirical and sarcastic lyrics, the song was an acerbic, but good-natured swipe at the success of {{manufactured}} pop bands like The Monkees. [...] However, Tim Connors has stated that [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] also suggests certain ironies due to pre-fabricated aspects of the Byrds' own origin, including drummer Michael Clarke having been initially recruited for his good looks, rather than for his musical ability. [...] As a result of this, music journalist David Fricke has noted that some fans have mistaken [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] for an autobiographical song. [...] Hillman's driving bassline and McGuinn's chiming twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar riff form the core of the song, with the production being rounded off by the sound of screaming teenage fans, which had been recorded at a Byrds' concert in Bournemouth during the band's 1965 English tour. [...] South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela contributed the trumpet solo featured in the song, which represented the first use of brass on a Byrds' recording. [...] Masekela and the Byrds would later perform [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] together at the Monterey Pop Festival on June 17, 1967.|$|E
500|$|The band {{returned}} to the studio between November 28 and December 8, 1966 to record their fourth album, Younger Than Yesterday. [...] With Allen Stanton having recently departed Columbia Records to work for A, the band chose to bring in producer Gary Usher to help guide them through the album sessions. [...] Usher, who had a wealth of production experience and a love of innovative studio experimentation, would prove invaluable to the Byrds as they entered their most creatively adventurous phase. [...] The first song to be recorded for the album was the McGuinn and Hillman-penned [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star", a satirical and heavily sarcastic jibe at the manufactured nature of groups like the Monkees. [...] The song features the trumpet playing of South African musician Hugh Masekela and as such, marks the first appearance of brass on a Byrds' recording. [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] was issued as a single in January 1967 and peaked at number 29 in America but failed to chart in the UK. [...] Despite this relatively poor chart showing, [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] {{has become one of}} the Byrds' best-known songs in the years since its initial release, inspiring cover versions by the likes of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and the Patti Smith Group amongst others.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} preceded by the [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] single, which was {{released}} on January 9, 1967 and reached number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100, but failed to chart in the UK. [...] Two additional singles taken from the album, [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and [...] "Have You Seen Her Face", reached number 30 and number 74 on the Billboard chart respectively, but again missed the UK chart. [...] The [...] "My Back Pages" [...] single was the last single release by the Byrds to reach the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|The album also {{marked the}} {{emergence}} of the band's bass player Chris Hillman as a talented songwriter and vocalist. [...] Prior to Younger Than Yesterday, Hillman had only received one shared writing credit with the Byrds, but this album saw him credited as the sole composer of four songs and a co-writer of [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star". [...] Byrds expert Tim Connors has noted that two of Hillman's compositions on Younger Than Yesterday exhibited country and western influences and thus can be seen as early indicators of the country rock experimentation that would feature—to a greater or lesser degree—on all of the Byrds' subsequent albums.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the most}} {{surprising}} development within the Byrds at this time was the emergence of bass player Chris Hillman as both a lead vocalist and the band's third songwriter. [...] Prior to the recording of Younger Than Yesterday, Hillman had never sung lead vocals on a Byrds' recording and his only writing contribution with the band had been a shared credit for the instrumental track [...] "Captain Soul". [...] On this album, however, he is credited as the sole songwriter of [...] "Have You Seen Her Face", [...] "Time Between", [...] "Thoughts and Words", and [...] "The Girl with No Name", with all four tracks featuring him as the lead vocalist. [...] Hillman is also credited as the co-writer of [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star", which he sings with McGuinn and Crosby.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star", Younger Than Yesterday {{also includes the}} evocative Crosby and McGuinn penned song [...] "Renaissance Fair", a cover of Dylan's [...] "My Back Pages" [...] (which was later released as a single), and a quartet of Chris Hillman songs, which found the bassist emerging fully formed as an accomplished songwriter. [...] Two of Hillman's country-oriented compositions on the album, [...] "Time Between" [...] and [...] "The Girl with No Name", {{can be seen as}} early indicators of the country rock direction that the band would pursue on later albums. [...] Younger Than Yesterday also features the jazz-tinged Crosby ballad [...] "Everybody's Been Burned", which critic Thomas Ward has described as [...] "one of the most haunting songs in the Byrds' catalogue, and one of David Crosby's finest compositions." ...|$|E
500|$|In the UK, {{journalist}} Penny Valentine, {{writing in}} Disc magazine, described the album as {{a return to}} form for the Byrds, before declaring that the band were [...] "back where they belong with a sound as fresh as cream and sunflowers." [...] Melody Maker was also enthusiastic about the album, commenting, [...] "if you ignore this album you are not only foolish – but deaf!". [...] Record Mirror awarded the album four stars out of five and Allen Evans of the NME also praised the LP: [...] "This is an exciting album, at times brash and noisy ('So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star', 'Have You Seen Her Face'), spooky (the science-fiction outer-space sounds on 'C.T.A.-102'), folksy ('Everybody's Been Burned'), weird (the irritating, monotonous backing to 'Mind Gardens'), and pleasant (the soft swinging of 'The Girl with No Name'). A lot of thought has gone into this album and it's good because of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The two-record (Untitled) {{album was}} {{released}} by the Byrds on September 14, 1970 to positive reviews and strong sales, with many critics and fans regarding the album as a return to form for the band. [...] Peaking at number 40 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and number 11 in the UK, the album's success continued the upward trend in the band's commercial fortunes and popularity that had begun {{with the release of}} the Ballad of Easy Rider album. [...] The live half of (Untitled) included both new material and new renditions of previous hit singles, including [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] and a 16-minute version of [...] "Eight Miles High", which comprised the whole of one side of the original LP release. [...] Band biographer Johnny Rogan has noted that the inclusion of these newly recorded live versions of older songs served to forge a spiritual and musical link between the Byrds' current line-up and the original mid-1960s incarnation of the band.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and reached number 37 on the UK Albums Chart. [...] It {{was preceded by}} the [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] single in January 1967, which reached the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100. Two {{additional}} singles taken from the album, [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and [...] "Have You Seen Her Face", were also moderately successful on the Billboard singles chart. [...] However, none of the singles taken from the album charted in the United Kingdom. [...] Music critics Richie Unterberger and David Fricke have both noted that although it was largely overlooked by the public {{at the time of}} its release, the album's critical standing has improved over the years and today Younger Than Yesterday is considered one of the Byrds' best albums. [...] The title of Younger Than Yesterday is derived from the lyrics of [...] "My Back Pages", a song written by Bob Dylan, which was covered on the album.|$|E
500|$|While noting Yellow Submarines {{status as}} the Beatles' only [...] "inessential" [...] album, Richie Unterberger of AllMusic {{describes}} [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] as [...] "an odd piece of psychedelic ersatz, mixing trippiness and some personal comments". Referring to the revelations offered in the song, Unterberger adds: [...] "they present Harrison's vision of how music and recording sounded, from the inside-out and the outside-in, during the psychedelic era – the song thus provided a rare glimpse inside the doors of perception of being a Beatle (or, at least, one aspect of being this particular Beatle) circa 1967." [...] Writing for Billboard in 2001, Bill Holland grouped [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] with the Byrds' [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] and early-1970s releases by the Kinks and Joni Mitchell, as songs that constitute {{the first wave of}} musical statements in which artists [...] "accuse or indict their industry's business policies". Inglis views [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] as the Beatles' [...] "first 'postmodern' song", due to the [...] "deliberate ironic intent" [...] evident in the subject matter and in the use of tape effects and scattered conversation.|$|E
500|$|While {{the film}} portrays Andy {{escaping}} to freedom through a sewer pipe {{described as a}} [...] "river of shit," [...] Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer Terence Marsh. Of the scene, Robbins said, [...] "when you're doing a film, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good soldier—you don't {{want to be the}} one that gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety." [...] As for the scene were Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off. While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), they were originally intended to be watching Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. However, the footage was too costly to procure from Paramount Pictures, and producer Niki Marvin approached The Shawshank Redemptions domestic distribution rights-holder Columbia Pictures, who offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was Gilda.|$|E
