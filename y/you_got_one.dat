6000|$|... "Ah, that's {{the great}} thing," [...] said Isabel, smiling and suspecting that her {{acquaintance}} with this lightly flitting personage would {{not lead to}} intellectual repose. If the Countess objected to argument Isabel at this moment had as little taste for it, and she put out her hand to Pansy with a pleasant sense that such a gesture committed her to nothing that would admit of a divergence of views. Gilbert Osmond apparently took a rather hopeless view of his sister's tone; he turned the conversation to another topic. He presently {{sat down on the}} other side of his daughter, who had shyly brushed Isabel's fingers with her own; but he ended by drawing her out of her chair and making her stand between his knees, leaning against him while he passed his arm round her slimness. The child fixed her eyes on Isabel with a still, disinterested gaze which seemed void of an intention, yet conscious of an attraction. Mr. Osmond talked of many things; Madame Merle had said he could be agreeable when he chose, and to-day, after a little, he appeared not only to have chosen but to have determined. Madame Merle and the Countess Gemini sat a little apart, conversing in the effortless manner of persons who knew each other well enough to take their ease; but every now and then Isabel heard the Countess, at something said by her companion, plunge into the latter's lucidity as a poodle splashes after a thrown stick. It was as if Madame Merle were seeing how far she would go. Mr. Osmond talked of Florence, of Italy, of the pleasure of living in that country and of the abatements to the pleasure. There were both satisfactions and drawbacks; the drawbacks were numerous; strangers were too apt to see such a world as all romantic. It met the case soothingly for the human, for the social failure--by which he meant the people who couldn't [...] "realise," [...] as they said, on their sensibility: they could keep it about them there, in their poverty, without ridicule, as you might keep an heirloom or an inconvenient entailed place that brought you in nothing. Thus there were advantages in living in the country which contained the greatest sum of beauty. Certain impressions you could get only there. Others, favourable to life, you never got, and you got some that were very bad. But from time to time <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> of a quality that made up for everything. Italy, all the same, had spoiled a great many people; he was even fatuous enough to believe at times that he himself might have been a better man if he had spent less of his life there. It made one idle and dilettantish and second-rate; it had no discipline for the character, didn't cultivate in you, otherwise expressed, the successful social and other [...] "cheek" [...] that flourished in Paris and London. [...] "We're sweetly provincial," [...] said Mr. Osmond, [...] "and I'm perfectly aware that I myself am as rusty as a key that has no lock to fit it. It polishes me up a little to talk with you--not that I venture to pretend I can turn that very complicated lock I suspect your intellect of being! But you'll be going away before I've seen you three times, and I shall perhaps never see you after that. That's what it is to live in a country that people come to. When they're disagreeable here it's bad enough; when they're agreeable it's still worse. As soon as you like them they're off again! I've been deceived too often; I've ceased to form attachments, to permit myself to feel attractions. You mean to stay--to settle? That would be really comfortable. Ah yes, your aunt's a sort of guarantee; I believe she may be depended on. Oh, she's an old Florentine; I mean literally an old one; not a modern outsider. She's a contemporary of the Medici; she must have been present at the burning of Savonarola, and I'm not sure she didn't throw a handful of chips into the flame. Her face is very much like some faces in the early pictures; little, dry, definite faces that must have had a good deal of expression, but almost always the same one. Indeed I can show you her portrait in a fresco of Ghirlandaio's. I hope you don't object to my speaking that way of your aunt, eh? I've an idea you don't. Perhaps you think that's even worse. I assure you there's no want of respect in it, to either of you. You know I'm a particular admirer of Mrs. Touchett." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "One Heart" [...] was {{composed}} and produced by John Shanks and Kara Dioguardi. It is an upbeat, dance-pop song, which draws from club-friendly house anthems, {{about the power}} of love and how determination and support can help a person through their problems. Keyboards, resembling the twinkling beats of a music box, begin the single. As it shortly plays, Dion says [...] "one heart you are following." [...] In the beginning, she advises to look on the bright side, with lyrics such as, [...] "When you're down, you can start again/ Turn around anything you're in/ Love will find a place yeah." [...] In the chorus, she says if they let their hearts lead them, {{they will be able to}} stay focused on their dream. ("If <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> heart you are followin'/One dream keeps you wondering/Love lights your way through the night/One wish keeps you tryin'/What's your silver lining/Loves lights your way through the night.") A jaunty acoustic guitar and equally cheerful drums accompany Dion in the bridge. She stresses that people have to have a dream to believe in, in lines like, [...] "Everybody needs something to hold on to". Towards the end, she begins to wail a bit and extending some notes. At the end, she quietly says [...] "love will find a way/love will find a way in your heart." ...|$|E

So when they first dropped the ball on the project I stuck around with it, you know I stuck around because them my boys, shout out to Young Dro shouts out to Grand Hustle shouts out to Mac Boney shouts out to everybody in Grand Hustle, Jason Geter I see you, Jason Geter gave me my first car u feel me, so it ain't no bad blood. But its just that I'm 24 years old I ain't fitting to sit on the shelf and wait on you'll till im 30 and I'm hot." [...] Austin also discussed getting stabbed multiple times by the mother of his child and not having any of his Grand Hustle label-mates visit him while he was in the hospital, stating [...] "I called Jason I had got stabbed up, I got war wounds and everything on me, my baby mama stabbed me up you know what I'm saying 6 to 7 times, I got to DeKalb Medical I'm calling Jason, I'm calling Clay, all the executives at Grand Hustle like look brah I'm fucked up, I'm down here crying and everything, I just got stabbed up, but didn't nobody come see me, you know how much that hurt me. You'll suppose to be my family, I'm out here rocking you'll P$C chain, n**** i'm getting into beef with n****'s in the streets cause Tip got beef with Shawty Lo and these n****'s got beef with these n****'s way before I came to Grand Hustle. I had just got into Grand Hustle I'm picking you'll n****'s beef you see what I'm saying at the end of the day you see what I'm saying. At the end of the day I felt like my best situation was to sit down with Jason and let him know I want my release papers dog, I want my walking papers whatever I gotta pay you'll whatever it gone to take, im ready to walk, because my name big enough right now I gotta big enough buzz and a big enough fanbase to say f*** it I'm a do this s*** independent, let me get all my money you feel me.

5000|$|Mikhail Khodorkovsky, I {{am writing}} to you from Finland. My name is Polina Zherebtsova. I am a {{political}} refugee from Russia. From contemporary Russia, which for many, many years has been ruled by Mr. Putin. All my life I have kept a diary. And it so happened that I {{was born in the}} Caucasus, in the city of Grozny. When I was nine years old my city was surrounded by a ring of Russian tanks - and houses were turned into ruins and ashes along with their inhabitants. Has your home been shelled by a tank, Mr Khodorkovsky? Mine was. The upper floors of the apartment building were on fire, and children were screaming in unbearable pain: shrapnel tore their bodies. My grandfather, a veteran of the Second World War, was in the hospital on Pervomayskaya Street, but was killed in the shelling. He was recovering - my mother and I were going to take him home. We could not bury him for a week. There was fighting. I know you have been through a lot, have been imprisoned. But tell me - can you imagine how the patients scream when the guns are firing at their hospital or when a jet bomber, invisible and invulnerable to their curses, drops a one-and-a-half ton bomb on them? We looked for where the snow was cleaner, gathered it up and strained it through cloth so we would drink it. It was not white snow, not at all like the snow I can see just now in Finland. It was dark gray and bitter, because there were burning buildings all around. An oil plant was on fire, and whole neighborhoods of homes were burning. Before they reached living human flesh, the bombs tore up stone and concrete. And the houses were full of people, and they had nowhere to run to. We fell from hunger, lying about in the corners of apartments, half submerged in basements. And the rats huddled against the cold at our feet and squeaked. The rats slept with me in the hallway on the icy wooden floor, and I didn't chase them away, realizing that even they were suffering from [...] "Russian democracy" [...] Our cats died, unable to withstand the diet of pickled tomatoes we fed them once every few days. To get at least some food, you had to walk about in other people's basements, where the conquerors had left thin silver threads, and if you stepped on one of those threads you would go straight to heaven. And {{do you want to hear}} how I stood near the concrete slabs under which for three days in the centre of Grozny, choking in the wreckage and cement dust, Russian old folk died? No one was able to raise the slabs and remove the debris! People wept and prayed, but could not do anything. Those who died under the ruins of their houses did not get a grave in [...] "the land we won." [...] This hell was repeated many times in ten years: as long as the war lasted in the Caucasus, in the Chechen Republic. In August 1996 rockets from a Russian military post flew into the staircase of our apartment building: our neighbours were blown to pieces. I was eleven years old at the time. I came out into the front entrance of our building and my feet sank ankle-deep in blood. Blood dripped from the walls and ceiling, and I could hear the surviving neighbours screaming in terrible agony. Since then, Mr Khodorkovsky, I do not believe Russia's rulers. I do not think that this is the price of conquering the land and preserving its integrity. This was done by [...] "weaklings" [...] - because a strong man will not assert himself at the expense of the lives of women and children. Essentially they are traitors of their own people. In 1999, when the [...] "humanitarian corridors" [...] of refugees were shelled, burning people alive in buses, we could not get out of the city. And on October 21, 1999 Grozny market was hit by a rocket. In the afternoon, when thousands of people were crowded there. It was later announced that this was a [...] "market of terrorists" [...] with whom the invaders were fighting. [...] "Terrorists" [...] was the name they gave to the children, the old folk and women who traded vegetables, sweets, bread, cigarettes, newspapers, etc. And the market was called the [...] "arms market," [...] but I never saw weapons there, although sometimes I would spend a whole day going round all the stalls with a box of stuff. During the holidays or after school I could not rest - I had to work in order to survive. I traded in that market place. There were no pensions, no salaries. People did their best to survive. For a year my mother received no salary. It was stolen. And we traded in order to survive and buy bread. They did not have to start [...] "conquering us", turning our lives into one continuous strip of hell. Our lives were already hard enough without bombs and [...] "Grad" [...] installations. When the rocket hit Grozny market I was three blocks away from the place where it landed. I saw fire from the ground to the sky, and then I heard a deafening explosion. In my legs there were sixteen fragments of shrapnel. And what happened to the people who were closer to the rocket? Severed arms, legs, heads, bodies turned to dust. The children found their mother by her hairpins or the buttons on her jacket... Did anyone get an apology? Or compensation for this hell? Did anyone? I got nothing except threats and being told to [...] "shut your mouth", as I was a true witness to these bloody events. Here is the face of the modern Russian government. Killing, slandering and grabbing. And this is called [...] "conquest"? In 2000, On January 19, the surviving neighbours and my mother and I were threatened with execution by firing squad. We were on the edge of a cliff and the soldiers fired over our heads. Our old granny neighbour fell to her knees, crying: [...] "What are you doing? We're your people! We're Russians! Don't shoot!" [...] The Caucasus is a peculiar region. In it, cultures and ethnicities, ways of life and cuisines, have been interwoven. Of the forty-eight apartments in our building ten were Chechen and the rest - Russian, Armenian, Gypsy, Azeri, Ingush, Jewish, Polish... We lived together amicably until the war began. The war swept everything away: life, friendship, love. It destroyed everything. Surviving in inhuman conditions, people from the Chechen Republic n the other regions of Russia faced and still face the most vile discrimination, persecution and threats. The authorities have no time for their stories of mass executions and extrajudicial kilings. All, regardless of ethnicity, are classed as [...] "Chechens." [...] I have come up against this, too. For about a year I was refused a passport. But <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> in a single day, and were even kindly driven to the gangway of a private jet. Double standards - those are precisely what distinguish despotism from democracy... I was very sympathetic to you when you were in prison. I considered the sentences you were given unjust, political. Even now I think that you may have been subjected to pressure. But you in your interview you said: [...] "Putin is no weakling. I am ready to fight in order to keep the North Caucasus as part of our country. This is our land, we conquered and won it!" [...] Consider: now you will have to share responsibility for those war crimes, which in the Caucasus are not the costs of [...] "conquest", but its essence. Read my diary. Read how we were conquered. How we buried our murdered neighbours under fire, having first covered the graves with branches so that the hungry dogs would not tear the bodies apart. How thousands of women and children were murdered in the Chechen Republic. Do you still want integration with such a Russia? I do not. And I do not need their citizenship. I am embarrassed by it, like the shameful brand-mark on a slave.Polina Zherebtsova23.12.2013 ...|$|E
