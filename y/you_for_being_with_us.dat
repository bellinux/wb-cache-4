40|$|To {{speak about}} the complex reality of China in {{meaningful}} terms {{is a very difficult}} task, and to reflect on business education and its mission in this context is an even bigger challenge. We are very fortunate to have Professor Henri-Claude de Bettignies sharing his experiences and thoughts with us. For a significant part of his life, Professor de Bettignies has been engaged in understanding business in East Asia and China and building bridges between the East and the West. He has showed a strong commitment to assist Chinese business people in raising their ethical awareness and to help steer them through a great deal of complex ethical situations. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> Before discussing several more specific points, I would like to emphasize the importance of what Henri-Claude said in his introduction. In fact, China has been facing enormous challenges in her development over the last 30 years, and it is hard to overestimate the gravity of those multiple difficulties. Unfortunately, China watchers and critics from abroad too often do not grasp the complexity of China’s process of reform and opening-up and too easily slide into China bashing that deflects the attention from the real problems that exist. The Chinese are still mindful of the invasion of Western powers in the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Thus, when the West thinks i...|$|E

This study is dedicated to my father, Freddy Higgs (1941 - 2001) and my mother Yvonne Higgs. Their hard work and sacrifices to provide me with the life that I have today can never be measured. A special thank you goes to my dedicated mom, for all her love and support over the years away from home. For all the weekly phone calls to encourage me to pull through the tough times, I will be forever grateful. The most motivating quote from her being; “If you think you can, you can. If you think you can’t, you can’t. Either way you will prove yourself right. ” And now I have proved that I can. Thank you to my immediate family, my wonderful Granny, Mrs Yvette Bartleman for her continuous support and the lovely holidays I spend with her on the farm. To my sister Yvette Payn and niece Bianca Payn and my brother Percy Higgs, for their support and encouragement over the years. A special thank you to my fiancé, Shaun Franklin. Without your love and support over the past years, I would not have achieved my goal and passion in life as a chiropractor.

60|$|You see {{we are in}} London after all, {{and poor}} Sidmouth left afar. I am almost {{inclined}} to say 'poor us' instead of 'poor Sidmouth.' But I dare say I shall {{soon be able to}} see in my dungeon, and begin to be amused with the spiders. Half my soul, in the meantime, seems to have stayed behind on the seashore, which I love more than ever now that I cannot walk on it in the body. London is wrapped up like a mummy, in a yellow mist, so closely that I have had scarcely a glimpse of its countenance since we came. Well, I am trying to like it all very much, and I dare say that in time I may change my taste and my senses--and succeed. We are in a house large enough to hold us, for four months, {{at the end of which}} time, if the experiment of our being able to live in London succeed, I believe that papa's intention is to take an unfurnished house and have his furniture from Ledbury. You may wonder at me, but I wish that were settled so, and now. I am satisfied with London, although I cannot enjoy it. We are not likely, in the case of leaving it, to return to Devonshire, and I should look with weary eyes to another strangership and pilgrimage even among green fields that know not these fogs. Papa's object in settling here refers to my brothers. George will probably enter as a barrister student at the Inner Temple on the fifth or sixth of this month, and he will have the advantage of his home by our remaining where we are. Another advantage of London is, that we shall see here those whom we might see nowhere else. This year, dear Mrs. Martin, may it bring with it the true pleasure of seeing you! Three have gone, and we have not seen you.... May God bless you and all that <b>you</b> care <b>for,</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> always as the God of consolation and peace.|$|R

The question is, what makes a school Catholic? How does faith permeate a school in terms of its documents, practices and the people involved? The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate faith permeation in education. This case study examines how Catholicity is integrated into a small elementary school's mission statement, policies, curriculum, and staff/community relationships. Evidence of faith permeation will be examined through an evaluation of school documents, a questionnaire of staff and interviews of three teachers and three parents. Through a reflective narrative account, it explores the history of Catholic education in Alberta and the guiding literature that has shaped one school's perspective. I will unearth any evidence of faith permeation in the case study school, which will allow me to describe the purpose of Catholic education. This project attempts to address implications for the future of Catholic education i...|$|R
