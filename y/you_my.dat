5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I can only tell <b>you</b> <b>my</b> own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too {{sure that it is}} right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E

I Brought <b>You</b> <b>My</b> Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, the band's debut album, features a raw sound that has guitar riffs, very energetic vocals and sometimes screaming.

The band's album The Black Parade lacks the post-hardcore elements featured on the first two My Chemical Romance albums and features elements of pop punk, emo and punk rock. The fourth My Chemical Romance album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys continues the band's alternative rock and pop punk sound with some new elements of power pop, pop rock and electronic rock.|$|E

25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely.

If I lose <b>you,</b> <b>my</b> loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
