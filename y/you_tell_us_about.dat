BEGINNINGS The morning of the day Dpal 'bum first started for Chengdu City, his mother, Mtsho mo, got up earlier than usual and prepared food. His stepfather, whom he called Uncle Bzang kho, had also risen and stepped {{to the back of}} the room where he burned the leaves of an aromatic plant to beseech the deities for blessings, particularly hoping that Dpal 'bum would successfully graduate in two years. Bzang kho awakened Dpal 'bum and told him to have breakfast, which included beef, bread, and milk tea – a common Tibetan meal.

40|$|Are we {{living in}} the "golden age" of cosmology? Are we close to {{understanding}} {{the nature of the}} unknown ingredients of the currently most accepted cosmological model and the physics of the early Universe? Or are we instead approaching a paradigm shift? What is dark matter and does it exist? How is it distributed around galaxies and clusters? Is the scientific community open to alternative ideas that may prompt a new scientific revolution - as the Copernican revolution did in Galileo's time? Do other types of supernovae exist that can be of interest for cosmology? Why have quasars never been effectively used as standard candles? Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the scientific adventure of COBE? How does the extraction of the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy depend on the subtraction of the various astrophysical foregrounds? These, among many others, are the astrophysical, philosophical and sociological questions surrounding modern cosmology and the scientific community that Mauro D'Onofrio and Carlo Burigana pose {{to some of the most}} prominent cosmologists of our time.

40|$|CSIRO) had on {{its hands}} {{a group of}} {{brilliant}} young men. What was {{the culture of the}} place at that time and who was the leader? It was an interesting situation at that time because there were two outstanding people: Joe Pawsey (Christiansen and Mills 1964) and Taffy Bowen. They were miles apart in their outlook on life. Pawsey was a first-rate scientist but had no interest in administration or organi-zation. Bowen, on the other hand, was a bril-liant organizer and administrator but, in my view, a poor scientist. The two together made a very powerful combination. However, there was friction there. This grew with the years and towards the end, before I left, there were two distinct camps. I belonged clearly to the Pawsey camp. So it was an extremely interesting time and Pawsey was a very stimulating group leader. The first thing I remember on joining Radio-physics was when he gave a course of lectures on a very mathematical approach and he produced a physical approach. I was working with him a lot during the war. After the war I became interested in radio astronomy. Pawsey was my mentor really. He was outstanding; there’s no question about that. He {{was one of the best}} of the people there by a long shot. He used to leave you very much to yourself. But having talked over a problem you’d go away and do it. If you had any prob-lems arising as a result of your problem you could always go back to Pawsey and he would always come up with some suggestions.
