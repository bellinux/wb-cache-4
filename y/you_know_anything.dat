I don't know what you're doing. You're doing A, D, F, G, B, D, C. You don't know how to write a song... Have you ever listened to pop music? Have you ever heard any rock-and-roll music... You should go downstairs when you leave here... and buy some rock-and-roll records.|$|E
500|$|Author Brandon Friedman, also {{a combat}} veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, shared a similar view at VetVoice: [...] "The Hurt Locker is a high-tension, well-made, action movie that will {{certainly}} keep most viewers {{on the edges}} of their seats. But if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about the Army, or about operations or life in Iraq, you'll be so distracted by the nonsensical sequences and plot twists that it will ruin the movie for you. It certainly did for me." [...] Friedman criticized the inaccuracy of the film's representation of combat, saying [...] "in real life, EOD techs don't conduct dangerous missions as autonomous three-man teams without communications gear ... Another thing you'll rarely hear in combat is an EOD E-7 suggesting to two or three of his guys that they leave the scene of an explosion in an Iraqi city by saying: 'C'mon, let's split up. We can cover more ground that way.|$|E
2500|$|Gerson Saines brought Grandin {{to observe}} {{the last day of}} shooting, which was a scene {{involving}} a cattle dip tank that Grandin had designed. Although Grandin said that she tried to stay away from Danes to avoid impinging on her performance, she was quite concerned about the proper construction of the tank and about the breed of cattle being used in the scene. [...] "I thought, we can't have a silly thing like that City Slickers movie, where they had Holstein cattle out there," [...] Grandin said. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about cattle, you'd know that was stupid." [...] She said watching Danes on the monitors was [...] "like going back in a weird time machine to the '60s." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, she {{ran for the}} 14th District seat in the Ohio Senate {{to replace}} Senate President Doug White, who was retiring. The Senate seat {{included}} Clermont, Brown, Adams and Scioto counties and part of Lawrence County. Her opponent for the Republican nomination was Tom Niehaus, a fellow member of the Ohio House from New Richmond whose 88th District represented the half of Clermont County outside her district plus Brown and Adams Counties to the east. Schmidt told the Enquirer [...] "The fear {{from many of the}} people I meet is that because the next senator will come from Clermont County, they will be underrepresented. But if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about me, I don't under-represent anybody." [...] She also said she worried about the state budget: [...] "We do have a history of overspending in Ohio. But it's not just recent history. It's a 40-year-old habit." [...] The Enquirer was dismayed by advertisements from the Ohio Taxpayers Association [...] "twisting the two candidates' voting records to Schmidt's advantage" [...] and endorsed Niehaus.|$|E
2500|$|Ricky Bell sat out {{the game}} with a {{shoulder}} injury, and Darryl Carlton left the game early. Tampa Bay quarterbacks were sacked ten times (still a team record as of 2009), and threw three interceptions. Eddie Brown's 11 punt returns set an NFL single-game record, also still standing. John McKay reacted angrily to Washington tackle Bill Brundige's postgame remarks that McKay's USC offense wouldn’t work in the NFL. McKay called Brundige an [...] "idiot" [...] and a [...] "dumb tackle", and pointed out that the Redskins scored their first touchdown from the same formation. He then told reporters, [...] "none of <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about football", and chided them for asking why the Buccaneers were having trouble moving the ball, when they knew that several starters were out with injuries. The Tampa Bay defense held Washington to ten points, despite the Redskins’ eight possessions in Buccaneer territory. Washington players described it as {{among the best in the}} league, and coach George Allen said it was [...] "of championship caliber". [...] The 18th consecutive loss tied the Buccaneers with the 1972–1973 Houston Oilers for the third longest NFL losing streak.|$|E

2500|$|In an Express-Times {{article about}} Flanagan, Owens recalled: [...] "He {{was the kind}} of guy -- rock-solid {{reliable}} -- that if he was working a shift, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> that came along would be handled.
