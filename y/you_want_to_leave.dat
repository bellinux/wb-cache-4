"Drive" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Will Made It, Cyrus, Pierre Ramon Slaughter, and Samuel Jean; it was {{produced}} by Mike Will Made It, with co-production by P-Nasty, and engineered by Chris [...] "Tek" [...] O'Ryan. Stephen Hybicki recorded the song, which was later mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Ryan Kaul. Cyrus commented that the song was written on Valentine's Day in 2013, which was [...] "emotionally [...] such a hard time"; she elaborated that the track was [...] "about needing to leave someone but not really wanting to completely cut yourself off from the relationship. It’s a time when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> but you can’t. It’s also about moving on." [...] It has been widely speculated to {{have been inspired by}} Cyrus' former fiancé Liam Hemsworth.|$|E

"Mister Weston," [...] said Ben, gravely, as {{he pushed}} his plate farther on the table, and arose from his seat {{as if he had}} a long speech to deliver, [...] "us fellers have seen that you wasn't feelin' very nice at havin' to stay with us, an' we kinder thought <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> us 'cause things didn't go to suit you." ...|$|R

60|$|Haven't I? I suppose I must shut my {{eyes and}} say nothing. You're in love with her. D'you think I've not seen it in these months? That's why <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "I've hustled round since sun-up and {{imagined}} the gang could get along {{for half an}} hour without my watching. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> something to your foremen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't leave me! There, I {{knew it was}} that. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>want</b> Nurse <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you?</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> her <b>to</b> be {{with you}} every minute?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Porter, I don't {{want any}} such talk from you!" [...] and now Ward Porton doubled up his fists and {{stuck out his}} chin. [...] "I've stood all I am going to stand from <b>you.</b> I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> me alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So that's what's a-ranklin' in your heart, is it? <b>You</b> <b>want</b> us <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> do <b>you?</b> There's {{too many}} on us. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> us <b>to</b> {{pack up and}} swim. Is that it? Come!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't {{want you}} to go away. I won't let you go away," [...] she said, a trace of fierceness {{mingling}} with her entreaty. [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> me if you love me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You don't {{have to know}} {{a person}} to tell her your troubles. I {{sometimes}} tell mine to the cat that camps out on the wall opposite my room. What did <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country for, with summer coming on?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My advice is," [...] he said, finally, [...] "to let 'em draw {{cuts for}} Elmhurst. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> your {{money to the}} best o' the lot, you're as sure of {{striking}} it right that way as any other." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{a minute}} or two Ned bore the reproof in silence, and then he spoke. [...] "If you are unhappy, Tom, I can bear a good deal; but don't overdo it,--unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” I said, “if {{you mean}} that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the room I will confess to you that I can’t very well do it yet. But I could lock both doors if you don’t mind that.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Sympson Grove directly. You packed {{your things}} up, and papa threw {{them out of}} your trunk; mamma cried, Mrs. Pryor cried; they both stood {{wringing}} their hands begging you to be patient; and you knelt {{on the floor with}} your things and your up-turned box before you, looking, Shirley, looking--why, in one of your passions. Your features, in such passions, are not distorted; they are fixed, but quite beautiful. You scarcely look angry, only resolute, and in a certain haste; yet one feels that at such times an obstacle cast across your path would be split as with lightning. Papa lost heart, and called Mr. Moore." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hallam laughed, {{though the}} glint {{in his eyes}} did not express good will. [...] "You have got a temper {{that will be the}} ruin of you, and don't know when a man's too big for you, while, now I come to look at you, there's a lump on your {{forehead}} that makes the thing quite plain. You have been fooling with Alton, and he has 'most pounded the life out of you. Still, what do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country for, anyway?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] Hartley {{was going}} on, [...] "I'm {{going to just}} quietly leave a book on her centre-table. I don't know as it'll {{interest}} her much, but it'll show we appreciate the grub, and so on. By jinks! you don't seem to realize what a worker that woman is! Up five o'clock in the morning--By-the-way, you've been going around with the girl a good deal, and she's introduced you to some first-rate sales; now, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> her a little something, make it a morocco copy, and charge it to the firm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look here, my good girl, we haven't {{the least}} {{intention}} of keeping {{you in the}} dark. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> your mistress {{like this in the}} midst of her anxieties she says you can go and welcome. But it's not a bit of good in the world coming up with these cock-and-bull stories. The truth is your master's mad, that's the sober truth of it--hopelessly insane, you understand; and we've got to find him. But nothing's to be said, d'ye see? It's got to be done without fuss or scandal. But if there's any witness wanted, or anything of that kind, why, here you are; and,' he dropped his voice to an almost inaudible hoot, 'and well worth your while! You did see him, eh? Step into the trap, and all that?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That may all be true, an' I don't dispute it," [...] said Ben; [...] "but you see you didn't {{stay with}} your uncle Daniel {{when you had}} the chance, an' you did come with the circus. You've told Job <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> an' he 'll be watchin' {{you all the time}} to see that you don't give him the slip. Now what's the consequence? Why, you can't get away for a while, anyhow, an' you'd better try to amount to {{something}} while you are here. Perhaps after you've got so you can ride <b>you</b> may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> stay; an' I'll see to it that you get all of your wages, except enough to pay Castle for learnin' of you." ...|$|R

6000|$|DON JUAN. Then {{you must}} stay here; for hell {{is the home}} of the unreal and of the seekers for happiness. It is the only refuge from heaven, which is, as I tell you, the home of the masters of reality, and from earth, which {{is the home of}} the slaves of reality. The earth is a nursery in which men and women play at being heros and heroines, saints and sinners; but they are dragged down from their fool's paradise by their bodies: hunger and cold and thirst, age and decay and disease, death above all, make them slaves of reality: thrice a day meals must be eaten and digested: thrice a century a new {{generation}} must be engendered: ages of faith, of romance, and of science are all driven at last to have but one prayer, [...] "Make me a healthy animal." [...] But here you escape the tyranny of the flesh; for here you are not an animal at all: you are a ghost, an appearance, an illusion, a convention, deathless, ageless: in a word, bodiless. There are no social questions here, no political questions, no religious questions, best of all, perhaps, no sanitary questions. Here you call your appearance beauty, your emotions love, your sentiments heroism, your aspirations virtue, just as you did on earth; but here there are no hard facts to contradict you, no ironic contrast of your needs with your pretensions, no human comedy, nothing but a perpetual romance, a universal melodrama. As our German friend put it in his poem, [...] "the poetically nonsensical here is good sense; and the Eternal Feminine draws us ever upward and on"--without getting us a step farther. And yet <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> this paradise! ...|$|E
