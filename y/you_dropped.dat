5|$|The Drug in Me Is You was speculated by news source Perez Hilton to sell {{anywhere}} from 17,000 to 20,000 copies in the United States {{during its first}} week of sales, placing it close behind predicted debuting chart toppers Eric Church (Chief), Kelly Rowland (Here I Am), and Joss Stone (LP1). The album ended up selling 18,120 copies in its first week in the United States, charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200. This almost exactly matched the first week sales of Escape the Fate (2010), the third album by Radke's former band, though Escape the Fate only charted at number 25, six spots lower than The Drug in Me Is You, despite equal sales. In its second week on sales, The Drug in Me is <b>You</b> <b>dropped</b> about 70% in the United States, selling 5,870 copies. This dropped the album 60 spots to number 79 on the Billboard 200, and brought total US sales for the album to around 24,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|In {{its second}} week, Dreaming of You fell to number {{three on the}} Billboard 200 chart, and {{remained}} there for two consecutive weeks. Sales of Dreaming of You continued to decrease, falling to number six in its fourth week. In its fifth week, Dreaming of <b>You</b> <b>dropped</b> to number eight. Starting in its sixth week, the album remained in the top twenty of the Billboard 200 chart. On the week ending October 28, 1995, sales of Dreaming of You rose 18% after an eighteen-week decline. This {{was followed by the}} highly publicized murder trial. The album remained on the Billboard 200 chart for forty-four consecutive weeks, exiting the chart at number 181 on the week ending June 1, 1996. Lannert predicted Dreaming of You would remain atop the Latin music charts until Selena's next posthumous release. It remained at number one for forty-two consecutive weeks until Enrique Iglesias displaced it with his self-titled debut album on the week ending May 25, 1996. Dreaming of You {{went on to become the}} best-selling Latin and Latin pop album of 1995 and 1996.|$|E
