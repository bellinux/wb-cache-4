500|$|Critics had a {{negative}} reaction to the pay-per-view, with the only match that received praise being the Hardy Boyz versus MNM tag team match.Two shows are on my list for this category, one from November and one from December. Can <b>you</b> <b>guess?</b> Cyber Sunday and the ill-fated December to Dismember. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070604194439/http://www.twnpnews.com/columns/messages/3901.shtml |archivedate = 2007-06-04}} Slam! Sports rated the pay-per-view 4 out of 10 stars, stating, [...] "the two matches that were promoted saved this thing from being a debacle". In the 2006 Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards, the event was voted the [...] "worst major wrestling show of the year".|$|E
500|$|Receiving empathically, in NVC, {{involves}} [...] "connection with what's {{alive in}} the other person and what would make life wonderful for them... It's not {{an understanding of the}} head where we just mentally understand what another person says... Empathic connection is an understanding of the heart in which we see the beauty in the other person, the divine energy in the other person, the life that's {{alive in the}}m... It doesn't mean we have to feel the same feelings as the other person. That's sympathy, when we feel sad that another person is upset. It doesn't mean we have the same feelings; it means we are with the other person... If you're mentally trying to understand the other person, you're not present with them." [...] Empathy involves [...] "emptying the mind and listening with our whole being." [...] NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs <b>you</b> <b>guess</b> they may be expressing.|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can <b>you</b> <b>guess</b> what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{peaked in}} the Top40 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It was {{reviewed}} by Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald, who felt [...] "Blasko {{works in the}} territory where Ed Harcourt and Fiona Apple shine, taking {{some of the new}} acoustic framework (think Turin Brakes) and some of the folk-meets-electronica stuff that came out in the post-Portishead years and applies them to straightforward pop songs". Allmusic's Tammy La Gorce finds Blasko is [...] "an entrancing artist who sings exceptionally well but is bent on making <b>you</b> <b>guess</b> what brews within her heart rather than pouring it out to you". Triple J declared it the Feature Album of the Week because it is [...] "a beautiful encapsulation of her life and influences and a showcase for her truly amazing voice".|$|E
