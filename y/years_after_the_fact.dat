5000|$|His mother, Charlotte de L'Aubespine, {{daughter}} of François, marquis de Hauterive by his wife, Eléonore de Volvire, marquise de Ruffec, descended from a distinguished family, noble {{since at least}} the time of Francis I. She was a formidable woman whose word was law in the family, and became more so in extreme old age. Her son Louis was well educated, largely by her, for whom Louis XIV and Queen Marie-Thérèse stood sponsor. After further tuition from the Jesuits, he joined the Mousquetaires gris in 1692, serving at the Siege of Namur and at the Battle of Neerwinden. Then he embarked upon his life's mission by pronouncing upon the precedence among French peers, much against the orders and interests of François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg, his victorious general. Saint-Simon fought in a couple more military campaigns, although not under Luxembourg. In 1695 he married Marie-Gabrielle de Durfort, {{daughter of}} Guy-Aldonce, duc de Lorges, a marshal of France, later serving under the Duke's command. He seems to have regarded her with a respect and affection unusual between husband and wife in that era; and she sometimes succeeded in suppressing his pompous ideals. As he did not receive further promotion in the army, he resigned his commission in 1702, thereby incurring Louis XIV's displeasure. He kept his position at court but only with difficulty, and then immersed himself in court intrigue at Versailles, tapping a collection of informants, the likes of dukes as well as servants, which later yielded him the benefit of an extraordinary amount of privileged information. Saint-Simon, for his own part, appears to have played only an intermediate role in court life. Having previously served in London, he was nominated as ambassador to Rome in 1705, but the appointment was cancelled before he departed. At last he attached himself to Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, Louis XIV's nephew and the future regent. Though this was hardly likely to ingratiate him with Louis, it at least gave him the status of belonging to a definite party and it eventually placed him in the position of friend to the acting chief of state. He also allied himself with Louis, Duke of Burgundy, the Dauphin's son and next heir to the French throne. Saint-Simon loathed [...] "the bastards," [...] Louis XIV's illegitimate children, and not, apparently, entirely because they were accorded ceremonial precedence above France's peers. The Saint-Simon that is revealed through the Mémoires had many enemies, and a hatred reciprocated by many courtiers. However, it should be remembered that these reminiscences were written 30 <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts,</b> by a disappointed man, and that Saint-Simon had maintained congenial or at least courteous relations with the majority of his fellow courtiers.|$|R

40|$|Shared {{beliefs about}} war atrocities {{committed}} {{not only by}} the outgroup but also by the in-group {{play a major role in}} post-conflict reconciliation.

On the contrary, in order to achieve a sound reconciliation, it is important to recognize the responsibilities of both victims and perpetrators (Nadler & Shnabel, 2008). Our contribution aims to explore consequences on young Italians of different typologies of narration about in-group war crimes committed during the invasion of Ethiopia (1935 - 36). These atrocities are well-know by historians but still unknown to the vast majority of Italians (Del Boca, 1995). In particular we are developing a line of research exploring the effects of evasive vs. parrhesiastic (Foucalt, 1983) narratives. We hypothesise that speaking the truth about in-group war crimes is a more effective social action since it not only recognises the needs of empowerment of the victims, but also enables descendants of perpetrators to frankly come to terms with their history (Leone & Sarrica, 2012). Data were collected trough quasi-experimental procedures. Dependent variables were measured through multiple tools including self-reports, FACS, multimodal analysis of reactions, observation of restorative behaviours. Results show that young people exposed to parrhesiastic narratives about in-group war crimes display more surprise, anger and negative emotions than those exposed to evasive description. However, they also show more restorative intentions. Theoretical and applicative developments are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|After {{moving to}} Los Angeles, California, at the {{invitation}} of Blackie Lawless, and arriving on February 4, 1982, Fox played bass-guitar in several bands, including Steeler, Sin, and W.A.S.P.. Although the band was called Sister upon his arrival, relatively speaking, he was only briefly associated with W.A.S.P. for several weeks, and recorded a 'live' three-track cassette demo. He claims to have come up with the name [...] "W.A.S.P.", (there were no periods in the band name at this time—which was validated in an interview by former W.A.S.P. guitarist Randy Piper). The idea is said to have occurred to him after he stepped on a wasp in the courtyard of the house where he lived with band leader Blackie Lawless. The story of W.A.S.P. is retold in the books Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal by David Konow, and [...] "W.A.S.P.; A Sting in the Tale" [...] by Darren P. Upton, As stated, this is confirmed by W.A.S.P. guitarist Randy Piper at a time of Piper's height of drug and alcohol abuse, as well as in several online interviews with him. On the other hand, some who witnessed the formation of W.A.S.P. explain that Rik Fox participated in <b>the</b> band <b>after</b> drummer Tony Richards showed up in the scene; according to Richards, the name was not Circus Circus when he joined the band. Fox contends that to his recollection, the band was named Sister when he joined. Lawless has since begrudgingly confirmed that Rik Fox had indeed, been a band member but, 'only for a couple of rehearsals', which may not be entirely accurate, since Fox spent some 4 months rehearsing and writing with the band.
