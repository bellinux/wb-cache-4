5|$|All true {{caterpillars}} have an upside-down <b>Y-shaped</b> {{line that}} runs {{from the top of}} the head downward. In between the <b>Y-shaped</b> line lies the frontal triangle or frons. The clypeus, located below the frons, lies between the two antennae. The labrum is found below the clypeus. There is a small notch in the centre of the labrum with which the leaf edge engages when the caterpillar eats.|$|E
5|$|Some caterpillars, {{especially}} {{members of}} Papilionidae, contain an osmeterium, a <b>Y-shaped</b> protrusible gland {{found in the}} prothoracic segment of the larvae. When threatened, the caterpillar emits unpleasant smells from the organ {{to ward off the}} predators.|$|E
5|$|Tremella mesenterica {{may also}} be {{confused}} {{with members of the}} Dacrymycetaceae family, like Dacrymyces chrysospermus (formerly D.palmatus), due to their superficial resemblance. Microscopic examination shows that the Dacrymycetaceae have <b>Y-shaped</b> basidia with two spores, unlike the longitudinally split basidia characteristic of Tremella; additionally, D.chrysospermus is smaller, has a whitish attachment point to its substrate, and grows on conifer wood.|$|E
5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a <b>Y-shaped</b> configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} at the {{anterior}} end, and opens into an elongated muscular pharynx with a triangular or <b>Y-shaped</b> lumen, lined by myoepithelial cells. The pharynx opens into a cylindrical intestine, which is lined with glandular and digestive cells. The anus {{is located on the}} ventral surface close to the posterior of the body. In some species, there are pores in the pharynx opening to the ventral surface; these contain valves and may allow egestion of any excess water swallowed while feeding.|$|E
5|$|Like on Morton Road before it, {{the portion}} of Church Road {{that is part of}} NY360 was sparsely populated, save for a portion of the road near its {{junction}} with Lake Road West Fork. Roughly halfway between Redman Road and Lake Road West Fork, NY360 passed over Sandy Creek. At Lake Road West Fork, NY360 veered southeast. As NY360 continued along the roadway, the amount of development increased as the route approached of the hamlet of Hamlin. North of the hamlet's center, NY360 met NY19 (Lake Road East Fork) at a <b>Y-shaped</b> intersection. NY360 ended here, and NY19 continued southward into Hamlin as Lake Road.|$|E
5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of a cuticle, an epidermis and longitudinal and circular bands of muscle fibres. In some primitive species, each epidermal cell has a single cilium, a feature shared only by the gnathostomulans. The whole ventral surface of the animal may be ciliated or the cilia may be arranged in rows, patches or transverse bands. The cuticle is locally thickened in some gastrotrichs and forms scales, hooks and spines. There is no coelom (body cavity) and {{the interior of the}} animal is filled with poorly differentiated connective tissue. In the macrodasyidans, <b>Y-shaped</b> cells, each containing a vacuole, surround the gut and may function as a hydrostatic skeleton.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} of the south polar region {{is marked by a}} pattern of parallel, Y- and V-shaped ridges and valleys. The shape, orientation, and location of these features suggest they are caused by changes in the overall shape of Enceladus. As of 2006 there were two theories for what could cause such a shift in shape: the orbit of Enceladus may have migrated inward, leading to an increase in Enceladus's rotation rate. Such a shift would lead to a more oblate shape; or a rising mass of warm, low-density material in Enceladus's interior may have led to a shift in the position of the current south polar terrain from Enceladus's southern mid-latitudes to its south pole. Consequently, the moon's ellipsoid shape would have adjusted to match the new orientation. One problem of the polar flattening hypothesis is that both polar regions should have similar tectonic deformation histories. However, the north polar region is densely cratered, and has a much older surface age than the south pole. Thickness variations in Enceladus's lithosphere is one explanation for this discrepancy. Variations in lithospheric thickness are supported by the correlation between the <b>Y-shaped</b> discontinuities and the V-shaped cusps along the south polar terrain margin and the relative surface age of the adjacent non-south polar terrain regions. The <b>Y-shaped</b> discontinuities, and the north-south trending tension fractures into which they lead, are correlated with younger terrain with presumably thinner lithospheres. The V-shaped cusps are adjacent to older, more heavily cratered terrains.|$|E
5|$|Weeding rakes: As weeding was a {{constant}} issue in the ancient and medieval Chinese agricultural process, {{it led to the}} invention of the weeding rake. The invention of the Chinese weed rake is derived from the invention of the Chinese harrow. In the Chinese agricultural text Qimin Yaoshu written by the Northern Wei Dynasty official Jia Sixie. Harrows were originally called iron-teeth rakes due to its shaping. According to it's shape, the Chinese harrow was divided into three sub-classifications: Strip rake, <b>Y-shaped</b> rake, and square rake. The harrows seen in the murals of the Wei and Jin Dynasties are strip rakes.|$|E
5|$|Whale tail is the <b>Y-shaped</b> {{waistband}} of a thong or G-string when visible above the waistline of low-rise jeans, shorts, or a skirt {{that resembles a}} whale's tail. Intentionally or unintentionally, a whale tail is exposed above the trousers mostly when sitting or bending, or even while standing. The frequency or occasion depends on the style of trousers, the style of underwear, {{and the way they}} are worn. Displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together with the rise of low-rise jeans and thong underwear. The trend, popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, waned within the decade.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 1 {{opened on}} March 15, 1963, and was {{expanded}} between 1970 and 1974 {{with the current}} A and B Gates buildings. Currently, Terminal 1 has four concourses, {{each of which is}} connected to a central pre-security area. Ticketing and baggage claim are located on Level 1 of this area. Level 2 houses the three security checkpoints, an esplanade with several retail outlets, and a USO lounge for military service members. West of the pre-security area are the A Gates and the B Gates, two <b>Y-shaped</b> concourses with circular ends. To the south are the C Gates, which can be accessed by the Green Line of the tram system. The satellite D Gates concourse, which opened in 1998, lies to the east and contains three lounges: the Centurion lounge for American Express card holders; the Club at LAS, which is available to all passengers at a fee; and the United Club. The Blue Line of the tram system links the D Gates with the pre-security area.|$|E
5|$|Trapalcotherium is {{identified}} {{as a member of}} Gondwanatheria—a small and enigmatic group of mammals from Cretaceous and Paleogene of the southern continents (Gondwana)—on the basis of the transverse ridges and triangle on its crown. It resembles Ferugliotherium from the Los Alamitos Formation, the only previously known uncontroversial member of the family Ferugliotheriidae, but differs in some characters: the triangle at the front is narrower in Trapalcotherium; the valley behind the front triangle is less curved; the ridges attached to the second lingual cusp form another triangle; the tooth is relatively shorter; Trapalcotherium does not have the <b>Y-shaped</b> valleys between cusps seen in Ferugliotherium; and the tips of the lingual cusps are more labially placed. The evolutionary affinities of gondwanatheres, which include the Ferugliotheriidae and the higher-crowned Sudamericidae, are controversial, though a relationship with multituberculates (a large group mainly known from the northern continents of Laurasia) has repeatedly been proposed; the identification of Trapalcotherium does not provide additional information that has a bearing on the relationships of the gondwanatheres.|$|E

25|$|In {{the eighth}} century it became {{customary}} {{to let the}} ends fall down, one {{in the middle of}} the breast and the other {{in the middle of the}} back, and to fasten them there with pins, the pallium thus becoming <b>Y-shaped.</b> A further development took place during the ninth century (according to pictorial representations, at first outside of Rome where ancient traditions were not maintained so strictly): the band, which had hitherto been kept in place by the pins, was sewn <b>Y-shaped,</b> without, however, being cut.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Y-shaped</b> {{building}} contained 1,001 {{guest rooms}} over 20 floors and a ballroom capable of hosting 2,200 people. The room count {{was reduced to}} 710 after numerous renovations.|$|E
25|$|Most {{mutations}} {{that shape}} bNAbs {{take place at}} the tips of the <b>Y-shaped</b> antibody molecules, which have loops to ensnare viral epitopes. bNAbs are stickier than other antibodies.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} Super Bowl to use the <b>Y-shaped</b> goalposts (with one {{supporting}} post instead of two) invented by Jim Trimble and Joel Rottman; they had made their debut {{at the start of}} the season for both the AFL and NFL.|$|E
25|$|The {{river is}} memorialized, in part, by two {{horizontal}} blue stripes on the Municipal Flag of Chicago. The river {{also serves as}} inspiration for one of Chicago's ubiquitous symbols: a three-branched, <b>Y-shaped</b> symbol (called the municipal device) is found on many buildings and other structures throughout Chicago; it represents the three branches of the Chicago River.|$|E

First flight: 20 August 1957, 187 built. This variant was sometimes referred to as Crusader II.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of Freeman–Sheldon syndrome include drooping {{of the upper}} eyelids, strabismus, low-set ears, a long philtrum, gradual hearing loss, scoliosis, and walking difficulties. Gastroesophageal reflux has been noted during infancy, but usually improves with age. The tongue may be small, and the limited movement of the soft palate may cause nasal speech. Often there is an H- or <b>Y-shaped</b> dimpling of the skin over the chin.|$|E
25|$|After {{strengthening}} the first thread, the spider {{continues to make}} a <b>Y-shaped</b> netting. The first three radials of the web are now constructed. More radials are added, {{making sure that the}} distance between each radial and the next is small enough to cross. This means that the number of radials in a web directly depends {{on the size of the}} spider plus the size of the web. It is common for a web to be about 20 times the size of the spider building it.|$|E
25|$|Some larvae of the Hymenoptera order (ants, {{bees and}} wasps) can appear like the {{caterpillars}} of the Lepidoptera. Such larvae are mainly {{seen in the}} sawfly suborder. However while these larvae superficially resemble caterpillars, they can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} prolegs on every abdominal segment, an absence of crochets or hooks on the prolegs (these are present on lepidopteran caterpillars), one pair of prominent ocelli on the head capsule, and an absence of the upside-down <b>Y-shaped</b> suture {{on the front of the}} head.|$|E
25|$|The 5'UTRs are 95–101 {{nucleotides}} long in Dengue virus. There are two conserved {{structural elements}} in the Flavivirus 5'UTR, a large stem loop (SLA) and a short stem loop (SLB). SLA folds into a <b>Y-shaped</b> structure with a side stem loop and a small top loop. SLA is likely {{to act as a}} promoter, and is essential for viral RNA synthesis. SLB is involved in interactions between the 5'UTR and 3'UTR which result in the cyclisation of the viral RNA, which is essential for viral replication.|$|E
25|$|Above Taylor's vaulted kitchen, {{between the}} Pillared Room and the State Dining room, Soane created a Smaller Dining Room (sometimes called the Breakfast Room) that still exists. To build it, Soane removed the chimney {{from the kitchen}} to put a door in the room. He then moved the chimney to the east side, running a <b>Y-shaped</b> split flue inside the walls up either side {{of one of the}} windows above. The room {{therefore}} has a unique architectural feature: over the fireplace there is a window instead of the usual chimney breast.|$|E
25|$|Although Pope Benedict XVI's second pallium was not {{actually}} made until 2008, {{the model for}} it already existed on his coat of arms. A scarcely known fact is that a precedent for Pope Benedict XVI's variations of the pallium was set in 1999 when Pope John Paul II wore a long <b>Y-shaped</b> pallium with red crosses for that year's Easter celebrations. It was only used that one time and was created by Piero Marini, the then Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations, who would also create Pope Benedict's first pallium.|$|E
25|$|A lobster-pot trap is {{a chamber}} that {{is easy to}} enter, and whose exit is either {{difficult}} to find or obstructed by inward-pointing bristles. Lobster pots are the trapping mechanism in Genlisea, the corkscrew plants. These plants appear to specialise in aquatic protozoa. A <b>Y-shaped</b> modified leaf allows prey to enter but not exit. Inward-pointing hairs force the prey to move in a particular direction. Prey entering the spiral entrance that coils around the upper two arms of the Y are forced to move inexorably towards a stomach in the lower arm of the Y, where they are digested. Prey movement is also thought to be encouraged by water movement through the trap, produced {{in a similar way}} to the vacuum in bladder traps, and probably evolutionarily related to it.|$|E
25|$|Burj Khalifa was {{designed}} by Adrian Smith, then of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), whose firm designed the Willis Tower and One World Trade Center. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise {{the architecture of the}} project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The <b>Y-shaped</b> tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifa’s central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings. The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.|$|E
25|$|The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) is a centimeter-wavelength radio {{astronomy}} observatory located in central New Mexico on the Plains of San Agustin, between the towns of Magdalena and Datil, ~50miles (80km) west of Socorro. The VLA comprises twenty-seven 25-meter radio telescopes deployed in a <b>Y-shaped</b> array and all the equipment, instrumentation, and computing power to function as an interferometer. Each of the massive telescopes is mounted on double parallel railroad tracks, so the radius and density of the array can be transformed to adjust the balance between its angular resolution and its surface brightness sensitivity. Astronomers using the VLA have made key observations of black holes and protoplanetary disks around young stars, discovered magnetic filaments and traced complex gas motions at the Milky Way's center, probed the Universe's cosmological parameters, and provided new knowledge about the physical mechanisms that produce radio emission.|$|E
25|$|Boivin {{made the}} first ski descents of the {{following}} mountains and faces, amongst others: the Frendo Spur on the Aiguille du Midi on 2 July 1977; the south face of Huascarán and the north faces of Pisco and Kitarahu (all in the Andes) in 1978; the east face of the Matterhorn, on which he skied slopes of more than 60 degrees (from the Shoulder, after which he soloed the Schmid route on the north face in 4 hours 10 minutes) on 6 June 1980; <b>Y-shaped</b> Gully on the Aiguille Verte on 26 February 1985; Nant Blanc face of the Aiguille Verte on 12 June 1989. On 17 April 1987 he made a ski enchaînement of five descents: south-east face of the Aiguille du Moine (1st descent); south face of the Aiguille du Dru (1st descent); Whymper Couloir on the Aiguille Verte; north-east face of Les Courtes; finishing off with a descent of the Grandes Jorasses.|$|E
25|$|Both St. Joseph and St. Francis Xavier Church were {{designed}} by the firm of McCarthy, Smith and Eppig. St. Joseph's is Wilmette's oldest religious congregation, established in 1843. The present building (1939) is among the finest examples of Art Deco architecture on the North Shore. The interior is particularly well preserved and features Art Deco light fixtures and stained glass windows designed and fabricated by Giannini & Hilgart of Chicago. The altar floor and sanctuary wall contain Italian and French marble inlaid with Portuguese onyx. The Stations of the Cross are pastel-hued mosaics crafted in the Vatican Studio of Mosaics in Rome. The design and materials of the <b>Y-shaped</b> school designed by Herman J. Gaul of Chicago and constructed in 1934, and the adjacent rectory, harmonize with the church. St. Francis Xavier Church (1939) was designed in the Late Gothic Revival mode while McCarthy, Smith & Eppig were simultaneously working on St. Joseph's. The stained glass windows were made with English and German imported glass by the famed F. X. Zettler Studios of Munich and New York City. St Francis Xavier School (1924), {{just east of the}} church, is a unique modern blend of Gothic architecture by Chicago architect Barry Byrne.|$|E
25|$|From the {{inception}} of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from forward airfields. To this end, the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed {{to gain access to the}} L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, Elektron magnesium alloy <b>Y-shaped</b> legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were cantilevered from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes, a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant Kraftei engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} recent experiment demonstrates {{several aspects of}} bee learning. Foragers were trained to enter a simple <b>Y-shaped</b> maze that had been marked at the entrance with a particular color. Inside the maze was a branching point where the bee was required to choose between two paths. One path, {{which led to the}} food reward, was marked with the same color that had been used {{at the entrance to the}} maze, while the other was marked with a different color. Foragers learned to choose the correct path, and continued to do so when a different kind of marker (black and white stripes oriented in various directions) was substituted for the colored markers. When the experimental conditions were reversed, rewarding bees for choosing the inner passage marked with a symbol that was different from the entrance symbol, the bees again learned to choose the correct path. Variations in the length of the tunnel between the stimulus markers showed that bees retain information in working memory for about 5 seconds, equivalent to the short-term memory of birds. Altogether, the experiments demonstrated that bees can to choose between alternatives, determine if a stimulus is the same or different than one seen earlier, remember the earlier one for a short period, and generalize this performance to new pairs of stimuli.|$|E

500|$|Rogaland County Municipality {{is in the}} {{planning}} process of building a light rail in Greater Stavanger. The initial plans call for a <b>Y-shaped</b> service which could be operational by 2018, with possibilities for further expansion. As of 2010, the plans call for a [...] line from Stavanger to Sandnes, and a [...] branch to the airport. The travel time from Sandnes to Stavanger would be 29 minutes, and is therefore a supplement to the commuter rail. The light rail would have interchange with the light rail at Stavanger, Paradis, Jåttåvågen, Gausel and Sandnes Sentrum. Several new branches of the light rail have been proposed for later construction.|$|E
