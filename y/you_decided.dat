If you do not, and you have grandchildren, you should explain to them why <b>you</b> <b>decided</b> not to," [...] calling the film [...] "horrifying, enthralling and [...] the potential, I believe, to actually change public policy and begin a process which could save the Earth." ...|$|E
500|$|In her aria ("Oh what grief"), Mařenka sings of her betrayal. When Jeník appears, she rebuffs him angrily, and {{declares}} {{that she will}} marry Vašek. Kecal arrives, and is amused by Jeník's attempts to pacify Mařenka, who orders her former lover to go. The villagers then enter, with both sets of parents, wanting to know Mařenka's decision ("What have <b>you</b> <b>decided,</b> Mařenka?"). As she confirms that she will marry Vašek, Jeník returns, and to great consternation addresses Mícha as [...] "father". In a surprise identity revelation it emerges that Jeník is Mícha's elder son, by a former marriage – the [...] "worthless good-for-nothing" [...] earlier dismissed by Kecal – who had in fact been driven away by his jealous stepmother, Háta. As Mícha's son he is, {{by the terms of}} the contract, entitled to marry Mařenka; when this becomes clear, Mařenka understands his actions and embraces him. Offstage shouting interrupts the proceedings; it seems that a bear has escaped from the circus and is heading for the village. This creature appears, but is soon revealed to be Vašek in the bear's costume ("Don't be afraid!"). His antics convince his parents that he is unready for marriage, and he is marched away. Mícha then blesses the marriage between Mařenka and Jeník, and all ends in a celebratory chorus.|$|E

500|$|Pete Schulberg of The Oregonian wrote, [...] "Forget all {{the commotion}} about NYPD Blue. Homicide {{delivers}} without the lewd language and skin shots. It depicts violence {{in a most}} compelling way: You don't see it. You just feel it." [...] Bob Wisehart of The Sacramento Bee said, [...] "The {{bottom line is that}} while NYPD Blue is a fine show [...] it was on my 10-best list for 1993 [...] Homicide is better. There's been nothing like it since the heyday of Hill Street Blues." [...] Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, who called Homicide [...] "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from NYPD Blue, and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in [...] "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "If [...] is what it took to get you to watch NYPD Blue and <b>you</b> <b>decided</b> to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that Homicide is so far superior to NYPD Blue in all those categories that if you're not , you're missing the best hour of episodic television since Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere left the air." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{group that}} most {{characterized}} London streets were beggars and vagrants. The broad eighteenth-century definition for beggar embraced {{not just the}} poorest people having {{to live on the}} street, but virtually anyone who would stop you asking for money, work, or offering you a service such as: shoe cleaners, linkboys, milkmaids, chimney sweeps, etc. Begging was quite an art, the way you held your body, the sores you showed or not showed, the tone of the voice, your gender and age, the time of the year, the narrative strategies <b>you</b> <b>decided</b> to adopt, all these elements affected the way you begged and had to be consider carefully. Moreton regards beggars and vagrants as potential criminals in disguise and affirms that they [...] "should be suppressed, who lounge about all day, to see where they can steal at night" [...] and that [...] "all shoe-cleaners, I mean boys and sturdy vagrants, be suppressed, [...] as for link-boys, alias thieves with lights". Shoeblacks are a peculiar example of a vagrant occupation. Established as an employment {{at the end of the}} seventeenth-century, shoe cleaning provided a perfect excuse for approaching passers-by without incurring a penalty.|$|E

Cage has also stated that [...] "I would like people to play it once…because that's life. Life you can only play once... I would like people to have this experience that way." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I'm fine with , but the right way to enjoy Heavy Rain is really to make one thing because it's going to be your story. It's going to be unique to you. It's really the story <b>you</b> <b>decided</b> to write... I think playing it several times is also a way to kill the magic of it."
