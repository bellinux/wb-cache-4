500|$|I {{was more}} {{concerned}} that [...] would feel that we did it. A lot of times producers or songwriters leak records because they feel if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> song out there it would go [...] Usually a leak that far in advance of an album release puts the song in serious jeopardy of being excluded from the final track list. It was frustrating. I felt like you work hard {{to get in the}} studio to work with Beyoncé. [...] I was blessed... that song turned out [...] have nine lives.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} the prostitution plot, Christina Hendricks said, [...] "This {{is a very}} confusing situation for Joan and for everyone involved. First off, it's just completely insulting. Second of all, it's quite an opportunity. Then {{all of a sudden}} <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> money involved or the opportunity involved or you put a label on it, then it becomes a scary road to go down." [...] Hendricks said that Joan's motivation was [...] "protection [...] her child." [...] Hendricks felt that Joan saw herself as an equal in a way to the other partners after going through with the deal, as Joan had seen them do worse things over her thirteen years in employment.|$|E

I will look in your eyes and tell you that I'm not dumb enough or moronic enough to think that you are dumb or moronic enough not to see that I would have stolen a melody. If <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> songs next to each other, side by side, the only {{similarities}} are the chord progression. It's the same one that has been in disco music for the last 50 years.

500|$|The {{video was}} shot on May 30, 2008 in Los Angeles, California. Unexpectedly, several girls began crying during the shoot; Cyrus {{attributed}} {{this to the}} emotions in the song. Ratner was impressed with Cyrus' instinct and ability to address emotional issues while making them [...] "fun at the same time". Ratner compared her to Madonna, saying, [...] "she can be hanging out and laughing, and then <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> camera on her and it's like, 'Holy shit!'" [...] The effervescence made editing {{more difficult for the}} director. He said, [...] "It was the hardest video I've ever edited because every moment was great. Every moment that she was on camera, she was amazing. She's got an incredible quality about her. She gets the camera, and that's {{what it takes to make}} a great music video." [...] Cyrus commented that she felt the video was [...] "more honest than [...] song" [...] and that she was [...] "singing out to [...] that special person".|$|E
500|$|On June 20, 2014, the U.S. House Veterans Affairs Committee {{learned that}} every one of the 470 senior {{executives}} in the VA received performance evaluations that indicated they were at least [...] "fully successful" [...] {{in each of the past}} four years. Congressional representatives argued that the data shows that senior management in the VA is out of touch with the problems in the department. Republican Representative Phil Roe said, [...] "Do you think that’s normal in business, that nearly every executive is successful? That means <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> bar down here, so anybody can step over it." [...] Democratic Representative Ann McLane Kuster compared the situation to grade inflation. Senior executives were paid a total of $2.4 million in bonus compensation in the most recent year. Gina S. Farrisee, VA assistant secretary for human resources and administration, admitted in her written comments that the department needed to do better at holding executives accountable.|$|E
500|$|British {{composer}} Charlie Mole {{wrote the}} score to Northanger Abbey, while the Pemberley Players provided other authentic pieces of music. Sue Mythen choreographed the ballroom scenes. Speaking to Benji Wilson of the Radio Times, Jones revealed the dance sessions {{were the most}} taxing part of the shoot. She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them {{to make sure they}} were right. She explained, [...] "But what happens is as soon as <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E

500|$|Mary Pols of Time {{praised the}} film's fantasy {{sequences}} {{for being able}} to show the audience a [...] "joyous Wizard of Oz energy" [...] that is able to [...] "open the door into Precious's mind in a way even [...] Sapphire couldn't." [...] Pols felt that, while not implying that the film has [...] "a lack of compelling emotional material" [...] but that the film's [...] "few weak moments" [...] are the [...] "ones that dovetail with typical inspirational stories." [...] Marshall Fine, of The Huffington Post, praised the film as being [...] "a film that doesn't shy away from the depths to which human beings can sink, but it also shows the strength and resilience of which we are capable, even at our lowest moments." [...] Scott Mendelson, also of The Huffington Post, felt that when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> [...] "glaring issues aside," [...] the film [...] "still works as a potent character study and a glimpse inside a world we'd rather pretend does not exist in America." [...] But while the film [...] "succeeds as a powerful acting treat and a potent character study, there are some major narrative issues that prevent the film from being an accidental masterpiece." [...] Mendelson described the film as being [...] "an acting powerhouse" [...] based on its many emotional themes.|$|E
500|$|In January 2013, filming was {{scheduled}} to take place at Shepperton Studios in London, United Kingdom, and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in 3D. Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June. She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created {{through a combination of}} CGI and motion capture, going on to say that [...] "You can't do any motion capture with a raccoon – they won't let <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> suit on. But we will do rotomation, probably, for some of the behavior... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be, the behavior and the performance. He's very clear on where he wants to take the characters." [...] In March 2013, Feige discussed Guardians of the Galaxy in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, [...] "It's much more of a standalone film. It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been {{on the other side of}} that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time." [...] Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space. In mid-March, Dave Bautista was signed to play Drax the Destroyer. Other actors who had been considered for the role included Isaiah Mustafa, Brian Patrick Wade and Jason Momoa. By the following week, sculptor Brian Muir, who sculpted Darth Vader's mask for the Star Wars films, was revealed to be working on the film.|$|E

2500|$|Having been {{introduced}} earlier to the Essex county cricket captain Tom Pearce, Dodds was de-mobbed {{from the army}} in 1946 and joined Essex. At about this time, according to his later account in his autobiography, he joined Moral Re-Armament and embraced a form of active Christianity in which he lived his life according to [...] "advice" [...] which he received in conversations with God: [...] "You have a quiet time, in which <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> problem to him, and you note what thoughts he puts into your mind in reply.

2500|$|Although Wilson {{found it}} {{necessary}} to clarify service roles and missions, he did not press for extensive further unification of the armed forces. He established in February 1956 an office of special assistant to the secretary of defense for guided missiles but made few other changes after implementation of Reorganization Plan No. 6 in 1953. When asked in 1957 about persistent demands for further unification, Wilson responded, [...] "It's an oversimplification in the false hope that you could thus wash out the problems if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> people all in the same uniform and that then they wouldn't disagree over what should be done.

2500|$|Director Joel Coen {{described}} {{the process of}} film making: [...] "I can almost set my watch by how I'm going to feel {{at different stages of}} the process. It's always identical, whether the movie ends up working or not. I think when you watch the dailies, the film that you shoot every day, you're very excited by it and very optimistic about how it's going to work. And when you see it the first time <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> film together, the roughest cut, is when you want to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and just go away. And then it gradually, maybe, works its way back, somewhere toward that spot you were at before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Madigan's {{final design}} {{was based on}} a brief {{prepared}} by the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) with input from James Johnson Sweeney and James Mollison. [...] Sweeney was Director of the Guggenheim Museum between 1952–1960 and Director of The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and had been appointed as a consultant to advise on issues concerning the display and storage of art. [...] Mollison said in 1989 that [...] "the size and form of the building had been determined between Colin Madigan and J.J. Sweeney, and the National Capital Development Commission. [...] I was not able to alter the appearance of the interior or exterior in any way...It's a very difficult building in which to make art look more important than the space in which <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> art". [...] The construction of the building commenced in 1973, with the unveiling of a plaque by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, and it was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1982, during the premiership of Whitlam's successor, Malcolm Fraser. The building cost $82 million.|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{cover is}} {{a photo of}} Amos holding a large rifle, sitting {{in a rocking chair}} on the porch of an old wooden building. One of her legs is out of her pants and flung {{over the side of the}} chair. A snake coils around the chair and a large rooster hangs from the roof of the porch. The image is a nod to her song [...] "Me and a Gun," [...] which appears on the album Little Earthquakes and recounts a rape she sustained. [...] "Well, it's [...] a {{reference}} to Me and a Gun, a song I wrote that was on Little Earthquakes. And the idea that there's a dead cock on my right and alive snake on my left. And the idea is that death and life... creation... what it's taken me to get here with men, and I don't want to be angry anymore. And you turn it over and <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> gun down, but I'm not pretending what it's taken to get me here. But no more resentment."

2500|$|In another {{interview}} Cedric elaborated on the kidnapping/vanishing themes, saying [...] "Lyrically, I {{wanted to}} incorporate elements of traditional songs. So {{that it would}} sound like our world had these handed down, traditional songs that were to do with real random vanishings and kidnappings. That {{is a big part}} of Latin culture. People get kidnapped all the time. I wanted to cover everything. Right from the exhilarating feeling you get when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> ransom note down, the adrenaline rush when you realise a loved one has been taken from you, followed by that bleak, dismal area of not knowing what to do. Especially if you don't come from money. We had two friends that we knew from Texas who just randomly vanished. We've never known whether they just took off or if they met foul play. I found it an interesting subject matter to tackle. I wanted the lyrics to instil that bleak feeling you can get from living somewhere like El Paso. Even though I haven't lived at home for ages, it's still with me. The stories that come from across the border still hit home really hard. I just wanted to have a soundtrack for that really." ...|$|E

[...] For tax and banking purposes, and to establish a legitimate income and credit history, Giles was told she needed to start saying she was a [...] "freelancer". The ACORN employee also suggested that Giles open two accounts at separate banks, depositing no more than $500 each a week to ensure few eyebrows are raised.|$|E
2500|$|Blake’s {{internally}} braced hollow wooden surfboards {{were eventually}} superseded by laminated boards with an interior layer of balsa, then by foam-and-fiberglass designs, but {{another of his}} innovations remains a fixture of modern surf- and paddleboards, the [...] "skeg" [...] or fin. Traditional surfboards were flat-bottomed, but in 1935, Blake experimented by tearing the keel off an old speedboat and attaching it {{to the bottom of}} a surfboard. Blake later remembered, [...] "I finally put the fin on the board and went out in the surf, paddled out. In paddling out, the board had an entirely different feeling with the skeg on it, it wasn't entirely a likable feeling... But I got a pretty good wave and right away found the remarkable control you had over the board with the skeg on it. It didn't spin out, it steered easy, because the tail held steady when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> pressure on the front. You could [...] turn it any way you wanted it. I knew right from that moment it was a success. I consider it as my good solid contribution to the sport.
