500|$|Criticism of Wild Arms {{comes from}} its myriad puzzles and minigames that {{resemble}} {{those found in}} an action games, described as being [...] "extremely action oriented, which may be frustrating to RPG fans who don't have the quickest of reflexes". The game was also compared to the RPG Final Fantasy VII, released five months later, which in turn led to Wild Arms being designated as a game that would [...] "suppress <b>your</b> <b>appetite</b> for Final Fantasy VII". [...] GameSpot additionally declared that Wild Arms graphics, though impressive, were not the industry standard at the time, remarking: [...] "Although it's no Final Fantasy VII, Wild Arms looks great." ...|$|E
2500|$|She expresses {{admiration for}} the films of Nagisa Oshima, Ingmar Bergman and Bernardo Bertolucci, but, while she {{continues}} to view her AV performances as a social mission, she contrasts the AV with film. She says the AV [...] "has a different atmosphere. It's not very sophisticated, in fact it's primitive. It's a bit like eating and menus in restaurants: you're hungry {{and you have a}} sudden craving for noodles, so you go and eat noodles. <b>Your</b> <b>appetite</b> is towards a porno video, so you go and rent whatever turns you on. And as with food, viewers can use basic ingredients to 'cook' the desired stimulation from the video themselves." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'That's the {{happiness}} of you young people,' she continued. 'You don't {{know what it is}} to be low in your feelings. You always have <b>your</b> <b>appetites</b> too, and what a comfort that is.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{you must}} just lose <b>your</b> <b>appetites,</b> for I won't tell you," [...] said Mr Merryboy firmly. [...] "It will do you good--eh! mother, won't {{a touch of}} {{starvation}} improve them, bring back the memory of old times-- eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} them where those came from," [...] he said, [...] "and {{everything}} else <b>your</b> <b>appetites</b> call for; {{and you need}} not name the thing you wish; as long as I am with you, you have only to wish and find." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not Want {{to destroy}} <b>your</b> <b>appetite,</b> Mr. Brooks," [...] Lady Sybil said, [...] "but this is--if not a {{farewell}} feast, something like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there is}} another fraud. I was told it would help <b>your</b> <b>appetite,</b> {{and here you are}} with less than when you left Hot Springs. If I'd had my way----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's a cure, it's a cure! I knew I {{could do}} it. Dear sir, my grand system never failed--never. You've got <b>your</b> <b>appetite</b> back--you know you have; say {{it and make}} me happy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't spoil <b>your</b> <b>appetites,</b> children, {{with that}} stuff. Do {{you see this}} basket? Well, I have only got to say, [...] "Little basket, little basket, do your duty," [...] {{and you will see}} what will happen. Now you shall say it instead of me, for a treat.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} be thankful," [...] said Shirley, [...] "and not mock me. What could I do? How could I gauge <b>your</b> <b>appetites</b> or number <b>your</b> band? For aught I knew, {{there might have been}} fifty of you at least to victual. You told me nothing; and then an {{application}} to provision soldiers naturally suggests large ideas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{worst of}} these little brushes which lead to nothing, is that they leave as strong a smell of {{gunpowder}} in your cabin, Greenly, as if a whole fleet had been destroyed," [...] observed the vice-admiral good-humouredly, {{as he began to}} help his guests. [...] "I hope the odour we have here will not disturb <b>your</b> <b>appetites,</b> gentlemen." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do {{you want}} to go ashore in the boat, boy?" [...] said Blackbeard, really mindful of the health of this {{projected}} member of his family. [...] "It may help <b>your</b> <b>appetite</b> to use your legs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Quite so,' {{replied the}} fox; 'it would be {{unreasonable}} {{of me to}} object to your satisfying <b>your</b> <b>appetite</b> at my expense. But if the fox resigns herself to the sacrifice, the mother offers you one last request.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] she said, [...] "that I {{know all}} about your troubles; and you cannot doubt that I desire to make you happy for as long a time as you may remain with me. For this purpose, my honored guests, I have ordered a banquet to be prepared. Fish, fowl, and flesh, roasted, and in luscious stews, and seasoned, I trust, to all your tastes, are ready to be served up. If <b>your</b> <b>appetites</b> tell you it is dinner time, then {{come with me to}} the festal saloon." ...|$|R
5000|$|None of {{the works}} {{ascribed}} to him in ancient times, if indeed they were written by him, have survived. He {{was said to have}} written a book comparing the laws of the Scythians with the laws of the Greeks, as well as work on the art of war. All that remains of his thought is what later tradition ascribes to him. He became famous for the simplicity of his way of living and his acute observations on the institutions and customs of the Greeks. He exhorted moderation in everything, saying that the vine bears three clusters of grapes: the first wine, pleasure; the second, drunkenness; the third, disgust. So he became a kind of emblem to the Athenians, who inscribed on his statues: 'Restrain <b>your</b> tongues, <b>your</b> <b>appetites,</b> <b>your</b> passions.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Merely to {{see whether}} your walk this morning had done <b>your</b> <b>appetites</b> any good," [...] {{answered}} Essper, looking disconsolate; [...] "and so I thought I might make myself useful at the same time. And though I do not bring on the soup in a cocked hat, and carve the venison with a couteau-de-chasse," [...] continued he, bowing very low to Ernstorff, who, standing stiff behind his master's chair, seemed utterly unaware that any other {{person in the room}} could experience a necessity; [...] "still I can change a plate or hand the wine without cracking the first, or drinking the second." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you need}} is that tonic I prescribed. Remember that. And don't pamper <b>your</b> <b>appetite</b> when it comes back. Eat strong, nourishing food, and beefsteak, plenty of beefsteak. And don't cook it to a cinder. Good day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{tell you}} just now, lass, {{as it might}} spoil <b>your</b> <b>appetite</b> for breakfast. Set about getting that ready {{as fast as you}} can, for I want to be off as soon as {{possible}} to visit my snares." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed! {{and which}} of the two are worst?" [...] inquired Jack. [...] "Another slice of pork, Ladoc, <b>your</b> <b>appetite</b> appears to be sharp this morning; thank you, go on, Marteau, you were saying {{something}} about the bears and seals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{the whole}} fish had to be {{tortured}} and slain that you might tempt <b>your</b> carnal <b>appetite</b> with that one taste of the tail. Know ye not, consumers of flesh meat, that ye are nourishing the wolf and tiger in your bosoms?" ...|$|R
50|$|Schmidt {{respected}} and admired {{the work of}} abstract and non-objective artists, but she never felt inclined to work in that style. In 1969 she said I never have liked to work from my imagination. I like to work from a fact, and I {{will try to make}} something out of the fact. I enjoy that most. And I do my best work when I do that. I don't know whether it's just because I put it out of my mind that I don't like to make things up. Some artists are marvelous at just fantastic inventions. But I love the smell and the feel of life. You have to follow <b>your</b> <b>appetites.</b> You don't choose to be what you are. You are what you are.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This gentleman,' said Silas Wegg, {{pointing}} out Venus, 'this gentleman, Boffin, is more milk and watery with you than I'll be. But he hasn't borne the Roman yoke as I have, nor yet he hasn't {{been required to}} pander to <b>your</b> depraved <b>appetite</b> for miserly characters.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This {{is indeed}} an {{agreeable}} surprise, sir!' said the manager cheerfully. 'You are admiring our famous chimney-piece, I see. May I ask, Mr. Westwick, how {{you find yourself}} in the hotel, this time? Have the supernatural influences affected <b>your</b> <b>appetite</b> again?' ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{sat down}} at table, and Larry smiled as he said, [...] "It's the first time I have seen your scruples spoil <b>your</b> <b>appetite,</b> Chilton, but I had a notion {{that you were not}} quite sure about taking any supper from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Cuffy!" [...] {{continued}} the sailor with a sigh, [...] "you've {{good reason to}} yowl, for the half of a rotten fish ain't enough for a dog o' <b>your</b> <b>appetite.</b> Come, let's see if we can't find somethin' more to our tastes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To gratify the {{appetite}} with thorough and hearty appreciation after working hard for your food, or walking far to find it, is not gross. Grossness consists in eating heavily {{when you have}} not toiled, and stimulating with fire-water, pepper, or mustard, <b>your</b> sluggish <b>appetite.</b> To call me a gross creature, then--" ...|$|R
60|$|Secondly: You of the meaner sort {{are subject}} to fewer temptations than the rich; and {{therefore}} your vices are more unpardonable. Labour subdueth <b>your</b> <b>appetites</b> {{to be satisfied with}} common things; the business of your several callings filleth up your whole time; so that idleness, which is the bane and destruction of virtue, doth not lead you into the neighbourhood of sin: Your passions are cooler, by not being inflamed with excess, and therefore the gate and the way that lead to life are not so straight and so narrow to you, as to those who live among all the allurements to wickedness. To serve God with the best of your care and understanding, and to be just and true in your dealings, is the short sum of your duty, and will be the more strictly required of you, because nothing lieth in the way to divert you from it.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{well for}} you that a low fever has forced you to abstain {{for the last three}} days: there would have been danger in {{yielding}} to the cravings of <b>your</b> <b>appetite</b> at first. Now you may eat, though still not immoderately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come, Mr. Arabin, don't let love {{interfere}} with <b>your</b> <b>appetite.</b> It never does with mine. Give me half a glass more champagne {{and then go}} to the table. Mrs. Bold will do me an injury if you stay talking to me any longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And your {{instincts}} had forewarned {{you of all}} this? God's life, woman! can you invent no better tale than that?" [...] He turned aside as two slaves entered bearing an earthenware vessel. [...] "Here comes your supper. I hope <b>your</b> <b>appetite</b> is keener than your logic." ...|$|E
40|$|Healthy eating {{includes}} all foods and beverages. Many beverages contain added sugar {{and have no}} nutritional value. Before you serve your child a beverage, stop and think if it’s healthy, is it the right portion size, and will it affect <b>your</b> child’s <b>appetite</b> at their next meal.

Would nothing but my subjection satisfy <b>your</b> unconquerable <b>appetite</b> for power?" ...|$|R
5000|$|As the Haitian {{government}} {{relied on}} {{assistance from the}} United States, Duvalier {{had little choice but}} to comply with certain human rights rules and principles while Jimmy Carter was president. However, as Carter’s term came to an end, Duvalier’s opposition to the free press became more pronounced. In October 1980, he announced that le bal est fini (the party is over) for the independent press. Dominique, reading the writing on the wall, responded with one of his most famous editorials, entitled “Bon appétit, messieurs,” addressed to the journalists of the state press. “For you, the banquet shall resume. And you will not hear any discordant sounds, any noise that might disturb <b>your</b> <b>appetites.</b> You will not be distracted from your plentiful feast by the cries of the poor, the screams of the boat people devoured by sharks, the gunshots killing our cane-cutter brothers in Santo Domingo or in Nassau or La Romana... No, you will not hear those discordant, disagreeable noises that might trouble your meal, that might prevent you from celebrating -- it will be only silence... So you may celebrate at ease, gentlemen! At ease! And in that profound silence: Bon appétit, messieurs!” ...|$|R
