Meanwhile, Patel gets possessive and jealous as he feels Shanaya is ignoring him and {{spending more time with}} her co-actor. When Patel notices Shanaya grooving to music with a band, he gets extremely upset and bawls at her, “When you have time to do all this, you have time for parties, you have time for your co-actor, why don’t <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> for me? Have you ever asked me if I’m okay or not, even once?”Shanaya feels insulted and gets outraged, and packs her suitcase to leave his house. She explains, “If we were together, would you be able to adjust to the lifestyle of an actress. Would you be able to control yourself when people stare at me? No. Because you’re insecure. It takes a strong, secure man to marry an actress.” She leaves the house.|$|E

5000|$|Shenmue {{received}} mostly positive reviews, with {{an average}} aggregate score of 89.34% on GameRankings. Many reviews praised the game's graphics, realism, soundtrack and ambition. IGN called Shenmue [...] "a gaming experience that no one, casual to hardcore gamer, can miss". Eurogamer called it [...] "one of the most compelling and unusual gaming experiences ever created." [...] GameSpot wrote that though Shenmue is [...] "far from perfect" [...] it was [...] "revolutionary" [...] and [...] "worth experiencing - provided <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to invest." [...] Edge wrote that {{though it was not}} [...] "the milestone" [...] they had hoped for, Shenmue is [...] "involving, and ultimately rewarding". Ed Lomas of the UK Official Dreamcast Magazine said the production values were [...] "astounding ... Shenmue is the most beautiful game ever made, no doubt about it." [...] Though he acknowledged minor problems with controls, dated QTEs, script and voice acting, he felt the experience as a whole was [...] "incredible", particularly its immersion and the freedom to pursue the story at one's own pace. The game received the Excellence Prize for Interactive Art at the 2000 Japan Media Arts Festival.|$|E
5000|$|On December 17, the Philadelphia Inquirer {{reported}} that they had obtained additional emails tied to the collapse, and which had been seen by the Grand Jury, which indicated the impatience of the developer with the pace of demolition and the demolition contractor's request for progress payments.

An April 29 email indicated that Richard Basciano, the STB owner, had stopped by the site and was [...] "shocked that the buildings were still standing," [...] and demanded progress. Several other of the emails also emphasize the desire of the owners to get the demolition completed. On May 22 Thom Simmonds emailed Alex Wolfington, a consultant to STB, opposing further negotiations with the Salvation Army: [...] "Why?..Waste more time? Wait for someone to be killed?
