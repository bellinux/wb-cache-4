[...] She wrote a chapter in the book, Metamorphoses of the Zoo: Animal Encounter after Noah, by Ralph R. Acampora. [...] The chapter, titled [...] "Open Door Policy: Humanity's Relinquishment of [...] "Right to Sight" [...] and the Emergence of Feral Culture", discusses the extensive psychic damage caused by the objectification and [...] "forced incarceration of individuals with brains, minds, emotions, and cultures {{comparable to those of}} humans" [...] (Acampora, p.153), who are kept in a captive environment for public display and institutional profit. [...] In a 2011 , Bradshaw was asked to comment on captive animal businesses. [...] She stated, [...] "Captivity is institutionalized trauma. Zoos, aquaria, and other places like circuses are exploitative. They are businesses. Visiting zoos is no different from visiting prisons. These places are filled with animals suffering horribly, surviving by living in disturbing mental states and behaviors such as self-mutilation, depression, unhappiness, premature death, elephants living half as long as their free ranging counterparts, mothers killing their babies, aggression and fighting. Would you bring <b>your</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> a concentration camp or to a prison? The comparison is no exaggeration." ...|$|E

Why should we assume their hard hearted pride and relentless cruelty, to which murder is not only a sport, but a subject of vainglorious triumph? Let those whose rank claims as its right such bloody homage take pride and pleasure in it; we, who have no share in the sacrifice, may the better pity the sufferings of the victim.
