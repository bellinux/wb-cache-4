5|$|Using her {{influence}} at The Miami Herald, Douglas wrote columns about poverty: <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{most beautiful}} {{city in the}} world as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept... {{but if you have a}} weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{himself said}} {{he decided to}} open the film in December {{so that it would}} have less {{competition}} from then to January. Titanic capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998. Additionally, Avatar established itself as a [...] "must-see" [...] event. Gray said, [...] "At this point, {{people who are going to}} see Avatar are going to see Avatar and would even if the slate was strong." [...] Marketing the film as a [...] "novelty factor" [...] also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. [...] "It's really hard to sell the idea that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same experience at home," [...] stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com. The [...] "Oscar buzz" [...] surrounding the film and international viewings helped. [...] "Two-thirds of Titanics haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly...Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them", and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than before.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{score was}} composed by Carter Burwell, {{a veteran of}} all the Coen Brothers' films. While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had Kenny Rogers' [...] "Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was in)", the Gipsy Kings' cover of [...] "Hotel California", and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind. They asked T-Bone Burnett (who would later work with the Coens on O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, [...] "T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac." [...] Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart, Moondog and Bob Dylan's [...] "The Man in Me" [...] (from New Morning). However, he {{had a tough time}} securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Dead Flowers", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, [...] "It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' Eagles, man!' Klein stands up and says, 'That's it, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> song!' That was beautiful." [...] Burnett was going to be credited on the film as [...] "Music Supervisor", but asked his credit to be [...] "Music Archivist" [...] because he [...] "hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to think of me as management".|$|E

2500|$|Halladay {{was named}} the starter for Games One and Five during the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He won Game One 11–6, but lost the Game Five 1–0, which was a duel with former Blue Jays {{teammate}} Chris Carpenter. This loss eliminated the Phillies from the playoffs, a disappointment as they were touted as heavy favorites for the World Series, and {{it would turn out}} to be Halladay's final postseason appearance. Reflecting on that series at his retirement, Halladay said [...] "I think the one thing I took away from that is <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> best team on paper, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> guys who want it the most. But when the squirrel runs across home plate while your team is trying to pitch, there is nothing you can do about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Laudrup's {{departure}} from Barcelona {{was a huge}} blow for the fans and his teammates alike. Reflecting on his time at Barcelona, he commented, [...] "I think we played some very good football, and I think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten {{best players in the}} world, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> best team. Because everybody talked about Begiristain, Bakero, Guardiola, Stoichkov, and Koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe {{the best team in the}} world, together with AC Milan in that period." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another way to {{understand}} {{the solution is to}} consider the two original unchosen doors together (Adams 1990; Devlin 2003, 2005; Williams 2004; Stibel et al., 2008). As Cecil Adams puts it (Adams 1990), [...] "Monty is saying in effect: you can keep your one door or <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> other two doors." [...] The [...] chance of finding the car has not been changed by the opening of one of these doors because Monty, knowing the location of the car, is certain to reveal a goat. So the player's choice after the host opens a door is no different than if the host offered the player the option to switch from the original chosen door to the set of both remaining doors. The switch in this case clearly gives the player a [...] probability of choosing the car.|$|E

2500|$|Early in 1977, Terry Nation was {{commissioned}} to write four more episodes for Series One and five episodes for Series Two. Nation was now contracted to write all thirteen episodes {{of the first}} series. The BBC had expanded Nation's writing commitment in order that Nation's high profile would help {{the promotion of the}} series. Providing a large amount of material in a short time would prove difficult for Nation. Admitting that he had agreed to write every episode out of [...] "ego and supreme confidence", Nation later recalled that he returned home following the commission and told his wife, [...] "I think I've got myself into deep trouble!". Nation informed Boucher that he would only be able to deliver the first draft of each script, telling Boucher, [...] "...you can have rewrites or <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> next episode: which do you want?”. As a result, while Nation created the plots, Boucher provided a great deal of input into the characters and dialogue. According to Boucher, [...] "Terry came up with the characters, he came up with thirteen good stories, but he didn't come up with the dialogue. I remember saying, and I think it's pretty close to the truth, that for a long time, Paul Darrow [...] never spoke a line that I hadn't written or altered to make the lines sharper".|$|E
2500|$|In November 1990, {{an equally}} {{contentious}} discussion of vos Savant's article {{took place in}} Cecil Adams's column The Straight Dope (Adams 1990). Adams initially answered, incorrectly, that the chances for the two remaining doors must each be one in two. After a reader wrote in to correct the mathematics of Adams's analysis, Adams agreed that mathematically he had been wrong. [...] "You pick door #1. Now you're offered this choice: open door #1, or open door #2 and door #3. In the latter case you keep the prize if it's behind either door. You'd rather have a two-in-three shot at the prize than one-in-three, wouldn't you? If you think about it, the original problem offers you basically the same choice. Monty is saying in effect: {{you can keep your}} one door or <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> other two doors, one of which (a non-prize door) I'll open for you." [...] Adams did say the Parade version left critical constraints unstated, and without those constraints, the chances of winning by switching were not necessarily two out of three (e.g., it was not reasonable to assume the host always opens a door). Numerous readers, however, wrote in to claim that Adams had been [...] "right the first time" [...] and that the correct chances were one in two.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
