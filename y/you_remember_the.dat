The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E

Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged [...] the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: [...] “So I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what are you going to do about it? And, <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>the</b> United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E
500|$|A Herald Sun reviewer, however, {{thought she}} gave the final season of Will & Grace the [...] "send-off it deserved." [...] Rachel Browne of The Sun Herald said the problem with Spears' {{performance}} is that [...] "it's impossible to accept her in any role other than her own headline-hugging self." [...] Browne, however, thought her appearance was [...] "fun to watch". The Sunday Mail was also positive about Spears' performance, commenting that she [...] "does well, especially when <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> dismal Crossroads." [...] Trent Vanegas of Pink is the New Blog said that doing the show was a [...] "great move" [...] for Spears. Television researcher Tim Brooks, the co-author of the 1979 book The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, commented that Spears' role was a [...] "very {{good way to get}} her chops into comedy", in part because it is [...] "very out of type. She's not just playing herself as a celebrity." ...|$|E

500|$|Davey {{performed}} a nationwide tour in late May 2007, debuting songs from her follow-up album which she initially {{referred to as}} Silversleeve. All {{but two of the}} songs were recorded in her home. The album, released under the title Tales of Silversleeve and produced by Liam Howe of Sneaker Pimps, was preceded by [...] "Reuben", its first single, on 21 September 2007. Davey explained the title choice, [...] "I had a runny nose when I was a child and let's just say I didn't wipe it with a tissue". This proved to be a successful move as it led to a Choice Music Prize nomination for 2007 Irish Album of the Year. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "even more imaginative" [...] than her debut and gave it four out of five stars. entertainment.ie reviewer Lauren Murphy described the record as [...] "Without doubt, one of the best albums of the year", noting [...] "there's a magic about Tales of Silversleeve that makes it an album you're almost afraid to listen to twice, in case it's not as good as <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> first time". The Irish Independent's reviewer gave the album five stars, describing it as [...] "a record that she can be proud of". Jim Carroll, The Irish Times rock critic, called it [...] "The most charming pop album you'll hear in Zero Seven".|$|E

In 2007, Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared with Peter Davison's Fifth Doctor in a Doctor Who special for Children in Need, written by Steven Moffat and entitled [...] "Time Crash". He later performed alongside Davison's daughter, Georgia Moffett (as [...] "Jenny") in the 2008 episode [...] "The Doctor's Daughter".|$|E
2500|$|Vladimir stands {{through most}} of the play whereas Estragon sits down {{numerous}} times and even dozes off. [...] "Estragon is inert and Vladimir restless." [...] Vladimir looks at the sky and muses on religious or philosophical matters. Estragon [...] "belongs to the stone", preoccupied with mundane things, what he can get to eat and how to ease his physical aches and pains; he is direct, intuitive. He finds it hard to remember but can recall certain things when prompted, e.g., when Vladimir asks: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> Gospels?" [...] Estragon tells Vladimir about the coloured maps of the Holy Land and that he planned to honeymoon by the Dead Sea; it is his short-term memory that is poorest and points {{to the fact that he}} may, in fact, be suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Al Alvarez writes: [...] "But perhaps Estragon's forgetfulness is the cement binding their relationship together. He continually forgets, Vladimir continually reminds him; between them they pass the time." [...] They have been together for fifty years but when asked–by Pozzo–they do not reveal their actual ages.|$|E

The tour lasted one month and {{featured}} {{a number of}} support acts. The band's website reported that the band had hand-picked their favorite new artists to support them on the tour. Longtime friend of the band Miriam Kaufmann toured with the band and sang lead female vocals on [...] "Set the Fire to the Third Bar", which originally featured Martha Wainwright.
