Benzodiazepine dependence as well as benzodiazepine withdrawal is associated with self-harming behaviour in young people. Alcohol is a major risk factor for self-harm. A study which analysed self-harm presentations to emergency rooms in Northern Ireland found that alcohol was a major contributing factor and involved in 63.8% of self-harm presentations.

High-resolution three-dimensional MRI scans were acquired in 23 (10 males and 13 females) <b>younger</b> <b>adolescent</b> subjects (13 [...] 14 years) and 30 (15 males and 15 females) elder adolescent subjects (19 [...] 21 years). Whole-brain analysis by VBM revealed that the elder adolescent subjects had significantly more gray matter in the left medial temporal regions than the <b>younger</b> <b>adolescent</b> subjects and significantly less gray matter in the left medial frontal region (Brodmann area 6). In the volumetric analysis, significantly less cerebral gray matter volume and significantly greater cerebral white matter volume were found in elder <b>adolescents</b> compared with <b>younger</b> <b>adolescents.</b> The volume of the hippocampus was significantly larger in male elder adolescents than in male <b>younger</b> <b>adolescents.</b> The volume of the parahippocampal gyrus did not differ between <b>younger</b> and elder <b>adolescent</b> subjects.

25|$|The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) {{has been}} shown to be quite {{effective}} for treating bulimia nervosa (BN) in adults, but little research has been done on effective treatments of BN for adolescents. Although CBT is seen as more cost efficient and helps individuals with BN in self-guided care, Family Based Treatment (FBT) might be more helpful to younger adolescents who need more support and guidance from their families. Adolescents are at the stage where their brains are still quite malleable and developing gradually. Therefore, <b>young</b> <b>adolescents</b> with BN are less likely to realize the detrimental consequences of becoming bulimic and have less motivation to change, which is why FBT would be useful to have families intervene and support the teens. Working with BN patients and their families in FBT can empower the families by having them involved in their adolescent's food choices and behaviors, taking more control of the situation in the beginning and gradually letting the adolescent become more autonomous when they have learned healthier eating habits.|$|E

2500|$|Adolescence marks a time {{of sexual}} maturation, which manifests in social {{interactions}} as well. While adolescents may engage in casual sexual encounters (often referred to as hookups), most sexual experience {{during this period of}} development takes place within romantic relationships. Adolescents can use technologies and social media to seek out romantic relationships as they feel it is a safe place to try out dating and identity exploration. From these social media encounters, a further relationship may begin. Kissing, hand holding, and hugging signify satisfaction and commitment. Among <b>young</b> <b>adolescents,</b> [...] "heavy" [...] sexual activity, marked by genital stimulation, is often associated with violence, depression, and poor relationship quality. This effect does not hold true for sexual activity in late adolescence that takes place within a romantic relationship. Some research suggest that there are genetic causes of early sexual activity that are also risk factors for delinquency, suggesting that there is a group who are at risk for both early sexual activity and emotional distress. For older adolescents, though, sexual activity in the context of romantic relationships was actually correlated with lower levels of deviant behavior after controlling for genetic risks, as opposed to sex outside of a relationship (hook-ups) ...|$|E

30|$|Overall, {{these results}} support the {{conclusion}} that setting the “proficiency test” bar too high may create unrealistic expectations for many and, in turn, de-motivate students unable to reach these high standards, an assertion supported {{by a number of}} studies that have investigated the relationship between testing and motivation among adolescent learners (Black and Wiliam, 1998; Crooks, 1988; Harlen and Deakin Crick, 2003).

40|$|M. Phil. (Adolescent Guidance) Research studies {{indicate}} that so-called non-clinical or normal depression is a common and widespread phenomenon amongst adolescents and {{that the rate of}} depression increases dramatically in early adolescence, particularly amongst adolescent girls. Although depression is generally considered as a mood isturbance, it is in effect a whole body experience involving the mind, body and spirit of the adolescent and can cause a variety of future adjustment problems. Current research on adolescent depression indicates that depression is particularly responsive to intervention and that early identification will prevent the development of a pernicious form of depression in adolescents. This study thus focuses on the early identification of non-clinical or normal depression in girls in early adolescence. Guidelines are described to support them in their experience of normal depression. The application of guidelines is thus preventive in nature and aimed primarily at supporting the <b>young</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls. The research design followed in this study can be described as a qualitative design with an exploratory, descriptive and contextual focus. Data was collected by means of phenomenological interviews and field notes. A literature control was used to verify the findings. The study was conducted in two phases. In phase one <b>young</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls' experience of non-clinical depression was explored. In phase two the collected data was used as the basis for inferring and describing guidelines to support <b>young</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls who experience non-clinical depression. After the data was analysed, two broad themes were identified and were used as a basis to describe guidelines that can support <b>young</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls who experience normal depression. The first theme reflects their perception of how they experience nonclinical depression, while the second theme reflects the influence of dysfunctional interpersonal relationships between their family, peers or teachers and themselves in precipitating or maintaining their experiences. Guidelines inferred from these themes were described that could be applied to support them in these experiences. The findings from this study reveal that the <b>young</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls are not yet clinically depressed, However, if intervention measures are not implemented to support them, their feelings and experiences could develop into clinical depression. It is hoped that this study will assist in the early identification of non-clinical depression in <b>young</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls and that the guidelines will support them so that the development of clinical depression can be prevented...|$|R

Separate analyses of variance (ANOVA) were computed for each dependent measure.
