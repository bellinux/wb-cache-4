40|$|Sorting steers {{for three}} {{different}} finishing systems (calf-feds, summer <b>yearlings</b> and fall <b>yearlings)</b> resulted in {{no differences in}} performance or average carcass characteristics compared to unsorted steers. Sorting decreased variation in hot carcass weight and number of carcasses over 950 lb. Sorting did not increase profit when calf-feds or fall <b>yearlings</b> were sold live compared to unsorted calf-feds and fall <b>yearlings.</b> However, when sold on a grid basis, sorting did increase profit for summer and fall <b>yearlings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aspects of the {{reproductive}} biology of female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on Holla Bend National Wildlife Refuge were investigated by examining {{the reproductive}} tracts of 121 deer harvested during the 1985 - 90 archery seasons. The presence of corpora albicantia in <b>yearlings</b> suggested that 27 % of female fawns conceived, producing a mean of 1. 0 ova/breeding fawn. Pregnancy rates among <b>yearlings</b> and adults averaged 94 % and 97 %, respectively. Ovulation rates averaged 1. 4 and 2. 0 ova/female among <b>yearlings</b> and adults. Some females were ovulating in early-October, but the earliest conceptions occurred {{during the last week}} of October. The peak breeding period for <b>yearlings</b> and adults was during mid- and late-November. No fawns ovulated prior to December 1. The implantation rate averaged 91 % among <b>yearlings</b> and adults...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{study on the}} development of Osteragia Ostertagi, Cooperia oncophora and Nematodirus helvetianus in 15 -month-old <b>yearlings</b> and three-month-old calves demonstrated that <b>yearlings</b> have considerably greater resistance to gastrointestinal parasitism than calves. This was manifested by the establishment of smaller worm burdens, marked stunting of worms and a markedly lower worm egg output in the <b>yearlings.</b> The characteristic marked rise in egg counts observed in calves a few weeks after exposure to a heavy gastro-intestinal parasite infection did not occur in the <b>yearlings.</b> It was concluded that fecal examinations have a limited usefulness as a reliable aid to diagnosis of gastrointestinal parasitism in older cattle...|$|R
40|$|A two-year study {{compared}} steers {{from the}} same herd finished as calves or <b>yearlings</b> at a fat thickness endpoint of 0. 5 in. <b>Yearlings</b> yielded heavier carcasses with larger ribeye areas, lower marbling scores and lower quality grades. Calves produced more tender steaks measured by shear force and a consumer taste panel. The probability of a tough steak (based on shear force) from calf-fed steers was 1. 9 and 0. 02 % for 7 and 21 days of aging, respectively, while the risk for <b>yearlings</b> was 29. 2 and 4. 0 %, respectively. Calf-fed steers produced more tender steaks and, after 21 days of aging, steaks from <b>yearlings</b> were similar...|$|R
5|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A <b>yearling</b> participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. Directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both <b>yearling</b> and older male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have {{a greater degree of}} directional asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive age-specific plumage.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} exists {{among the}} river otters. Males are, on average, 5% larger than females. In Idaho, juvenile, <b>yearling,</b> and adult males averaged 8, 11, and 17% heavier, respectively, than females {{of the same}} age. A clinical reduction in size may exist {{from north to south}} along the Pacific coast, but not from east to west.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to observe and quantitate changes in the claws of two groups of feedlot cattle (calves and backgrounded <b>yearlings)</b> fed diets that varied in energy (73. 5 or 78. 5 % TDN) and crude protein (11, 13, 15, 16, 17, or 19 %) content. At slaughter, the {{thickness}} of sole horn and the prevalence of toe and heel hemorrhages were greater in calves than in <b>yearlings</b> (p< 0. 02). Feeding the high-energy ration increased the prevalence of toe and heel hemorrhages in calves (p< 0. 02) and heel hemorrhages in <b>yearlings</b> (p< 0. 02). In <b>yearlings,</b> rotation of the distal phalanx and ridging of the dorsal wall of the claw were the most prominent pathological features. Osteopathy of the apex of the distal phalanx occurred more frequently in calves than in <b>yearlings</b> (p< 0. 01). This study suggests that intensive feeding of beef cattle before they reach 14 months of age has a deleterious effect on digital health...|$|R
