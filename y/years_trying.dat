5|$|He {{spent his}} {{remaining}} <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to recover his health which was severely undermined by prison confinement. In late 1926, he {{was admitted to}} Lindlahr Sanitarium in Elmhurst, Illinois. He died there of heart failure on October 20, 1926, {{at the age of}} 70. His body was cremated and buried in Highland Lawn Cemetery in Terre Haute, Indiana.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish estate {{job offer}} fell through and Mitchell became unemployed. He later stated that {{giving up his}} seat in Parliament had been a {{disastrous}} mistake. He {{spent much of the}} next 10 <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to get back into Parliament. He applied to several Conservative associations (for example, Bournemouth East in August 1977). But at every selection interview he was questioned about his reasons for giving up Aberdeenshire West in 1974. No winnable constituency would adopt him.|$|E
5|$|Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville: A former U.S. Army {{medical doctor}} and {{scientist}} before the worldwide plague, {{he loses his}} wife and daughter in a helicopter crash shortly after Manhattan is quarantined and spends the next three <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to find a cure while defending himself against the Darkseekers. He is immune to the virus and uses vials of his blood to try to create a cure.|$|E

5|$|Gilroy {{spent several}} <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> {{to write a}} plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead start by {{designing}} the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheros were a rarity in films, because they are difficult to write, and usually devolve into psychopaths; {{in an attempt to}} break from the stereotype, he thought of writing an antihero success story. Several films, including The King of Comedy (1983), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on how to write antiheroes.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev greatly {{improved}} relations with Yugoslavia, {{which had been}} entirely sundered in 1948 when Stalin realized he could not control Yugoslav leader Josip Tito. Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to Belgrade in 1955. Though a hostile Tito did {{everything he could to}} make the Soviets look foolish (including getting them drunk in public), Khrushchev was successful in warming relations, ending the Informbiro period in Soviet-Yugoslav relations. During the Hungarian crisis, Tito initially supported Nagy, but Khrushchev persuaded him of the need for intervention. Still, the intervention in Hungary damaged Moscow's relationship with Belgrade, which Khrushchev spent several <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to repair. He was hampered by the fact that China disapproved of Yugoslavia's liberal version of communism, and attempts to conciliate Belgrade resulted in an angry Beijing.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, the GWR returned to direct government control, {{and by the end}} of the war a Labour government was in power and again planning to nationalise the railways. After a couple of <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to recover from the ravages of war, the GWR became the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. The Great Western Railway Company continued to exist as a legal entity for nearly two more years, being formally wound up on 23 December 1949. GWR designs of locomotives and rolling stock continued to be built for a while and the region maintained its own distinctive character, even painting for a while its stations and express trains in a form of chocolate and cream.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the goals}} of the team for Angel of Darkness were to create more {{complicated}} puzzles and make the character of Lara Croft, together with the tone of the game, darker and more hard-edged. They also wished to compete with some of the newer action-adventure games on the market, which were providing heavy competition, and include gameplay ideas from Shenmue and the Metal Gear series. Many character movements were drawn from and based directly on movements made by real people, similar to later motion capture techniques, and the world design drew from various artists and elements of films from the likes of Luc Besson and David Fincher. Murti Schofield, who had previously worked with Core Design, was brought in to write the story and script. As part of writing the background for the organisations involved in the story, he researched historical secret societies and artefacts, and accurate translations of Latin text incorporated into the game. Schofield created the character Kurtis Trent upon a request for someone who could become the focus of a spin-off franchise. Core spent two <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to reshape the franchise as well as writing a back story {{in the form of a}} book separated into multiple chapters, with Angel of Darkness being the first of those chapters.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} two-and-a-half <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to do {{his best}} for Jamestown, John Smith was severely injured by an accidental gunpowder explosion in his canoe, which decided his fate for him.

25|$|Fanny Cradock {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the public in the postwar-utility <b>years,</b> <b>trying</b> to inspire the average housewife with an exotic approach to cooking. She famously worked in various ball-gowns without the customary cook’s apron, averring that women should feel cooking was easy and enjoyable, rather than messy and intimidating.|$|E
5000|$|Queen Mary, Henry's daughter, was {{a devout}} Catholic and as queen (1553-58) for five <b>years</b> <b>tried</b> {{to reverse the}} Reformation. She married the Catholic king of Spain and {{executed}} Protestant leaders. Protestants reviled her as [...] "Bloody Mary".|$|R

25|$|After {{more than}} 12 years in Siam, Yamada Nagamasa went to Japan in 1624 on board {{one of his}} ships, where he sold a cargo of Siamese deer hide in Nagasaki.

25|$|In principle, {{the above}} {{equation}} completely describes {{the dynamics of}} an ensemble of gas particles, given appropriate boundary conditions. This first-order differential equation has a deceptively simple appearance, since ƒ can represent an arbitrary single-particle distribution function. Also, the force acting on the particles depends directly on the velocity distribution functionƒ. The Boltzmann equation is notoriously difficult to integrate. David Hilbert spent <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to solve it without any real success.|$|E
25|$|Kassengift went {{straight}} to No.1 in the German albums chart and this coincided with music television stations MTV and VIVA starting to regularly play Rosenstolz's music. This took AnNaR. and Plate by surprise, who remarked that they had spent six <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to crack the music stations. The accompanying concert tour was a sell-out, and {{in a review of}} one of the Berlin concerts, Felix Kosel of German music magazine bloom commented that the band's gay audience had become a more diverse audience.|$|E

50|$|In 1922, Henry Baerlein {{noted that}} the Austrians had for thirty <b>years</b> <b>tried</b> to Albanianize the Janjevo population. In 1997, the Croatian {{government}} began resettling Croats from the village to Kistanje in Croatia. During the Kosovo War (1998-99), the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) attacked the village. Only 350 of the pre-war 1500 Croats remained in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Wen Jiao's father Wen Dan (溫澹) was a commandery governor, and {{his uncle}} Wen Xian (溫羨) {{was an early}} Jin prime minister.

25|$|By 1921 Sun {{had become}} {{president}} of the southern government. He spent his remaining <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to consolidate his regime and achieve unity with the north. His efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were fruitless, however, and in 1920 he turned to the Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. For political expediency, though, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established Chinese Communist Party (CCP).|$|E
25|$|The Russian Tsarist Empire waged {{war against}} Circassia in the Northwest Caucasus {{for more than}} one hundred <b>years,</b> <b>trying</b> to replace Circassia's hold along the Black Sea coast. After a century of {{insurgency}} and war and failure to end the conflict, the Tsar ordered the expulsion of most of the Muslim population of the North Caucasus. Many Circassians, Western historians, Turks and Chechens claimed that the events of the 1860s constituted one of the first modern genocides, in which a whole population was eliminated in order to satisfy the desires (in this case economic) of a powerful country.|$|E
25|$|Hochschild {{cites the}} {{research}} of several historians, many of them Belgian. He refers especially to Jules Marchal, formerly a Belgian colonial civil servant and diplomat who (as Hochschild describes) spent twenty <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to break Belgian silence about the massacres. The documentation {{was not easy to}} come by; the furnaces of the palace in Brussels are said to have spent more than a week burning incriminating papers before Leopold turned over his private Congo to the Belgian nation. For many years Belgian authorities prevented access to what remained of the archives, notably the accounts given by Congolese to the King's Commission.|$|E
50|$|A {{new policy}} this <b>year</b> <b>tried</b> to {{encourage}} faster spelling, with 90 seconds for easier {{words on the}} first day, and two minutes for harder words in the later rounds, though the judges had some flexibility in applying the limits. The policy was adopted after reviewing time and round statistics for six prior years and finding a trend of spellers using more time.|$|R
5000|$|In the 21st century, {{an average}} of 7 people have died each <b>year</b> <b>trying</b> to summit Everest {{or as part of}} base camp support.

5000|$|Over-reliance on the automobile, {{coupled with}} the lack of a pedestrian-friendly environment, has contributed to two-thirds of adult Americans being {{overweight}} or obese. [...] Americans spend about $33 billion a <b>year</b> <b>trying</b> to lose weight. Degradation of the urban and rural landscape caused by sprawl also has wide-ranging negative effects on the environment and contributes to high maintenance costs to the infrastructure.|$|R
25|$|The job of {{designing}} and printing the new stamp {{was carried out}} in a great rush; engraving began only on May 4, and stamp printing on May 10 (a Friday), in sheets of 100 (contrary to the usual practice of printing 400 at a time and cutting into 100-stamp panes). Since the stamp was printed in two colors, each sheet had to be placed into the flat-bed printing press twice, an error-prone process that had resulted in invert errors in stamps of 1869 and 1901, and at least three misprinted sheets were found during the production process and destroyed. It is believed that only one misprinted sheet of 100 stamps got through unnoticed, and stamp collectors have spent the ensuing <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to find them all.|$|E
25|$|Border Memorial: Frontera de los Muertos is an {{augmented}} reality public art project and memorial, {{dedicated to the}} thousands of migrant workers who have died along the U.S./Mexico border in recent <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to cross the desert southwest in search of work and a better life. Built for smartphone mobile devices, this project allows people to visualize the scope of the loss of life by marking each location where human remains have been recovered with a virtual object or augmentation. The public can simply download and launch a mobile application and aim their devices’ cameras at the landscape along the border and the surrounding desert. The application uses geolocation software to superimpose individual augments at the precise GPS coordinates of each recorded death, enabling the public to see the objects integrated into the physical location as if they existed in the real world.|$|E
25|$|The Anderson Valley {{is one of}} California's coolest {{wine growing}} regions in the state being deeply {{influenced}} by the cool Pacific fog coming in off the coast. Early plantings of Chardonnay, Gewurztraminer, and Pinot Noir in the 1960s and 1970s {{led to the formation}} of a handful of wineries by 1980. The potential for sparkling wine production became apparent in the 1980s when Champagne house Louis Roederer selected Anderson Valley for its California operation Roederer Estate. The Champagne firm scouted California extensively for <b>years</b> <b>trying</b> to find a region with the most climatic similarities to the Champagne region of France. Pinot Noir - grown for both sparkeling and still wine production - is the dominant varietal for the region. A 2015 vineyard census determined that 87 of 91 vineyard properties in the region grow Pinot Noir.|$|E
