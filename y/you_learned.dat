[...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just made you want to feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that {{you had a chance to}} play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you." ...|$|E

Castellaneta was also a regular participant in The Ron Petke and His Dead Uncle Show, a radio show at NIU. The show helped Castellaneta hone his skills as a voice-over actor. He recalled [...] "We did parodies and sketches, we would double up on, so <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> to switch between voices. I got my feet wet doing voiceover. The show was just barely audible, but we didn't care. It was the fact that we got a chance to do it and write our own material." [...] He took a play-writing class and auditioned for an improvisational show. A classmate first thought Castellaneta would [...] "fall on his face with improvisation" [...] but soon [...] "was churning out material faster than [...] could make it work." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{income from}} the concerts did not permit generous {{rehearsal}} time. Wood had nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week's six concerts. To gain the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that [...] "if you watched him, you couldn't come in wrong." [...] The violist Bernard Shore wrote, [...] "You may be reading at sight in public, but you can't possibly go wrong with that stick in front of you". Thirty-five years after Wood's death, André Previn recounted a story {{by one of his}} players who recalled that Wood [...] "had everything planned out and timed to the minute ... at 10a.m. precisely his baton went down. <b>You</b> <b>learned</b> things so thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time." ...|$|E

[...] The attitude of the Tutsi soldiers—during and after the war has made them more detested by the population due to the killings, torture. [...] For example, they will go into the village, raid all the cattle, tell the population—since when have <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> to keep cattle; we are cattle; we know cattle. [...] In Bukavu, they went into and stole from houses. [...] Not so much in Goma. [...] The result is the population is increasingly getting concerned over the question of the Tutsi presence.|$|E
2500|$|On the November 2006 {{death by}} {{poisoning}} of Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko in London, Zhirinovsky said: [...] "Any traitor must be eliminated using any methods. If you {{have joined the}} special services to work, then you should work, but to betray, to run away abroad, {{to give up the}} secrets <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> while working – all of this looks bad." [...] Sergei Abeltsev, Zhirinovsky's former bodyguard and State Duma member from the LDPR, added: [...] "The deserved punishment reached the traitor. I am sure his terrible death will be a warning to all the traitors that in Russia the treason is not to be forgiven. I would recommend to citizen Berezovsky to avoid any food at the commemoration for his crime accomplice Litvinenko." [...] In the 2007 election, political patronage from Zhirinovsky enabled Litvinenko murder suspect Andrei Lugovoi to win election to the Russian parliament and thus obtain formal parliamentary immunity. He also accused Great Britain (according to him, [...] "the most barbaric country on the planet") of fomenting World War I, the October Revolution, World War II, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|Some Christians {{note that}} the Christian faith teaches [...] "salvation is by faith", [...] "But as for you, {{continue}} in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> it, and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which {{are able to make}} you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus." [...] The Holy Bible, New International Version. International Bible Society. 1984. and that faith is reliance upon the faithfulness of God. The most extreme example of this position is called fideism, which holds that faith is simply the will to believe, and argues that if God's existence were rationally demonstrable, faith in its existence would become superfluous. Søren Kierkegaard argued that objective knowledge, such as 1+1=2, is unimportant to existence. If God could rationally be proven, his existence would be unimportant to humans. It is because God cannot rationally be proven that his existence is important to us. In The Justification of Knowledge, the Calvinist theologian Robert L. Reymond argues that believers should not attempt to prove the existence of God. Since he believes all such proofs are fundamentally unsound, believers should not place their confidence in them, much less resort to them in discussions with non-believers; rather, they should accept the content of revelation by faith. Reymond's position {{is similar to that of}} his mentor Gordon Clark, which holds that all worldviews are based on certain unprovable first premises (or, axioms), and therefore are ultimately unprovable. The Christian theist therefore must simply choose to start with Christianity rather than anything else, by a [...] "leap of faith". This position is also sometimes called presuppositional apologetics, but should not be confused with the Van Tillian variety.|$|E
