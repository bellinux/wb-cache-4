Bekhor says: [...] "I wouldn't say it's a Rorschach test, but depending on how you react to it really says a lot about what <b>your</b> <b>relationship</b> is with that element of the human anatomy. It's a really interesting phenomenon and we're really curious to see how audiences respond." [...] The film premiered on 1 May 2012 at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival.|$|E

500|$|So far, {{there have}} been two {{occasions}} in which no award has been presented. Bent did not offer a prize in 1987 and 1991, as he felt there was no title that was odd enough to deserve the prize. The prize has become noteworthy enough that, in 2004, The Bookseller castigated publishers for choosing titles with a view to winning it, saying, [...] "There were too many self-consciously titled entries – presumably in a bid to emulate the 2003 champion, Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories". Bent has also expressed his dislike of people voting for ruder titles, stating that he himself would not have voted for the 2007 winner If You Want Closure in <b>Your</b> <b>Relationship,</b> Start with Your Legs.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and <b>your</b> <b>relationship</b> to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] {{want to be on the}} radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael G. Wilson {{decided on}} the film's title Quantum of Solace only [...] "a few days" [...] before its {{announcement}} on 24 January 2008. It {{was the name of}} a short story in Ian Fleming's anthology For Your Eyes Only (1960). The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: [...] "when the 'Quantum of Solace' drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone." [...] Daniel Craig admitted, [...] "I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in <b>your</b> <b>relationship</b> then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up." [...] He said that [...] "Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [...] has been killed," [...] and therefore, [...] " [...] looking for revenge... to make himself happy with the world again." [...] Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in Casino Royale. Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd. Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to [...] "let me know what it feels like" [...] when he succeeds, the implication of the title being {{that it will be a}} small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.|$|E

2500|$|GLaDOS' {{appearance}} in Portal 2 received critical acclaim. GameSpot's Chris Watters wrote that GLaDOS was a [...] "complex character who evolves throughout these early levels" [...] and that [...] "before {{all is said}} and done, you'll once again come to cherish <b>your</b> <b>relationship</b> with that cruel AI". PALGN's Adam Ghiggino called Ellen McLain's portrayal of GLaDOS [...] "hilariously blunt" [...] due to her calling the player-character fat. He also wrote that GLaDOS has [...] "a lot of emotion to [...] movement". The Guardians Nick Cowen wrote that GLaDOS was [...] "by turns funny and monstrous". Computer and Video Game's Andy Robinson wrote that GLaDOS was [...] "surely now deserving of entry into the Best Game Characters Ever club". He added that [...] "GlaDOS's character progression is a joy to follow, as she progresses from bitter, to angry and eventually even finding a bit of heart". An editor for GameTrailers wrote that GLaDOS' [...] "constant auto-tuned barbs are extremely well-written and voiced-helping lend some character to an otherwise spartan presentation".|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Steve Hewitt {{and the rest}} of the band had become tense during the recording of Meds and eventually, in October 2007, the band announced that Hewitt was no longer in Placebo. Molko commented that [...] "Being in a band is very much like being in a marriage, and in couples—in this case a triple—people can grow apart over the years. To say that you don't love your partner anymore is inaccurate, considering all that you've been through and achieved together. There simply comes a point when you realise that you want different things from <b>your</b> <b>relationship</b> and that you can no longer live under the same roof, so to speak". Olsdal commented [...] "We couldn't go on with Steve Hewitt. We didn't have the same goals, nor the same vision anymore. We had to separate. It all went wrong during the Meds tour. [...] There was no communication between us. Brian and I are one, but at some point we even didn't talk to each other anymore. We realised Placebo was dying. To be able to go on, things had to change." [...] According to Hewitt, [...] "Alex Weston, our manager, [...] called me in to the office and said I was not in the band anymore. And that's it. I was thrown out". Hewitt claims that it was [...] "very hurtful" [...] and [...] "disappointing" [...] to have been ejected in this way after being in the band for over a decade. Early in 2008 Hewitt founded the band Love Amongst Ruin, switching to guitar and singing lead vocals. In August 2012 he became the drummer of the reformed Six by Seven.|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Takiff from The Philadelphia Inquirer {{praised the}} album for being [...] "serious and reflective, at times heavily laden with psychic trauma. You might {{consider}} Like a Prayer to be 's Misfits...or her {{hour in the}} confessional box". Sal Cinquemani, from Slant Magazine, described the album as [...] "a collection of pop confections layered with live instrumentation, sophisticated arrangements, deeply felt lyrics, and a stronger, more assured vocal." [...] The review concluded by declaring Like a Prayer [...] "one of the quintessential pop albums of all time. Barry Walters from the San Francisco Examiner, named the album [...] "'s best and most consistent collection yet [...] the album [...] crosses the line between craft and inspiration. From the start, she's had an intuitive grasp of how {{to put on a}} good show. Now she's got the guts to show us what's inside". Senior editor from The Cavalier Daily Chaz Repak, praised Madonna's [...] "improved" [...] songwriting; [...] "her religious faith and her marriage to Sean Penn, are completely well written", however, he ended his review on a more critical note by saying: [...] "Like a Prayer constitutes Madonna's best work to date. But after such work as [...] "Material Girl", [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Open Your Heart", that's not saying much." [...] Negative criticism came from [...] Spin magazine. Reviewer Christian Logan wrote: [...] "On Like a Prayer <b>your</b> <b>relationship</b> to Madonna changes from to song to song, and it makes you uncomfortable. It's like sitting on a table with a friend who's telling too much about herself to people she doesn't know". Joe Levy, from the same magazine, was also critical, writing that [...] "there's not a lot of old Madonna, nothing of the generation of women who grew up in her wake: Regina, Debbie Gibson, and Taylor Dayne", but highlighted [...] "Keep It Together" [...] as [...] "the only great dance song on the record". At the end of 1989, Like a Prayer was voted the 18th best record {{of the year in the}} Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by The Village Voice.|$|E
