500|$|At Wimbledon, Raonic {{was again}} seeded eighth. He {{defeated}} Matthew Ebden, Jack Sock, ≈Åukasz Kubot, Nishikori, and Kyrgios {{to reach his}} first major semifinal. He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's {{a lot of good}} things to take from it. ... But when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] You feel it in front of you and you want to grab it." [...] Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.|$|E
500|$|Pauline Kael of The New Yorker said [...] "The James Bond {{series has}} had its bummers, but nothing before {{in the class of}} A View to a Kill. You go to a Bond picture expecting some style or, at least, some flash, some lift; you don't expect the dumb police-car crashes <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>here.</b> You do see some ingenious daredevil feats, but they're crowded {{together}} and, the way they're set up, they don't give you the irresponsible, giddy tingle you're hoping for." [...] Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. [...] "Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don't think I've ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation. If Glen has any emotions about what he puts on the screen, he keeps them to himself.)" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then, how did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> over <b>here?</b> <b>You</b> were at Henry's weren't you, on {{the night}} the Lapland sailed? You didn't cross with us, and there's no other steamer due for two days." ...|$|R
