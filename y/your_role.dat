5|$|The series {{features}} a create-a-superstar mode, where players {{are able to}} create their own wrestler, including their move set and ring entrances. The feature was introduced when WWF SmackDown! was released in 2000. As new games were released, the mode was altered; the first change came with the release of WWF SmackDown! 2: Know <b>Your</b> <b>Role,</b> which featured a mode in which wrestler taunts could be created and customized. This was further modified in WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth, which enabled players to create the walking style of a wrestler. With the release of WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006, the game first featured the ability for players to make an entrance for the created superstar. The feature was expanded with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007, as players could place pyrotechnics and special effects in any part of the superstar's entrance.|$|E

25|$|The game {{sports a}} variety of create modes. Create-A-Belt is a {{returning}} feature, with players now able to create Tag Team belts. Along with the created belts is the inclusion of title belts used in WWE during 2005, the WWE, World Heavyweight, Intercontinental, United States, WWE Tag Team, World Tag Team, Women's, and Cruiserweight championships. Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Championship and the WWE Hardcore Championship can also be won and defended in the game. The game also allows the player to defend and challenge {{for any of the}} titles in the game in Exhibition mode, a feature which was missing in previous games (after Smackdown 2: Know <b>Your</b> <b>Role).</b>|$|E
500|$|Against {{the last}} charge, Cass Sunstein has defended Breyer, noting {{that of the}} nine justices on the late Rehnquist Court, Breyer showed the highest {{percentage}} of votes to uphold acts of Congress and also to defer to the decision of the executive branch. However, according to Jeffrey Toobin in The New Yorker, [...] "Breyer concedes that a judicial approach based on 'active liberty' will not yield solutions to every constitutional debate," [...] and that, in Breyer's words, [...] "Respecting the democratic process does not mean you abdicate <b>your</b> <b>role</b> of enforcing the limits in the Constitution, whether in the Bill of Rights or in separation of powers." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} film's promotion, the Hollywood Sign was {{altered to}} include a 75-foot-tall cutout of Holli Would. The {{alteration}} angered local residents. In {{a letter to the}} city's Recreation and Park Board, commission officials wrote that they were [...] "appalled" [...] by the board's approval of the alterations and that [...] "the action your board has taken is offensive to Los Angeles women and is not within <b>your</b> <b>role</b> as custodian and guardian of the Hollywood sign. The fact that Paramount Pictures donated a mere $27,000 to Rebuild L.A. should not be a passport to exploit women in Los Angeles." [...] Protestors picketed the unveiling of the altered sign. The promotional campaign was focused on the sex appeal of Holli. It was considered by some experts as misaimed, with Paramount's marketing president Barry London saying [...] "Cool World unfortunately did not seem to satisfy the younger audience it was aimed at," [...] and designer Milton Knight recalling that [...] "Audiences actually wanted a wilder, raunchier Cool World. The premiere audience I saw it with certainly did." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{subjective}} events {{allow students}} more creativity than the objective events. The speech event {{is divided into}} prepared and impromptu sections. A three-and-a-half to four-minute long prepared speech is delivered. The student is then given one minute to read three prompts and deliver a one-and-a-half to two-minute impromptu speech. Example prompts have included: [...] "It {{has been said about}} our modern times that, 'Invention is the mother of necessity.' Please discuss.", [...] "Math has been described as the universal language. Discuss." [...] and [...] "Why is light, light and dark, dark?" [...] In the interview, the students are asked a wide variety of questions in a formal environment. Questions range from: [...] "Who is <b>your</b> <b>role</b> model?" [...] to [...] "How would you alert someone that their zipper is down?" [...] In both the speech and interview, the competitor is not allowed to reveal his or her school or hometown to ensure neutrality by the judges. In the essay event, students are given 50 minutes to write an essay responding to one of three prompts derived from the language and literature or the Super Quiz curriculum.|$|E
500|$|Muhney {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters. I have been told by many of my cast members that the role to play is Adam. They say, [...] "If I were to have a choice, the character I would want to play is <b>your</b> <b>role,</b> Adam." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first game}} in the series, WWF SmackDown! had a clear cut system for moves such as {{combining}} an arrow key with the circle button for grappling and moves and combining an arrow key with the X button for striking moves. Most of the later games, from WWF SmackDown! 2: Know <b>Your</b> <b>Role</b> to WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 used the aforementioned control scheme. When WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2007 was released, new game mechanics were introduced, in which a new control scheme altered the grappling system of the game, called [...] "Ultimate Control moves." [...] Unlike the previous games, where the player pressed two buttons to perform a grapple or an attack, players were able to place their opponents into a grapple position and then choose to perform a move by moving the directional buttons of their system's controller. For example, the player could place their opponent in a suplex grappling position and then either perform a normal suplex or an inverted suplex slam. Before the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008, in order for players to force a superstar to submit, they had to tap buttons to move a marker {{towards the end of}} the meter labeled [...] "Submit", and the only way for opponents to escape was for them to move the meter towards [...] "Escape". Included with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 was a new submission system, in which the player had to move the analog sticks of their system's controller in different directions to force the opponent to submit, while the opponent could do the same to escape the submission hold.|$|E

2500|$|Lü Meng {{was furious}} {{when he heard}} that Gan Ning had killed the servant so he {{gathered}} his own men and prepared to confront Gan. Gan Ning continued resting when he heard Lü Meng approaching. Lü Meng's mother {{came out of the}} house barefooted and chided her son, [...] "The lord (Sun Quan) treats you like his family and entrusts you with important responsibilities. How can you kill Gan Ning just because you've a private feud with him? If Gan Ning dies, even if the lord does not inquire into the incident, you've already overstepped <b>your</b> <b>role</b> as a subject." [...] Lü Meng was a filial son so his anger subsided after listening to his mother. He then went to Gan Ning's boat, laughed and said, [...] "Xingba, my mother is treating you to a meal.

Prior to the vote, the last House of Commons which Milliken would preside over, the Speaker was praised by MPs from all sides of the House. Conservative Government House Leader John Baird paid homage to Milliken’s career, recalling a meeting he’d had with the Speaker of the British House of Commons. “The Speaker of the Commons there said that he and Speakers from all around the Commonwealth look to you as their leader and their inspiration as someone who has conducted himself very professionally. For a Canadian to hear that from a British Speaker is a pretty remarkable conclusion and assessment of <b>your</b> <b>role</b> as Speaker." [...] Baird predicted that Milliken would “go down in history as, if not one of the best Speakers, the best Speaker the House of Commons has ever had." ...|$|E
