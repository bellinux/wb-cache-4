500|$|Rhodes {{came up with}} an {{idea for}} the backing track in the car while he was going to the studio. He started playing with the Roland Jupiter 8 keyboard, while singer Simon Le Bon was working with the lyrics. The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Little Red Riding Hood, and the repeating of the word [...] "do" [...] {{at the end of each}} verse takes its melody from the instrumentals in Gordon Lightfoot's song [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Read</b> My Mind". Andy Taylor worked out a Marc Bolan-ish guitar part, a very Marshall-sounding Les Paul guitar lick that was added to the track. Then the bass and drums were added, and the whole track was finished that day, including Le Bon's vocal melody and lyrics. The laugh at the beginning of the song and the screams during the song's fade-out were performed and recorded live by Rhodes' girlfriend at the time.|$|E

[...] We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked {{out of school for}} growing their hair long". [...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it.

500|$|Before {{the book}} concludes, Gladwell {{writes about the}} unique roots of his Jamaican mother, Joyce, a {{descendant}} of African slaves. Joyce attended University College in London, where she met {{and fell in love}} with Graham Gladwell, a young mathematician. After moving together to Canada, Graham became a math professor and Joyce a writer and therapist. While Gladwell acknowledges his mother's ambition and intelligence, he also points out opportunities offered to his parents that helped them live a life better than those of other slave descendants in the West Indies. Gladwell also explains that, in the 18th century, a white plantation owner in Jamaica bought a female slave and made her his mistress. This act inadvertently saved the slave and her offspring from a life of brutal servitude. As one of the slave's descendants, this turn of luck led to Gladwell's relatively successful position in life. Summarizing the publication, Gladwell notes that success [...] "is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky", and at the end of the book, he remarks, [...] "Outliers wasn't intended as autobiography. But <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> it as an extended apology for my success." ...|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{style of}} underplaying before the camera {{surprised}} {{many of his}} directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, [...] "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't {{going to be any}} good. But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> in his face all the things he'd been thinking." [...] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, [...] "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures." [...] His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, [...] "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with." ...|$|E

He wrote: [...] "As Laurel Leff, {{an assistant professor at}} the Northeastern School of Journalism, has concluded, it was a tragic demonstration of how the facts didn't speak for themselves. She has been the most diligent independent student of The Timess Holocaust coverage and deftly summarized her findings last year in The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> have <b>read</b> the front page of The New York Times in 1939 and 1940," [...] she wrote, [...] "without knowing that millions of Jews were being sent to Poland, imprisoned in ghettos, and dying of disease and starvation by the tens of thousands. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> have <b>read</b> the front page in 1941 without knowing that the Nazis were machine-gunning hundreds of thousands of Jews in the Soviet Union."

2500|$|Lightfoot {{was signed}} to Warner Bros./Reprise in 1970 {{and had a}} major hit in the United States with his {{recording}} of [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Read</b> My Mind". It had sold over one million copies by early 1971, and was awarded a gold disc. The song was originally featured on his 1970 album Sit Down Young Stranger, which did not sell well. After {{the success of the}} song, the album was re-released under the new title If <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Read</b> My Mind. It reached No.5 nationally and the success of the song represented a major turning point in Gordon Lightfoot's career. It also had the second recorded version of [...] "Me and Bobby McGee", as well as [...] "The Pony Man","Your Love's Return", and [...] "The Minstrel of The Dawn".|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Read</b> My Mind" [...] {{was written}} in {{reflection}} upon his disintegrating marriage. At the request of his daughter, Ingrid, he performs the lyrics with a slight change now: the line [...] "I'm just {{trying to understand the}} feelings that you lack" [...] is altered to [...] "I'm just trying to understand the feelings that we lack." [...] He has {{said in an interview that}} the difficulty with writing songs inspired by personal stories is that there is not always the emotional distance and clarity to make lyrical improvements such as the one his daughter suggested.|$|E

Between 1966 and 1969, Lightfoot recorded four additional albums for United Artists: The Way I Feel (1967), Did She Mention My Name? (1968), Back Here on Earth (1968), and the live recording Sunday Concert (1969). During those years, he consistently placed singles in the Canadian top 40, including [...] "Go-Go Round", [...] "Spin, Spin", and [...] "The Way I Feel". His biggest hit of the era was a rendition of Bob Dylan's [...] "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues", which peaked at No.3 on the Canadian charts in December 1965. Did She Mention My Name? featured [...] "Black Day in July", about the 1967 Detroit Riots. [...] Dr. Martin Luther King was murdered the following April 4. [...] Radio stations in 30 states pulled the song for [...] "fanning the flames", even though the song was a plea for racial harmony. [...] Lightfoot then stated station owners cared more about playing songs [...] "that make people happy" [...] and not those [...] "that make people think."

2500|$|Keys' songwriting on {{the album}} {{received}} negative criticism from The Washington Posts J.

Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian called Keys [...] "crashingly dull... her vaunted self-belief seemingly leaves no room for vulnerability, humour, insight {{or any of the}} other qualities possessed by the soul giants to whose stature she aspires". Writing for Rolling Stone, critic Robert Christgau found the album's prevailing mood [...] "reflectively soulful and the prevailing tempo mid". [...] In his consumer guide, Christgau gave it a one-star honorable mention (...) and quipped, [...] "Nice girl holds out," [...] while citing [...] "Teenage Love Affair" [...] and [...] "Wreckless Love" [...] as highlights. Despite commending the album for its [...] "more traditional soul" [...] and pop-oriented sound, The Observer writer Stephanie Merritt perceived Keys' lyrics as a significant fault and wrote [...] "for the most part, the lyrics are so reliant on stock phrases – 'feel your touch', 'hold me', 'shoulda known', etc – that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> anything you like into them without them carrying any personal feeling at all". Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot felt that the [...] "main problem is that Keys' songwriting has yet to transcend her obvious influences". Marisa Brown of AllMusic also viewed its lyrical quality as a weakness, but stated, [...] "even though As I Am is a flawed work — a little too poppy, a little too clichéd — it is also indicative of what Keys can and will do".|$|E
