500|$|... 20th Century Fox, Gracie Films, and Film Roman {{produced}} an animated The Simpsons film that {{was released on}} July 27, 2007. The production staff of The Simpsons had entertained {{the thought of a}} film since early in the series, but production never came together. Groening felt a feature-length film would allow them to increase the show's scale and animate sequences too complex for a TV series. The film was directed by David Silverman and written by a team of Simpsons writers comprising Groening, Brooks, Jean, Reiss, Mirkin, Scully, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, Matt Selman, and Ian Maxtone-Graham. Work continued on the screenplay from 2003 onwards and did not cease, taking place in the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. He also wanted to make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, as [...] "we wanna really give <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you haven't seen before." [...] Production of the film occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the series had concluded.|$|E
500|$|Work {{continued}} on the screenplay from 2003 onwards, {{taking place in}} the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. The writers spent six months discussing a plot, and each of them offered sketchy ideas. Jean suggested the family rescue manatees, which became the 2005 episode [...] "The Bonfire of the Manatees", and there was also a notion similar to that of The Truman Show where the characters discovered their lives were a TV show. Groening rejected this, as he felt that the Simpsons should [...] "never become aware of themselves as celebrities", but the idea was later used in the video game The Simpsons Game. Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. The decision for Flanders to have an important role also came early on, as Jean wished to see Bart wonder what his life would be like if Flanders were his father. Hank Scorpio, a character from the 1996 episode [...] "You Only Move Twice", was originally meant to return as the main antagonist, but the staff dropped the idea and created Russ Cargill instead. Having eventually decided on the basic outline of the plot for the film, the writers then separated it into seven sections. Jean, Scully, Reiss, Swartzwelder, Vitti, Mirkin, and Meyer wrote 25 pages each, and the group met one month later to merge the seven sections into one [...] "very rough draft". The film's script was written {{in the same way as}} the television series: the writers sitting around a table, pitching ideas, and trying to make each other laugh. The script went through over 100 revisions, and at one point the film was a musical. However, the songs were continually being shortened and the idea was dropped. Groening described his desire to also make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, saying that he wanted to [...] "give <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you haven't seen before".|$|E

[...] Callas herself {{said that she would}} go to [...] "the conservatoire at 10 in the morning and leave with the last pupil... devouring music" [...] for 10 hours a day. When asked by her teacher why she did this, her answer was that even [...] "with the least talented pupil, he can teach <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you, the most talented, {{might not be able to}} do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Nehemiah {{cited the}} use of the words [...] "will bring you out" [...] in [...] to {{demonstrate}} that using the word hamotzi in the blessing over bread would mean that God [...] "will bring forth" [...] bread from the land – not that God [...] "has brought forth" [...] bread from the land. Rabbi Nehemiah thus read [...] to mean: [...] "I am the Lord, the One Who will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians." [...] The Gemara reported that the Rabbis of a Baraita, however, read [...] to mean: [...] "When I shall bring you out, I will do for <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> will show you that I am the One Who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians." ...|$|E
