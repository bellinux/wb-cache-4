25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for <b>your</b> <b>college.</b> But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

"Among other reasons, {{we believe}} [...] rankings: imply a false {{precision}} and authority {{that is not}} warranted by the data they use; obscure important differences in educational mission in aligning institutions on a single scale; say nothing or very little about whether students are actually learning at particular colleges or universities; encourage wasteful spending and gamesmanship in institutions' pursuing improved rankings; overlook {{the importance of a}} student in making education happen and overweight the importance of a university's prestige in that process; and degrade for students the educational value of the college search process.

40|$|As a {{guardian}} and promoter {{of one of}} our nation's community col-leges, how are you faring? Are you successfully guarding <b>your</b> <b>college's</b> academic quality and promoting its credibility as a scholarly institution? In an effort to uphold <b>your</b> particular community <b>college's</b> mission and sustain <b>your</b> <b>college's</b> efforts to be a strong presence within higher educa-tion, you might consider ways to enhance the college's reputation, to bring prestige to the campus and its faculty, and to reshape the image of the institution in the eyes of both the public and the education community. Language can help you meet these goals through an understanding of the community college as a discourse community. An investigation into the notion of the community college as a dis-course community must begin with a presentation of the arguments regarding the definition of the term discourse community. Although the literature offers evidence that the definition of the term discourse commu-nity has been greatly debated, I begin with a tentative definition offered by Bizzell (1992) because it is comprehensive in scope. A discourse community, she says, "is {{a group of people who}} share certain language-using practices [...] . [that] can be seen as conventionalized " by social interactions within the group and in its dealings with outsiders. It bor-rows from the concept of "speech community. " It is "bound together primarily by its uses of language, although bound perhaps by other ties as well, geographical, socioeconomic, ethnic, professional, and so on " (p...|$|R
