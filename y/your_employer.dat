6000|$|THE JUDGE. Didn't it {{occur to}} you that the only thing for you to do was to confess to <b>your</b> <b>employers,</b> and restore the money? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is <b>your</b> <b>employer,</b> the Sieur Philip Fletcher. I have {{warranted}} that {{he shall}} find you good and true men, and I {{hope you will}} do justice to my recommendation." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Coulson," [...] he said, [...] "I {{congratulate you}} and <b>your</b> <b>employers.</b> To the lower regions with business! Help {{yourself}} to the oysters and pass the wine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{about your}} own policy?" [...] I questioned. [...] "It would seem your {{function}} is to twist truth at the command of <b>your</b> <b>employers,</b> who, in turn, obey the behests of the corporations." ...|$|R

60|$|JOHN.--Milliken! you scoundrel! What do {{you mean}} by Milliken? Speak of <b>your</b> <b>employer</b> as your {{governor}} if you like; but not as simple Milliken. Confound your impudence! you'll be calling me Howell next.|$|E

60|$|BURGESS (rising, breathless with indignation). Ho! I'm a silly ole fathead, am I? Ho, indeed (gasping). Hall right, my gurl! Hall right. You {{just wait}} till I {{tell that to}} <b>your</b> <b>employer.</b> You'll see. I'll teach you: see if I don't.|$|E
60|$|JOHN.--Yes, child--yes. I think {{a better}} never beat in woman's bosom. You're good to everybody--good {{to your parents}} whom you send half your wages to: good to <b>your</b> <b>employers</b> whom you never robbed of a halfpenny.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Florence, [...] "it was {{not your}} fault, and I'm sorry for you. I suppose you had--difficulties--with some of <b>your</b> <b>employers?</b> No doubt {{one or two}} of them tried to make love to you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Just so,' said Mr Abney, {{by way of}} {{comment on}} this. 'You are {{naturally}} surprised. The whole arrangement is excessively unusual, and, I may say--ah--disturbing. However, you have your duty to fulfil to <b>your</b> <b>employer,</b> White, and you will, of course, remain here with the boy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In any {{ordinary}} case," [...] he continued, [...] "I {{would not}} {{ask you to}} betray <b>your</b> <b>employer's</b> confidence. As things are, I think I am justified. You are English, are you not? You realise, I suppose, {{that the country is}} on the brink of war?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{for some}} reason, Sir James is keen about {{bringing}} you back, {{and if you}} state the terms on which you'll come, I imagine he'll agree.

6000|$|... "Yes, you are," [...] replied Morley, with a laugh. [...] "I {{make you}} master now. So, pray, Captain Welton, attend to your duty, and be civil to <b>your</b> <b>employer.</b> There's a breeze coming that {{will send you}} foul o' the Maplin light if you don't look out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it belongs}} to him, Goldstein," [...] said Uncle John, {{in defense of the}} boy. [...] "He is <b>your</b> <b>employer</b> and has the right to dictate. But just at present he needs your help. He asked me to come here and tell you of his arrest." ...|$|E
