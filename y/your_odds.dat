40|$|IN {{the course}} of the last decade, while spendingseveral {{thousand}} hours in the practice ofintensive psychotherapy, I have treated— sometimes unknowingly except in retrospect—a considerable number of schizoid and schizophrenic patients. Like all clinicians, I have formed some theoretical opinions as a result of these experiences. While I have not until recently begun any sys-tematic research efforts on this baffling disorder, I felt that to share with you some of my thoughts, based though they are upon clinical impressions in the context of selected research by others, might be an acceptable use of this occasion. Let me begin by putting a question which I find is almost never answered correctly by our clinical students on PhD orals, and the answer to which they seem to dislike when it is offered. Suppose that you were required to write down a procedure for selecting an individual from the population who would be diagnosed as schizo-phrenic by a psychiatric staff; you have to wager $ 1, 000 on being right; you may not include in your selection procedure any behavioral fact, such as a symptom or trait, manifested by the individual. What would you write down? So far as I have been able to ascertain, there is only one thing you could write down that would give you a better than even chance of winning such a bet—namely, "Find an individual X who has a schizophrenic identical twin. " Admittedly, there are many other facts which would raise <b>your</b> <b>odds</b> somewhat above the low base rate of schizophrenia. You might, for example, identify X by first finding mothers who have certain unhealthy child-rearing attitudes; you might enter a subpopulation defined jointly by such demographic variables as age, size of community, religion, ethnic background, or social class. But these would leave you with a pretty unfair wager, as would the rule, "Find an X who has a fraternal twin, of the same sex, diagnosed a...|$|E
40|$|Background: Long {{distance}} road {{running is}} continually growing as competitive and recreational sport, globally. Despite its popularity, a high burden of incidence of injury exists among runners. Previous research has focussed on specific injuries, whereas others have investigated isolated risk {{factors that may}} contribute to running related injuries. The {{purpose of the study}} is to determine possible internal and external screening variables that may predict the incidence of running-related injuries in general. Methods: Forty one recreational runners participated in an observational study over the course of 12 weeks. Screening assessments consisted of injury history, training history, and anthropometric measurements. Functional and performance assessments included the Foot Posture Index (FPI), the Functional Movement Screen (FMS), vertical jump, single leg hop and sit-and-reach tests. Participants were monitored over a period of 12 weeks by completing a weekly online logbook regarding their training and possible incidence of injury. Monitoring was terminated after 12 weeks of observation. Differences between injured and non-injured runners were determined using Independent -T-tests for mean differences, or Mann-Whitney U Test for distributional differences (non-parametric data). Binomial Logistic regression models were used to determine the influence of internal, external functional and external behavioural factors on the risk for running injury, respectively. Results: The total group revealed a cumulative incidence of injury of 63 % over the 12 weeks of observation. There was no gender difference between incidences of injuries over the 12 week observation training period (OTP). Injured runners achieved a higher total FMS score (median = 16, Interquartile Range = 3) compared to uninjured runners (median = 15, Interquartile range = 3; p = 0. 006). Binomial logistic regression models of external functional (FMS, Vertical Jump, Sit-and-Reach scores) factors [X² (3) = 9. 764, p = 0. 021] were statistically significant. Only the FMS score contributed significantly to the incidence of injury (p = 0. 013) of the three external functional factors in the Regression Model. Discussion and Conclusion: The study adds to current evidence that the assessment of the Functional Movement Screen is important in predicting injury, however, the present study shows that a higher score obtained during the FMS increase <b>your</b> <b>odds</b> to sustain an injury. The study is in contrast with the body of evidence that the incidence of previous injury is the strongest predictor of the incidence of a current injury. The study concluded that the Functional Movement Screen is a useful screening tool to determine a long distance runner's risk for running-related injuries and should be included in health-injury risk assessments of recreational runners...|$|E

Diarrheal diseases kills an estimated 1. 8 million people per year, of which, 1. 6 million are {{children under the age of}} five years old. Diarrheal diseases as a result of contaminated drinking water remain a major public health concern in developing countries. Worldwide, about 1. 1 billion people lack access to sustainable and safe drinking water sources. Contamination from pesticides, poor sanitation, unsafe waste disposal, and animal and human excrement are detrimental to a community's drinking water quality. The Kimana Group Ranch, a 6, 000 square mile Maasai group ranch within the Amboseli Region of the Southern Kajiado District in Southwest Kenya, is a community that has seen drastic changes in its water quality and quantity in recent decades. The Maasai, a traditionally pastoralist tribe, is moving more towards agriculture due to the outside influence of encroaching tribes and the prospect of a better economic future. This shift towards agriculture, increased population growth and the rapidly melting ice caps of Mt. Kilimanjaro have had harmful effects on the ranch's water quality. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects on the Kimana Group Ranch's water quality on diarrheal illness within the ranch. Our goal was to identify those contaminants most likely to cause illness, the types of sources most likely to be contaminated, and the effects of domestic water treatment on the prevalence of diarrheal disease within this community. We hypothesized that open water sources are most likely to be contaminated, that human and animal excrement was causing most of the contamination, and those individuals who treated their water were less likely to report diarrheal illness. Open and closed water sources were identified throughout the community through non-random convenience snowball sampling. Altogether 30 sites were identified, nineteen closed sources and eleven open sources. All sites were sampled and tested for concentrations of ammonia, nitrates, nitrites, pH, presence of fecal coliform, and temperature and conductivity. Surveys were administered at 29 of the sites to 526 participants where we asked individuals questions about their water collection habits, water uses, diarrhea in the household, and domestic water treatment behaviors. Ethical considerations were taken and the study was approved by the Kenyan Institutional Review Board with a waiver of approval from Boston University School of Public Health. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis was performed using SAS v 9. 1. The proportion of individuals reporting diarrhea within their household within the last two weeks was 12 % (63 / 526). There was a two-fold increase in the proportion of individuals who reported illness at open sources versus closed sources, 14. 6 % and 7. 4 % respectively. Bivariate analysis shows that individuals who collect water from open sources have 2. 15 (95 % CI: 1. 15, 4. 00) times the odds of reporting illness in their household as compared to individuals who collect their water from a closed source. Multivariate analysis shows that in this population, treating your water every time you collect reduces <b>your</b> <b>odds</b> of diarrhea by 51 %. Fecal coliform was the only water quality predictor that was not within acceptable drinking water standards. All open water sources where illness was reported tested positive for coliform. Illness at open water sources made up 98 % of the total illnesses at water sources with coliform contamination. Altogether, 77. 8 % of all who reported illness were at open water sources. Open water sources are the most contaminated and cause the most illness within the Kimana Group Ranch. Our analysis shows domestic water treatment practices provide a protective effect against diarrhea. Further studies must address other types of microbial contaminants in the ranch's water sources and their association with diarrheal illness. Open water sources and water treatment education must be the focus of interventional research within this community...|$|E
