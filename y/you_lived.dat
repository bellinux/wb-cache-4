25|$|The first {{writings}} in Scientology regarding past lives {{date from}} around 1951 and slightly earlier. In 1960, Hubbard {{published a book}} on past lives entitled Have <b>You</b> <b>Lived</b> Before This Life. In 1968 he wrote Mission into Time, a report on a five-week sailing expedition to Sardinia, Sicily and Carthage to see if specific evidence could be found to substantiate L. Ron Hubbard's recall of incidents in his own past, centuries ago.|$|E

500|$|... "There's always {{something}} to criticize -- I {{have too much}} power or too many clients. I scoff at that. Think about it: If <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> on a block with $300,000 houses and you sold yours for $2.5 million, your neighbors would thank you. But in my business they don't. That used to make me angry. Now I'm just amused." ...|$|E
500|$|The Scientology {{publication}} Have <b>You</b> <b>Lived</b> Before This Life {{contains some}} space opera, describing past lives—including some on warlike planets—which were recalled through auditing. In the 1960s, Hubbard introduced {{a series of}} questions, known as [...] "security checks", to verify members' loyalty. Mikael Rothstein, associate professor of religious history at the University of Copenhagen, sees the Xenu myth as building off of, and the culmination of, these accounts. The Xenu myth was released to Scientologists in the late 1960s, after teachings about thetans {{and their relationship to}} the physical body had been disseminated; its release provided the cause and origin of many of the group's teachings. Rothstein describes [...] "space opera" [...] as [...] "Hubbard's introduction of a new reality, and new foundation for everything".|$|E
500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E

Sometimes he would take the crowd outside to sing the final verse to the men across the street in jail, who had been arrested in raids earlier in the night. Speaking of this ritual in the film [...] (1977), gay journalist George Mendenhall said: [...] "It sounds silly, but if <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> at that time and had the oppression coming down from the police department and from society, there was nowhere to turn...and {{to be able to put}} your arms around other gay men and to be able to stand up and sing 'God Save Us Nelly Queens'...we were really not saying 'God Save Us Nelly Queens.'

The same year, [...] "The Voice Within" [...] was also performed by Jessica Robinson on Over the Rainbow. On May 26, 2012, contestant Ruth Brown performed the song live during the semi-finals of the first season of The Voice UK, which left tears on her eyes. Brown revealed that the song was personal to her {{because she had a}} hard time at school. Judge Sir Tom Jones complimented her performance, [...] "The story of the song means a lot to her, I think this girl is stronger than even she realises it herself", [...] "You didn’t just sing it, <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> it". On June 8, 2013, eleven-year-old Ariksandra Libantino sang [...] "The Voice Within" [...] during the final round of the seventh series of Britain's Got Talent. The song was also played during the first season of Ghost Whisperer on an episode entitled [...] "The Vanishing". Chris Mann and Jacquie Lee, both contestants and team members of Aguilera's team on The Voice, performed the track during the second and fifth seasons, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|In 1840, the Republic of Texas {{altered the}} city charter for Houston, {{dividing}} it into four wards. Historically the wards reflected geographic boundaries, without {{consideration of the}} population density within the wards. After slavery ended in Texas on June 19, 1865, ex-slaves were forced to live in separate enclaves within each of Houston’s wards. The voting population of the wards was lower than the population, since women and African-Americans had been forbidden from voting. Instead, wards followed boundaries of features such as the Buffalo Bayou, Congress Street, and Main Street. Each ward elected two aldermen to the Houston City Council. The election of the Mayor of Houston was citywide. Betty Chapman, a historian, said [...] "They really were mixed societies in the early days. Where you worked dictated where <b>you</b> <b>lived,</b> not who you wanted to live around." ...|$|E

2500|$|Book of Leviticus: [...] "God {{spoke to}} Moses at Mount Sinai, {{telling him to}} speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you come to the land that I am giving you, the land must be given a rest period, a sabbath to God. For six years you may plant your fields, prune your vineyards, and harvest your crops, but the seventh year is a sabbath of sabbaths for the land. It is God's sabbath during which you may not plant your fields, nor prune your vineyards. Do not harvest crops that grow on their own and do not gather the grapes on your unpruned vines, since it is a year of rest for the land. [...] the land is resting may be eaten by you, by your male and female slaves, and by the {{employees}} and resident hands who live with you. All the crops shall be eaten by the domestic and wild animals that are in your land." [...] (Leviticus 25:1–7) [...] "And if ye shall say: 'What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we may not sow, nor gather in our increase'; then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for the three years. And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the produce, the old store; until the ninth year, until her produce come in, ye shall eat the old store." [...] (Leviticus 25:20–22) [...] " [...] I will scatter you among the nations, and keep the sword drawn against you. Your land will remain desolate, and your cities in ruins. Then, as long as the land is desolate and you are in your enemies' land, the land will enjoy its sabbaths. The land will rest and enjoy its sabbatical years.
