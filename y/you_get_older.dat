500|$|Silence is {{considered}} a [...] "passion project" [...] of Scorsese's {{and has been in}} development since 1990, two years after the release of Scorsese's most controversial film, The Last Temptation of Christ, which also carried strongly religious themes. Scorsese first read the novel in 1989 and obtained the movie rights soon afterwards. When asked why he retained interest in the project for over 26 years, Scorsese stated: [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>older,</b> ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>older,</b> there's got to be more... Silence is just something that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions." ...|$|E

When {{asked if she}} still wishes she had the same body she had at 20 she replied, [...] "No. I actually think I look better now because I feel so much better about myself now. And that's what's so exciting. As <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>older,</b> you get better.... Look at all these incredible women, like Vanessa Redgrave, who are still so beautiful. The reason is because they embrace who they are." [...] She has appeared {{on the covers of}} Shape, Cosmopolitan, Allure, Glamour, Lucky, InStyle, Maxim and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E

[...] "As <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> and have children, your reflections on what matters begin to change." [...] Raymond says [...] "I started slowing it down," [...] he went on, [...] "enjoying the places I went, going to museums, understanding the nature of what artists were trying to say." [...] Raymond is good friend with graffiti and street-style-inspired artists RETNA, who did the cover art for Justin Biebers studio album Purpose, as well as a contemporary American artist, Daniel Arsham who directed his music video [...] "Chains" [...] and did the cover art for his singles [...] "No Limit" [...] and [...] "Crash".|$|E

500|$|The album {{marked a}} {{departure}} in Fall Out Boy's sound {{in which the}} band implemented a diverse array of musical styles. As reported by Billboard, Fall Out Boy [...] "drifts further from its hardcore punk roots to write increasingly accessible pop tunes," [...] a slight departure from the group's previous more pop punk sound. Infinity on High {{has been compared to}} the work of pop punk bands such as Green Day, with Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commenting, [...] "Whatever snot and feedback courses through these songs, sweetness always triumphs, carried forth by bubblegum bass lines, snappy drums and tunes as comforting as lullabies." [...] Stump explained that the album contains a variety of different moods: [...] "It’s {{one of those things where}} <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> as a band and you do your own thing...The older Fall Out Boy elements, from the early records, are definitely there, and this album is an extension of that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> is that parents don’t know what the hell they’re doing and neither will you when you get to be a parent. You’ve just got to understand that people are human and they make mistakes," [...] he said. DeLonge remembered learning of his parents' divorce when he discovered scrape marks on the driveway of their home. [...] "Right then, I knew my dad had dragged out his furniture single-handedly," [...] he recalled. He spoke on the song's inspiration in 2001: ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{family was}} {{by his side}} {{at the time of}} his death. His good friend Burt Reynolds made a {{statement}} to the Los Angeles Times, saying: [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> and start to lose people you love, you think about it more, and I was dreading this moment. Dom always made you feel better when he was around, and there will never be another like him." [...] Mel Brooks also made a statement to the same paper, telling them that DeLuise [...] "created so much joy and laughter on the set that you couldn’t get your work done. So every time I made a movie with Dom, I would plan another two days on the schedule just for laughter. It's a sad day. It's hard to think of this life and this world without him." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} in The Guardian in 2000, Sontag was quite open about being bisexual: [...] "'Shall I tell you about getting older?', she says, and she is laughing. 'When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>older,</b> 45 plus, men stop fancying you. Or put it another way, the men I fancy don't fancy me. I want a young man. I love beauty. So what's new?' She says {{she has been in}} love seven times in her life. 'No, hang on,' she says. 'Actually, it's nine. Five women, four men.'" [...] Many of Sontag's obituaries failed to mention her significant same-sex relationships, most notably that with Annie Leibovitz. In response to this criticism, New York Times Public Editor, Daniel Okrent, defended the newspaper's obituary, stating {{that at the time of}} Sontag's death, a reporter could make no independent verification of her romantic relationship with Leibovitz (despite attempts to do so). After Sontag's death, Newsweek published an article about Annie Leibovitz that made clear references to her decade-plus relationship with Sontag.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Come Up Show following a recent performance in Canada in April 2011, Method Man replied with this regarding his current 'weed-loving' image: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> and you've got kids and your {{kids are going to}} school and you know [...] teachers...and they see how active you are and concerned [...] with your kids' education or well being, it's hard to sit there and be taken seriously if people are always talking about he's always high...which is totally not the case", he said. [...] "When I first came out, I was young, we were doing our thing, we smoked a lot...and we didn't care if the world knew. Now, I have to use more discretion because of my kids. This is not for me; everything I do is for them now, so I use a bit more discretion and I don't put weed as a forefront any more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gromyko grew up {{near the}} {{district}} town of Vetka {{where most of the}} inhabitants were devoted Old Believers in the Russian Orthodox Church. Gromyko's own village was also predominantly religious, but Gromyko started doubting the supernatural at a very early age. His first dialog on the subject was with his grandmother Marfa, who answered his inquiry about God with [...] "Wait until <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>older.</b> Then you will understand all this much better". According to Gromyko, [...] "Other adults said basically the same thing" [...] when talking about religion. Gromyko's neighbour at the time, Mikhail Sjeljutov, was a freethinker and introduced Gromyko to new non-religious ideas and told Gromyko that scientists were beginning to doubt the existence of God. From the age of nine, after the Bolshevik revolution, Gromyko started reading atheist propaganda in flyers and pamphlets. At the age of thirteen Gromyko {{became a member of the}} Komsomol and held anti-religious speeches in the village with his friends as well as promoting Communist values.|$|E

But when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>old,</b> your money will be spent, and you {{will not be able to}} go out and get more. I know, master. I have studied the way of white men. On the beaches are many old men who were young once, and who could get money just like you. Now they are old, and they have nothing, and they wait about for the young men like you to come ashore and buy drinks for them.|$|R
2500|$|Jimmy Eat World {{began writing}} Damage in early 2012, with vocalist and guitarist Jim Adkins noting: [...] "I think with [...] Invented [...] an outline {{that it would}} be themed around. Not {{necessarily}} a subject, but we had a direction before we wrote it. As <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> it's more interesting to have a theme that everything tries to support – I would say this album [...] has a theme. I would describe it as an attempt at making an adult breakup record. The consequences to what the characters are going through are more significant. There's just more to it. I'm 37 and the world around me is a lot different than when I was writing breakup songs in my 20s. I tried to reflect that in what the lyrics are." [...] Adkins elaborated: [...] "With Damage the point was love songs. But the type of love songs that interest me deal with adversity and emotional injury. If you have a happy song about how happy you are, I just want to slap you. There's no story there for me. I can't have any empathy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Connolly and {{his older}} sister, Florence (named for their {{maternal}} grandmother, and eighteen months his senior), were cared for by two aunts, Margaret and Mona Connolly, his father's sisters, in their cramped tenement in Stewartville Street, Partick. [...] "My aunts constantly told me I was stupid, which still affects me today pretty badly. It’s just a belief that I’m not quite as good as anyone else. It gets worse as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>older.</b> I’m a happy man now but I still have the scars of that." [...] Regarding his sister, Connolly has called her his [...] "great defender". [...] "To this day, he explained in 2009, [...] "Guys say, 'God, your sister... We didn't dare beat you up – your sister was a nightmare'. She used to get after them." [...] In the mid-1960s, Flo was on holiday in Dunoon {{with her husband and}} two children. [...] "My mother said, 'I saw Florence walking along, and I followed her.'" [...] "I said, 'Did you speak to her?' 'Oh, no, I didn't,' she said. I thought, 'Oh, my god. It's like being a ghost while you're still alive.' Walking behind your own child. Having a look. I couldn't bear that." ...|$|E
