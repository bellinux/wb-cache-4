500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E
500|$|NPR writer Linda Holmes {{challenged}} the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself [...] "silly {{and full of}} bad dialogue" [...] and [...] "cheesy more than offensive", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that [...] "you can shake a Bunny tail and be empowered, no argument. It depends on what's {{going on in the}} rest of your life. But shaking a Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment if {{you have to go to}} Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage." [...] The series, she concluded, might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement. In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, [...] "The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors—no gum chewing, constant smiling—wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe." [...] Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that [...] "The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they are nice to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninterestingm calling it a [...] "bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once." [...] Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that [...] "the truth is [...] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame." ...|$|E

[...] As a result, Jackson said, the bidder who had criticized Bush did not receive the contract: [...] "Brother, you have a disconnect—the President is elected, I was selected. You wouldn’t be getting the contract unless I was sitting here. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with the President, don’t tell the secretary." [...] Jackson told the crowd, [...] "He didn't get the contract. Why should I reward someone who doesn't like the president, so they can use funds to try to campaign against the President? Logic says they don't get the contract. That's the way I believe." ...|$|E
