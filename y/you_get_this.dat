A major inspiration was the Aphex Twin single [...] "Windowlicker", which was [...] "neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track", according to Bangalter. The duo also utilized vintage equipment {{to recreate the}} sound of an artist from a previous era. As stated by Homem-Christo, [...] "On 'Digital Love' <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> Supertramp vibe on the bridge," [...] which was generated through an in-studio Wurlitzer piano. During a later interview, Homem-Christo clarified that [...] "we didn't make a list of artists we like and copy their songs." [...] Daft Punk would collaborate with Edwards again on the song [...] "Fragments of Time", featured on the 2013 album Random Access Memories.|$|E

She is shown {{on the roof of the}} building throughout the video, with the Los Angeles skyline in the background. The video features mostly face shots of her and Timbaland intercut with shots of dancers, under the careful guidance of internationally acclaimed Puerto Rican choreographer Gabriel Rivera. Furtado described the clip as [...] "a throwback to the '80s ... the more surreal side" [...] because the shots of her and Timbaland reminded her much of those of Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart in videos for Eurythmics' singles, and [...] "the strange relationship [...] had, where ... <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> intense vibe from it. And Tim and me, we're partners, we vibe on a serious creative level, so the video captures that energy." [...] The video ends with Furtado climbing back into the helicopter, which flies off.|$|E

Reading [...] "Just like the Calgon commercial / I really gotta get up out of here", Carey tells her lover that she is leaving him, making a [...] "clever" [...] reference to a commercial. In regards to the latter lyrics, Lawrence Farber from the Windy City Times wrote [...] "they are a playful approach to bitterness—and, more specifically, a cheatin' bad apple." [...] She then sings [...] "By the time <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> message / It's gonna be too late / So don't bother paging me / 'Cause I'll be on my way," [...] establishing that the relationship is over, and that he shouldn't even try to mend the situation.

500|$|The single's {{video was}} {{directed}} by Jake Nava, and contains numerous wardrobe changes by Carey in a storyline involving luxurious scenery in which the singer leaves her significant other. It is presented in one continuous shot, with no edits. The video begins with a TV screen and the word 'Mimi' appearing, while on the monitor, Dupri raps his introduction. As the television fades, Carey is then shown lying in a bathtub overflowing with water and rose petals, with her hair flowing {{over the side of}} the tub. Next, the camera follows down one floor of the mansion to find Carey, decked out in bright blue makeup and high heels, as she sings [...] "By the time <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> message / It's gonna be too late / So don't bother paging me / 'Cause I'll be on my way," [...] into the phone. A short scene is then shown of her lover in a strip club, receiving the message Carey had sent him. As he reads it, he blows smoke into the screen, fading to reveal Carey dressed in a trench coat and dress, before grabbing her bag and heading out the door as she sings, [...] "So I packed up my Louis Vuitton / Jumped in your ride and took off." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MistaJam, Tempah cites Dizzee Rascal and So Solid Crew as influences for the album, who've influenced him since his childhood. He also told Capital that Daft Punk influenced the album. Speaking about the album title Demonstration, Tinie {{said that it was}} about him compromising to make an album that was both true to where he came from and follows the trappings of mainstream hip hop: [...] "Anyone who wants to take inspiration from it can have a sort of example based on my experiences of how to do this. So basically, do something that still nods to where you've come from, still feels very London, still feels very British, but kind of meets the criteria of what a mainstream record needs." [...] He also commented oh how things change when signing with a record label and how the process of making albums: [...] "The first time around, you don't really know. All you do is <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> record deal and you're like whoa! Like, I'm signed! This is amazing! And you're just recording {{and before you know it}} the album's done. This time around, I had to think about so much more things, you know: edits, production things that I didn't like, going back and forth on mixing.... I was very hands-on this time." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 19, Duty offered Wise some {{cigarettes}} {{in exchange for}} allowing himself to be tied up to make the guards think {{that he had been}} taken hostage, with the goal of having Duty transferred into administrative security. The prosecutor's report stated that after tying Wise's hands and feet behind his back, Duty strangled him to death with a shoelace. Duty then wrote a letter to Wise's mother Mary, in which he stated: [...] "Well by the time <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> letter you will already know that your son is dead. I know now because I just killed him an hour ago. Gee you'd think I'd be feeling some remorse but I'm not." [...] The letter was intercepted at the prison.|$|E
2500|$|The secretive {{attitude}} and gradual unfolding of Snape's character was broadly admired, with Stephen Fry, the UK audio books narrator, saying in 2003: [...] "Most characters like Snape {{are hard to}} love {{but there is a}} sort of ambiguity—you can’t quite decide—something sad about him—lonely and it’s fascinating when you think he’s going to be the evil one..., then slowly <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> idea he’s not so bad after all." [...] David Yates, who directed the final four films of the series, also expressed his views on the character, saying: [...] "A character like Snape, where you're not really sure if he's a good guy or a bad guy, that gives you a latent tension... I think the coolest thing you can do with an audience is deny them a little bit of information." [...] Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself. Joyce Millman suggests in her essay [...] "To Sir with Love" [...] in the book Mapping the World of Harry Potter, that Snape is derived from a tradition of Byronic heroes such as Wuthering Heights Heathcliff.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the case}} was resolved, control of the Legacy of Kain {{trademark}} belonged to Crystal Dynamics, and Kain II was either canceled or superseded when Shifter became Soul Reaver. Though Crystal Dynamics staff who worked on Soul Reaver {{declined to comment on}} the discovery, Dyack had previously affirmed that [...] " [...] tried to take it over". He said that [...] "many people ask us if we like the direction they have gone in but it is so alien to what we created it is pointless to answer now. We understand that some people love the Soul Reaver series and we think that is great. However, it is not what we would ever have done". In a 2008 interview, he elaborated his sentiment that [...] "if you look at Legacy of Kain where it is right now -- so diluted, so dysfunctional -- as a property itself, it's pretty much gone in a completely different direction than we would have ever taken it. [...] Even if the developer's good, and I think Crystal Dynamics is not a bad developer, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> dilution of the content, because the original author is gone".|$|E
2500|$|In late 2006, Scott {{announced}} {{a remake of}} the action thriller The Warriors (1979). [...] "The original Warriors was New York in the 1970s, and everything went upwards, everything went vertically. And now I'm making it a contemporary thing and doing it in L.A., so everything is horizontal. So my vision of The Warriors is Los Angeles in 2007 and the gangs, instead of being 30, {{are going to be}} 3,000 or 5,000," [...] he said. Scott met with actual gang members for research: [...] "I've met all the heads of all the different gangs, so I've already educated myself. They all said, 'Listen dude, if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> on we'll sign a treaty and we'll all stand on the Long Beach Bridge. There'll be 150,000 members there. It'll look like the L.A. Marathon. Scott was simultaneously developing a drama project titled Emma's War about British foreign aid worker Emma McCune. Scott said in October 2006, [...] "It's been a difficult piece to crack. We had one writer aboard who did a pass at the script and didn't get it, but we've got someone else onboard now who I'm going to make live down there and smell it, touch it, feel it. There's nothing that can compare to that kind of first-hand experience." ...|$|E

In one incident, after receiving a complaint from Steve Jobs of Apple, Schmidt sent an email to Google's HR people saying; [...] "I believe we have a policy of no recruiting from Apple and this is a direct inbound request. Can <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> stopped and let me know why this is happening? I will need to send a response back to Apple quickly so please let me know as soon as you can. Thanks Eric". Schmidt's email led to a recruiter for Google being [...] "terminated within the hour" [...] for not having adhered to the illegal scheme. Under Schmidt, there was a [...] "Do Not Call list" [...] of companies Google would avoid recruiting from. According to a court filing, another email exchange shows Google's human resources director asking Schmidt about sharing its no-cold call agreements with competitors. Schmidt responded that he preferred it be shared [...] "verbally, since I don't want to create a paper trail over which we can be sued later?" ...|$|E
