500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change <b>your</b> <b>approach</b> like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E

2500|$|In March 2013 Giulio Fanti, {{professor}} of mechanical and thermal measurement at the University of Padua conducted a battery of experiments on various threads that he believes were cut from the shroud during the 1988 Carbon-14 dating, and concluded that they dated from 300 BCE to 400 CE, potentially placing the Shroud within the lifetime of Jesus of Nazareth. Because of {{the manner in which}} Fanti obtained the shroud fibers, many are dubious about his findings. The shroud’s official custodian, Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia of Turin, told Vatican Insider: [...] "As there is no degree of safety on the authenticity of the materials on which these experiments were carried out [...] the shroud cloth, the shroud's custodians cannot recognize any serious value to the results of these alleged experiments." [...] Barrie Schwortz, a member of the original STURP investigation team, commented on Fanti’s theory: [...] "But it would be more convincing if the basic research had first been presented in a professional, peer-reviewed journal. If you’re using old techniques in new ways, then you need to submit <b>your</b> <b>approach</b> to other scientists." ...|$|E

Immediately the whole conclave replies, and you behold them rising above the trees, flapping darkly, and winging their way to deeper solitudes. Sometimes, however, they remain till you come near enough to discern their sable gravity of aspect, each occupying a separate bough, or perhaps the blasted tip-top of a pine.

It declared demands to be placed on capitalists, opposition to the bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, and support for workers' action against fascism. Most of the demands on capitalists remain unfulfilled. The collapse of the Soviet Union occurred, but through a social revolution leading to the restoration of capitalism, rather than the political revolution proposed by the Trotskyists.

60|$|It {{would be}} better, I dare say, {{for you to}} make <b>your</b> <b>approach,</b> as I made mine, through my childhood. As a boy I was very like other boys--in my waking hours.

No fear that I experienced in my waking life resembled the fear that possessed me in my sleep. It was of a quality and kind that transcended all my experiences.|$|E

Then, if you steal up toward the sound, you will find Mooween standing on a big limb of a beech tree, grasping the narrowing trunk with his powerful forearms, tugging and pushing mightily to shake down the ripe beechnuts.

Most wild creatures, however fierce, prefer to mind their own business and will respect the same sentiment in you. But when you stumble upon a wildcat you are never sure of his next move. That is because he is a slinking, treacherous creature, like all cats, and never quite knows how best to meet you. He suspects you unreasonably because he knows you suspect him with reason. Generally he slinks away, or leaps suddenly for cover, according to the method of <b>your</b> <b>approach.</b> But though smaller he is naturally more savage than either the Canada lynx or the panther, and sometimes he crouches and snarls in your face, or even jumps for your chest at the first movement.|$|E
