500|$|Miller had {{a strong}} {{reputation}} with fellow musicians. Pianist Geoffrey Keezer was convinced {{that he wanted to}} be a pianist after attending a performance by Miller in 1986. Vibraphonist Warren Wolf stated that Miller helped him early in his career, including by being a link to jazz history: [...] "you're getting that experience of playing with Art Blakey, that attitude of 'Yes, it's my band, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> other people a chance to shine.'" [...] Robert Glasper also cited Miller as an influence, and wrote and recorded [...] "One for 'Grew" [...] as a tribute.|$|E
500|$|Hail to the Thiefs lyrics were {{influenced}} by what Yorke called [...] "the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity" [...] following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush. He took words and phrases from discussion of the unfolding War on Terror and used them in the album's lyrics and artwork. He denied any intent to make a [...] "political statement" [...] with the songs, and told the Toronto Star: [...] "I desperately tried not to write anything political, anything expressing the deep, profound terror I'm living with day to day. But it's just fucking there, and eventually <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it up and let it happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Hershiser {{had ended}} Padres catcher Benito Santiago's 34-game hitting streak {{the year before}} and the Padres were eager to snap Hershiser's streak. Santiago's streak was an MLB record for a catcher, an MLB record for a rookie and a team record for the Padres. No one who has started a hitting streak at age 22 or younger has matched the streak since. According to Tony Gwynn, [...] "We wanted so badly to put a run on the board...Maybe, we tried a little too hard. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the man credit. He didn't give me one decent pitch to hit all night. He put {{everything}} right where {{he wanted it to}} go." ...|$|E

500|$|Wellman {{frequently}} {{conflicted with}} the military officers brought in to supervise the picture, especially the infantry commander whom he considered to have [...] "two monumental hatreds: fliers and movie people". After one argument Wellman retorted to the commander, [...] "You're just a goddamn fool because the government has told me <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me all your men and do just exactly what I want you to do." [...] Although Wellman {{paid much attention to}} technical details in shooting, he used cars and clothing of the year during the filming, forgetting to use those of World War I. He took six weeks to fully edit the film and prepare it for release.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Andrew Hanson {{questioned}} whether the writers had been using drugs lately because of the surge of drug-related episodes; though he loved it, he acknowledged that the episode was one [...] "you are either going to love or hate", explaining that it [...] "got a little crazy using Olivia’s mind as a setting, [...] it stays grounded through the emotional current running underneath... <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Fringe credit for taking a risky, bold move." [...] SFScope writer Sarah Stegall called the episode [...] "brilliant, risky, fascinating, and dangerous. It's not a tack this show can afford to take very often, but I like it when it does." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{launched}} by ITV and Syco at the Millennium Hotel Mayfair, London, on 3 May 2011. The initial recruitment phase for contestants lasted until 13 May. The updated format was conceived by Simon Cowell, {{who said that}} it was inspired by roulette and the story of Ashley Revell, who had bet his entire life savings on [...] "red" [...] in a roulette game in Las Vegas. It is the most expensive game show in history, costing in the region of £15m, at around £1.5m per episode. ITV's director of entertainment and comedy, Elaine Bedell, was contacted by Cowell, [...] "This being Simon this was at 1.30am, but even then it was quite a compelling idea". When later talking about the £1m prize on offer each night, Cowell said, [...] "It's expensive if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> away a million every night but we have insurance for that." ...|$|E

500|$|In its 7 December 2010 issue, Heat {{magazine}} said series 7 of The X Factor {{had been}} the best series to date, citing many of the controversies, plus events such as Lloyd singing on a spiral staircase, Wagner's [...] "ludicrous" [...] performances and Walsh likening Richardson to [...] "a little Lenny Henry", as moments that helped make it [...] "the most deliriously, thrilling, controversial and demented yet. [...] This was the year the biggest and best show on TV somehow got bigger and better." [...] Before the final, Digital Spy's reality television editor Alex Fletcher listed his five favourite moments from the series. His favourite moment was Nhengu's elimination, on which he said [...] "No other show can make people so passionate, angry and feel like they really know the programme's stars. With only approximately 30 minutes of screentime, Gamu had managed to capture the hearts of millions. Whatever you think of Simon Cowell's programmes, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them credit for achieving that." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Bellman {{writes that}} modern concert {{performance}} style—set in the [...] "conservatory" [...] tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings—militates against {{what is known}} of Chopin's more intimate performance technique. The composer himself said to a pupil that [...] "concerts are never real music, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> {{up the idea of}} hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art." [...] Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as [...] "always crescendo to a high note", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring. [...] Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin [...] "has created a kind of chromatic embroidery... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn". Hiller wrote that [...] "What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers." ...|$|E
500|$|Thierry Henry {{paid tribute}} to Larsson's {{contribution}} to Barcelona's win after the game, saying, [...] "People always talk about Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him credit for that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is a team player. He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision." [...] Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.|$|E

500|$|After {{watching}} {{the first several}} episodes of season three, Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine gave the show 3.5/4 stars, and praised it for making a [...] "huge, game-changing step forward". He continued that [...] "Hard science meets soft comedy, {{and the results are}} consistently surprising and rarely disappointing. The solid mythology and high stakes keep the series moving as forward as quickly as FlashForward and The Event, but the dual tones of the two worlds offer considerably more breadth in the stories it tells... captivating television". Robert Bianco from USA Today praised Torv, Noble, and Jackson's performances. He however disliked the new plotline of two Olivias, explaining [...] "It's hard to fault the execution of the first two episodes, which skillfully set up Fringe's two competing universes and two misplaced Olivias... Yet well-done isn't the same as welcome. I'm not giving up on the show, which was one of last year's best. But I don't want to spend weeks watching our Olivia suffer and their Olivia make Walter and Peter suffer. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> writers leeway to take you where they want to go — but at a certain point, commercial entertainment has to be entertaining, or there's no reason to watch".|$|E
500|$|Karen Foss, a {{communications}} {{professor at the}} University of New Mexico, attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics {{to the fact that}} he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, [...] "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies." [...] Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the [...] "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: [...] "My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you." [...] A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective: And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.|$|E

50|$|Historically, the Kwakwaka'wakw {{economy was}} based {{primarily}} on fishing, with the men also engaging in some hunting, and the women gathering wild fruits and berries. Ornate weaving and woodwork were important crafts, and wealth, defined by slaves and material goods, was prominently displayed and traded at potlatch ceremonies. These customs were the subject of extensive study by the anthropologist Franz Boas. In contrast to most non-native societies, wealth and status were not determined by how much <b>you</b> <b>had,</b> but by how much <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> away.

Quintana started the fight boxing and {{connecting}} right jabs, the round concluded with both users exchanging combinations.

Quintana began the third round connecting a solid jab to Cotto's face, but the round concluded with Cotto connecting several combinations to the body. In the fifth round Cotto had control of the fight's tempo, and connected several combinations to the body, scoring a knockdown while switching between the orthodox and southpaw stances. Between rounds Quintana indicated that {{he was unable to}} continue, the corner wanted to continue but Quintana was unresponsive when the referee asked if he wanted to proceed.
