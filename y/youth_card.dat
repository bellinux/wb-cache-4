2500|$|In the {{elections}} of 1972 he sought reelection but lost to Rafael Hernández Colón of the PPD. [...] The PPD had claimed that many corruption scandals (rather minor compared to similar ones in the various administrations following Ferré's) had been overlooked by the Ferré administration. A bloody student strike at the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras in 1971 had been neutralized by the Puerto Rican police using brute force, something about which Ferré had mixed feelings. Hernández played the <b>youth</b> <b>card</b> in his campaign (when elected he was the youngest Puerto Rican governor). All these issues, along with the reunification of the People's Party and the PDP, contributed to a PDP win over Ferré in the election.|$|E

5|$|The {{regional}} ORCA {{card was}} introduced as an integrated smart card for transit {{agencies in the}} Puget Sound region on April 20, 2009, allowing users to load monthly passes and value through an e-purse web interface. The card also allowed free transfers within a two-hour period between transit agencies of equal value, with the difference for higher fare subtracted from the e-purse or prompting for cash. While initially available for no fee, effective March 1, 2010 a $5 cost was added when ordering a standard adult or <b>youth</b> ORCA <b>card.</b> CT removed their paper transfers on January 1, 2010 after the ORCA card made them obsolete.|$|R

30|$|Regarding locations, {{gambling}} crimes involving {{fraud and}} theft appeared more obvious to participants in northern NSW and less obvious in north QLD. Crime associated with dependant youth stealing for food {{was reported in}} both northern NSW and north QLD. <b>Youth</b> gambling on <b>cards</b> for money was reported and observed in two LGAs in northern NSW.

40|$|Twenty-one 15 - to 17 -year-olds {{attempted}} to purchase cigarettes in 232 {{stores in the}} manner that confederates typically do in access studies, {{as well as in}} the manipulative ways (e. g., lying about their ages) that youth smokers do, thereby modeling youth access to tobacco within versus outside of studies, respectively. Youth typical-research versus manipulative behavior was contrasted with clerk behavior (requests for <b>youth</b> ID <b>cards)</b> to examine the relative contributions of both to youth access to tobacco for the 1 st time. Results revealed that clerk behavior was the strongest predictor of cigarette sales to youth and hence underscore the need for interventions with merchants. Sales nonetheless were higher under youth-manipulative conditions and thereby highlight the low ecological validity of access research. Key words: youth access to tobacco, youth lies, ecological validity, primary prevention Smoking among youth (12 - to 17 -year-olds) might be under-stood as a function of supply and demand, where supply refers to youth access to (ability to acquire) cigarettes, and demand refers to the psychosocial variables that predict children’s desire to smok...|$|R
30|$|In one LGA, <b>youth</b> {{gambling}} on <b>cards</b> was plainly obvious. Card gambling {{was a regular}} occurrence here where: “kids play in street nearly every day, 16 year olds” and “kids {{play a lot of}} cards”. Several concerned community members saw potential lifetime patterns of risky behavior being established by these young gamblers. One long-term resident said “ 80 % young kids play cards for money; sets them up for later patterns of gambling”. This was reinforced by a family support worker who saw an easy transition from cards to commercial gambling “kids start playing cards in the street in the open, very young. Underage {{gambling on}} cards in main street. At 18 they go to venues”.|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} 100 years, {{vocational}} psychologists and educational researchers {{have sought to}} identify the significant influences shaping occupational interests. This descriptive study used a series of vocational card sort exercises with 139 rural high school youth to identify gender differences in occupational interests toward working in 60 of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s fastest growing occupations, including new and emerging 21 st century green energy roles. Through a classroom-based exercise, <b>youth</b> sorted <b>cards</b> from four decks into piles (1 - 5) at their desk. Sorting the card into pile (1) expressed Strong Dislike; pile (2) Dislike, pile (3) No Interest, pile (4) Some Interest, or pile (5) Strong Interest toward the occupational information depicted on each card. Four decks of 60 cards were used to measure youth expressed interest toward performing the occupational tasks (A), holding the occupational titles (B), working in the type of workplace environments (C), and using the type of tools and technology (D) used by workers in each occupation. A Total Occupational Interest Score reflected the summation of four scores from deck (A+B+C+D) by each youth toward each occupation. Significant differences in occupational interests were found. Female youth expressed strongest interest toward health care, and lowest interest toward green energy roles. Male youth were most interested in construction, transportation, advanced manufacturing, and homeland security. Both groups most preferred working in traditional roles for each gender to perform in the workplace...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This brief report {{provides}} grades for the 2014 New Zealand Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and <b>Youth.</b> The Report <b>Card</b> {{presents a}} review of current evidence across 9 key indicators, including physical activity (PA), organized sport and free play, sedentary behavior, and community and government initiatives across New Zealand. METHODS: Nationally representative survey data were collated {{by researchers at the}} University of Auckland, New Zealand, between June and December 2013. The grade for each indicator is based on the percentage of children and youth meeting a defined benchmark: A is 81 %- 100 %; B is 61 %- 80 %; C is 41 %- 60 %, D is 21 %- 40 %; F is 0 %- 20 %; INC is incomplete data. RESULTS: Overall PA received a score of B, as did Organized Sport Participation and Active Play. PA participation in School Environment scored slightly less with a score of B-. Sedentary Behaviors, Family and Peers, and Community and Built Environment scored a grade of C. Active transportation received a score of C-. An inconclusive grade was given for the Government indicator {{due to a lack of}} established international criteria for assessment. CONCLUSIONS: PA participation in New Zealand is satisfactory, but could improve. However, sedentary behavior is high. Of particular concern is the age-related decline in PA participation, particularly among adolescent females, and the increase in sedentary behavior...|$|R

30|$|The {{international}} evaluation {{literature suggests}} a mixed record regarding {{the effectiveness of}} training programs for <b>youth.</b> <b>Card</b> et al. (2010, 2015) conclude that classroom and on-the-job training can have positive impacts on employment, especially over the longer run (e.g., after 2  years post-training); however, they found that youth tend to benefit less than adults from these programs in their 2010 meta-analysis, but not in their 2015 study. Looking at youth training programs, in particular, Betcherman et al. (2007) also find mixed results, though impacts {{seem to be more}} positive in developing than developed countries. An analysis by the Inter-American Development Bank of their own youth training programs found slightly more positive results (Ibarraran and Shady 2009). The recent meta-review of youth employment programs by Kluve et al. (2016) found that training, along with entrepreneurship programs, had the most positive impacts in low- and middle-income countries.|$|E
