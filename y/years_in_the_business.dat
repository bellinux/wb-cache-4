Klepacki scored {{the game with}} a Korg TR Rack, Novation Nova desktop, and Roland XV-5080. Red Alert 2 {{included}} a remix of [...] "Hell March". The return to high-energy songs was owed in part to fan criticism of Tiberian Sun. Klepacki maintained the energetic style in Red Alert 2s expansion pack Yuri's Revenge.

[...] Several Command & Conquer mainstays appear as reworked versions, including Target (Mechanical Man), Industrial, Act on Instinct, and No Mercy.

Tim Sendra, writing for AllMusic, awarded the album 4 stars out of five, and listed {{it as one}} of his recommendations from Minogue's album discography. He commented that [...] "Packed with hooky songs that fit her voice perfectly, it's easily the equal of her previous Aphrodite record and therefore one of her best again." [...] Although he pointed [...] "Beautiful" [...] as the one [...] "skippable moment", [...] "Kiss Me Once is a glittering, fun, and surprisingly powerful album that's classic Kylie through and through." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine awarded it four stars, and complimented Minogue's return to dance and pop music.

[...] Spin magazine editor Brittany Spanos noted the album's lacked [...] "cohesion", but stated [...] "Therein lies the strength of Kiss Me Once: Minogue’s ability to turn any contrived situation into something positive, magical, and utterly her own." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his senior}} year, Mosorjak started working in various {{capacities}} for local independent promotions, {{both as a}} referee and manager, under the name Greg [...] "Punk Rock" [...] Mason. His initial training was learned [...] "on the job" [...] as well as assistance from friends Zoltan the Great and Mark Curtis, and Luis Martinez.

Between 1985 and 1992, he attended North Carolina State University at Raleigh and Appalachian State University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in political science from the former institution.|$|E
