No one is better than any one else. What an incredible day for California AND for equality." [...] Lovato later said: [...] "I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality.

I know that there's so many women that feel the same thing after they give birth. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me because I do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E

Writing for Library Journal, Judith Sutton concluded, [...] "There are, in fact, several other cookbooks devoted to bacon, {{including}} Sara Perry's Everything Tastes Better with Bacon, but with its irresistible recipes and wealth of information and lore, Villas's new title is recommended for most collections." [...] Amy Culbertson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram also compared the Villas's work to another book on bacon, writing, [...] "His is a more definitive cookbook than last year's [...] "Seduced by Bacon" [...] by Joanna Pruess". The book was highlighted in the [...] "Holiday Cookbook Roundup: Gift Guide" [...] column of The Austin Chronicle, where writer Mick Vann concluded, [...] "This {{is one of the}} few cookbooks you'll find where every single recipe makes you want to head straight for the stove, whether it's a bacon, goat cheese, and sweet-onion pie; Russian borscht; beef-stuffed plantains; or braised Japanese pork belly. For those fellow bacon lovers in our midst, Villas' The Bacon Cookbook is required reading." [...] In honor of International Bacon Day in 2009, the National Pork Board offered recipes from The Bacon Cookbook. Bonnie Stern of Financial Post recommended the book, and commented, [...] "Few of us can resist the allure of sizzling, smokey, crispy bacon. Though not usually high on the list of foods that are considered good for you, if you don't eat it often, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> bacon and eat it, too. If you want to know all about bacon, have a look at The Bacon Cookbook by James Villas".|$|E
