6000|$|Thyme {{gave him}} the cruel look of youth, which seemed to say: 'You are my very good uncle, and a dear; but <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twice my age. That, I think, is conclusive!' ...|$|E

They'll pass you on to your settlement, Missis, with all speed. You're not in a state to be let come upon strange parishes 'ceptin as a Casual.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Because," [...] Wilmore replied coolly, [...] "underneath that steely {{hardness}} of manner {{for which}} your profession is responsible, {{you have a}} vein of sentiment, of chivalrous sentiment, I should say, which some day or other is bound to get you into trouble. The woman is beautiful enough to turn any one's head. As a matter of fact, I believe that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half {{in love with her}} already." ...|$|E

As to a house sendin' a sailor-boy as its messenger--did you ever hear of the great house of Messrs. Hewett and Company, what {{supplies}} Billin'sgate with fish?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Bes, {{hitherto}} I {{have looked}} on {{you as a}} slave taken by my son, the noble Shabaka, {{in one of his}} far journeys that it pleases him to make to fight and to hunt. But henceforth I look upon you as a friend and give you a seat at my table. Moreover it comes into my mind that although so strangely shaped by some evil god, perhaps <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> you seem to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I will be revenged. Look here, Frank; if {{your view}} of these things is {{altogether}} different from mine, let us drop the subject. Of all living human beings {{you are the one}} that is most to me now. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> any other ever was. But, even for you, I cannot alter my nature. Even for you I would not alter it if I could. That man has injured me, and all the world knows it. I will have my revenge, and all the world shall know that. I did wrong;--I am sensible enough of that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] Hannibal said, rising, [...] "we will to bed again. Malchus, acquaint Trebon of our {{determination}} that silence {{is to be}} kept; tell him that I shall bear him in mind, and not forget his share in this night's work. As for you, Malchus, henceforth <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> my cousin; you have saved my life, and I shall never forget it. I shall tell Imilce {{in the morning of}} the danger which has passed, for it is sure to come to her ears, and she will know better than I do how to thank you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall hear. It happened, {{just after}} I had seen crazy Jack safe in his bed. When I heard the bell, I {{was on my}} way downstairs, with a certain bottle in my hand.

6000|$|Pray,--pray write at once. Mother {{is getting}} vexed because there [...] is no letter. I am never vexed {{with my own}} darling love, but I [...] do so long for a letter.

Oh do, do, pray come! Cannot you think how I must [...] long to see you! The gentleman who came here said that you would [...] come, and I know you will. But pray come soon.

60|$|The {{matter of}} fees is important, {{far beyond the}} mere {{question}} of bread and butter involved. Properly attended to, fuller justice is done to both lawyer and client. An exorbitant fee should never be claimed. As a general rule never take your whole fee in advance, nor {{any more than a}} small retainer. When fully paid beforehand, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a common mortal if you can feel the same interest in the case as if something was still in prospect for you, as well as for your client. And when you lack interest in the case the job will very likely lack skill and diligence in the performance. Settle the amount of fee and take a note in advance. Then you will feel that you are working for something, and you are sure to do your work faithfully and well. Never sell a fee note--at least not before the consideration service is performed. It leads to negligence and dishonesty--negligence by losing interest in the case, and dishonesty in refusing to refund when you have allowed the consideration to fail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Helène," [...] he said gravely, [...] "for {{your own}} sake, {{and for your}} country's sake, I charge you to {{consider}} well what you are doing. What does it matter to you if Henri is even {{as bad as you}} say, which, mark you, I deny. He is the King of France! Personally, you can be strangers if you please, but marry him you must. You need not be his wife, but you must be his queen! Almost you make me ask myself whether I am talking to Helène of Bourbon, a Princess Royal of France, or to a love-sick English country girl, pining for a sweetheart, whose highest ambition it is to bear children, and whose destiny is to become a drudge. May God forbid it! May God forbid, that after all these years of darkness you should play me false now when the dawn is already lightening the sky. Sink your sex! Forget it! Remember that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a woman--you are royal, and your country has the first claim upon your heart. The dignity which exalts demands also sacrifices! Think of your great ancestors, who died with this prayer upon their lips--that one day their children's children should win again the throne which they had lost. Their eyes may be upon you at this moment. Give me a single reason for this change in you--one single valid reason, and I will say no more." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{know why}} I ask them. You know {{that to me}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> all the world." [...] She stood {{still for a moment}} after hearing this, and then without any reply walked away into the other room. She felt half ashamed of herself in that she had not rebuked him for {{speaking}} to her in that fashion after his interview with her father, and yet his words had filled her heart with delight. He had never before plainly declared his love to her,--though she had been driven by her father's questions to declare her own love to herself. She was quite sure of herself,--that the man was and would always be to her the one being whom she would prefer to all others. Her fate was in her father's hands. If he chose to make her wretched he must do so. But on one point she had quite made up her mind. She would make no concealment. To the world at large she had nothing to say on the matter. But with her father there should be no attempt on her part to keep back the truth. Were he to question her on the subject she would tell him, as far as her memory would serve her, the very words which Lopez had spoken to her this evening. She would ask nothing from him. He had already told her that the man was to be rejected, and had refused to give any other reason than his dislike to the absence of any English connexion. She would not again ask even for a reason. But she would make her father understand that though she obeyed him she regarded the exercise of his authority as tyrannical and irrational.|$|E
6000|$|Sackville St: Janry 7th It is a {{month to}} day since I first beheld my lovely Henrietta, and the sacred anniversary must and shall be kept in a manner {{becoming}} the day--by writing to her. Never shall I forget the moment when her Beauties first broke on my sight--No time {{as you well know}} can erase it from my Memory. It was at Lady Scudamores. Happy Lady Scudamore to live within a mile of the divine Henrietta! When the lovely Creature first entered the room, oh! what were my sensations? The sight of you was like the sight ofa wonderful fine Thing. I started--I gazed at her with admiration--She appeared every moment more Charming, and the unfortunate Musgrove became a captive to your Charms before I had time to look about me. Yes Madam, I had the happiness of adoring you, an happiness for which I cannot be too grateful. [...] "What said he to himself is Musgrove allowed to die for Henrietta? Enviable Mortal! and may he pine for her who is the object of universal admiration, who is adored by a Colonel, and toasted by a Baronet! Adorable Henrietta how beautiful you are! I declare you are quite divine! <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Mortal. You are an Angel. You are Venus herself. In short Madam you are the prettiest Girl I ever saw in my Life--and her Beauty is encreased in her Musgroves Eyes, by permitting him to love her and allowing me to hope. And ah! Angelic Miss Henrietta Heaven is my witness how ardently I do hope for the death of your villanous Uncle and his abandoned Wife, since my fair one will not consent to be mine till their decease has placed her in affluence above what my fortune can procure--. Though it is an improvable Estate--. Cruel Henrietta to persist in such a resolution! I am at Present with my sister where I mean to continue till my own house which tho' an excellent one is at Present somewhat out of repair, is ready to receive me. Amiable princess of my Heart farewell--Of that Heart which trembles while it signs itself Your most ardent Admirer and devoted humble servt. T. Musgrove.|$|E

In this world one may wake {{in the night and}} one may resolve to be a king, and {{directly}} one has resolved one is a king. Does that sound foolishness to you? Anyhow, it's fair that I should tell you, though you count me a fool. This--this kingship--this dream of the night--is my life. It is the very core of me. Much more than <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>More</b> <b>than</b> anything else can be. I mean to be a king in this earth. KING. I'm not mad.... I see the world staggering from misery to misery and there is little wisdom, less rule, folly, prejudice, limitation, the good things come by chance and the evil things recover and slay them, and it is my world and I am responsible. Every man to whom this light has come is responsible. As soon as this light comes to you, as soon as your kingship is plain to you, there is no more rest, no peace, no delight, except in work, in service, in utmost effort. As far as I can do it I will rule my world. I cannot abide in this smug city, I cannot endure its self-complacency, its routine, its gloss of success, its rottenness.... I shall do little, perhaps I shall do nothing, but what I can understand and what I can do I will do. Think of that wild beautiful country we saw, and the mean misery, the filth and the warring cruelty of the life that lives there, tragedy, tragedy without dignity; and think, too, of the limitless ugliness here, and of Russia slipping from disorder to massacre, and China, that sea of human beings, sliding steadily to disaster. Do you think these are only things in the newspapers? To me at any rate they are not things in newspapers; they are pain and failure, they are torment, they are blood and dust and misery. They haunt me day and night. Even if it is utterly absurd I will still do my utmost. It IS absurd. I'm a madman and you and my mother are sensible people.... And I will go my way.... I don't care for the absurdity. I don't care a rap." ...|$|E
