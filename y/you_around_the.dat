Rooted in Southern hip hop, {{it contains a}} bounce and bass-heavy sound with dense TR 808-driven basslines, live instrumentation, and backing vocalists. Music writer Greg Kot calls it [...] "a state-of-the-art Southern-fried party-funk album" [...] and notes its bass-heavy sound as [...] "full of surface charm, the type of music {{that is designed to}} sound big in a club, the soundtrack for a night of excess. But there’s very little conventional about these beats".|$|E

2500|$|Los Portales {{represent}} {{the social and}} commercial life of the city. They are a composed of three sets of arches or portals that extend on the 3 sides of the city block that extends behind the main cathedral. Behind the sets of arches there is walking space that takes <b>you</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> stores that are contained within. [...] The western arches follow the perimeter of what was the La Asunción Franciscan monastery. The eastern and southern arches were completed in 1836 by José María González Arratia. The original western arches were built by the Buenaventura Merlín. [...] Each side consists of basket-handle arches, each with a balcony. Each side has its own name. The eastern one, with 37 arches, is called [...] "20 de Noviembre" [...] or [...] "Constitución"; the southern one, with 44 arches, is called [...] "Madero" [...] and the western one, with 35 arches, is called [...] "Reforma". [...] There are four additional arches {{at the entrance to}} Avenida Independencia. Near Los Portales are some of the city's oldest businesses, some of which date from the 19th century such as the pharmacy on Calle Santos Degollado, a brass and iron workshop on Avenida Lerdo and a leather workshop on Avenida Juárez.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, a {{selection}} he recorded as {{a duet with}} Kim Carnes, [...] "Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer," [...] became a major hit. Earlier that year, he sang a duet of [...] "You and Me" [...] with Lynda Carter in her television music special Lynda Carter Special (Rogers originally recorded this with Dottie West for the Every Time Two Fools Collide album). [...] Later in 1980 came his partnership with Lionel Richie who wrote and produced Rogers' No.1 hit [...] "Lady." [...] Richie went on to produce Rogers's 1981 album Share Your Love, a chart topper and commercial favorite featuring hits such as [...] "I Don't Need You" [...] (Pop No.3), [...] "Through the Years" [...] (Pop No.13), and [...] "Share Your Love with Me" [...] (Pop No.14). His first Christmas album was also released that same year. In 1982, Rogers released the album Love Will Turn <b>You</b> <b>Around.</b> <b>The</b> album's single {{of the same name}} reached No.13 on the Billboard Hit 100 and topped the country and AC charts. It was the theme song of Rogers' 1982 film Six Pack. Shortly afterwards, he started working with producer David Foster in 1983 recording the smash Top 10 hit Bob Seger cover [...] "We've Got Tonight," [...] a duet with Sheena Easton. Also a #1 single on the Country charts in the United States, it reached the Top 30 on the British charts.|$|E

Listen: I who am a 'heaven-herd,' I who know the signs of the weather, tell you that within two days such a tempest as this will break upon us. Then White Man, I and my companions will be ready to meet you on the plain. Take the cross by which you swear and set it up yonder and stand by it, and with you your converts, Nodwengo the prince, and this man whom you have named John, if they dare to go. Over against <b>you,</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> symbol of the god by which we swear, will stand I and my company, and we will pray our god and you shall pray your God. Then the storm will break upon us, and when it is ended we shall learn which of us remain alive. If you and your cross are shattered, to us will be the victory; if we are laid low, take it for your own. Your judgment, King!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The next {{question}} {{is that of the}} mode of descent. Upon this point I had been satisfied in my walk with <b>you</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> building. About five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod. From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters ferrades--a kind rarely employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bourdeaux. They are {{in the form of an}} ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door) except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis--thus affording an excellent hold for the hands. In the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad. When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were both about half open--that is to say, they stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact, having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination. It was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected.--By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trellis-work. Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might even have swung himself into the room.|$|E
