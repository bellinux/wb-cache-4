[...] He was not afraid to poke fun at the {{establishment}} (one piece he wrote was titled [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> German Agent in Your Home?"), and his common man observations often veered into angry rants, such as his piece [...] "The Average Voter," [...] where the namesake of the piece [...] "orgets what the paper said...so votes straight Republicrat ticket." [...] His lighter fare {{did not hesitate to}} touch upon topical issues, drawing analogies between a football game and patriotism, or chewing gum and diplomacy and economic relations with Mexico.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} day of the trial, Winthrop recorded, [...] "Mrs. Hutchinson, the court you see hath labored to bring you to {{acknowledge}} the error of your way that so you might be reduced. The time now grows late. We shall therefore give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time to consider of it and therefore desire that you attend the court again in the morning." [...] The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson, who had held her own in a battle of wits with the magistrates. Biographer Eve LaPlante suggests, [...] "Her success before the court may have astonished her judges, but it was no surprise to her. [...] She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools, largely because of the intimacy she felt with God." ...|$|E
500|$|Alexandra's letters {{reveal that}} Maria, the middle {{child of the}} family, {{sometimes}} felt insecure and left out by her older sisters and feared she wasn't loved {{as much as the}} other children. Alexandra reassured her that she was as dearly loved as her siblings. At age eleven, Maria apparently developed a painful crush on one of the young men she had met. [...] "Try not to let your thoughts dwell too much on him, that's what our Friend said," [...] Alexandra wrote to her on December 6, 1910. Alexandra advised her third daughter to keep her feelings hidden because others might say unkind things to her about her crush. [...] "One must not let others see what one feels inside, when one knows it's considered not proper. I know he likes you as a little sister and would like to help you not to care too much, because he knows <b>you,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Grand Duchess, must not care for him so." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Zito {{started off}} with a win against the Mariners. He went 6 innings and allowed an earned run, an RBI single by Olerud in the first inning. In his next start, Zito went 7 innings, struck out 7, walked 4, and allowed one run against Texas. In the process, he became only the fifth A's pitcher to win 10 {{straight}} games, the first since Welch in 1990. On April 18, Zito went nine innings, allowing six hits and no runs in a start against the Rangers. Zito improved to 9–0 in his career against Texas. After the game, Texas manager Buck Showalter said, [...] "I got the feeling he made it look pretty easy. When he {{has that kind of}} command, you can see what happens." [...] Zito struggled in his second-to last start before the All-Star Break on July 8. He allowed seven earned runs and 15 hits against the Devil Rays. The 15 hits allowed were a career high. Devil Rays manager Piniella was stunned by Zito's bad start. He said, [...] "If you'd have told me we'd get 15 hits off Zito in five or six innings, I would have looked at <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> funny." [...] Nevertheless, Zito bounced back in his next start. He went eight innings without surrendering a run against the Baltimore Orioles. Zito was again named to the All Star team, the second time he has been named to the team.|$|E

500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am going to give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted {{that he would like to}} take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "All the Lovers" [...] {{was directed by}} Joseph Kahn, {{who is known for}} having previously collaborated with American recording artist Britney Spears on the videos for her singles [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Womanizer". It was filmed in Downtown Los Angeles, the central business district of Los Angeles, California, in early May 2010. Aiming to pay [...] "homage" [...] to her large gay audience, Minogue wanted the video to express [...] "what I'm about and what I love" [...] and thus it was made to depict scenes of same-sex kissing. Arts and culture magazine BlackBook reported that the video, which portrays a large group of underwear-clad men and women, is a re-imagination of the installations of Spencer Tunick, an American photographer known for organising large-scale nude shoots. Minogue credited Kahn for the idea behind the video, saying [...] "He came up with a brilliant, simple idea and executed it so sensitively, I thought. It's still cutting edge, it still gets <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hot under the collar, but I think there's a real sensitivity." [...] Initially, two ideas for the storyline arose, one which was a [...] "little gentler" [...] and one which was [...] "edgier", and in the end the latter option was finalised. When Kahn submitted his cut of the video to Parlophone, a person working for the label refused to release it and wanted a new one to be shot. However, at Minogue's interference the video was finally commissioned and released. A preview of the video was released on 25 May 2010 while the full version was premiered five days later. It was made available to download at the iTunes Store on 11 June 2010. In 2011, Kahn talked about working with Minogue and called her the [...] "dream artist to work with" [...] and a [...] "joy to photograph", praising her ability to [...] "understand" [...] directors. He further commented that: [...] " [...] is one of my favourite videos I did last year, and one of my favourites ever really. The message Kylie wanted to say with this video is important, and I am lucky to have worked with her on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Voiced by Bill Oddie, Grimbling is a [...] "dirty old man" [...] {{who often}} {{appears as a}} groundsman, butler, or some similar profession.

[...] He added later in the night, [...] "...I have seen the first black {{president}} there.

[...] Commenting the next day, Pat Buchanan, while complimentary towards Obama, was more critical of what he called a centrist speech: [...] "He is hiding what he truly believes. What does Obama believe about this war?"

2500|$|Dev's electro {{style and}} [...] "sing-talk" [...] vocal style have been {{compared}} to fellow pop singer Kesha.

I get why people compare us but once people see me live they won't connect us as much." [...] While comparing her to Kesha, Idolator wrote that [...] "Dev's beats come off a bit more mellow and her songs {{a little bit more}} electro than pop." [...] In response to being compared to both Kesha and Uffie, Dev said, [...] "I just feel that I have a lot more to say and the ability to have an eclectic sound, I'm not bashing either artist, but I'm {{going to be able to}} give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more than what you've heard on those records. When my album comes out, hopefully I won't have to hear another reference or comparison." [...] Much of Dev's music is inspired by rap music, as she believes that fans respond to [...] "pop music but with rap roots". She said, [...] "I've always been into hip-hop. Eminem changed my life when I was younger." [...] The Hollywood Reporter compared her [...] "futuristic" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] sound to underground electroclash musicians Peaches and Yelle. Dev's musical genres have been cited as electro-crunk and electropop.|$|E
