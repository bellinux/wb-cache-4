Thank you for attending and, congratulations to the class of 2008 ! This ceremony has become both a fixture and a tradition in the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources. As a matter of fact, it took the national 2 ̆ 2 First Place Award 2 ̆ 2 in a 2006 competition that was {{open to all universities}} in the United States...|$|E

"I think not, Mrs. Renshaw; {{it may be}} a long skirmish, and {{we shall}} {{have plenty of time to}} load; and <b>your</b> <b>being</b> here <b>with</b> <b>us</b> and running the risk of being hit would make us nervous. I think, if you do not mind, we would much rather know that you are in safety behind us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes,' rejoined Mrs Browdie. 'John ha' done. John fixed tonight, {{because she}} had settled that she would go and drink tea with her father. And to make quite sure of there being nothing amiss, and of <b>your</b> <b>being</b> quite alone <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> he settled {{to go out there}} and fetch her home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he {{returned}} with gravity, [...] "I feel that I've still much to learn about her." [...] To which he subjoined [...] "She'll rejoice awfully in <b>your</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> us." ...|$|R
60|$|You do {{not know}} what {{mischief}} <b>your</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> me might have prevented. You shall hear from me tomorrow; in the mean time don't be alarmed. I am in no immediate peril.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{am quite}} {{convinced}} that <b>your</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> Mrs. Norris {{will be as}} good for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much for your ultimate happiness too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} let them. Cling to your auntship; it {{explains}} <b>your</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> them. A grand creature! I feel like {{the people who had}} had a visit from the gods of old." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 313: [...] "Reconnect and Refine" [...] Connect {{with the}} essence of <b>your</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> Reconnect and Refine. This exhilarating {{sequence}} encourages you to find comfort in the present moment, and let go of preconceived expectations or agendas. It is not about where you are going, but where you are.|$|R
6000|$|... 'To {{tell you}} the truth, I can't stand <b>your</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> her again, while I am made a fool of by that woman. If I'm not to see her, I'll be off. I'll send her a note; we will cross to Bickleypool, and start by the mail-train this very night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if they're {{that low}} down <b>your</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> me wouldn't help much," [...] replied Pan, pondering the matter. [...] "I'll tell you, Blink. Here's how I figure. Marco {{is a pretty}} big place. It's full of men. And western men are much alike anywhere. Matthews is no fool. He couldn't risk murdering me in broad daylight, from ambush." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I've {{worked it}} out--that's exactly what I HAVE done. She hadn't {{for a long}} time been so happy about {{anything}} as at <b>your</b> <b>being</b> there <b>with</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And indeed, Ailie, {{he is so}} {{wedded to}} smoke and calculations, and so averse to this sublunary world, that though <b>your</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> him might be beneficial, still I greatly {{question}} whether the risk of carrying poor little Rose to so remote a place in such a climate, would be desirable. If he were pining to have a home made for him, {{it would be worth}} doing; as it is, the sacrifice would be disproportioned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{delivered}} that letter," [...] said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. [...] "I would not consent to <b>your</b> <b>being</b> charged <b>with</b> any written answer, but perhaps {{you will take}} a verbal one?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Is that it, woman? Does it {{strike you}} so? The Great Breath blowing a tiny seed of fire Fans out your petals for excess of flame, Till all <b>your</b> <b>being</b> smokes <b>with</b> fine desire? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In that case,' he said, 'matters {{might be}} soon settled. This fortune of mine {{would be no}} misfortune then; and probably, Phoebe, my sisters would have no {{objection}} to <b>your</b> <b>being</b> happy <b>with</b> us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{it seems}} a pity," [...] whispered Basil, dispassionately, [...] "to turn this man adrift, {{when he had a}} {{reasonable}} hope of <b>being</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> all day, and has been so civil and obliging." ...|$|R
60|$|As by the {{presence}} of God <b>being</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> we know ourselves to be the people of God: so by this presence of God the world themselves are sometimes convinced who we are also.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt the}} señorita's <b>being</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> would suggest {{something}} of the kind, but he seemed surprised at first," [...] Walthew replied with a thoughtful air. [...] "For all that, I can't quite see----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My noble wife," [...] said Aylmer, deeply moved, [...] "I {{knew not}} the height {{and depth of}} your nature until now. Nothing shall be concealed. Know, then, that this crimson hand, {{superficial}} as it seems, has clutched its grasp into <b>your</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> a strength of which I had no previous conception. I have already administered agents powerful enough to do aught except to change your entire physical system. Only one thing remains to be tried. If that fail us we are ruined." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything {{depends upon}} <b>your</b> <b>being</b> honest <b>with</b> me," [...] she continued. [...] "You will see from my {{question}} that I know. Was there not something said about supper at your rooms {{before or after}} the dance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for your letter, and for <b>your</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> Valentin. It is a most inexpressible sorrow to me that I was not. To see you will be nothing but a {{distress}} to me; there is no need, therefore, to wait for what you call brighter days. It is all one now, and I shall have no brighter days. Come when you please; only notify me first. My brother is to be buried here on Friday, and my family is to remain here. C. de C." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is in New England. Perhaps {{he is at}} {{this moment}} {{on his way to}} us," [...] replied her husband. [...] "His letter is dated nearly a {{fortnight}} back; and he expresses an intention of <b>being</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> in a few days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Out here we can't {{do things}} exactly {{as they are}} done in the big cities," [...] grinned Vorlange. [...] "We are out here after the boomers just now, and <b>your</b> <b>being</b> here <b>with</b> Pawnee Brown will rather go against you. But keep quiet now until I return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir, you {{are only}} too good. I do feel a little wronged, and, I must say, sympathy is most {{grateful}} to my feelings. You will, however, allow me to express my surprise at <b>your</b> <b>being</b> acquainted <b>with</b> my real name, {{as well as with}} my misfortunes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I remember; {{you told}} us about her. You were {{children}} together. But what's the good of <b>your</b> <b>being</b> in love <b>with</b> her if she's married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Captain, dear, sorrow a sup of dhrink did I see {{you take}} this blessed evening; shure then you'll {{let me get you}} a glass of wine before we all begin, jist to prevent <b>your</b> <b>being</b> smothered <b>with</b> the dust like; shure, yer honour hasn't taken a dhrop yet." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{will have}} learnt, {{yesterday}} morning, Father, {{that we have}} carried them off. We could have brought you the news last night, {{but to do so}} we must have ridden fast and, the girls <b>being</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> we thought it were better to take two days over the journey. So we slept in Tynedale last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is no use {{talking of}} these matters to Andrew," [...] Malcolm {{impressed}} upon him; [...] "it would do no good. When {{he was a}} young man he took the side of the Hanoverians, and he won't change now; while, did Mistress Janet guess that your heart was with the Stuarts, she would say that I was ruining you, and should bring you to a gallows. She is not fond of me now, though she does her best to be civil to her husband's brother; but did she know that you had become a Jacobite, like enough she would move Andrew to put a stop to <b>your</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> me, and there would be all sorts of trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|When I {{had been}} down a good while, and found my spouse {{did not fall}} into the story again, as I expected, I took heart, and called for it. [...] "My dear," [...] said I, [...] "the fall of the candle put {{you out of your}} history, won't you go on with it?" [...] "What history?" [...] says he. [...] "Why," [...] says I, [...] "about the captain." [...] "Oh," [...] says he, [...] "I had done with it. I know no more than that the captain told a broken piece of news that he had heard by halves, and told more by halves than he heard it,--namely, of <b>your</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> child, and that you could not go the voyage." ...|$|R
5000|$|An 2014 {{investigation}} by journalist Ken Silverstein published in Vice Magazine explains how Panama came into <b>being,</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> help:In 1903, {{the administration of}} Theodore Roosevelt created the country after bullying Colombia to hand over {{what was then the}} province of Panama. Roosevelt acted at the behest of various banking groups, among them J. P. Morgan & Co., which was appointed as the country's official [...] "fiscal agent".|$|R
5000|$|... "Blink of an Eye" [...] was {{released}} through Kelly's YouTube channel on July 10, 2016, {{one month after}} Grimmie's death. Kelly wrote in the caption that the song was something she needed to write. [...] "My heart was and is still so heavy when I think of her not <b>being</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> However, I am still comforted knowing that I'll get {{to see her again}} someday in Heaven." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is wonderful," [...] he said, {{when she}} had finished; [...] "but I did not tell Luud--you noticed that I did not tell Luud about it. Had he known, {{he would have had}} you sing to him and that would have {{resulted}} in <b>your</b> <b>being</b> kept <b>with</b> him that he might hear you sing whenever he wished; but now I can have you all the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{that has}} not been the reason. There is a great deal more in Lord Lufton than that; and since I must speak, dear Lucy, I cannot but say that I should not wonder at <b>your</b> <b>being</b> in love <b>with</b> him, only--only that--" ...|$|R
