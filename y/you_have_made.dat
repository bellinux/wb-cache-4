25|$|The “worlds” in {{the many}} worlds theory is then just the {{complete}} measurement history up until and during the measurement in question, where splitting happens. These “worlds” each describe a different state of the universal wave function and cannot communicate. There is no collapse of the wavefunction into one state or another, but rather you just find yourself in the world leading up to what measurement <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> and are unaware of the other possibilities that are equally real.|$|E

They should all strive to make reparation for the outrages my Son is subjected to in the sacrament of his love. See the graces that will be poured forth on those who will wear it with confidence and help you to spread this devotion.|$|E

25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E

Victor and Jack have shared wives, corporations, but mostly, unabashed hatred. They despise each other." [...] Additionally, Waldman wrote: [...] "Braeden's {{contribution}} to the show these past three decades really cannot be understated. He's been a driving force as Victor primarily because he's a villain who's not quite pure evil. He has a heart and on occasion shows a vulnerability that makes him likable and even sympathetic" [...] but [...] "like a big jungle cat, he is not one to be tamed. That's why at any point, Victor can turn on someone he once professed to love [...] See, that's Victor. He makes viewers crazy with his actions, but he's so dynamic and interesting, that you can't stop watching him. Thank you, Eric Braeden. You are Victor and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> him completely compelling for 30 years." [...] In another article, Waldman called Braeden {{one of the biggest}} stars in the soap opera business. Victor has adopted several nicknames on the show that have carried into the media. This includes [...] "The Mustache" [...] and [...] "The Dark Night". When asked which storyline he felt affinity for or strongly about in his thirty years during an interview with AOL TV, Braeden stated it was the scenes in which he met his dying mother, Cora Miller (Dorothy McGuire), {{for the first time since}} he was seven years old.

2500|$|The room then {{fills with}} supplicants to the Princess ("Drei arme adelige Waisen"). An Italian tenor {{sent by the}} Portuguese {{ambassador}} serenades the Marschallin ("Di rigori armato"), while Ochs works out the marriage contract with the Marschallin's notary. Two Italian intriguers, Valzacchi and Annina, try to sell the Princess the latest scandal sheets, but she coldly declines. Rudely interrupting the tenor's song, Ochs tells the notary to demand a dower from Sophie's family (having confused dower with dowry). The notary attempts to explain that such is impossible under the law. Valzacchi and Annina now offer their services to Ochs. He asks whether they {{know anything about the}} Princess's [...] "maid". They don't, but they assure him that they do. Amidst all the activity, the Marschallin remarks to her hairdresser: [...] "My dear Hippolyte, today <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> me look like an old woman."
