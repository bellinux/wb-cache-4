500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Paparizou had {{announced}} that her second English-language album {{was in the}} works, with a release slated for 2009, making it the follow-up to Vrisko To Logo Na Zo (2008) and the English follow-up to The Game of Love (2006) and that once it was released she would travel abroad {{for a period of}} time. However, this did not materialize mostly due to her father's sudden death, explaining that her priorities had shifted; Paparizou expressed that [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> parent, you are forced to mature, you test your endurance. After a busy 20082009 schedule, Paparizou announced that instead of performing for the winter season she would take a break from the industry in order to support her mother who needed her, something she did not have the opportunity to do in the past year due to work obligations, as well as take time to record her new material.|$|E
2500|$|Neither {{the quality}} of Bow's voice nor her Brooklyn accent was an issue to Bow, her fans, or Paramount. However, Bow, like Charlie Chaplin, Louise Brooks, and most other silent film stars, did not embrace the novelty: [...] "I hate talkies ... they're stiff and limiting. <b>You</b> <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> lot of your cuteness, because there's no chance for action, and action is the most {{important}} thing to me." [...] A visibly nervous Bow had to do a number of retakes in The Wild Party because her eyes kept wandering up to the microphone overhead. [...] "I can't buck progress [...]. I have to do the best I can," [...] she said. In October 1929, Bow described her nerves as [...] "all shot", saying that she had reached [...] "the breaking point", and Photoplay cited reports of [...] "rows of bottles of sedatives" [...] by her bed.|$|E

2500|$|The race {{restarted}} with 129 laps {{to go and}} a multi-car wreck {{brought out}} the seventh caution of the race. It started when Busch spun out and collected Brad Keselowski. Matt Kenseth, Paul Menard, Ryan Blaney, Jimmie Johnson and Elliott all suffered damage in the wreck. Busch said afterwards {{that he thought he}} [...] "just missed the bottom groove by a few inches, got loose and the wreck was on. The way that our car was restarting it felt comfortable, it felt good. That inside with the rosin and the VHT, if you donâ€™t hit it exactly right <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> lot of time. I tried {{to make up for it}} and got loose. I feel really bad for the Monster Energy guys. We had a win in our sights and I just drove the car at 101 percent instead of that 99 that I probably needed to be at." [...] Joey Logano assumed the race lead.|$|E
2500|$|... (A PT is {{a patrol}} torpedo boat and a bluejacket is an enlisted sailor.) These incidents, {{along with many other}} perfidious actions of the Japanese {{throughout}} the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided: [...] "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on Saipan taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> few more people. You get a little bit leery of taking prisoners when they are fighting to the death and so are you." [...] The other reported, [...] "Very few of them came out on their own; when they did, why, usually one in the front he'd come out with his hands up and one behind him, he'd come out with a grenade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the {{developers}} {{had intended to}} do a straight adaptation of the film. However, they quickly concluded that doing so presented two inherent problems; the original screenplay was so good, they felt it couldn't be replicated in a gaming environment, and because Montana dies at the end, they felt players {{would not want to}} invest in developing a character that they knew was doomed from the beginning. As such, they decided the game would tell an original story, set after the film. Jason Bone, combat designer on the game, explained [...] "We didn't want to rehash the movie because we feel that to make a good game, {{there needs to be a}} compelling storyline with good characters that drive you through it. There have been a lot of games that have been made based on movies, and when they follow the exact storyline of the movie, <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> little bit of interest if you know where things are going. We felt that a fresh start would allow us to have the freedom to do new and interesting things to keep the player motivated and engaged." ...|$|E

5000|$|During ICANN 45 in Toronto, auction expert Peter Cramton {{outlined}} a private gTLD auction model {{as a solution}} for resolving 158 new gTLD contention sets. Donuts co-founder Jon Nevett says that Donuts will handle as many of its contention sets as possible via this method, as auctions will be cheaper and faster for applicants than ICANN's original method. [...] "The cost of <b>losing</b> <b>an</b> ICANN auction {{is greater than the}} cost of <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> private auction", Nevett said. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>an</b> ICANN auction <b>you</b> get nothing, zero, <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> your asset ... with private auctions it doesn't hurt as much to lose, so the theory is the second-place guys won't stretch as much." ...|$|R

Be it as it may, the boy has been in all respects, even more than I dared to wish, and the comfort he has been ever since he came out to me has been unspeakable. We must not grudge him such a soldier's death after his joyous life. But for you, my poor girl, I could only wish the same for myself to-morrow.

There has only been one fight which could be called a battle since the war began; and as for the sieges, it means that <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> lot of men, and have little credit when you take a place, especially as the moment you go out one way the enemy enter on the other side, and there is all the work to be done over again." ...|$|E

There are plenty of snakes, too; and <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> good deal, I can assure you, by turning up your nose at them. They are just as good as eels, as Meinik cooks them--stewed with a blade of cinnamon, and some hot peppers. I cannot see that they can be a bit more objectionable to eat than eels; indeed, for anything one knows, the eel may have been feasting on a drowned man, the day before he was caught; while the snakes only take a meal once a week or so, and then only a small bird of some kind." ...|$|E
