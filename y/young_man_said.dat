25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2007, The Vachons {{were back in the}} US. At a February 17 show for Grapple Masters Wrestling in Bristol, Vermont, The Vachons were supposed to appear for the show's opening promo. When the team was introduced, however, their rivals The Hellraisers come out instead. The Hellraisers began picking on a fan in the crowd, Albert, but then invited him to join them in the ring. They continued talking to Albert until the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> he was a fan of The Vachons causing The Hellraisers to attack him. The Vachons then ran to the ring to chase off The Hellraisers setting up two singles matches between the four wrestlers later that night. The match series ended in a tie with Hellraiser Misery defeating Damien Vachon in a Tables match and Pierre Vachon winning a Thumbtacks match against Hellraiser Pain. Both teams were scheduled to meet in a Dog Collar match for the GMW Tag Team Championship on March 10.|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, April 30, a coroner's inquest was held. Frank testified {{about his}} {{activities}} on Saturday and other witnesses produced corroboration. A <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> that Phagan had complained {{to him about}} Frank. Several former employees spoke of Frank flirting with other women; one said she was actually propositioned. The detectives admitted that [...] "they so far had obtained no conclusive evidence or clues in the baffling mystery...". Lee and Frank were both ordered to be detained.|$|E

2500|$|Nimoy {{also won}} acclaim {{for a series}} of stage roles. In 1971 he played the {{starring}} role of Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof, which toured for eight weeks. Nimoy, who had performed in the Yiddish theater as a <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> <b>said</b> the part was like a [...] "homecoming" [...] for him, explaining that his parents, like Tevye, also came from a shtetl in Russia and could relate to the play when they saw him in it. Later that year he starred as Arthur Goldman in The Man in the Glass Booth at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego.|$|E
2500|$|This section {{bears the}} title of Townsend Hoopes' best-known book. In 2004, of a seminar that brought a group of Muslim {{students}} to the US, he observed [...] "A vital {{point here is that}} the realities of modernity (technical, social, political) are inexorable. They cannot be wished away, which means that traditional societies are faced with a crucial choice: to adjust, to adapt or to risk steady decline and perhaps ultimate disappearance. Given this daunting paradigm, the genuine enthusiasm for America shown by our 21 Muslim guests was a heartening sign. They seemed impressed with the depth of our national commitment to human freedom and individual opportunity, and the stability of our institutions, both governmental and private. Several declared that exposure to America had reinforced their determination to work for social change in their own countries. Two Pakistani women, both law students, said they planned to devote their lives to fighting for broader women's rights at home. One <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> it was his ambition to become his country's prime minister.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are better}} off than Pisani was, anyhow," [...] one of the <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "for you are not {{hampered}} with proveditors, and anything that your captaincy may suggest will, you may be sure, receive our assent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} it is mental rather than bodily collapse," [...] the <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "A sudden failure of brain power. He was {{absolutely}} unable to make any effort to walk, or indeed to move his limbs at all. It was a sort of mental paralysis." ...|$|R
60|$|Selingman {{glared at}} the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> but <b>said</b> nothing. The others, too, were all remarkably bereft of words.|$|R

I mean the one in the third box from the passage, in white, with the red flowers,” the <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> as Littlemore slowly rose and stood beside him. “The fellow with her is leaning forward. It’s he who makes me doubt. Will you have the glass?” ...|$|R
60|$|Philip's heart {{went out}} to the red-faced, commonplace <b>young</b> <b>man</b> who <b>said</b> a gentle word to him. He {{suddenly}} felt less unhappy.|$|R
60|$|It almost seemed, {{when the}} <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> these words, {{as if he}} threw a defiant look towards the quiet strangers in the corner.|$|E
6000|$|... "I scarce {{thought you}} would try, Hetty," [...] the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said.</b> You see, I'm not used {{to this kind of}} welcome in this house." ...|$|E

60|$|The <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>said</b> it was {{the funniest}} song that had ever been written, and that, if we liked, they would get Herr Slossenn Boschen, whom they knew very well, to sing it. They said it was so funny that, when Herr Slossenn Boschen had sung it once before the German Emperor, he (the German Emperor) had had to be carried off to bed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A very {{singular}} <b>young</b> <b>man</b> that,' <b>said</b> the powdered-headed footman, {{looking after}} Mr. Weller, with a countenance which clearly showed {{he could make}} nothing of him.|$|R

60|$|Stephen hesitated, but Wilhelmina {{waited for}} his reply. She had the air of one {{remotely}} interested, yet she waited obviously to hear what this <b>young</b> <b>man</b> had <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|One of the <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>said,</b> 'It isn't much of {{the riches}} {{of the world has}} stopped with yourself, old man,' and he looked at the old man's bare feet, and they all laughed. But Hanrahan did not laugh, but he sat down very quietly, without a word. Then one of them said, 'So you will stop with us after all, Hanrahan'; and the old man said: 'He will stop indeed, did you not hear me asking him?' ...|$|R

60|$|Lord Antony and Sir Andrew {{had said}} nothing to {{interrupt}} the Comtesse whilst she was speaking. There was no doubt that they felt deeply for her; their very silence testified to that--but in every century, and ever since England has been what it is, an Englishman has always felt somewhat ashamed of his own emotion and of his own sympathy. And so the two <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>said</b> nothing, and busied themselves in trying to hide their feelings, only succeeding in looking immeasurably sheepish.|$|R
