While there is a recent increase of literature on math with <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> there is a scarcity of research related to <b>young</b> <b>children</b> with disabilities, particularly utilizing evidence based interventions.

40|$|This chapter {{considers}} the spaces in which <b>young</b> <b>children</b> live their lives, {{and how these}} spaces are caught up with how societies understand <b>young</b> <b>children</b> and early childhood. It identifies three broad ways of theorising the spaces in which <b>young</b> <b>children</b> live their lives, and considers how these both reflect and produce young children’s position within society. First, the chapter considers those, adult-designated, spaces for <b>young</b> <b>children</b> that are so common in the minority world, which are intended to protect <b>young</b> <b>children</b> from {{the dangers of the}} adult world and to shape and ‘improve’ them in line with a range of desired outcomes (both developmental and societal). Second, the chapter explores theories of young children’s spaces, which emphasise the active role that <b>young</b> <b>children</b> play in responding to and shaping the spaces around them. Finally, the chapter develops ideas of inhabiting young children’s spaces to develop and consider a more vital account of the materiality of the spaces in which <b>young</b> <b>children</b> live, which moves beyond beyond the dualistic accounts that have tended to dominate post-Enlightenment Western thought...|$|R

5|$|By 1957 {{the synagogue}} sanctuary, {{which had been}} {{designed}} for 350 families, had become too small to accommodate Temple Israel's over 1,100 member families. In addition, since the 1950s Memphis's Jewish community had been steadily moving from the downtown, where Temple Israel's Poplar Avenue building was located, to the eastern suburbs; by 1957 {{over half of the}} members, and three-quarters of those with children in the congregational school, lived there. School attendance increased rapidly, and the student body soon outgrew its 1951 building. The school had to split attendance in 1959, with the <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> attending on Saturday and the older ones on Sunday, and by 1961, 780 children were enrolled. In the early 1960s, Temple Israel began holding weekday classes at Beth Sholom, which was closer to most members.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} school's history, the Vanderlips {{decided to}} change the school's system from the Montessori method to a more formal {{approach}} with more discipline, although students still had more freedom than the average school. In the 1930s, the school was considered progressive: students were not graded and were instructed to work at their own speed. As enrollment grew, another building was built for <b>younger</b> <b>children,</b> which burnt down in 1959. In addition, a lunchroom, shop, and studio were built early in the school's history. Frank Vanderlip enjoyed teaching simplified political economy at the school; he would act out Swiss Family Robinson on an imaginary island with students to demonstrate the development of capitalism. Narcissa Vanderlip ran the school lunchroom, and it is recorded that she served good simple food. She named some of her foods artistically (rice pudding with raisins was called Bête Noire a la Bolshevik).|$|E

This paper {{describes}} an automatic tissue segmentation algorithm for brain MRI of <b>young</b> <b>children.</b> Existing segmentation methods {{developed for the}} adult brain do {{not take into account}} the specific tissue properties present in the brain MRI of <b>young</b> <b>children.</b> We examine the suitability of state-of-the-art methods developed for the adult brain when applied to the segmentation of the <b>young</b> <b>child</b> brain MRI. We develop a method of creation of a population-specific atlas from <b>young</b> <b>children</b> using a single manual segmentation. The method is based on non-linear propagation of the segmentation into population and subsequent affine alignment into a reference space and averaging. Using this approach we significantly improve the performance of the popular EM segmentation algorithm on brain MRI of <b>young</b> <b>children.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E

5|$|At Parc Cwm long cairn {{a variety}} of {{mortuary}} practices was evident and the deliberate ordering of skeletal parts noticeable. Whittle and Wysocki (1998) note cremated human remains were placed only in the front, right (southeast) chamber, where females and males, and all age ranges were represented. The southeast chamber was also unusual in that it contained nearly {{three times as many}} individuals as in each of the other chambers, which contained the remains of all representative groups except <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> and infants. At the forecourt entrance Atkinson recorded finds, deposited in groups, including: flint debitage, lithic cores and a bladelet (burnt and unburnt); a leaf-shaped arrowhead (burnt); pieces of quartz; pieces of stalactite (now missing); sherds of Neolithic pottery; and cremated bone fragments. Atkinson speculated that the stalactite originated from Cat Hole cave, which (along with Tooth Hole cave) Whittle and Wysocki note as a possible source of the quartz too.|$|E

40|$|About the Book:] <b>Young</b> <b>children</b> as {{citizens}} explores how <b>young</b> <b>children</b> (birth to 12 years of age) {{can and should}} participate in civic life. It reflects new images of <b>young</b> <b>children</b> as social actors, together with the increased interest in children's rights in the public sphere. The contributors are early childhood researchers, pedagogues, children and policy makers from Australia and Europe. They present a rich diversity of research-based case studies in which policy-makers and educators have listened to young children¹s views on public issues and responded in respectful and ethical ways. <b>Young</b> <b>children</b> {{as citizens}} is a unique resource for policy-makers, those working in children's services and child advocates. It shows how best to consult <b>young</b> <b>children</b> and it presents a range of arguments that consulting <b>young</b> <b>children</b> about policies and decisions that affect them supports and enhances a vigorous democratic society. Students (undergraduate and postgraduate), teachers and researchers in early childhood studies can use individual chapters of <b>Young</b> <b>children</b> as citizens selectively to explore issues of increasing complexity in different courses. The book {{would be a good}} set text for Honours and Master's programs that address issues of children's rights...|$|R
