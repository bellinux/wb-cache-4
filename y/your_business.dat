The Sunday Tribune said on 14 February 2010 {{that he would have to}} wait for three months before returning to RTÉ. Exactly a year after leaving RTÉ, he returned to the broadcaster on 5 May 2010. He worked as an advisor on the RTÉ business desk. He presented Mind <b>Your</b> <b>Business</b> on RTÉ Radio 1 on Saturday Mornings as a summer replacement for The Business.|$|E

25|$|Cuban {{started his}} own company, MicroSolutions, with support from his {{previous}} customers from <b>Your</b> <b>Business</b> Software. MicroSolutions was initially a system integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as Carbon Copy, Lotus Notes, and CompuServe. One of the company's largest clients was Perot Systems.|$|E

He was fired less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store.|$|E
25|$|Nobody {{wants the}} {{insolvent}} to be destitute. The insolvent, therefore, {{is allowed to}} follow any profession or occupation, and to enter into any contracts related thereto. The insolvent, however, requires {{the consent of the}} trustee in order to carry on the business of a trader or manufacturer. If the trustee refuses this permission, the insolvent may appeal to the Master. Why? Because of the disposition of assets: If <b>your</b> <b>business</b> is buying and selling, the trustee's work is made very difficult.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, Morrissey {{launched}} his solo career with Viva Hate. This album and its follow-ups—Bona Drag, Kill Uncle, Your Arsenal, and Vauxhall and I—all {{did well in}} the UK Albums Chart and spawned a number of hit singles. During this time his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure, who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his subsequent albums, Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted, also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he embarked on a hiatus between 1998 and 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, You Are the Quarry, in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums Ringleader of the Tormentors, Years of Refusal, and World Peace Is None of <b>Your</b> <b>Business.</b> He released his autobiography in 2013, followed by his first novel in 2015. His eleventh solo album, Low in High School, is set {{to be released in}} November 2017.|$|E
25|$|By {{the timing}} of collection, VAT (as well as {{accounting}} in general) can be either accrual or cash based. Cash basis accounting is a very simple form of accounting. When a payment is received {{for the sale of}} goods or services, a deposit is made, and the revenue is recorded as of the date of the receipt of funds—no matter when the sale had been made. Cheques are written when funds are available to pay bills, and the expense is recorded as of the cheque date—regardless of when the expense had been incurred. The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank, and the secondary focus is on making sure all bills are paid. Little effort is made to match revenues to the time period in which they are earned, or to match expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. Accrual basis accounting matches revenues to the time period in which they are earned and matches expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. While it is more complex than cash basis accounting, it provides much more information about <b>your</b> <b>business.</b> The accrual basis allows you to track receivables (amounts due from customers on credit sales) and payables (amounts due to vendors on credit purchases). The accrual basis allows you to match revenues to the expenses incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports.|$|E

500|$|Some commenters on Wright's Facebook page {{were skeptical}} of his claims, {{pointing}} {{to differences in}} the costume between the two videos; Wright explained the differences by saying he wanted, and made, a better cloak for the second video. Krahbichler accepted Wright's claims. [...] "It {{would be too much}} of a hassle just to play along for this long, and making up stories that fit so well," [...] he wrote shortly after the second video was posted. [...] "I believe it is very safe to say that PWW is indeed the creator".

500|$|Bryan {{continued}} with language evoking the Civil War, telling his audience that [...] "in this contest brother has been arrayed against brother, father against son." [...] By then, {{as he spoke}} in a sincere tone, his voice sounded clearly and loudly through the hall. He denied, however that the contest was personal; he bore no ill-will towards those who supported the gold standard. However, he stated, facing towards the gold delegates, [...] "when you come before us and tell us that we are about to disturb <b>your</b> <b>business</b> interests, we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your course." [...] The gold men, during the address, paid close attention and showed their appreciation for Bryan's oratory. Bryan then defended the right of silver supporters to make their argument against opposition from gold men, who were associated with financial interests, especially in the East. Although his statements nominally responded to a point made by Russell, Bryan had thought of the argument the previous evening, and had not used it in earlier speeches. He always regarded it as the best point he made during the speech, and only the ending caused more reaction from his listeners: ...|$|E
