60|$|Perhaps {{a part of}} my weariness is {{owing to}} the hotel-life which we lead. At an English hotel the {{traveller}} feels as if everybody, from the landlord downward, united in a joint and individual purpose to fleece him, because all the attendants who come in contact with him are to be separately considered. So, after paying, in the first instance, a very heavy bill, for what would seem to cover the whole indebtedness, there remain divers dues still to be paid, to no trifling amount, to the landlord's servants,--dues not to be ascertained, and which you never can know whether you have properly satisfied. You can know, perhaps, when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> than satisfied them, by the aspect of the waiter, which I wish I could describe, not disrespectful in the slightest degree, but a look of profound surprise, a gaze at the offered coin (which he nevertheless pockets) as if he either did not see it, or did not know it, or could not believe his eyesight;--all this, however, with the most quiet forbearance, a Christian-like non-recognition of an unmerited wrong and insult; and finally, all in a moment's space indeed, he quits you and goes about his other business. If you have given him too much, you are made sensible of your folly by the extra amount of his gratitude, and the bows with which he salutes you from the doorstep. Generally, you cannot very decidedly say whether you have been right or wrong; but, in almost all cases, you decidedly feel that you have been fleeced. Then the living at the best of English hotels, so far as my travels have brought me acquainted with them, deserves but moderate praise, and is especially lacking in variety. Nothing but joints, joints, joints; sometimes, perhaps, a meat-pie, which, if you eat it, weighs upon your conscience, with the idea that you have eaten the scraps of other people's dinners. At the lake hotels, the fare is lamb and mutton and grout,--the latter not always fresh, and soon tired of. We pay like nabobs, and are expected to be content with plain mutton.|$|E

And to have served under Cochrane will, {{as long as you}} live, be a feather in your cap, just as I feel that it is a great honour for myself, although it has been to my pecuniary disadvantage, to have done so. I have exchanged letters with Mr. Hewson on the subject. He has behaved with the greatest kindness in the matter, and agrees with me that it would in some respects be a great advantage to you. He has offered in the kindest possible way to allow your apprenticeship to run on while you are with Cochrane, just as if you were still serving with his own ships, and whenever you may return to England he will reinstate you in his service, the time you have been away counting just the same as if you had been with him. I expressed a doubt whether your apprenticeship would count; but he said that any master being, from any circumstances, unable to teach a trade to an apprentice, as he covenanted to do, could, with the consent of that apprentice, hand him over to another employer; and that as you will be learning the sea as efficiently on the coast of Chili as elsewhere, he could loan you, as it were, to Lord Cochrane. Besides, of course, there is no real necessity for passing through an apprenticeship in order to become an officer. Large numbers of men do, in fact, become officers without ever having been apprenticed, as it is only necessary to serve so many years at sea, and to pass an examination. Still, there are advantages the other way. All ship-owners prefer a man who has served an apprenticeship in a good line of ships, as he would naturally be better mannered and better educated, and therefore better fitted for the position of an officer in ships carrying passengers. In that way it would be as well that you should obtain your discharge {{at the end of your}} term of apprenticeship from Mr. Hewson, although I have some doubts whether your sea-service under a foreign flag would be allowed to count by the examiners if you went up to pass as a mate. Upon the other hand, lad, you are now in a good service, and are certain to get on if you remain in it; and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> chance of being shot than if you go with Cochrane.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Because {{there was}} no women's track team at the University of Michigan in the pre-Title IX era, Kraker {{continued}} running for the Michigammes while attending school there.

[...] She noted: [...] "Things are better now. There's equality and that's good. But sometimes when you're given everything, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> motivation." [...] As a freshman at Michigan, Kraker {{was named to the}} U.S. National team earning top-ten world ranking for the 800 meters in 1966. [...] She set a national record for the half-mile indoor in 1967 and a world record for the indoor 600-yard event at Madison Square Garden. [...] After a year of setbacks, including severe tendinitis, an appendectomy, and a disastrous Olympic Trials where she finished fourth, Kraker made the U.S. Olympic team in a high-altitude race when injured 400 meter champion Jarvis Scott opted out of the 800 to concentrate on her specialty. [...] She was the first native-born Michigan woman to win a place on the U.S. Olympic track team. In Mexico City, Kraker finished fifth in her preliminary heat in a time of 2:07.3. [...] In 1970, Kraker won the national indoor championship for the half-mile. She qualified for the Olympics again in 1972, this time in the inaugural 1500 meter race for women. Kraker's 1500 meter time of 4:12.76 in the Munich semifinals was the second-fastest all-time performance by an American woman, and she retained that position for three more years.|$|E
5000|$|Around 200 CE, when Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu, Yuan sent a {{messenger}} to meet Zhang Xiu and propose an alliance between them against Cao.

[...] Jia Xu replied, [...] "Why don't you submit to Cao Cao?" [...] Zhang Xiu asked, [...] "Yuan Shao is powerful while Cao Cao is weak. Besides, I'm also Cao Cao's enemy. What will happen if I submit to him?" [...] Jia Xu replied, [...] "That's why it is better for you to submit to Cao Cao. He controls the Empire in the name of the Emperor. This is the first reason why you should submit to him. Yuan Shao is militarily more powerful. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> troops than him, so even if you join him, he won't regard you highly. Cao Cao has less troops. If you join him, he'll be delighted. This is the second reason why you should submit to him. A man who aspires to become a great ruler will be more willing to put aside personal enmities and make his virtues known to people. This is the third reason why you should submit to Cao Cao. I hope you won't have any more doubts." [...] Zhang Xiu heeded Jia Xu's advice and led his forces to surrender to and join Cao Cao.|$|E
50|$|Life is short, {{make the}} best use of it. Realize that service (sewa) and prayer (simran) are the only two bedrocks of life. Without mercy in the heart even a saint becomes a monster. To achieve {{anything}} one has to first give up slumber, rest and one has to undergo pain. Giving is no giving till it pains to give. Serving is no serving till it pains to serve. When there is opposition, and hurt, the service is accepted by Almighty. Seek no publicity, work alone without politics, there are many who will value your work. If you are running after fame and respect, God is never happy. Serve the needy in silence. Nature rewards the humble. Serve the needy. Compassion is the most important quality in a person, the start point of religion. Without compassion, all is futile. Remembering God always, and making small prayers (Ardaas) before each work gets success. Building temples and places of worship is good, but real good thing is to serve humanity, and nature. Realize that each breath we take takes us closer to our end, do not waste time in petty affairs. Work with own hands, humbly. Share and consume, and do not eat meat. Your food itself should be pure, do not consume intoxicants. Do not use drugs, or tobacco. Suffering bad words, without reacting is real tapasya(strenuous worship). God loves us, and looks after us, he is always close to us, and cares for us. When you are serving the needy, you are serving God.Service {{in which there is no}} pain involved is no service, giving is no giving till it pains to give. If you face opposition in your works, consider it as certain that success is near and you are about to be blessed. Shun the company of publicity seekers, they do work for fame and will barter your works for personal selfish motives. If you get into worry, feed the birds, worry disappears from under the roof of the house on which birds feed. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> money and cannot feed the birds, feed the ants, as they will be satisfied with just a few grams of sugar and flour (chini te atta). It is the number of souls which are satisfied by you which will matter. If you are in a great problem, and cannot get any results, go to a butchery, buy a pregnant cow, or an animal about to be butchered. Get that animal released, care for it, and you will be blessed. Release fish which is about to be eaten, into flowing water/ponds. Give water to the thirsty. Clothes to those who have none. Bandage the injured and those who cannot afford it. Sweep the floors of prayer houses, keep them clean. One who pays daily respects to a Master is loved by his master. Salute God daily, in each breath you take. Remembrance is being with Him. Have a contract with God: I will do your works, You do mine.|$|E
