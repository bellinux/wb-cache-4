5|$|The Incredible Hulk joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut carbon {{emissions}} and waste created during filming. Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, {{was a popular}} environmental analogy, and Norton himself was an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced <b>yellow</b> <b>pine</b> instead of lauan for the sets, and also used zero-or low-VOC paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries. The Incredible Hulk became the first blockbuster film to receive the Environmental Media Association's Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.|$|E
5|$|The cruisers' hulls were {{constructed}} with transverse steel frames with <b>yellow</b> <b>pine</b> planking {{up to the}} upper deck. A layer of Muntz metal sheathing covered the hull to protect the wood from shipworm. The stem and sternposts {{were constructed}} with steel and timber. A bronze naval ram was fitted at the bow. The hull was divided into ten watertight compartments, and a double bottom was installed below the boiler rooms. The ships were good sea boats, but they rolled badly and the sponsons for the main guns caused severe vibration. Since Geier was laid down after the other five ships entered service, she was redesigned slightly to discard the sponsons, and so she did not suffer from bad vibration. They were very maneuverable, except for turns into the wind when steaming at low speed. The ships had a crew of 9officers and 152enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one cutter, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
25|$|The bridge's {{two towers}} were built by {{floating}} two caissons, giant upside-down boxes made of southern <b>yellow</b> <b>pine,</b> {{in the span}} of the East River, and then beginning to build the stone towers on top of them until they sank {{to the bottom of the}} river. Compressed air was pumped into the caissons, and workers entered the space to dig the sediment, until the caissons sank to the bedrock. The whole weight of the bridge still sits upon a 15-foot thickness of southern <b>yellow</b> <b>pine</b> wood under the sediment.|$|E

2500|$|The valley's name may {{be derived}} from the Miwok word hatchhatchie, which means [...] "edible grasses" [...] or [...] "magpie". It {{is likely that the}} edible grass was blue dicks. Chief Tenaya of the Yosemite Valley's Ahwaneechee tribe claimed that Hetch Hetchy was Miwok for [...] "Valley of the Two Trees", {{referring}} to a pair of <b>yellow</b> <b>pines</b> that once stood at the head of Hetch Hetchy. Miwok names are still used for features, including Tueeulala Fall, Wapama Fall, and Kolana Rock.|$|R
25|$|These {{conditions}} are particularly {{characteristic of the}} northern regions; in the south the vegetation on the uplands is more luxuriant. Among the many varieties of trees and plants found are the date palm, mimosa, wild olive, giant sycamores, junipers and laurels, the myrrh and other gum trees (gnarled and stunted, these flourish most on the eastern foothills), a magnificent pine (the Natal <b>yellow</b> <b>pine,</b> which resists the attacks of the white ant), the fig, orange, lime, pomegranate, peach, apricot, banana, and other fruit trees; the grape vine (rare), blackberry, and raspberry; the cotton and indigo Plants, and occasionally the sugar cane. There are in the south large forests of valuable timber trees; and the coffee plant is indigenous in the Kaffa country, whence it takes its name.|$|E
25|$|His first {{twelve years}} in the lumber trade was spent supervising a sawmill in Donner, Louisiana. He {{would go on to}} become {{president}} of the Lutcher and Moore Cypress Lumber Company, and a partner in the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Pine</b> Paper Mill in which he shared interests with his brother-in-law William Henry Stark. During the time in which the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway was being developed, Brown along with his father-in-law and other key local businessmen would help influence the development of the deepwater channel link to the Port of Orange. Brown also partnered with W.H. Stark to begin the construction of an iron bridge to replace the ferry that crossed the Sabine River to provide another transportation link for Texas and Louisiana. Brownâ€™s other influence on the region was the development of irrigation canals for rice farming and his financial investments in the local growing oil industry.|$|E
25|$|The Patterson {{was named}} for Carlile Pollock Patterson, fourth Superintendent of the Coast Survey and first of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The New York Times {{credited}} the design to Commander Colby Mitchell Chester, USN, at that time Hydrographic Inspector in USC Naval architect Samuel Hartt Pook, U.S. Naval Constructor, was credited with supervising the drawings. She was built of wood in James D. Leary's yard at Williamsburg (Brooklyn) New York. Frames were white oak with cedar tops; planking, beams and lower deck were <b>yellow</b> <b>pine,</b> the upper deck was white pine. Her hull was fitted with iron diagonal braces, and five watertight bulkheads (3 wood, 2 iron). Power was a Cross compound vertical steam engine (one source reports 356hp, another source says 215 ihp; this difference may represent different calculation or measurement methods) and she could carry 133 tons of coal as fuel. Her machinery was constructed by Neafie & Levy of Philadelphia. She was rigged as a barkentine with double topsail yards; standing rigging was galvanized charcoal-iron wire. Her boats were two steam launches, two cutters, two whaleboats, and a dinghy. Her deckhouse, 13 Ã— 62ft, included the engine and boiler rooms, galley, pantry, and a drafting room. She carried a Sigsbee piano-wire sounding machine, state-of-the-art for deep-water hydrography, holding five miles of wire. Lieutenant Richardson Clover, USN, supervised construction and became her first commander.|$|E

50|$|The larvae feed on {{many members}} of the pine family. In the {{northern}} part of its range, it favours hard or <b>yellow</b> <b>pines</b> such as Pinus banksiana and Pinus resinosa. Further south, it prefers Pinus echinata, Pinus taeda, Pinus elliottii and Pinus palustris. Trees less than 5 m tall are frequently attacked, and plantations of pine established in the 1930s saw the insect reach pest proportions. Other host trees that the larvae will feed on include Pinus virginiana, Pinus strobus and Pinus sylvestris, and if nothing else is available, Picea abies, Cedrus deodara and Larix spp.|$|R
60|$|The {{murmur of}} falling water sounded closer. Presently Carley {{saw that the}} road turned at the notch in the canyon, and crossed a clear swift stream. Here were huge mossy boulders, and red walls covered by lichens, and the air {{appeared}} dim and moist, and full of mellow, hollow roar. Beyond this crossing the road descended {{the west side of}} the canyon, drawing away and higher from the creek. Huge trees, the like of which Carley had never seen, began to stand majestically up out of the gorge, dwarfing the maples and white-spotted sycamores. The driver called these great trees <b>yellow</b> <b>pines.</b>|$|R
500|$|Heller {{described}} {{the area around}} McCoy as [...] "much {{the same kind of}} country as Beaverton, but more level and forested. [...] The coast range is about fifteen miles distant. In some places, forests of Douglas fir occur, but the land is chiefly open and grassy. [...] White oaks and a few <b>yellow</b> <b>pine</b> occur also, and the region I should judge was more Transition than that at Beaverton." [...] He described Beaverton as: [...] "low and rolling, but hills are entirely lacking in the immediate vicinity of the town. [...] The timbered land is covered with forests of <b>yellow</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus jeffreyi), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga taxifolia), white oak (Quercus zarryana), etc. [...] The soil is chiefly black adobe except on the higher parts, where it is largely clay. [...] The region evidently is Transition in character of its vegetation as shown by the presence of the <b>yellow</b> <b>pine</b> and white oak." ...|$|E
500|$|Winfield Scott (originally to {{be named}} Placer) was {{constructed}} by the shipbuilding company Westervelt and MacKay of New York, and was completed in March 1850. [...] The ship was named for the celebrated United States Army general Winfield Scott (the stern was built with a bust in his likeness), and she was launched on 27 October 1850. An announcement in the October 20 edition of the New York Herald stated that [...] "We understand that no expense has been spared to secure strength, safety and speed..." [...] Her hull was wooden with double iron bracing and was made from White oak, Live oak, Locust, Redcedar and Georgia <b>yellow</b> <b>pine.</b>|$|E

50|$|There {{are various}} plant life {{distributions}} in North America. Plant {{life in the}} Arctic includes grasses, mosses, and Arctic willows. Coniferous trees, including spruces, pines, hemlocks, and firs, are indigenous to the Canadian and Western U.S. mountain ranges {{as far south as}} San Francisco. Among these are giant sequoias, redwoods, great firs, and sugar pines. Sugar pines are generally confined to the northwestern area of the United States.The central region of the country has hardwoods. Southern states grow extensive <b>yellow</b> <b>pines.</b> In addition, mahogany, logwood, and lignumvitae - all tropical in nature - are grown. The southwest has desert plants, including yucci and cacti. The cultivated native plants of North America are tobacco, maize, potato, vanilla, melons, cacao, gourds, indigo plant, and bean.|$|R
50|$|Through mutual friends, Jones {{heard of}} a {{potential}} investment in a railroad venture in south Mississippi, which included 63,000 acres (25,500 hectares) of southern <b>yellow</b> <b>pines</b> that were ready for harvest. Although the unfinished Gulf and Ship Island Railroad (G&SIRR) was in bankruptcy, Jones formed the Bradford Construction Company with other investors and bought the railroad. Using his fortune from oil production, Jones finished construction of the G&SIRR, bought out his partners in the Bradford Construction Company, and merged with the railroad to form the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad Company. Along with William H. Hardy, Jones co-founded the City of Gulfport as the railroad's southern-most terminal and had a deep-water channel dredged in the Gulf of Mexico, creating a harbor and the port of Gulfport.|$|R

500|$|Reflecting {{their close}} {{relationships}} with trees, the fruit bodies of L. indigo are typically found {{growing on the}} ground, scattered or in groups, in both deciduous and coniferous forests. They are also commonly found in floodplain areas that have been recently submerged. In Mexico, associations have been noted with Mexican alder, American Hornbeam, American Hophornbeam, and Liquidambar macrophylla, while in Guatemala the mushroom associates with smooth-bark Mexican pine and other pine and oak species. In Costa Rica, the species forms associations with several native oaks of the Quercus genus. Under controlled laboratory conditions, L.indigo was shown {{to be able to}} form ectomycorrhizal associations with the neotropical pine species Mexican white pine, Hartweg's pine, Mexican <b>yellow</b> <b>pine,</b> smooth-bark Mexican pine, and [...] the Eurasian pines Aleppo pine, European black pine, maritime pine, and Scots pine.|$|E
500|$|A Lighthouse Inspection Report {{from the}} United States Lighthouse Society from December 1889 {{states that the}} {{hexagonal}} tower was only accessible by boat.

50|$|Another {{major project}} that Waugh {{embarked}} upon was {{the design of}} the little town that bordered one of the natural wonders of the world and a vital U.S. national monument, the Grand Canyon of Arizona. The town consisted of 300 to 400 people and, at the time, a tourist population of about 200 annually. In the design, Waugh realized that the purpose of this town was to provide for the tourists who came to see this great wonder. He believed that <b>yellow</b> <b>pines</b> should be saved and that the piÃ±on and cedar that were planted along streets should be removed. By creating a scattered canopy by taking away the formality in the trees, Waugh believed it would unify the natural and undomesticated surroundings with the overall presentation of the town.|$|R
