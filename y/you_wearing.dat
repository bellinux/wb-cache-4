2500|$|CHUM became {{well known}} for its zany {{contests}}. [...] In the 1950s and 1960s, it was contests such as 'The Walking Man', where listeners had to spot CHUM's mystery walking man using only clues given out on the air. [...] The 1970s' [...] "I Listen to CHUM" [...] promotion had DJs dialing phone numbers at random and awarding $1,000 to anyone who answered the phone with that phrase. [...] In 1976, there was the CHUM Starsign promotion. [...] Listeners wore a button featuring their astrological sign. [...] If CHUM's 'Starsign spotter' saw <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> your Starsign, you won prizes such as money or concert tickets to major events.|$|E
2500|$|On March 5, 1999, at UFC 19, after Ortiz won by referee {{stoppage}} in his rematch with Guy Mezger, {{he immediately}} flipped off the Lion's Den corner {{and then put}} on a shirt that said [...] "Gay Mezger is my Bitch". After Shamrock saw the shirt, he yelled into the octagon [...] "Hey Tito, don't let me see <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> that shirt!". Shamrock leaped onto {{the top of the}} cage, screaming at Ortiz and angrily waving his finger in Ortiz's face. Referee John McCarthy picked Ortiz up and carried him across the octagon to prevent the situation from escalating further. The situation was escalated to the point that police and security had to be called in to monitor the situation.|$|E

[...] "It's a magic ring I've loaned you, my dear," [...] said she, [...] "and {{as long as}} <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> it, <b>you</b> will be {{invisible}} to all eyes, those of Blueskins and Pinkies alike. I'm going to let <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> this wonderful ring, for it will save you from being discovered by your enemies. If at any time you wish to be seen, take the ring from your finger; {{but as long as}} <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> it, no one can see you, not even Earth people." ...|$|R

6000|$|That next Sunday as I drank my tea I interrogated my wife. [...] "How is this Sunday {{different}} from all other Sundays, little woman? What has happened?

6000|$|... "Perhaps it would, {{but surely}} {{it would be}} better that the land should be ruined than that we should be. Father, dear," [...] she said appealingly, laying one hand upon his shoulder, [...] "do be frank with me, and tell me what our {{position}} really is. I see <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> yourself out about business from day to day, and I know that there is never any money for anything, scarcely enough to keep the house going; and yet you will not tell me what we really owe--and I think I have a right to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid, mother," [...] Chris {{said as they}} started, [...] "that {{what seems}} so easy now will {{be too much for}} many of the women. We started without breakfast, and unless we can get {{something}} by the way I doubt if many will reach the town to-night. Of course for the men it is nothing. Very often when I have been out on the veldt and have started early, I have had nothing till I got back late in the evening. What are <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> that veil for, mother? I saw that you pulled it down over your face yesterday afternoon. I suppose you did it to keep the dust out of your eyes, but there is none now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so, Nephew.

She said that you looked very well in it, Shabaka. But now begone, for hark, here comes the {{procession}} with the new-anointed Pharaoh whose royal robe you won for him yonder in the pass, when you smote down Idernes and held his legions. Oh! it was well done and my new Cup, though faulty, was good enough to show me all. I felt proud of you, Shabaka, but begone, begone! 'A gift for the poor old beggar! A gift, my lords, for the poor blind beggar who has had none since the last Pharaoh was crowned in Egypt and finds it hard to live on memories!'" ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{is only a}} {{deviation}} from those ordinary rules of school life, which one observes naturally and without thinking, that enables one to realise how strong public-school prejudices really are. At a school, for instance, where the regulations say that coats only of black or dark blue are to be worn, a boy who appears one day {{in even the most}} respectable and unostentatious brown finds himself looked on with a mixture of awe and repulsion, which would be excessive if he had sand-bagged the headmaster. So in the case of boots. School rules decree that a boy shall go to his form-room in boots, There is no real reason why, if the day is fine, he should not wear shoes, should he prefer them. But, if he does, the thing creates a perfect sensation. Boys say, [...] "Great Scott, what have you got on?" [...] Masters say, [...] "Jones, what are <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> on your feet?" [...] In the few minutes which elapse between the assembling of the form for call-over and the arrival of the form-master, some wag is sure either to stamp on the shoes, accompanying the act with some satirical remark, or else to pull one of them off, and inaugurate an impromptu game of football with it. There was once a boy who went to school one morning in elastic-sided boots....|$|E
