The programme, titled [...] "Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate", included recent footage of fans chanting various antisemitic slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners. The documentary recorded antisemitism and monkey noise taunts of black players in Poland. In Ukraine, the documentary recorded Nazi salutes and FC Metalist Kharkiv fans violently assaulting a group of Asian students at the Metalist Oblast Sports Complex, one of the stadiums hosting matches in Ukraine. Panorama filmed former England defender Sol Campbell watching these clips, and then asked him whether he would recommend families go to the Championship. He responded: [...] "Stay at home, watch it on TV. Don't even risk it… because <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> coming back in a coffin." ...|$|E

None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> very easily <b>end</b> <b>up</b> seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|R
5000|$|A {{total of}} 147 U.S. {{military}} personnel died in combat, and another 236 {{died as a}} result of accidents or other causes. Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6. There was subsequent debate about whether UN Coalition forces should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power. Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces. Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S. and Coalition forces had left Iraq too soon. In an April 15, 1994 interview with C-SPAN, Cheney was asked if the U.S. and UN forces should have moved into Baghdad. Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a [...] "bad idea" [...] and would have led to a [...] "quagmire", explaining that:Because if we'd gone to Baghdad we would have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. occupation of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq.

In the following chapter we will provide a definition and explanation of food quality {{in the context of}} local and regional food. The quality concept is divided in production quality, the way the food has been produced, and product quality, the quality of the produce itself. Most effort will be put on the latter, based on an illustration of four important product quality traits. Last, a short account for how consumers perceive the quality of local and regional food and their very varying reasons for purchasing it or not. Founded by the EU South Baltic Program REGFOO...|$|E
40|$|The article {{provides}} a typology or map of ethical behavior. The map is detailed {{in the table}} in the article. In the table a wide range of behaviors that {{can be found in the}} public service are listed. These behaviors are grouped into three categories: "Value-Based Ethics": Behaviors that serve the public good and maximize the values of life, health, and freedom, values that can be seen as being reflected in the Preamble to the U. S. Constitution; "Value Neutral or Relative Ethics": Behaviors that reflect an indifference to Value-Based Ethics, " and "No Values": Behaviors that reflect values that are at odds with the public good. While the map has primary applicability to those who serve in the public sector, it can also be seen as having applicability to those in the private sector. This is particularly the case among those in the private sector who strive to balance the goals of making a profit with contributing to the public good. While individuals in the private sector are not obliged to act in ways that give high priority to serving the public good, those in the public sector are so obligated. A major purpose of the map is to compare and contrast behaviors across the three categories and to 1 awaken understanding and insight that might serve as an impetus for nurturing and strengthening value-based behavior among those who serve in government. ________________________________________________________________ There is an old adage, "If you don't know where you're going, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> anywhere. " It has been seen by some as having great relevance to the field of public administration. A luminary in the field, Dwight Waldo, had made a similar observation over thirty years ago in his article entitled "Public Administration and Change: Terra Paene Incognita " (Waldo, 1969). He asserted that the field was bereft of a philosophy of change or sense of direction. Indeed, his work influenced my selection of a dissertation topic that addressed thi...|$|E
