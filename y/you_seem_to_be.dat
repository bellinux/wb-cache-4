Lady Bracknell informs Jack that, as the first-born, {{he would have been}} named after his father, General Moncrieff. Jack {{examines}} the army lists and discovers that his father's name—and hence his own real name—was in fact Ernest. Pretence was reality all along. As the happy couples embrace—Jack and Gwendolen, Algernon and Cecily, and even Dr.Chasuble and Miss Prism—Lady Bracknell complains to her newfound relative: [...] "My nephew, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> displaying signs of triviality." [...] "On the contrary, Aunt Augusta", he replies, [...] "I've now realised {{for the first time in}} my life the vital importance of being Earnest." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} Home of the Gentry {{must have come}} as a {{surprise}} to Goncharov, who'd never considered Turgenev a novelist. In a letter dated March 28, 1859, he wrote: [...] "Would it be permissible for me to comment on your talent? I'd say you've got a gift for drawing tender landscapes, and have a keen ear, but <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> eager to erect monumental structures [...] and give us drama. Goncharov's opinion seemingly never altered.|$|E
2500|$|In 1760, the betrothal {{was again}} {{brought up by}} Denmark, which {{regarded}} it {{as a matter of}} prestige. The negotiations were made between Denmark and the Swedish Queen, as King Adolf Frederick of Sweden was never considered to be of any more than purely formal importance. Louisa Ulrika favored a match between Gustav and her niece Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt instead, and claimed that she regarded the engagement to be void and forced upon her by Carl Gustaf Tessin. She negotiated with Catherine the Great and her brother Frederick the Great to create some political benefit for Denmark in exchange for a broken engagement. However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, who was very loved for her kindness and charity. This view was supported by the Caps political party, which expected Sophia Magdalena to be an example of a virtuous and religious representative of the monarchy in contrast to the haughty Louisa Ulrika. Fredrick V of Denmark was also eager to complete the match: [...] "His Danish Majesty could not have the interests of his daughter sacrificed because of the prejudices and whims of the Swedish Queen". In 1764 Crown Prince Gustav, who was at this point eager to free himself from his mother and form his own household, used the public opinion to state to his mother that he wished to honor the engagement, and on 3 April 1766, the engagement was officially celebrated. When a portrait of Sophia Magdalena was displayed in Stockholm, Louisa Ulrika commented: [...] "why Gustav, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> already in love with her! She looks stupid", after which she turned to Prince Charles and added: [...] "She would suit you better!" ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{laughed and}} said: [...] "Out there, to me, [...] You looked so weather-browned, And brown in clothes, <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] Made of the dusty ground!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All we know is, what I {{suppose you}} knew long ago, that her most {{intimate}} friend, next <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{an old friend}} of ours, named Thurnall." ...|$|R
6000|$|The General nodded. [...] "Well, yes," [...] he said politely, [...] "that's {{exactly what}} he is; though, as <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> asking about presumed relations, I didn't like to mention it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} very pleasant here," [...] said Mrs. Kenton, cautiously. [...] "You're enjoying yourself--I mean, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> getting so much stronger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{glad you}} are so well satisfied, sir,' was his calm remark. 'I didn't expect it. <b>You</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite in good spirits.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A most admirable sentiment, {{my young}} friend, which <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing {{your best to}} live up to. Not a line written, I see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lad, {{you are a}} wonder! Tell me now who {{and what}} are you? I saw when you first {{addressed}} me that you <b>were</b> not what <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> a working lad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean, my dear, that I've seen. I've seen, {{week after}} week, that <b>YOU</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thinking--of {{something}} that perplexed or worried you. Is it anything for which I'm in any degree responsible?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MEPH.: Rather. Talking of cricket, <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shaping {{rather well}} last Saturday. I had just run up on business, and {{someone told me}} you made eighty not out. Get your century all right? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then {{you must}} have been but a boy when you came here," [...] {{returned}} the Englishman, [...] "for <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> not yet middle-aged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't quite {{understand}} the sacrifice <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> making to Mr. Vimpany," [...] she confessed. [...] "Will you tell me, dear, what it means?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} her myself. I think {{it better to}} say as much <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> embarrassed by the fear that they might happen {{to see each other}} in your drawing-room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, young fellow; {{we shall}} {{see you on the}} road, and if you likes to chum up with us you may, for I likes yer looks, and <b>you</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of the right sort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moving," [...] {{said his}} comrade with a laugh. [...] "I would have roused you before, but <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so busily engaged with some friend that I hadn't {{the heart to}} part you sooner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{in great}} spirits," [...] said Sir Mallaby approvingly. [...] "It's {{pleasant}} {{to hear your}} merry laugh again, isn't it, Miss Milliken?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{a little}} {{difficult}} to understand why <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> content with track-grading. One would fancy it to be unusually hard work," [...] said the girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> both {{looking at}} them!" [...] She at once covered this unwary {{outbreak}} of jealousy under an impervious surface of compliment.

6000|$|... "Perfectly, I assure you," [...] says I. [...] "I <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> {{offer to}} ride your horse home for <b>you,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rather frightened at it; {{but the fact}} was, I was so {{comfortable}} here that really I couldn't move." ...|$|R
6000|$|On April 6 we had tea out of doors, on {{the terrace}} of our friend Miss Blagden in her villa up [at] Bellosguardo (not exactly Aurora Leigh's,[54] mind). <b>You</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lifted up above {{the world in a}} divine ecstasy. Oh, what a vision! ...|$|R
6000|$|Here {{the gentleman}} laughed, and said, [...] "No, I'm not captain; but <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an honest sort of boy. I don't {{know where the}} captain is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{are quite}} right,' he said, with decision. 'Georgina's {{principles}} are not mine. Excuse my remarking it, but <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a young lady}} of unusual penetration.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} was; I felt {{that you have}} been badly treated. But I only meant to stay a minute or two, and <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> busy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll tell you, however," [...] said I, [...] "whether {{you want}} to know or not. We said that as you put it in your pocket very glad <b>to</b> get it, <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it." ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. I was {{so lonely}} and so frightened. <b>You</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sorry for me. You {{were the only}} person who <b>was</b> really kind <b>to</b> me.
