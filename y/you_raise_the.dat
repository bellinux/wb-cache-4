6000|$|Vanderbank at {{this left}} his {{corner of the}} sofa and, {{with his hands in}} his pockets and a manner so amused that it might have passed for excited, took several paces about the room while his interlocutor, {{watching}} him, waited for his response. That gentleman, as this response for a minute hung fire, took his turn at sitting down, and then Vanderbank stopped before him with a face in which something had been still more brightly kindled. [...] "You ask me more things than I can tell you. You ask me more than I think you suspect.

Again shall <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you--he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments! ...|$|E

5000|$|Sergei Kovalyov {{was accused}} by Russian General Troshev, {{that during the}} Battle of Grozny, Kovalyov offered Russian {{soldiers}} to surrender. He promised that their life, health and honor would be preserved. But {{most of those who}} gave up were killed. However, Mr.Troshev is the only source of this information. Russian nationalist Alexander Prokhanov in his Zavtra newspaper also accused Kovalyov in mistreatment of soldier Yevgeny Rodionov mother, Lyubov Vasilievna. According to Prokhanov, she asked Kovalyov's help in finding her kidnapped and later killed son in 1996, but he roared in response: [...] "Why did you come to me? <b>You</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> murderer".|$|R
60|$|Remove {{the paper}} from the sunshine. The ink will not look so black. Carry the paper {{gradually}} into the darkest part of the room, and the contrast will as gradually appear to diminish; and, of course, in darkness, {{the distinction between the}} black and the white vanishes. Wet ink is as perfect a representative as is by any means attainable of a perfectly dark color; that is, of one which absorbs all the light that falls on it; and the nature of such a color is best understood by considering it as a piece of portable night. Now, of course, the higher <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> daylight about this bit of night, the more vigorous is the contrast between the two. And, therefore, as a general rule, the higher <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> light on any object with a pattern or stain upon it, the more distinctly that pattern or stain is seen. But observe: the distinction between the full black of ink, and full white of paper, is the utmost reach of light and dark possible to art. Therefore, if this contrast is to be represented truly, no deeper black can ever be given in any shadow than that offered at once; as local color, in a full black pattern, on the highest light. And, where color is the principal object of the picture, that color must, at all events, be as right as possible where it is best seen, i.e. in the lights. Hence the principle of Paul Veronese, and of all the great Venetian colorists, is to use full black for full black in high light, letting the shadow shift for itself as best it may; and sometimes even putting the local black a little darker in light than shadow, in order to give the more vigorous contrast noted above. Let the pillars in Plate +25+ be supposed to have a black mosaic pattern on the lower part of their shafts. Paul Veronese's general practice will be, as at 7, having marked the rounding of the shaft as well as he can in the white parts, to paint the pattern with one even black over all, reinforcing it, if at all, a little in the light.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{retorted}} Ditmar, [...] "and what then? <b>You</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> rents, and you won't get {{anybody to}} live in the houses. They'll move out to settlements like Glendale full of dirt and vermin and disease and live as they're accustomed to. What you reformers are actually driving at is that we should raise wages--isn't it? If we raised wages they'd live like rats anyway. I give you credit for sincerity, Mr. Siddons, but I don't want you to think I'm not as much interested in the welfare of these people as you and the men behind you. The trouble is, you only see one side of this question. When you're in my position, you're up against hard facts. We can't pay a dubber or a drawing tender any more than he's worth, whether he has a wife or children in the mills or whether he hasn't. We're in competition with other mills, we're in competition with the South. We can't regulate the cost of living. We do our best to make things right in the mills, and that's all we can do. We can't afford to be sentimental about life. Competition's got to be the rule, the world's made that way. Some are efficient and some aren't. Good God, any man who's {{had anything to do with}} hiring labour and running a plant has that drummed into him hard. You talk about ordinances, laws--there are enough laws and ordinances in this city and in this state right now. If we have any more the mills will have to shut down, and these people will starve--all of 'em." [...] Ditmar's chair came down on its four legs, and he flung his cigar away. [...] "Send me a copy of your survey when it's published. I'll look it over." ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{few years}} after this, the {{question}} began to be very hotly discussed in France. There was M. Pouchet, a professor at Rouen, a very learned man, but certainly not a very rigid experimentalist. He published a number of experiments of his own, {{some of which were}} very ingenious, to show that if you went to work in a proper way, there was a truth in the doctrine of spontaneous generation. Well, {{it was one of the}} most fortunate things in the world that M. Pouchet took up this question, because it induced a distinguished French chemist, M. Pasteur, to take up the question on the other side; and he has certainly worked it out in the most perfect manner. I am glad to say, too, that he has published his researches in time to enable me to give you an account of them. He verified all the experiments which I have just mentioned to you--and then finding those extraordinary anomalies, as in the case of the mercury bath and the milk, he set himself to work to discover their nature. In the case of milk he found it to be a question of temperature. Milk in a fresh state is slightly alkaline; and it is a very curious circumstance, but this very slight degree of alkalinity seems to have the effect of preserving the organisms which fall into it from the air from being destroyed at a temperature of 212 degrees, which is the boiling point. But if <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> temperature 10 degrees when you boil it, the milk behaves like everything else; and if the air with which it comes in contact, after being boiled at this temperature, is passed through a red-hot tube, you will not get a trace of organisms.|$|E
