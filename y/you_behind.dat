According to The Times of India, Fashion [...] "is not about cliches alone and manages to transcend them with its moving tale of three women {{who try to}} maintain their honour, dignity, [...] identity in a cruel world that spills over with grime behind the glamour. The film not only takes <b>you</b> <b>behind</b> the psychedelic ramp, it travels through the dark inner recesses of the three lead characters, laying bare their strengths and weaknesses; their fears and hopes; their dreams and nightmares". Ananya Bhattacharya of Zee News said that the film [...] "went on to speak volumes about women, their aspirations and the dark side-effects of over-ambition". In {{an interview with the}} Hindustan Times, Chopra said that the film is [...] "an emotional tale and the story of three girls... shows female bonding in a beautiful way...".|$|E
