50|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>black-faced</b> <b>blenny</b> (Tripterygion delaisi) {{is a small}} benthic {{fish from}} the family Tripterygiidae (triplefin-blennies). It occurs at depths of -3 to -40 m and lives on the {{substrate}} under large rocks, cliffs or other overhangs.|$|E
50|$|The {{common name}} <b>yellow</b> <b>black-faced</b> <b>blenny</b> {{derives from the}} {{colouration}} of territorial males during the breading season: their body becomes yellow and their head turns black; during a territorial fight the colouration of the head changes to a grey colour {{as a sign of}} aggression. Non-territorial males, females, and juveniles are cryptically coloured and are grey-brown with five dark and broad dorso-ventral bands between the head and the tail. Outside the breading season, males and females can only be told apart with certainty by dissection.|$|E

In marine species, phylogeographic and demographic patterns are often shaped by sea level fluctuations, water currents and dispersal ability. Using mitochondrial control region sequences (n = 120), we infer phylogeographic structure and historic population size changes of a common littoral fish species, the <b>black-faced</b> <b>blenny</b> Tripterygion delaisi (Perciformes, Blennioidei, Tripterygiidae) from the north-eastern Adriatic Sea. We find that Adriatic T. delaisi are differentiated from conspecific populations in the remaining Mediterranean, but display little phylogeographic structure within the Adriatic basin. The pattern is consistent with passive dispersal of planktonic larvae along cyclonic currents within the Adriatic Sea, but limited active dispersal of adults. Demographic reconstructions are consistent with recent population expansion, probably triggered by rising sea levels after the last glacial maximum (LGM). Placing the onset of population growth between the LGM and the warming of surface waters (18 000 – 13 000 years BP) and employing a novel expansion dating approach, we inferred a substitution rate of 2. 61 – 3. 61 % per site per MY. Our study {{is one of only}} few existing investigations of the genetic structure of animals within the Adriatic basin and is the first to provide an estimate for mitochondrial control region substitution rates in blennioid fishes...|$|R
40|$|Background] Social {{dominance}} {{is important}} for the reproductive success of males in many species. In the <b>black-faced</b> <b>blenny</b> (Tripterygion delaisi) during the reproductive season, some males change color and invest in nest making and defending a territory, whereas others do not change color and ‘sneak’ reproductions when females lay their eggs. Using RNAseq, we profiled differential gene expression between the brains of territorial males, sneaker males, and females to study the molecular signatures of male dimorphism. [Results] We found that more genes were differentially expressed between the two male phenotypes than between males and females, suggesting that during the reproductive period phenotypic plasticity is a more important factor in differential gene expression than sexual dimorphism. The territorial male overexpresses genes related to synaptic plasticity and the sneaker male overexpresses genes involved in differentiation and development. [Conclusions] Previously suggested candidate genes for social dominance in the context of alternative mating strategies seem to be predominantly species-specific. We present a list of novel genes which are differentially expressed in Tripterygion delaisi. This is the first genome-wide study for a molecular non-model species in the context of alternative mating strategies and provides essential information for further studies investigating the molecular basis of social dominance.

40|$|Larval {{development}} and allometric growth {{patterns of the}} <b>black-faced</b> <b>blenny</b> Tripterygion delaisi are described from a larval series (body length, LB [*]=[*] 3 · 30 - 12 · 10 [*]mm) caught by light traps at the Arrábida Marine Park, Portugal. Larvae of T. delaisi possess distinctive morphometric and meristic characteristics {{which can be used}} to identify this species from related taxa. Pigmentation is sparse but characteristic, consisting of pigmented eyes, gas bladder pigmentation in the dorsal region, anal pigmentation and a row of regularly spaced postanal ventral melanophores. This pattern is present from as early as the yolk-sac stage and persists throughout all stages with just the addition of head and caudal pigmentation during the flexion and postflexion stages, respectively. The majority of fin development (with the exception of the caudal fin), occurs in the later stages of development. Myomere counts range between 37 and 45 for all stages. Growth is allometric during larval development. When inflexion points of growth were detected, growth was found to be biphasic with the inflexion points occurring within a very narrow range of LB (8 · 70 - 8 · 90 [*]mm) close to the mean[*]±[*]s. d. (9 · 44 [*]±[*] 1 · 48 [*]mm LB) of postflexion larvae. Considering allometric growth patterns and ontogenetic descriptions together, the first developmental phase includes the preflexion and flexion stage larvae, while the second phase characterises the postflexion larvae prior to the transition from larvae to juvenile.
