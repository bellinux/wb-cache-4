Shawn Perry of Vintage Rock also admires {{the range of}} sounds, saying: [...] "incidental passages, scads of sitar, sarod and tabla, Dixieland cutaways, 'Cowboy Music,' church bells, chirps, acoustic guitar, space rock riffs, piano, horns – <b>you</b> <b>name</b> <b>it</b> and he threw it in."

500|$|Brooks {{began writing}} The Sword of Shannara in 1967 {{when he was}} twenty-three years old. He started writing the novel to {{challenge}} himself and {{as a way of}} staying [...] "sane" [...] while he attended law school at Washington and Lee University. Brooks had been a writer since high school, but he had never found 'his' genre: [...] "I tried my hand at science fiction, westerns, war stories, <b>you</b> <b>name</b> <b>it.</b> All those efforts ... weren't very good." [...] When he was starting college, he was given a copy of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings to read for the first time. From then on, Brooks knew that he had found a genre he could write in. Writing Sword took seven years, as Brooks worked on it only sporadically while also completing his law school courses and rewrote it many times.|$|E

Talk about relationship goals; who wants McDreamy when Cristina Yang could be your person. These two were the real powerhouse, and Shonda Rhimes didn’t shy away from making the audience remember this. Derek was the love of her life, but Cristina was her soul mate. More than anyone else, Cristina challenged Meredith, was honest with her, and inspired her. For these reasons, it was Cristina who was constantly the source of Meredith’s character development, not Derek." ...|$|E
500|$|Ed Boon {{recalled}} that for {{six out of}} the eight months {{while they were in}} production of the original Mortal Kombat, [...] "nobody could come up with a name nobody didn't hate". Some of the names suggested included [...] "Kumite", [...] "Dragon Attack", [...] "Death Blow" [...] and just [...] "Fatality". Someone had written down [...] "combat" [...] on the drawing board for the names in Boon's office and then someone wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, [...] "just to be kind of weird". Steve Ritchie, a pinball designer at that time, was sitting in Boon's office and saw the word [...] "Kombat" [...] and said to Boon, 'Why don't <b>you</b> <b>name</b> <b>it</b> Mortal Kombat?' and that name [...] "just stuck". Since then, the series uses the letter [...] "K" [...] in place of [...] "C" [...] for various words containing the hard C sound. According to Boon, during the MK games' development they usually spell the words correctly and only [...] "korrect it" [...] when one of the developers points out they should do it.|$|E

500|$|Scott Derrickson {{did not see}} a lookbook for Doctor Strange, instead putting {{together}} his own presentation, with concept art and storyboards by himself and professionals he hired, to sell himself and {{his vision of the}} film to Marvel. In contrast, Marvel shared several different ideas for what Thor: Ragnarok could be with prospective filmmakers, who then went away and developed what they thought the film should be from that. Taika Waititi created a sizzle reel using clips from other films to present his vision based on Marvel's ideas, a practice that Marvel discourages as they [...] "oftentimes can be really terrible". However, Marvel thought Waititi's was [...] "amazing". Derrickson and Waititi were both eventually hired for the films. For Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Joe and Anthony Russo met with the studio four times over two months before they were hired, during which they [...] "kept getting more and more specific about what our vision was", {{putting together}} [...] "reference videos, storyboards, script pages, <b>you</b> <b>name</b> <b>it.</b> We did like a 30-page book that had everything that we’d do with the character, from the theme of the movie to the tone of the film to the fighting style to what we liked about the character and what we didn’t like".

2500|$|In 1999, Forsyth {{published}} The Phantom of Manhattan, {{a sequel}} to The Phantom of the Opera.

In a 1999 newspaper interview, Duley described herself as a former motorcycle gang member and drug user: [...] "Heroin. Cocaine. PCP. <b>You</b> <b>name</b> <b>it,</b> I did it." [...] According to an article originally appearing in the August 12, 2009 Frederick News-Post, Duley was under house arrest when she tape recorded Ivins' allegedly [...] "threatening" [...] messages.

2500|$|Schwarzenegger {{wanted to}} move from {{bodybuilding}} into acting, finally achieving {{it when he was}} chosen {{to play the role of}} Hercules in 1970's Hercules in New York. Credited under the stage name [...] "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: [...] "It was very difficult for me in the beginning– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. <b>You</b> <b>name</b> <b>it,</b> and they told me I had to change it.

500|$|In 2012, {{art critic}} Camille Paglia praised {{the film in}} Glittering Images, {{comparing}} some of its scenes to works by modern painters and calling it [...] "the greatest work of art in recent memory". Paglia explained that the film's finale, [...] "has more inherent artistic value, emotional power, and global impact than anything by the artists <b>you</b> <b>name.</b> <b>It's</b> because the art world has flat-lined and become an echo chamber of received opinion and toxic over-praise. It's like the emperor's new clothes -- people are too intimidated to admit what they secretly think or what they might think with their blinders off. Episode III epitomizes the modern digital art movement, more so than other piece from the last 30 years. I had considered using Japanese anime for the digital art chapter of the book, but it lacked the overwhelming operatic power and yes, seriousness of Lucas's Revenge of the Sith." ...|$|R
