5|$|After {{traveling}} through {{a network of}} caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis. They are greeted by Kida who resembles a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> discover that the Atlantean language {{is the basis of}} many existing languages. Kida enlists Milo's aid in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By swimming deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks. He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that a page is missing.|$|E
5|$|Greco-Roman mythology {{described}} the Empusae, the Lamia, and the striges. Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. The Lamia preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood, as did the gelloudes or Gello. Like the Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on adults. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood.|$|E

5|$|One {{scene that}} von Stroheim re-shot at the studio's insistence {{depicted}} a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is {{too embarrassed to}} examine the teeth of a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> Potter has to take over. A thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the audience would see a resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it. Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director {{wanted to have a}} knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gibson Gowland's head. Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to allow such a dangerous stunt. A special-effect shot was used instead.|$|E
5|$|Short Term 12 was {{originally}} conceived by Destin Daniel Cretton as a short film {{based on his}} experiences as a line staff worker at a group facility for teenagers where he had worked for two years; it served as his thesis project for his Master's degree in film at San Diego State University. The short film ran for 22minutes and premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Jury Prize in Short Filmmaking. After graduating from film school, Cretton decided to adapt the short into a feature-length screenplay, which won one of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' five Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting in 2010. The largest change Cretton made when adapting the short film into a longer screenplay was changing the lead character's gender: Denim, a man loosely based on Cretton himself, became Grace, a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> the facility's supervisor. Cretton researched similar facilities and interviewed former employees for the film, noting that the script featured stories directly told by children in these facilities from his interviews.|$|E
5|$|The Ways of Fate is a 1913 American silent short romance film {{produced}} by the American Film Manufacturing Company. The film's directorial and producer roles have been both attributed to Allan Dwan, but other sources point to Wallace Reid as director. The film's fictional plot is centered on Jim Conway, who grew up wanting to avenge his father's death and headed West to seek his father's killer. Lost in the mountains, he is saved by a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> the two fall in love. After a few weeks with her, Conway reveals the reason he came west and the young woman's father overhears it. The old man confesses to killing Conway's father, over a game of cards, and bares his chest. Conway refuses to take revenge, because love had diminished such feelings. The film was released on April 19, 1913 {{and it had a}} widespread national release. It is not known whether the film currently survives, but it is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Greek mythology {{contains}} several precursors {{to modern}} vampires, though none were considered undead; these included the Empusa, Lamia, and striges (the strix of Ancient Roman mythology). Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. Lamia was the daughter of King Belus and a secret lover of Zeus. However Zeus' wife Hera discovered this infidelity and killed all Lamia's offspring; Lamia swore vengeance and preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood. Like Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on young men. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood. The Romanian vampire breed named Strigoï has no direct relation to the Greek striges, but was derived from the Roman term strix, as {{is the name of the}} Albanian Shtriga and the Slavic Strzyga, though myths about these creatures are more similar to their Slavic equivalents. Greek vampiric entities are seen once again in Homer's epic Odyssey. In Homer's tale, the undead are too insubstantial to be heard by the living and cannot communicate with them without drinking blood first. In the epic, when Odysseus journeyed into Hades, he was made to sacrifice a black ram and a black ewe so that the shades there could drink its blood and communicate.|$|E

The couple were married eight months later in Vienna at the Augustinerkirche on 24 April 1854. The marriage was finally consummated three days later, and Elisabeth received a dower equal to today's 240,000 USD.|$|E

The life of a man such as Oppen made a lasting impression on DuPlessis. DuPlessis gained Oppen's trust as well and she was given the opportunity of editing Oppen's Selected Letters, which were published posthumously.|$|E

Paul D is suspicious and warns Sethe, but she is charmed by the <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> ignores him. Gradually, Paul D is forced out of Sethe's home by a supernatural presence.|$|E
