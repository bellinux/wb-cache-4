6000|$|My Lords, {{if there}} is a spark of manhood, {{if there is}} in <b>your</b> <b>breasts</b> the least feeling for our common humanity, and {{especially}} for the sufferings and distresses of that part of human nature which is made by its peculiar constitution more quick and sensible,--if, I say, there is a trace of this in <b>your</b> <b>breasts,</b> if you are yet alive to such feelings, it is impossible that you should not join with the Commons of Great Britain in feeling the utmost degree of indignation against the man who was the guilty cause of this accumulated distress. You see women, whom we have proved to be of respectable rank and condition, exposed to what is held to be the last of indignities in that country,--the view of a base, insulting, ridiculing, or perhaps vainly pitying populace. You have before you the first women in Asia, who consider their honor as joined with that of these people, weeping and bewailing the calamities of their house. You have seen that in this misery and distress the sons of the Nabob were involved, and that two of them were wounded in an attempt to escape: and yet this man has had the impudence to declare his doubts of the Nabob's having had any children in the place, though the account {{of what was going on}} had been regularly transmitted to him. After this, what is there in his conduct that we can wonder at? ...|$|E

I know a poor wretch whose one desire {{in life is to}} run away from his wife. She prevents him by threatening to throw herself in front of the engine of the train he leaves her in. That is what all women do. If we try to go where you do not want us to go there is no law to prevent us, but when we take the first step <b>your</b> <b>breasts</b> are under our foot as it descends: your bodies are under our wheels as we start. No woman shall ever enslave me in that way.|$|E

"Why these sums {{were taken}} by me,--why they were, except the second, quietly {{transferred}} to the Company's use,--why bonds were taken for the first, {{and not for the}} rest,--might, were this matter exposed to the view of the public, furnish a variety of conjectures, to which it would be of little use to reply. Were your Honorable Court to question me on these points, I would answer, that the sums were taken for the Company's benefit, at times when the Company very much needed them,--that I either chose to conceal the first receipts from public curiosity by receiving bonds for the amount, or possibly acted without any studied design which my memory could at this distance of time verify, and that I did not think it worth my care to observe the same means with the rest. I trust, Honorable Sirs, to <b>your</b> <b>breasts</b> for a candid interpretation of my actions,--and assume the freedom to add, that I think myself, on such a subject, on such an occasion, entitled to it." ...|$|E
