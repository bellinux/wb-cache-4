6000|$|O'Con. Then, upon my word, I'll {{have the}} Rising Sun put down, and the Angel shall give {{security}} for his good behaviour; but are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> nothing to quit scores with them? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{told you}} what I should like to do for you. See that the {{conditions}} come about promptly in which I may, do it. Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> everything to satisfy Mrs. Dallow?" [...] Mr. Carteret continued.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Cuthbert? I {{have thought}} {{all these months}} that you had taken me at my word, {{and that it was}} but as a friend you {{regarded}} me. Are you sure it is not gratitude for what little I did for you in the hospital! Still more that it is not because I showed my feelings so plainly the day before yesterday, and that it is from pity as well as gratitude that you speak now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And is that Lord Fitzjocelyn's {{definition}} of a narrow mind?' said Isabel. 'It sounds like faith and love. Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not make it yourself, Miss Ponsonby?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It shall all be made {{right in}} the morning," [...] said his wife. [...] "But are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not take {{anything}} that disagreed with you while you were away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He was {{the rather}} {{convinced}} of this, when, {{with a voice}} which in the force of its accents corresponded with her commanding air, Mrs. Montreville addressed him in English, which savoured slightly of a Swiss patois,--"You have come to us very fast, sir, to say nothing at all. Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not get your tongue stolen by de way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear me! O Lord! Stop a moment!" [...] says Mr. Smallweed. [...] "He's so very prompt! Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> it carefully, my worthy man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it willingly?" [...] queried his tormentor, adding, [...] "another little half-turn, please, Simon; and you, Mistress Meg, if {{he begins}} to faint, just prick him in the thigh with your knife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> right?" [...] she asked. [...] "It {{has always}} seemed to me from what I know and have heard of you that you were made for {{positions}} of trust. You {{would have been a}} better governor than the man they have nominated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't," [...] said Weston dryly, [...] "though I've {{no doubt}} {{there are a few}} lost mines. Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> haven't <b>done</b> a crazy thing in joining us in the hunt for this one? Of course, I've tried to put that aspect of the matter {{squarely}} before you already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Marian," [...] he said earnestly, {{clasping}} the outstretched hand, [...] "are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> will be happy--are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> are <b>doing</b> a wise thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>you</b> are <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know! Well, {{let us see}} if we can guess. Not long ago, when Lord Bangley was in question, {{he became}} furious against him; now, he is enraged with me for recommending that nice little Lord Holmeskirk. Put two and two together, my dear, and four is the undoubted result." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our liturgy," [...] {{observed}} Crawford, [...] "has beauties, {{which not}} even a careless, slovenly style of reading can destroy; {{but it has also}} redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt. For myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be" [...] (here was a glance at Fanny); [...] "that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing to have it to read myself. Did you speak?" [...] stepping eagerly to Fanny, and addressing her in a softened voice; and upon her saying [...] "No," [...] he added, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not speak? I saw your lips move. I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive, and not allow my thoughts to wander. Are not {{you going to tell me}} so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Papa, <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> must know, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{know all}} the things they said at Plumstead. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> {{know all the}} archdeacon said. How unjust he was; and Mr. Arabin too. He's a horrid man, a horrid odious man, but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dearest child," [...] said John, who, {{to say the}} truth, was {{beginning}} to find this thing less charming {{than it used to}} be, [...] "I am satisfied. I am much obliged to <b>you.</b> I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> all that could be asked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you just}} now told {{the gentleman who}} {{examined}} you on the other side, that <b>you</b> were quite <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not witness two deeds {{on the day he}} named,--the 14th of July. Now, seeing that you doubt your own memory, going back over so long a time, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> wish to correct that statement?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait--not so fast," [...] said Ferris with a laugh, yet {{a little}} annoyed that a {{question}} so purely tentative as his should have met at once such a definite response. [...] "Are <b>you</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> what they want?" [...] He unfolded to him, as fully as he understood it, Mrs. Vervain's scheme.|$|R
6000|$|... "Doubtless," [...] {{answered}} the commandant, who, as I have said, was irritable that night, [...] "doubtless those English missionaries have poisoned the king's mind against us Boers. Also," [...] he added suspiciously, [...] "I think you told me, Allan, {{that the king}} said he liked you and meant to spare you, even if he killed your companions, just because you also are English. Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know more than you choose to tell us? Has Dingaan perhaps confided something to you--just because you are English?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} going on in Monte Carlo," [...] Lady Hunterleys went on, [...] "which I cannot understand. Mr. Draconmeyer knows about it, I believe, although he is not personally concerned in it. But he will tell me nothing. I only know that for some reason or other your presence here {{seems to be an}} annoyance to certain people. Why it should be I don't know, but I {{want to ask you about}} it. Will you tell me the truth? Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not come here to spy upon me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir James {{looked at}} him keenly. [...] "You had worked that out, had you? Not bad--not at all bad. The curious {{thing is that they}} {{certainly}} did not know anything about you when they first held <b>you</b> prisoner. <b>You</b> are <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not in any way disclose your identity?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Londo and G'Kar join Delenn {{aboard a}} White Star. She {{presents}} {{each of them}} {{with a copy of}} a new treaty. Soon they will be joined by the League of Non-Aligned Worlds who will be presented with the same document. G'Kar asks, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>do</b> this?" [...] Londo starts laughing but explains that it's not because her idea is a joke; the proposal is so revolutionary that it's leaving him lightheaded in anticipation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I will go first. You {{fasten the}} rope under your arms, and I will haul <b>you</b> across. Be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not make a}} noise in getting into the water. But first of all take off your doublet, I will carry it and mine across on my head. It cannot be many yards across. The wind will soon dry {{the rest of our}} things, and once our work is done we can warm {{ourselves}} by running. I would say strip altogether, but we may have to do another swim; for, as we agreed, there is no chance of our being able to return by the way we came." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> {{have quite}} <b>done</b> tea? Not a bit or drop more? Why, you've eaten nothing, I'm sure.... Well, now, {{it is rather}} {{inconvenient}} that the other maid is not here {{to show you the}} ways of the house a little, but she left last Saturday, and Miss Aldclyffe has been making shift with poor old clumsy me for a maid all yesterday and this morning. She is not come in yet. I expect she will ask for you, Mrs. Graye, the first thing.... I was going to say that if <b>you</b> have really <b>done</b> tea, I will take you upstairs, and show you through the wardrobes--Miss Aldclyffe's things are not laid out for to-night yet.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Independence Day {{was celebrated}} on 30 June in a {{ceremony}} attended by many dignitaries, including King Baudouin of the Belgians and the foreign press. Baudouin's speech praised developments under colonialism, his reference to the [...] "genius" [...] of his great-granduncle Leopold II of Belgium, glossing over atrocities committed during {{the existence of the}} Congo Free State. The King continued, [...] "Don't compromise the future with hasty reforms, and don't replace the structures that Belgium hands over to <b>you</b> until <b>you</b> are <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> better... Don't be afraid to come to us. We will remain by your side, give you advice." [...] President Kasa-Vubu thanked the King.|$|R
5000|$|Dance with Me was {{recorded}} at Redondo Pacific Studios in Redondo Beach, California with record producer Thom Wilson, who was initially hesitant {{to work with}} T.S.O.L. because of their violent reputation: [...] "I was very apprehensive about it," [...] he recalled in 1998, [...] "People said to me, 'Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>do</b> this? They beat people up. However, {{he found that the}} band members took the recording process seriously and worked hard, the lone quirk being singer Jack Grisham's insistence on sitting while he recorded his vocal tracks. Wilson engineered and mixed the recordings, and they were mastered at K Disc. Paintings by artist Mark Wassman were used for the front and back cover, while photos for the back cover and insert were taken by photographers Glen E. Friedman and Edward Colver.|$|R
60|$|CROFTS [with serious friendliness] To be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> <b>You</b> won't {{find me a}} bad sort: I don't go in {{for being}} superfine intellectually; but Ive plenty of honest human feeling; and the old Crofts breed comes out {{in a sort of}} instinctive hatred of {{anything}} low, in which I'm sure youll sympathize with me. Believe me, Miss Vivie, the world isn't such a bad place as the croakers make out. As long as you don't fly openly in the face of society, society doesn't ask any inconvenient questions; and it makes precious short work of the cads who do. There are no secrets better kept than the secrets everybody guesses. In the class of people I can introduce you to, no lady or gentleman would so far forget themselves as to discuss my business affairs or your mothers. No man can offer you a safer position.|$|R
2500|$|Norris {{circulated}} {{the cartoon}} to bloggers based in Seattle, Washington. She sent {{a copy of}} her illustration to Dan Savage, who posted it on his blog on April 22. On April 23, she was interviewed by Dave Ross of KIRO, a local Seattle radio station. Norris responded to a question [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>do</b> this?", and said [...] "Yeah, I want to water down the targets ... as a cartoonist I just felt so much passion about what had happened, I wanted to counter Comedy Central’s message about feeling afraid." [...] The motivation for the protest was not simply to defend the South Park creators, but also to support the {{right to free speech}} under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She also said, [...] "it's a cartoonist's job to be non-PC." [...] On her website, Norris stated that the idea was not to disrespect Islam, but to support everybody's freedom of expression.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh rot!" [...] Trent interrupted. [...] "I {{know what}} I'm talking about. I won't have <b>you</b> sell out. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> hear? If {{you try it}} on I'll queer the market for you at any risk. I won't marry your daughter, I won't be blackmailed, and I won't be bullied. We're in this together, sink or swim. If you pull me down you've got to come too. I'll admit that if Monty were to present himself in London to-morrow and demand his full pound of flesh we should be ruined, but he isn't going to do it. By your own showing there is no {{immediate}} risk, and you've got to leave the thing in my hands to do what I think best. If you play any hanky-panky tricks--look here, Da Souza, I'll kill <b>you,</b> <b>sure!</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> hear? I could do it, {{and no one would}} be the wiser so far as I was concerned. You take notice of what I say, Da Souza. You've made a fortune, and be satisfied. That's all!" ...|$|R
2500|$|So Jason Clarke is my {{public defender}} {{at the time}} and he's warning me. He's saying, [...] "Lindsey don't take drug court. I'm telling you, you won't make it." [...] He's told me this like three or four times. I'm adamant. I'm saying, [...] "I'm taking drug court." [...] Because all I know is I get to get out of jail. It's all I know. I don't know {{anything}} else about it. So I go to plead into drug court. My dad's in the court room. Judge Barton was on the bench that day instead of Judge Williams. She was gone. My dad's done Judge Barton's accounting for probably the past 15 years and they're very good friends. So (Judge Barton) sees me come in and he pulls me up to the bench and he's like, [...] "Don't do this. Don't take drug court. Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>do</b> this?" [...] He asked me three or four times. Judge Barton's trying to talk me out of taking drug court. That I would not do well. I wouldn't make it. He didn't think it was what I should do.|$|R
5000|$|On September 25, 2012, Brewster told TV Guide {{that prior}} to {{accepting}} the SVU role, she initially wanted to do comedy, Criminal Minds fans questioning her jump to SVU, [...] "Yeah, people do think it's similar and that's OK. I'm 43 now. I've {{reached the point where}} I really can't care what anyone thinks," [...] Brewster continued, [...] "Of course, I do care. I'm an actress. I'm totally insecure, but I'm trying to stick to my guns about what is important to me and it doesn't matter what anyone thinks I should or shouldn't do." [...] When her Criminal Minds contract was up she announced she was leaving the show, Brewster saying, [...] "I told my agent and manager, 'Listen, tell me everything that you hear about, but basically I want to do comedy." [...] So when she expressed interest in the offer from SVU, [...] "They called me and they said, 'Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>do</b> a law enforcement show?' I asked, 'Do I have scenes with Mariska Hargitay?' They said, 'Most of your scenes are with Mariska.' I said, 'I want it. I totally want it.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|They all {{spent the}} evening {{together}} at Thorpe's. Catherine was disturbed {{and out of}} spirits; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce, in the fate of which she shared, by private partnership with Morland, a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton. Her satisfaction, too, in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken more than once. [...] "How I pity the poor creatures that are going there! How glad I am that I am not amongst them! I wonder {{whether it will be}} a full ball or not! They have not begun dancing yet. I would not be there for all the world. It is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself. I dare say it will not be a very good ball. I know the Mitchells will not be there. I am sure I pity everybody that is. But I dare say, Mr. Morland, you long to be at it, <b>do</b> not <b>you?</b> I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Well, pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you. I dare say we could do very well without you; but you men think yourselves of such consequence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do {{not care}} for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares--Well!--(as {{soon as she was}} within the door) Well! This is {{brilliant}} indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--Jane, Jane, look!--did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin's lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance. 'Oh! Mrs. Stokes,' said I--but I had not time for more." [...] She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--"Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a headache!--seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.--Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.--But two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, 'Upon my word, ma'am--.' Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her take her shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl-- Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice. There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--and there was a mat to step upon--I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?--Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> do?--Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land!--Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> look--how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> like Jane's hair?--You are a judge.--She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her hair!--No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare--and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.--How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> do?--Very well, I thank you. This is delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--Oh! there he is. Don't disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> all do?--Quite well, I am much obliged to you. Never better.--Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A little tea if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A sort of Berserkar fury!" [...] said Ethel, [...] "like {{that night}} <b>you</b> <b>did</b> the coral-worm verses. It's very odd. Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> are well, dear Norman?" ...|$|R
