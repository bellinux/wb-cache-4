Responding to claims that her moral views were [...] "dependably predictable", Blyton commented that [...] "most of you could write down perfectly correctly all the things that I believe in and stand forâ€“ <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> them in my books, and a writer's books are always a faithful reflection of himself". Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, MacArthur's {{amphibious assault}} at Inchon went ahead on 15 September. [...] "The success of Inchon {{was so great}} and the {{subsequent}} prestige of General MacArthur was so overpowering," [...] Collins later recalled, [...] "that the Chiefs hesitated thereafter to question later plans and decisions of the general, which should have been challenged." [...] In response to a rumor that the Eighth Army planned to halt at the 38th parallel and await United Nations authorization to cross, Marshall {{sent a message to}} MacArthur informing him that: [...] "We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of 38th parallel. Announcement above referred to may precipitate embarrassment in the UN where evident desire is not to be confronted with necessity of a vote on passage, rather to find <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> it militarily necessary to do so." [...] A few days later, MacArthur was instructed not to issue an announcement that his forces had crossed the 38th parallel. On 7 October a United Nations General Assembly Resolution was passed that could be broadly construed as permitting the invasion of North Korea.|$|E

While those two cases were {{originally}} equally likely, {{the fact that you}} are certain to find a gold coin if you had chosen the GG box, but are only 50% sure of finding a gold coin if you had chosen the GS box, means they are no longer equally likely given that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> a gold coin.

2500|$|In {{order to}} take {{decision}} the envoys of the Eastern Patriarchs asked the Bulgarian delegated the following question: [...] "When you took [...] Motherland, tell us under which authority {{it used to be}} and were there Latin or Greek priests?". They gave the prepared answer: [...] "We took [...] Motherland with arms from the rule of the Greeks and there we found not Latin but Greek priests." [...] In compliance with the response of the Bulgarian envoys, the Eastern Patriarchates pronounced their decision: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> Greek priests, it is clear that this land was under the rule of Constantinople... Therefore we adjudge, because the Bulgarian motherland, as we got to know, was previously under Greek ruler and had Greek priests, to be now returned again through Christianity to the holy Church of Constantinople, from which it was separated through paganism." [...] The protests of the Roman legates were futile. They forged a letter in which the Pope allegedly warned the Patriarch of Constantinople not to interfere with the Bulgarian matters, but Ignatius ignored it. After the Council (in the very same year) the Latin priests had to leave Bulgaria and were substituted by Byzantine missionaries.|$|E
