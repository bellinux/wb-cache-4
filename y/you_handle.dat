25|$|Sweden has {{a system}} for credit scoring that aims to find people {{with a history of}} neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make {{payments}} after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish Enforcement Authority which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a Betalningsanmärkning (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company. This kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where <b>you</b> <b>handle</b> cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} {{initially}} titled Britney and Kevin: Can <b>You</b> <b>Handle</b> Our Truth?, before its title {{was changed to}} Britney and Kevin: Chaotic, with [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>handle</b> our truth?" [...] becoming its tagline. All of the footage shot for OnTourage was used for Britney and Kevin: Chaotic. According to Spears, the series helped the couple {{to know each other}} more, saying: [...] "I didn't know [...] that well, and when I got the camera out, it made me feel better. It's really weird because it was like all this tension at first. We were so nervous being together. I'm really shy, and when I had the camera in my hand, it made me feel more outspoken." ...|$|E
500|$|Spears' {{cover of}} [...] "My Prerogative" [...] is musically {{different}} {{from its original}} version, with the bass and new jack swing sound replaced with a synthpop sound, synthesizers and elements typical of Bloodshy & Avant productions. It was noted by Christy Lemire of msnbc.com that the cover also contains elements of Bollywood music. At {{the beginning of the}} song, Spears says in a breathy voice the lines [...] "People can take everything away from you / But they can never take away your truth / But the question is, can <b>you</b> <b>handle</b> mine?". The rest of the lyrics do not deviate much from the original version, instead they are changed to fit a woman's perspective. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV commented the cover could be interpreted as a statement on Spears's life and the media reaction to some of her decisions at the time, including her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline.|$|E

2500|$|National media {{attention}} {{was given to}} a 15-second video clip that appeared to show Corwin's Assembly chief of staff, Michael Mallia, repeatedly asking the 78-year-old Davis why he had skipped a campaign debate, followed by Mallia shrieking as Davis apparently shoved him or flapped at the camera. The video clip was circulated by local and national Republican organizations and prompted bipartisan criticism of both Davis and Mallia. Requests to see a longer tape and a tape made by second camera were refused by Corwin and her campaign. In {{an interview with the}} National Journal, Corwin said she thought the video was self-explanatory, and indicated that Mallia had been acting on his own free time, and not as her employee while he was tracking and taping her opponent, Davis. In response to Davis' complaints that he had been harassed, Corwin said, [...] "I've had cameras on me for two months now, and I've never hit anybody ... and I think that's the difference is how <b>you</b> <b>handle</b> a situation like that." [...] One week after the election, Mallia resigned his position as Corwin's chief of staff {{as a result of the}} controversy.|$|E
2500|$|Emperor Jianwen soon died, and was {{succeeded by}} his son Sima Yao the Crown Prince (as Emperor Xiaowu). [...] With Huan not in the capital, actual power at the capital soon slipped {{into the hands of}} Xie An and Wang Tanzhi, a {{situation}} that greatly displeased Huan, who, however, when again summoned by Emperor Xiaowu and Empress Dowager Chu to serve as regent, declined. [...] He did visit the capital in 373, and there was a rumor that he would execute Wang and Xie and then seize the throne. [...] As Wang and Xie greeted him, however, he did not carry out the rumored actions, and after visiting the young emperor, returned to his base at Gushu (姑孰, in modern [...] Ma'anshan, Anhui). [...] He grew ill in fall 373, and, after entrusting matters to his brother Huan Chong, died. [...] His domain was divided into three parts, governed by Huan Chong, another brother Huan Huo (桓豁), and his nephew Huan Shixiu (桓石秀). [...] As Huan Chong was loyal to the imperial government, the threats of a Huan usurpation dissipated. [...] (When, on his deathbed, Huan Wen was asked by Huan Chong what to do with Wang and Xie, his response was, [...] "They will not let <b>you</b> <b>handle</b> them," [...] meaning that while Wang and Xie were not daring to disobey him while alive, they would not obey Huan Chong after his death, and that killing them would not be helpful to Huan Chong either.) [...] Despite imperial officials' secret happiness that Huan was dead, he was formally buried with great honors.|$|E
