500|$|Mars co-wrote [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine of The Smeezingtons. The three co-produced {{the song}} with Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, and Emile Haynie. It {{was written in}} the key of D minor, with Mars's vocals range from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Levine {{aforementioned}} that some parts in the song are not instruments as Mars said they needed [...] "a dep-dep-dep-dep sound". Later, Levine told Mars to [...] "sing it into the microphone", where he chopped it up, and despite sounding like an instrument, the sounds are really Mars' voice. The song's composition relies mainly on a [...] "guitar-worthy groove guitar, a soaring sing-along chorus and sexual innuendo galore". It finds Mars singing a confession of a relationship that is so good that he repeats to his love [...] "Your sex takes me to paradise", a verse inspired by Halle Berry [...] "You make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven for too long/ Can I just stay here, {{spend the rest of my}} days here?" [...] he sings. During his Google Hangout on the day of the song's release, Mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from the track. Mars picked the phrase [...] "But swimming in <b>your</b> <b>water</b> is something spiritual," [...] and said that the single's exploration of feeling and being in love fits into the [...] "sensual, sensual and sensual" [...] theme of the album.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 November 1984, they {{recorded}} Field of Glass, a three track 12" [...] EP, mostly live in BBC Studio 5 in London, {{which was}} issued in February 1985. The title track, [...] "Field of Glass", was not released on CD as the master tape {{could not be}} found—it was eventually discovered under David McComb's bed. During the Australian tour in early 1985, the band acquired their final permanent member, Lee, who had performed on the mini-album Lawson Square Infirmary. Together the six-piece—Birt, Casey, Lee, MacDonald, David & Robert McComb—recorded a 12" [...] EP You Don’t Miss <b>Your</b> <b>Water.</b> The A-side is a countrified version of William Bell's [...] "You Don't Miss Your Water", which was released in August by Hot Records, but by then they were already back in London.|$|E
2500|$|Since Ganga had {{descended from}} heaven to earth, {{she is also}} the vehicle of ascent, from earth to heaven. As the Triloka-patha-gamini, (Skt. triloka= [...] "three worlds", patha = [...] "road", gamini = [...] "one who travels") of the Hindu tradition, she flows in heaven, earth, and the netherworld, and, consequently, is a [...] "tirtha," [...] or {{crossing}} point of all beings, the living {{as well as the}} dead. It {{is for this reason that}} the story of the avatarana is told at Shraddha ceremonies for the deceased in Hinduism, and Ganges water is used in Vedic rituals after death. Among all hymns devoted to the Ganges, there are none more popular than the ones expressing the worshipers wish to breathe his last surrounded by her waters. The Gangashtakam expresses this longing fervently: O Mother! ... Necklace adorning the worlds! [...] Banner rising to heaven! [...] I ask that I may leave of this body on your banks, Drinking <b>your</b> <b>water,</b> rolling in your waves, [...] Remembering your name, bestowing my gaze upon you.|$|E
