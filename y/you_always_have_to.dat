It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep that in mind.|$|E
500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I think that <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Whorf {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the allophone, a word that describes positional phonetic variants of a single superordinate phoneme; in doing so he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory. The term was popularized by G. L. Trager and Bernard Bloch in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition. Whorf considered allophones to be another example of linguistic relativity. The principle of allophony describes how acoustically different sounds can be treated as reflections of a single phoneme in a language. This sometimes makes the different sound appear similar to native speakers of the language, even {{to the point that they}} are unable to distinguish them auditorily without special training. Whorf wrote that: [...] " [...] are also relativistic. Objectively, acoustically, and physiologically the allophones of [...] phoneme may be extremely unlike, hence the impossibility of determining what is what. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep the observer in the picture. What linguistic pattern makes like is like, and what it makes unlike is unlike".(Whorf, 1940) ...|$|E

2500|$|Thirty {{years after}} the scandal broke, Amanda Marcotte {{suggested}} in The Daily Beast that [...] "we owe a lot to Vanessa Williams for being a pioneer {{when it comes to}} showing the world how to recover when you’ve been unjustly shamed for being sexual. Williams could have slunk off into the shadows in shame, which no doubt many people at the time expected her to do. Williams picked herself up and kept fighting for a career as an entertainer, first by becoming a successful singer and then becoming a well-known comic actress ... Sleazy people tried to drag Vanessa Williams down with accusations of being sexual 30 years ago, but she moved on, showing she had nothing to be ashamed of." [...] In addition, Williams commented on her ability to persevere after these events in a 2015 interview with Entertainment Tonight by stating that [...] "you can't give up ... <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remember what you're made of and not let circumstances get in the way. They might delay your progress for the moment, but <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remember who you are, and that will give you the eyes on the prize." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parks {{chose to}} film {{in areas of}} the Deep South where Northup labored in slavery. The {{director}} sought to have a crew of mixed races, he said [...] "perhaps to show the Southerners how Blacks and Whites could work together". In his memoir, Parks recalled the mix: Japanese American cinematographer Hiro Narita, a black producer and assistant director, a mostly white crew, and a black costume lady who was assisted by a woman from Hong Kong. He filmed Solomon Northup's Odyssey in three weeks' time in Savannah, Georgia. Parks said of the final product, [...] "I can't say I don't like the film; I think it's a powerful film, {{but it could have been}} stronger. But you meet that sort of crisis on every film; there are some sort of compromises <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make." ...|$|E

Junaid once told me that his biggest regret was not {{to be a part of}} Jazba Junoon's recording. So when we came up with 'Naya Pakistan', I asked him that this is the chance that's not going to come again so finally Junaid accepted the offer with the condition that he will sing only the opening lines with no music at all."

5000|$|Kenton Grua {{was born}} and raised in Utah. At age 12, Grua was enthralled by a {{whitewater}} rafting trip taken with his father on the Green River, a tributary of the Colorado River. He began college around 1968, but soon dropped out after he was offered a job as a motormana rubber raft guidefor Ted Hatch in the Grand Canyon. He was soon after hired by Grand Canyon Dories, founded by environmentalist Martin Litton, who piloted a fleet of wooden McKenzie River dories specially modified for the Colorado. His boundless energy, memorable personality and constant experimentation earned Grua a nickname, as historian Lew Steiger explains: Years ago, his pals nicknamed him 'Factor' because that's what he was ... this additional element <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> factor in whenever you were on a river trip, or in the warehouse, or anywhere with him ... frequently brilliant, sometimes insane, usually intense ... always a factor.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike the {{previous}} album, which involved creating [...] "microloops" [...] that involved building up one-bar samples into multiple bars {{that would make}} up a full song, Palomo said that in composing this album, he recorded a riff from a sound he made and tried to [...] "keep that momentum up". On Era Extraña, {{in order to develop}} ideas he was having while recording the record, it was necessary for him to have more control of the effects and instruments he was using for the album. Making the album helped him learn how to create synth sounds and become a [...] "gear geek", instead of relying on presets as he did with his previous works. He said, [...] "The more tedious aspects of production do have the capacity to take the wind out of your sails, so <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> navigate through that as quickly as you can before you start feeling burnt on the song, before you forget that initial spark that made you even want to write it in the first place".|$|E
2500|$|Production on K.I.S.S. was {{primarily}} handled by local Cleveland native producer Young Yonny with additional contributions from Japanese musicians Jeff Miyahara and Daisuke Imai, Chuck Harmony and longtime collaborators Carvin & Ivan. As always {{and just as}} she did before with her last 3 independently—released projects, Mýa took full creative control of the album. Harrison lent {{a hand in the}} songwriting process; co-writing several of the album's tracks with many different artists and songwriters and served as executive producer to the project. Guest features included Miami rapper Trina, international recording artist Iyaz, reggae star Sean Paul and ex Immature frontman Marques Houston. The album is a representation of Mýa's life today. [...] "It's about being cool and drama-free. And everything I do reflects that," [...] she said in a recent interview. [...] "The people that I associate with, the circle that I keep is real simple and sometimes we think or we're trained to believe that <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have more, more, more to make ourselves feel happy or beautiful, but it's the other way around for me. Simplicity is sexy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an MTV News {{interview}} with Simpson on December 18, 2007, Simpson {{said that the}} album's title would be Bittersweet World, also {{the name of one}} of the album's songs; she said that she had also considered the title Color Outside the Lines, a line from the song [...] "Rule Breaker". She described the title Bittersweet World as reflecting how she [...] "feel about the world right now" [...] and later said that the song [...] "Bittersweet World" [...] is [...] "basically about how with the bad comes the good in pretty much every situation and vice versa. There are hard things, but <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find the positive." [...] Simpson did the photoshoot for the album with photographer Ben Watts in Los Angeles. The photoshoot took place while Simpson still had blonde hair; she subsequently dyed it red in January 2008. Simpson described the style of the photoshoot as [...] "street-oriented" [...] and referred to the importance of having the photoshoot reflect herself, the album, and what she experienced while recording it. Some of the shots were done in a studio, while others were done outside at Venice Beach.|$|E

There are pirates and Frenchmen, and there are Spaniards, whom I regard as a cross between the other two.

The worst of them are what they call mulattoes; they are a whity-brown sort of chaps, neither one thing nor the other, and a nice cut-throat lot they are. A sailor who drinks too much and loses his boat is as like as not to be murdered by some of them before morning. I hate them chaps like poison. There are scores of small craft manned by them which prey upon the negroes, who are an honest, merry lot, and not bad sailors either in their way. Sometimes four or five of these pirate craft will go together, {{and many of them are}} a good size and carry a lot of guns. They make some island their head-quarters. Any niggers there may be on it they turn into slaves. There are thousands of these islands, so at least I should say, scattered about, some of them mere sand-spots, others a goodish size.|$|E
