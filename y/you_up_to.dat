It {{was said that}} he [...] "could {{not bring himself to}} study for {{professional}} work" [...] after [...] "having led a sort of nomadic life when a youth in Australia". Suffering from homesickness, he decorated his study with objects to remind him of Lexington, including Aboriginal weapons. Horatio wrote to Tom about the latter's friends, the Djab wurrung: [...] "They told me to send <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> them as soon as you came back." ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Campling of The Times {{said that}} Fry was smug, [...] "but {{then he has}} a lot to be smug about, not least the ability to waffle for 30 to 45 minutes about not very much without being boring or condescending."

500|$|Minaj {{commented that}} of the album's limited availability, [...] "it's {{hard to get the}} album because the stores {{basically}} said that the last few re-releases [...] had put out did not do well and they didn't want to take a chance. Target and Wal-Mart are not selling the album, and Target is actually my biggest retailer. Best Buy only took limited [...] because they wanted to play it safe. It kinda sets <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> fail." [...] Walmart responded that they do not issue albums with the Parental Advisory label, while Target sold the record on their website anyway.|$|E
500|$|As the {{battering}} continued, even Cotton chided her, {{and while}} concerns from the congregation brought pause to the ministers, the momentum still remained with them. [...] When the final {{points of order}} were addressed, {{it was left to}} Wilson to deliver the final blow: [...] "The Church consentinge to it we will proced to excommunication." [...] He then continued, [...] "Forasmuch as you, Mrs. Hutchinson, have highly transgressed and offended...and troubled the Church with your Errors and have drawen away many a poor soule, and have upheld your Revelations; and forasmuch as you have made a Lye...Therefor in the name of our Lord Je Ch...I doe cast you out and...deliver <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Sathan...and account you from this time forth to be a Hethen and a Publican...I command you in the name of Ch Je and of this Church as a Leper to withdraw your selfe out of the Congregation." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Some {{people find}} their shtick," [...] Ledger {{reflected}} on the categorization of style.

2500|$|In August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales {{said in a}} BBC {{interview}} that the Wikimedia Foundation was [...] "... really doubling down our efforts ..." [...] to reach 25% of female editors (originally targeted by 2015), since the Foundation had [...] "totally failed" [...] so far. Wales said [...] "a lot of things need to happen ... a lot of outreach, a lot of software changes". Andrew Lih, writing in The New York Times, was quoted by Bloomberg News in December 2016 as supporting Wales comments concerning shortfalls in Wikipedia's outreach to female editors. Lih states his concern with the question indicating that: [...] "How can you get people {{to participate in an}} (editing) environment that feels unsafe, where identifying yourself as a woman, as a feminist, could open <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> ugly, intimidating behavior".|$|E

2500|$|The {{title of}} the album comes from the lyrics to a then {{unreleased}} Swans song entitled [...] "Oxygen" [...] (which was later released on To Be Kind) that depicts Gira dying and ascending to Heaven and several reviewers have noted spiritual themes on the album. Tiny Mix Tapes sums up its review with, [...] "The real bravery is for an album whose title equates religion with suicide to end almost {{at the other end}} of the spectrum: 'Teach me please, to cease to resist,' Gira asks. 'May I find my way to the reason to come home/ May I find my way to the foot of your throne.'" [...] Gira's interest in spirituality developed with this album and his goal was to create music, [...] "to elevate, to make you levitate, almost like having it erase your body and lift <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Heaven." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{permission}} of the court, Hutchinson was allowed to spend the week at the home of Cotton, where Reverend Davenport was also staying. [...] All week, the two ministers worked with her, and under their supervision she had written out a formal recantation of her unsound opinions that brought objection from all the ministers. [...] She stood at the next meeting, on Thursday, 22 March and read her recantation to the congregation. [...] Following more accusations, the proposal was made for excommunication, and the silence of the congregation allowed it to proceed. [...] Wilson delivered the final address, [...] "Forasmuch as you, Mrs. Hutchinson, have highly transgressed and offended... and troubled the Church with your Errors and have drawen away many a poor soule, and have upheld your Revelations; and forasmuch as you have made a Lye...
