500|$|Bloody Fun Day {{received}} {{a positive response}} from video game critics. Psychotronic, reviewer for Jay is Games, called it [...] "an exceptionally well-crafted and deep game" [...] and [...] "refreshingly original", saying the developer [...] "gets more interesting with every new title". Kotaku Australia's David Wildgoose stated the game is [...] "rather addictive". Vue Weekly writer Darren Zenko stated that the game is addictive, finding himself playing for more than 8 hours in a day. Psychotronic disliked the lack of variety in levels, due to only one island shape being available and no enemies being present. He also highlighted the lack of special effects when using the reapers' abilities, since Cuties all die using the same animation {{regardless of whether they}} are killed with a reaper's scythe or a special ability. Despite this, Psychotronic praised the game's special abilities in terms of balance and interest, stating that the [...] "three different families of powers support each other, making it feel like <b>your</b> <b>efforts</b> in one area can always be redirected to another." ...|$|E
500|$|Reilly further {{added that}} the renewal was also {{prompted}} by the high risk of trying to replace Fringe with another show with unknown viewership metrics; he commented that they [...] "have a far better shot of sticking with a show that has an audience that [...] think [...] can grow". Prior to {{the onset of the}} fourth season, Reilly reiterated that they do not expect any significant growth in Fringes viewership within that season: [...] "It’s a pretty complex show. If Fringe can do exactly what Fringe did last year, we’re going to be very happy. They’re right in the pocket creatively once again." [...] Wyman stated in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the Fox network had been [...] "supportive throughout this process", and though the show's viewership [...] "wasn't exactly what they would've hoped for", aspects such as a loyal fan base and supportive critics were enough to take the show forward for another season. Pinkner commented that [...] "there were no creative conditions" [...] on the show's renewal, nor any cuts in the show's budget, though was unsure if the show will be moved to a different time slot. Noble, at the 2011 Comic-Con Fringe panel, reiterated that the fans were responsible for the livelihood of the show, stated, [...] "Seriously, without <b>your</b> <b>efforts,</b> your rabid support, we wouldn’t be here right now. You are the best fans that ever existed". The fourth season premiered on September 23, 2011.|$|E

500|$|Age of Empires III, {{released}} on October 18, 2005, {{was built on}} an improved version of the Age of Mythology game engine with the most significant changes being the updated graphics engine and {{the inclusion of the}} Havok physics middleware engine. The game is set in the period between 1421 and 1850, and players can choose one of eight European nations. The game introduced a large number of features, such as home cities. Described by Ensemble Studios as [...] "an important support system to <b>your</b> <b>efforts</b> in the New World," [...] home cities helped provide the player with resources, equipment, troops, and upgrades. They could be used across multiple games, and upgraded after each battle; it was compared to a role-playing game character by Ensemble Studios. The first expansion to Age of Empires III, The WarChiefs, was released October 17, 2006. Most gameplay changes in the expansion pack were small, but it introduced three new civilizations, with a focus on Native Americans. Most notable was the introduction of the [...] unit. The second expansion, The Asian Dynasties, went on sale October 23, 2007. It was a jointly developed product; Big Huge Games helped Ensemble Studios develop the game, with Brian Reynolds joining Bruce Shelley as lead designer. The game expanded the Age of Empires III universe into Asia, and introduced three new civilizations. Reception towards Age of Empires III was mixed; Game Revolution described it as [...] "about as much fun" [...] as a history textbook, while GameZone argued it was [...] "one of the best looking games, much less an RTS game, that is out on the market currently". It sold more than two million copies, and won the GameSpy [...] "real-time strategy game of the year" [...] award. The WarChiefs failed to equal the success of its predecessor, with a lower score on both Game Rankings and Metacritic, and The Asian Dynasties score was lower still with 80%.|$|E

Ribbentrop hoped that recognizing Wang would be seen as a coup that might add to the prestige of the pro-German Japanese Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka, who was opposed to opening American-Japanese talks. Despite Ribbentrop's best efforts, Matsuoka was sacked as foreign minister later in July 1941, and the Japanese-American talks began.|$|E
