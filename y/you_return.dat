500|$|Abbott is the {{inventor}} of a style of maze called logic mazes. A logic maze has a set of rules, ranging from the basic (such as [...] "you cannot make left turns") to the extremely complicated. These mazes are also called [...] "Multi-State mazes". [...] The reason for this name is that sometimes you can return to a position you were in before, but be traveling in a different direction. That change in direction can {{put you in a}} different state and open up different choices for you. One example, from the book SuperMazes, would be a rolling-die maze. Where you can move from a particular square depends on what number is facing up on the die. If <b>you</b> <b>return</b> to that same square, the die may be in a different state, with a different number on top. Thus, you would have different options than the first time.|$|E

He asked which of them wanted the islands but Thorir said the decision {{was up to the}} earl himself. Rognvald predicted that Thorir's path would keep him in Norway and that Hrolluag was destined seek his fortune in Iceland. Einarr, the youngest of the natural sons, then came forward and offered to go to the islands.

500|$|While reassuring Thompson and Maguire that he {{was only}} repudiating the idea that he had given his country away, and not the {{concession}} itself (which he told them would be respected), Lobengula asked Maund to accompany two of his izinDuna, Babayane and Mshete, to England, so they could meet Queen Victoria herself, officially to present to her a letter bemoaning Portuguese incursions on eastern Mashonaland, but also unofficially to seek counsel regarding the crisis at Bulawayo. The mission was furthermore motivated by the simple desire of Lobengula and his izinDuna to see if this white queen, whose name the British swore by, really existed. The king's letter concluded with a request for the Queen to send a representative of her own to Bulawayo. Maund, who saw a second chance to secure his own concession, perhaps even at Rudd's expense, said he was more than happy to assist, but Lobengula remained cautious with him: when Maund raised the subject of a new concession covering the Mazoe valley, the king replied [...] "Take my men to England for me; and when <b>you</b> <b>return,</b> then I will talk about that."
