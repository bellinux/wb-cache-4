500|$|Sorkin {{fought with}} the ABC network during the first season {{over the use of}} a laugh track and a live studio audience. The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with Joyce Millman of Salon.com {{describing}} it as [...] "the most unconvincing laugh track you've ever heard". Sorkin commented that: [...] "Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, you {{have no choice but to}} use the laugh track. Oftentimes [...] is the right thing to do. Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> a cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me." [...] The laugh track was gradually dialed down and was gone by the end of the first season. Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse.|$|E

[...] Even as a preview in The One Amiga called it a [...] "game set to rival even the mightiest of American adventures," [...] the magazine's David Upchurch wrote that [...] "the game lacks real humour and atmosphere. This may be {{partly due to the}} lack of text in the game - it's hard to relate to the characters you meet," [...] and [...] "although entertaining, Curse of Enchantia is to Monkey Island 2 what Smash is to mashed potato," [...] that is [...] "just a weaker substitute." [...] Lee Perkins of The Age opined that [...] "Curse of Enchantia might be seen as a mite disappointing by fantasy gamers with moderately sophisticated tastes." [...] PC Gamer UK described it an [...] "average generic fare" [...] as [...] "the graphics are pretty" [...] but the game [...] "lacks atmosphere and feels too much like a succession of annoyingly vague puzzles rather than an adventure story." ...|$|E

It was easier in the past when grants were available from one's local authority even for the post university stage. The law is an extremely competitive profession as was emphasised by all our panellists. To succeed, you do not necessarily need a first from Oxbridge. What is required is a belief in yourself, passion, integrity, honesty, persistence and a capacity for hard work. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> as many mentors as you can muster and all our panellists made themselves available to aspiring lawyers in need of help in this regard. A degree in law continues to be highly sort after and valued by employers. Young lawyers should therefore be ready to be innovative and creative in the use of their valuable training as legal professionals." ...|$|E

According to Teo Chee Hean, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence at that time, he stated that the unit's establishment was needed because Singapore is not [...] "dealing only with people with guns. They may be dealing {{with people who have}} very powerful explosives and various kinds of other substances, chemical, radiological and so on, so you need to develop capabilities to deal with these things.

60|$|Polyphemus had {{an eye for}} business; it was in {{the middle}} of his forehead. It served him admirably for the only two duties which are demanded in a modern {{financier}} and captain of industry: the two duties of counting sheep and of eating men. But when that one eye was put out he was done for. But the Scotch are not one-eyed practical men, though their best friends must admit that they are occasionally business-like. They are, quite fundamentally, romantic and sentimental, and this is proved by the very economic argument that is used to prove their harshness and hunger for the material. The mass of Scots have accepted the industrial civilisation, with its factory chimneys and its famine prices, with its steam and smoke and steel&mdash;and strikes. The mass of the Irish have not accepted it. The mass of the Irish have clung to agriculture with claws of iron; and have succeeded in keeping it. That is because the Irish, though far inferior to the Scotch in art and literature, are hugely superior to them in practical politics. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> to be very romantic to accept the industrial civilisation. It does really require all the old Gaelic glamour to make men think that Glasgow is a grand place. Yet the miracle is achieved; and while I was in Glasgow I shared the illusion. I have never had the faintest illusion about Leeds or Birmingham. The industrial dream suited the Scots. Here was a really romantic vista, suited to a romantic people; a vision of higher and higher chimneys taking hold upon the heavens, of fiercer and fiercer fires in which adamant could evaporate like dew. Here were taller and taller engines that began already to shriek and gesticulate like giants. Here were thunderbolts of communication which already flashed to and fro like thoughts. It was unreasonable to expect the rapt, dreamy, romantic Scot to stand still in such a whirl of wizardry to ask whether he, the ordinary Scot, would be any the richer.|$|E

50|$|The Rex engine is, however, stoically {{consistent}} and reliable. Always a reliable starter under all conditions and {{a reliable and}} consistent runner, though <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> time on your side to enjoy the docile character of the machine. The low maximum speed is compensated for to some extent by a good fuel consumption of 180 - 200 mpg. In common with most British-built two-stroke machines of the time, the petroil mixture ratio recommended is a little cautious erring on the 'oily' side at 16:1 using self-mixing two-stroke oil (16 parts of petrol to 1 part oil). The manual advises stretching it to 20:1 if using SAE20 motor engine oil. This British tendency to add rather more oil than the Continentals gave two-strokes a 'blue smokey exhaust' reputation in the UK but the Panda exhaust is not particularly smokey.|$|E
