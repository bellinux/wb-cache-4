40|$|This article {{originated}} {{in some years}} of feminist activism, and a sustained effort to understand two sentences spoken by Evelina Giobbe, an antiprostitution activist and educator, at a radical feminist conference in 1987. She said: 2 ̆ 2 Prostitution isn 2 ̆ 7 t like anything else. Rather, everything else is like prostitution {{because it is the}} model for women 2 ̆ 7 s condition. 2 ̆ 2 Since that time, I have listened to those sentences echo in my mind, as if they wanted to teach me something I could not yet understand but needed to. I believe now that my perplexity arose, perversely, from my own commitments as a lawyer and activist in support of women in prostitution: not, it seemed, from the commitment part, but from the lawyer part. Thinking from within prevailing discourses of feminist legal theory and law reform strategies, I found myself precluded from any adequate engagement with, much less response to, Giobbe 2 ̆ 7 s analysis.

40|$|Abstract This is a {{story about}} the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme and his {{struggle}} against USA´s war in Vietnam in the late 60 ´s and the early 70 ´s. We follow the young Palme from his childhood to his travels to America and Asia, there he learns what true poverty means. Further we see Palme change side from his conservative background to a new social idealist. In Prag he learns to truly mistrust communism, an ideology he later in life paradoxical will be accused to stand for. Palme´s politic interests seems to take a great step forward when he starts to write articles in the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, there he’s writings take more and more colour from Palme´s own politic stands. After a few years, in 1969, he finally becomes the new Prime Minister of Sweden. When USA´s regime start to drop bombs over the little farm-nation Vietnam, the whole world reacts. In the West-world, Palme will take the leading role against this horrible war, something that creates a major diplomatic conflict between Sweden and USA. In this essay, I will also let <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Swedish opinion, through editorials from some major daily Swedish newspapers. Hopefully these editorials opinions will reflect rest of the Swedish people’s thoughts and therefore give you a picture of the climate of the Swedes contra the Vietnam-war...|$|E
40|$|A {{little about}} me: I {{go to an}} {{environmental}} liberal arts College called Northland and I’m majoring in mathematics and environmental studies with an emphasis in natural sciences. As a mathematics major, I felt that this summer I should do something ”mathy”- and here I am! At the University of Minnesota doing number theory. Which is interesting because [...] . I have never done number theory before! I came with curious (yet unfocused) enthusiasm to this summer math program. After the first lecture I decided I needed to learn some basics. This is what I like to call ”Phase I ” of my summer project: learn some elementary number theory. I picked up a number theory book and {{took a look at}} some other books that touched on number theory, and came across one that my dad got me for Christmas just this last year. It’s called In Code by Sarah Flannery. I {{was surprised to find that}} it was FULL of (you guessed it!) number theory! But even better, it went into the field of cryptology and how you can apply number theory (if you want a really good basic introduction to crypto I suggest <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this book- seriously.). Now I’m one of those people who like to be able to use the utlra-cool mathy things that they know, so this was just beautiful. A cool math thing that I was doing, and a way to use it. ”Phase I ” just got expanded to include basics of crypto. But wait, there’s more...|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{readings}} for this course are empirical studies of {{some aspect of}} economic life. Their authors began with an idea or theory they wanted to examine, and they designed a study that would let them field-test this idea in the real world. The paper requirement for this course asks that you do much {{the same sort of}} thing yourself, on a smaller scale. This memo is meant to briefly clarify some of the principles that guide the empirical research that sociologists do, and to discuss some of the methods they use to do it. You’ll probably use one of these methods to collect the data for your paper. First we’ll {{look at some of the}} basic concepts that guide empirical research. Then we’ll discuss four methods — surveys, interviews, participant observation and documentary analysis. What does a research paper look like? The best ones ask a well-defined and interesting research question; they present competing hypotheses drawn from more general theories; and they test these hypotheses against good empirical data that have been collected using some systematic method. 1 ∗Email at kjhealy@u. arizona. edu. Originally written (by me) as a handout for Soc 212, Social Relations in the Economy, taught at Princeton by Viviana Zelizer. I have rewritten it somewhat to help it stand on its own. 1 This memo draws in part on some ideas presented in Designing Social Inquiry: sci-entific inference in qualitative research by Gary King et al. (Princeton University Press 1994). This is an informative and accessible book that you might find useful to read in more detail. Chapters 1, 4 and 5 are especially worth reading.

Booth et al., The Craft of Research (Chicago 1995), and Howard Becker’s Tricks of the Trade: how to think about your research while you’re doing it (Chicago 1998). Throughout the memo, references to works mentioned in each section will be found in a footnote like this one at the end of that section. Papers and books discussed in the text are taken from the syllabus for the course. ...|$|E
