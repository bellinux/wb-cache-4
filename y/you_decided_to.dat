It depicts violence {{in a most}} compelling way: You don't see it. You just feel it." [...] Bob Wisehart of The Sacramento Bee said, [...] "The {{bottom line is that}} while NYPD Blue is a fine show [...] it was on my 10-best list for 1993 [...] Homicide is better. There's been nothing like it since the heyday of Hill Street Blues." [...] Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, who called Homicide [...] "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from NYPD Blue, and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in [...] "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "If [...] is what it took to get you to watch NYPD Blue and <b>you</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that Homicide is so far superior to NYPD Blue in all those categories that if you're not , you're missing the best hour of episodic television since Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere left the air." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{group that}} most {{characterized}} London streets were beggars and vagrants. The broad eighteenth-century definition for beggar embraced {{not just the}} poorest people having {{to live on the}} street, but virtually anyone who would stop you asking for money, work, or offering you a service such as: shoe cleaners, linkboys, milkmaids, chimney sweeps, etc. Begging was quite an art, the way you held your body, the sores you showed or not showed, the tone of the voice, your gender and age, the time of the year, the narrative strategies <b>you</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> adopt, all these elements affected the way you begged and had to be consider carefully. Moreton regards beggars and vagrants as potential criminals in disguise and affirms that they [...] "should be suppressed, who lounge about all day, to see where they can steal at night" [...] and that [...] "all shoe-cleaners, I mean boys and sturdy vagrants, be suppressed, [...] as for link-boys, alias thieves with lights". Shoeblacks are a peculiar example of a vagrant occupation. Established as an employment {{at the end of the}} seventeenth-century, shoe cleaning provided a perfect excuse for approaching passers-by without incurring a penalty.|$|E

Night Shyamalan movies, several which are situated in Philadelphia. Working with a scouting agent that assisted on the Philadelphia film, Cage and his team visited the city, taking {{in many of the}} poorer neighborhoods and meeting with the residents there to capture the despair, poverty, and fear they saw. Cage has also stated that [...] "I would like people to play it once…because that's life. Life you can only play once... I would like people to have this experience that way." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I'm fine with , but the right way to enjoy Heavy Rain is really to make one thing because it's going to be your story. It's going to be unique to you. It's really the story <b>you</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> write... I think playing it several times is also a way to kill the magic of it."
