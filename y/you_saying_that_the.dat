Allison Stewart with the Washington Post compared the album to its predecessor, Keep On Loving <b>You,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album [...] "tries harder, with worse results; McEntire and her collaborators aim for Carrie Underwood and too often wind up with warmed-over Shania Twain". On a positive note, she called her version of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] "fantastic". Thom Jurek with Allmusic gave the release a 2½ rating, saying [...] "Everything, from songs and arrangements to production tries hard to sound on the contemporary edge, but comes off as underscoring that Underwood has the corner on this sound [...] ultimately, All the Women I Am falls flat; it feels awkward in its stylistic mimicry, and has no center".|$|E

"The younger chief {{pleaded for}} <b>you,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mitche Manitou had {{stricken}} you with madness, {{as could be}} seen by your swimming to their canoe, and that a blight would fall upon the nation if you were led to the stake. But this Bastard said that love came often like madness among the pale-faces, {{and that it was}} that alone which had driven you. Then it was agreed that you should die and that she should go to his wigwam, since he had led the war-party. As for me, their hearts were bitter against me, and I also am to die by the pine splinters." ...|$|E

Would you wish to perform midshipman's duties also? I have asked him what are his wishes in the matter, and he left it entirely with <b>you,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> very nominal pay of a midshipman was really no remuneration for {{the services of a}} gentleman capable of interpreting in three or four languages, but that as the rules of the service made no provision for the engagement of an interpreter, except under special circumstances, and as you said that you did not think it likely you should make the sea your profession, you might not care to undertake midshipman's duties in addition to those of interpreter." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, it {{was your}} turn, Lieutenant Glover. You have come back three times more or less {{severely}} hurt already. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> brigantine is fast?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was still}} {{all of the}} next day," [...] said Sir Harry. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{prisoner}} was never out of your sight on that day too?" ...|$|R

"'O King,' I said, 'beneath those {{footfall}} {{the whole}} earth shakes, whose arms stretch {{round the world}} and whose breath is the storm, I, whose name is John, am sent by the white man whose name is Messenger'--for by that title you bade me make you known--'who for a year has dwelt in the land that your spears have wasted beyond {{the banks of the}} river. These are the words which he spoke to me, O King, that I pass on to you with my tongue: [...] "To the King Umsuka, lord of the Amasuka, the Sons of Fire, I, Messenger, who am the servant and the ambassador of the King of Heaven, give greeting. A year ago, King, I sent to <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> message which was brought by that white man whom you drove from your land had reached the ears of Him whom I serve, the High and Holy One, and that, speaking in my heart, He had commanded me to take up the challenge of your message. Here am I, therefore, ready to abide by the law which you have laid down; for if guile or lies be found in me, then let me travel from your land across the bridge of spears. Still, I would dwell a little while here where I am before I pass into the shadow of your rule and speak in the ears of your people as I have been bidden. Know, King, that first I would learn your tongue, and therefore I demand that one of your people may be sent to dwell with me and to teach me that tongue. King, you heard my words and you sent me a man to dwell with me, and that man has taught me your tongue, and I also have taught him, converting him to my faith and giving him a new name, the name of John. King, now I seek your leave to visit you, and to deliver into your ears the words with which I, Messenger, am charged. I have spoken."' ...|$|E

Stanisław Hadyna, a witness of the session, asked then: What are you talking about? Are <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese-American war will complete the Polish-German war? This is absurd. Pilchowa did not answer, and kept on talking: I do not understand what it is. I see something terrible. It is a giant mushroom, made of clouds, which is growing in the skies. Where is it? What is it? Then {{she opened her eyes}} widely and said that it was impossible: It will result in the death of the planet, she added.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, count. It {{is but a}} small clue {{with which}} to {{commence}} my search, but {{it is at least}} something. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> palace itself has been searched?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Say, I'm {{not quite}} sure I follow you," [...] Mr. Bundercombe observed. [...] "I am with you all right when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> direct pecuniary payment for being in Parliament doesn't amount to anything; but what's your pull worth, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> general {{would hardly}} {{be able to do}} anythin' of the kind?" [...] I asked. [...] "Surely to one so high in command Brant would listen, when he might refuse even to speak with one of less rank." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'That {{it is my}} fault. Before our marriage, you and {{she were}} {{the whole world to}} each other; but since I came, I have seen, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> craving for work was strong, and I fear it actuates her more than she knows.' ...|$|R

6000|$|I have {{therefore}} {{shown that}} a layman may be equitably seized of Church lands,--2. of tithes,--3. of exemption from tithes; and you will not contend {{that there should be}} no prescription.

6000|$|... "Exactly; {{and because}} you know him to be high-minded, because you think that he, having so much to give, will not break his word to you--to you who have nothing to give in return--it is, therefore, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first step must be taken by him.

"Which he will {{very soon}} be, my love," [...] said Mrs Dotropy, [...] "for he {{is sure to}} be splendidly nursed, now he has got back to his old {{quarters}} with these admirable Miss Seawards.

6000|$|... "Don't <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> Mr. Greenwood.
