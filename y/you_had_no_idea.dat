500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what he was or {{what he was going}} to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E
500|$|The Gunnerkrigg Court webcomic is told in {{a series}} of episodic {{chapters}} such that each, while forming part of the overall storyline, also functions individually as a stand-alone story arc."Each of the chapters individually is sort of a self-contained thing, so if you were to just read one of them it wouldn't be like <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what was going on." [...] The themes and topics of the chapters vary widely: as one reviewer describes, [...] "You are also not subjected to 400-plus pages of intricate plot movement. While there is an overall story arc, there are also lighter chapters that focus on unusual classes ... or small moments that build the main characters." [...] Each chapter begins with a title page and ends with one or more [...] "bonus pages," [...] which are not integral to the main storyline but often offer ancillary details about the world of Gunnerkrigg Court or about minor characters. [...] The chapters have varied in length from four pages to more than eighty. [...] Each page is drawn in traditional (A4; 210 × 297mm) page format and divided arbitrarily into frames. At the bottom of the most recent page is a link to a comments thread for that page, in which readers may comment on and discuss that day's comic.|$|E

To be scientific one must have an opponent who observes at least the more important rules of the ring.

I pointed out to Miss Wendermott that you were in the prime of life and in magnificent condition, while her father was already on the threshold of the grave and drinking himself into a fever in a squalid hut in a village of swamps. I told her that I suspected foul play, that I followed you both and found her father left to the tender mercies of the savages, deserted by you in the bush. I told her that many months afterwards he disappeared, simultaneously with your arrival in the country, that a day or two ago you swore to me <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> where he was.

About half the set I'd be whispering to John, I'd be saying, 'Hey, man, what key are we in?' Howard didn't have tunings or anything, he just played.

50|$|Arkanoid vs Space Invaders {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, with reviews praising the amalgamation of Arkanoid and Space Invaders, and ditching the free-to-play model of mobile applications. The game currently has an 87% score on Metacritic. Eli Hodapp of Touch Arcade states that “the Arkanoid and Space Invaders universes have been duct taped {{together in a}} way that actually works quite well” and that it is “A super-solid brick breaker with an interesting twist and no freemium shenanigans”. Chris Shilling of Waypoint describes the game as “Crisp and colorful with an energetic EDM soundtrack, Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders is a fizzy, addictive treat—like a bag of cola bottles but with slightly more nutritional value, and all for roughly the price of a London pint”. Jennifer Allen of Game Zebo commented by saying that “Arkanoid and Space Invaders is one of those perfectly shrewd moves that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> could work so well until, well, it did. Partly skills based and partly a puzzle game, it’s a delightful combination of two iconic classics. Even better, you won’t have to suffer the scourge of in-app purchases to enjoy it.”, however, she did criticise the boss battles by stating that they “Are somewhat lackluster, never quite fulfilling their potential”. Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer described Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders as “a mash up of two of Taito's old arcade franchises. And it's actually pretty interesting. There's bouncing, there are blocks, there are waves of alien invaders trying to destroy the cosmos. While that might sound like a silly mish mash, there's actually a decent amount of cohesion here”. CJ Andrissen of Destructoid praised the game by stating that it is “One of the best mobile games of the year” and that “There is just so much game here to enjoy and with no ads, no microtransactions, and no need to always be connected to the internet, Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders is missing most of the red flags people wave when dismissing the mobile marketplace. It isn’t the best version of Space Invaders out there but it is the best version of Arkanoid currently available”.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Every {{beginning}} real analysis student learns {{the classic}} Heine-Borel theorem, that the interval [0, 1] is compact. In this article, {{we present a}} proof of this result that doesn’t involve the standard techniques such as constructing a sequence and appealing to the completeness of the reals. We put a metric on the space of infinite binary sequences and prove that compactness of this space follows from a simple combinatorial lemma. The Heine-Borel theorem is an immediate corollary. 1. The Heine-Borel theorem Think back to your first real analysis class. In the beginning, most of the definitions were fairly straightforward. Open and closed sets made sense, because of the common usage of open and closed intervals in previous math classes. It was a bit odd that open sets could also be closed, or that sets could be neither open nor closed. But this was “higher math,” so you could let that one slide. Then came the definition of “compact. ” Completely out of nowhere. Why anyone would ever find themselves with an open cover, let alone try to extract a finite subcover, was beyond your wildest dreams. As you sat there in class {{trying to figure out}} what this really meant, the professor wrote the following two sentences on the board, with “Heine-Borel ” preceding one of them. 1 • The interval [0, 1] is compact. • A subset of R n is compact iff it is closed and bounded. You might remember what came next. From an arbitrary infinite sequence contained in [0, 1], a divide-and-conquer technique to construct a particular sequence of nested intervals, from this a subsequence of real numbers, and then a summon to the completeness of the reals, one of those blatantly obvious analysis facts that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how to prove (and likely still don’t know). It felt a little unsatisfying, and almost seemed like cheating. About this time, it dawned on you that your roommate was right: mathematicians make a living saying the simplest things in the most difficult round-about way. By now, you understand in ways you never could have imagined back then, how wise your old roommate was. But you also remember what attracted you to mathematics in the first place, those mysterious qualities that, like the silver bell in the Polar Express, coul...|$|E
