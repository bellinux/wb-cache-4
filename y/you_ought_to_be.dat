I say that you, Ruth Tredgett, {{have been a}} most discreditable person, and <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heartily ashamed of yourself, Ruth Tredgett; and as a clergymen of the Church of England I feel bound to tell you that—that your life has been—has been what God knows it couldn't well have helped being under the circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Lansbury {{found little}} support in his fight for women's {{suffrage}} from [...] his parliamentary Labour colleagues, whom he dismissed as [...] "a weak, flabby lot". In parliament, he denounced the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, for the cruelties being inflicted on imprisoned suffragists: [...] "You are beneath contempt... <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> driven from public life". He was temporarily {{suspended from the}} House for [...] "disorderly conduct". In October 1912, aware of the unbridgeable gap between his own position {{and that of his}} Labour colleagues, Lansbury resigned his [...] seat to fight a by-election in Bow and Bromley on the specific issue of women's suffrage. [...] He [...] lost to his Conservative opponent, who [...] campaigned on the slogan [...] "No Petticoat Government". Commenting on the result, the Labour MP Will Thorne opined that no constituency could ever be won on the single question of votes for women.|$|E

500|$|Postmodern {{cultural}} critic bell hooks {{cited the}} interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple {{as one of}} the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment of blackness in American film. In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that [...] "he best thing about Mystery Train is that it takes you to an America you feel <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to find for yourself, if you only knew where to look." [...] He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was [...] "as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance".|$|E
500|$|Around this period, the Ravens {{decided on}} a new, {{permanent}} name: the Kinks. Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In Jon Savage's analysis, they [...] "needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'—something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability. In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual—fame through outrage." [...] Manager Robert Wace related {{his side of the}} story: [...] "I had a friend... He thought the group was rather fun. If my memory is correct, he came up with the name just as an idea, as a good way of getting publicity... When we went to [...] with the name, they were... absolutely horrified. They said, 'We're not going to be called kinky! Ray Davies' account conflicts with Wace's—he recalled that the name was coined by Larry Page, and referenced their [...] "kinky" [...] fashion sense. Davies quoted him as saying, [...] "The way you look, and the clothes you wear, <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called the Kinks." [...] "I've never really liked the name", Ray stated.|$|E
500|$|During {{his four}} years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one {{reporter}} described as [...] "a strange love-hate relationship" [...] with Coach Bo Schembechler. Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a [...] "tough coach", and it was [...] "not easy at all" [...] playing for him. Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: [...] "Butch {{can be a real}} load." [...] By the 1981 season, Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk, saying: [...] "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country." [...] Woolfolk, too, concluded in the end that Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept after me. He kept saying I was getting too fancy. He kept saying, 'You're a big back, a fast back, and <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2007, Vladimir Putin visited Iran {{to discuss}} Russia's aid to Iran's nuclear power program and [...] "insisted {{that the use}} of force was unacceptable." [...] On October 17, Bush stated [...] "if you're {{interested}} in avoiding World War III, it seems like <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon," [...] understood as a message to Putin. A week later Putin compared U.S. plans to put up a missile defense system near Russia's border as analogous to when the Soviet Union deployed missiles in Cuba, prompting the Cuban Missile Crisis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{verdicts}} and {{the likelihood}} of death sentences immediately roused international opinion. Demonstrations were held in 60 Italian cities and a flood of mail was sent to the American embassy in Paris. Demonstrations followed in a number of Latin American cities. Anatole France, veteran of the campaign for Alfred Dreyfus and recipient of the 1921 Nobel Prize for Literature, wrote an [...] "Appeal to the American People": [...] "The death of Sacco and Vanzetti will make martyrs of them and cover you with shame. You are a great people. <b>You</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a just people." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Challenger, Greene {{chose to}} retire as a flight director. In October 1987, {{after a short}} period working with a study group on lunar exploration, he was {{appointed}} head of NASA's safety division. The division had been created after the Challenger accident at {{the recommendation of the}} Rogers Commission, which saw its establishment as key in creating a new, more vigorous [...] "safety culture" [...] at NASA. However, Greene feared that too much introspection by NASA engineers could lead to a damaging loss of confidence. In an interview a year later, he said that NASA had been on [...] "a fantastic guilt trip," [...] adding that [...] "I believe NASA has been overly eager to defend itself against all critics. Any time you have an independent panel, <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to name a defense attorney for the status quo." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Christian {{rock group}} Petra {{included}} in their song [...] "Judas Kiss", from the 1982 album More Power to Ya, the message, [...] "What {{are you looking}} for the devil for, when <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> looking for the Lord?" [...] Bloodhound Gang's 1996 controversy-begging track [...] "Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)" [...] mocked the Judas Priest controversy directly, and included the backmasked phrase [...] "Devil child, wake up and eat Chef Boyardee Beefaroni". The band Mindless Self Indulgence released a song titled [...] "Backmaskwarning!", which contains the forward lyrics [...] "Play that record backwards / Here's a message yo for the suckas / Play that record backwards / And go fuck yourself". The backwards messages in the song include, [...] "clean your room", [...] "do your homework", [...] "don't stay out too late", and [...] "eat your vegetables".|$|E
