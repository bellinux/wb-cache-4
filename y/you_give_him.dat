500|$|In the {{original}} script, Frink appeared more evil. However, when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed {{a voice for}} Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's character Julius Kelp from the 1963 film The Nutty Professor, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of that character. Julius Kelp is a nerdy, mad professor, albeit not evil, and is often unsuccessful with his experiments, so Frink became more like that as the show progressed. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told TV Guide that [...] "He was just written as a mad scientist character until Hank did the voice, and suddenly he became this nutty professor persona. What I love about Hank is that, <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a single lineand most of these characters have very few linesand he just brings it to life. Every time." [...] Frink was originally animated without his buckteeth; they were added later on {{to make him look}} even more like Lewis's character. He was named after television writer John Frink, who was later hired on The Simpsons. The nonsensical utterances that Frink makes are written in the scripts as [...] "Frink noise".|$|E

2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} when envious men and plunderers {{of the poor}} multiplied, there {{increased}} those who hardened their hearts and closed their hands from lending to the needy, and they transgressed what is written in [...] "Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart [...] [...] [...] and your eye be evil against your needy brother, and <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> nothing; and he cry unto the Lord against you, and it be sin in you.".

2500|$|Marlowe is {{adept at}} using liquor to loosen peoples' tongues. An example is in The High Window, when Marlowe finally persuades the detective-lieutenant, whose [...] "solid old face was lined and grey with fatigue", {{to take a}} drink and thereby loosen up and give out. [...] "Breeze looked at me very steadily. Then he sighed. Then he picked the glass up and tasted it and sighed again {{and shook his head}} {{sideways}} with a half smile; the way a man does when <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a drink and he needs it very badly and it is just right and the first swallow is like a peek into a cleaner, sunnier, brighter world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mishnah Sheviit chapter 10 and Tosefta Sheviit 8:3–11 {{interpreted}} [...] {{to address}} debts and the Sabbatical year. The Mishnah {{held that the}} Sabbatical year cancelled loans, whether they were secured by a bond or not, but did not cancel debts to a shopkeeper or unpaid wages of a laborer, unless these debts were made into loans. When Hillel saw people refraining from lending, in transgression of [...] he ordained the prosbul (...) , which ensured the repayment of loans notwithstanding the Sabbatical year. Citing the literal meaning of [...] — [...] "this is {{the word of the}} release" [...] — the Mishnah held that a creditor could accept payment of a debt notwithstanding an intervening Sabbatical year, if the creditor had first by word told the debtor that the creditor relinquished the debt. A prosbul prevents the remission of debts in the Sabbatical year. Hillel saw that people were unwilling to lend money to one another and disregarded the precept laid down in [...] "Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart saying, ‘The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand'; and your eye be evil against your needy brother, and <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> nothing," [...] and Hillel therefore decided to institute the prosbul. The text of the prosbul says: [...] "I hand over to you, So-and-so, the judges in such-and-such a place, my bonds, so that I may be able to recover any money owing to me from So-and-so at any time I shall desire."
