500|$|The head of British Secret Intelligence Service, Stewart Menzies, {{stated that}} Cicero {{was indeed a}} double agent and that among the {{documents}} submitted to the Germans were documents of misinformation. Author James Srodes states in his biography of Allen Dulles that some British historians believed that Cicero was [...] "'turned' into a double agent to send disinformation via von Papen". Malcolm Gladwell, author of Pandora's Briefcase, said that an interviewer had questioned Menzies before he died about whether {{he was telling the}} truth. Menzies told the interviewer [...] "Of course, Cicero was under our control," [...] but his truthfulness is questioned. Gladwell stated in an article in The New Yorker; [...] "if you had been the wartime head of M.I.6, giving an interview shortly before your death, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> say that Cicero was one of yours." [...] Gladwell also mentions that while Ribbentrop was wary of Bazna, which curtailed the dissemination of some of Bazna's intelligence, most German intelligence officials were not wary of him.|$|E
60|$|PRINCE PAUL. You {{ought to}} remember, too, Professor, {{that if you}} were seized, as <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> be, and hung, as you {{certainly}} would be, there would be nobody left to read your own articles.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} tell you what else I think of it because <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not understand. For you, M. Danton, {{there is at least}} this excuse that you did not know me. But you, Isaac--to bring this gentleman here with such a proposal!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} you {{believed}} it; but I am {{by no means}} convinced {{that you would be}} gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> do it, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> not go--and at another word, might stay a month." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As a psychical observer, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{investigate}} it in as impersonal {{a fashion}} as an astronomer investigates a wandering comet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. He arrived {{soon after}} Mr. Adair, sir, {{saying that he}} would wait, as <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> wish to see him shortly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even so. It {{would take}} too long to explain, and <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not understand. Besides, you might take it--really, you might take it for a declaration. But {{it has nothing to}} do with you personally; it's what you represent. Fortunately you don't know all that, or your conceit would {{increase}} insufferably." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it, Bowser, old boy? Did you see something?" [...] asked Farmer Brown's boy as {{he patted}} Bowser on the head. [...] "I can't let you go, you know, because <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> go off hunting {{all night and}} come home in the morning all tired out and with sore feet. Whatever it was, I guess you've scared {{it out of a}} year's growth, old fellow, so we'll let it go at that." ...|$|E
60|$|Danny Meadow Mouse sang this, or {{at least}} he tried to sing it, as he skipped about on the snow that covered the Green Meadows. But Danny Meadow Mouse has such a little voice, such a funny little squeaky voice, that had you been there <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> never have guessed that he was singing. He thought he was, though, and was enjoying it just as much as if he had the most {{beautiful}} voice in the world. You know singing is nothing in the world but happiness in the heart making itself heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sowerby {{said that}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{have to pay}} ten pounds to redeem it. I should offer the man some such sum as that." ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE. I think <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{have told}} me when we were married: {{it would have been}} a {{convenient}} weapon to break me in with.|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> like it better, however, than Lyons: {{which you}} may reach, if you will, {{in one of}} the before-mentioned steamboats, in eight hours.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was nothing," [...] {{answered}} Victoria, {{in a low}} voice. [...] "Or, rather, it {{was something}} I shall always be glad that I did not miss. I have seen Mr. Vane all my life, but I never=-never really knew him until that day. I {{have come to the}} conclusion," [...] she added, in a lighter tone, [...] "that the young are not always the best judges of the old. There," [...] she added, [...] "is the path that goes to the kitchen, which <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have taken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is unfortunate, certainly, Dorothy. I {{had hoped}} {{we might have}} been able to have fixed you somewhere that would have proved {{conclusively}} that you could not possibly have been at Gilliat's that afternoon. As it is, your recollections do not help us at all, for your time from somewhere about three till six is practically unaccounted for. The people you bought the gloves and scent from could prove that you were there, but <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not have been many minutes in their shop. Cocks' may remember that you were there a quarter of an hour or so.' ...|$|E
60|$|When Peter Rabbit {{was once}} more safely {{back in the}} dear Old Briar-patch, he told Mrs. Peter all about poor Mrs. Quack and her troubles. Then for a long, long time {{he sat in a}} brown study. A brown study, you know, is sitting {{perfectly}} still and thinking very hard. That was what Peter did. He sat so still that if you had happened along, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have thought him asleep. But he wasn't asleep. No, indeed! He was just thinking and thinking. He was trying to think of some way to help Mrs. Quack. At last he gave a little sigh of disappointment.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you had {{not been}} in uniform, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have been shot down as spies, without the trouble of capture," [...] said Brant quietly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because Miss Terry {{told me that}} he was; {{she said}} that he was always proposing to you, and that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> marry him in the end." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Therefore as to your loving him, I really don't {{think there}} need be {{any doubt about}} that. Then, my dear, as to {{the other part of}} the arrangement,--the money and all that. If you were to have any children, your own fortune would be settled on them; at least, that could be arranged, if you {{required}} it; though, as your fortune all came from the Balls, and is the very money with which the title was intended to be maintained, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not be very exacting about that. Stop a moment, my dear, and let me finish before you speak. I want you particularly to think of what I say, and to remember that all your money did come from the Balls. It has been very hard upon John,--you must feel that. Look at him with his heavy family, and how he works for them!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{about your}} size, Jumper," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "If anything, he {{is a little}} bit heavier. But because his hair lies much {{smoother}} than yours, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> look a little bit bigger if you were sitting beside him. As with his cousin, the Marsh Rabbit, the hair on his feet is thin. His toes are rather long and he can spread them widely, which is a great help in swimming. He doesn't have to take to the water as his little cousin does, for he is a very good runner. But he does take to it as the easiest way of getting rid of those who are chasing him. The Marsh Rabbit and the Swamp Hare are the only members of your family in all the Great World who are fond of the water and who are at home in it. Now, who shall I tell you about?" ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, the East, the East! My {{husband has}} been almost frantic on the subject. We may all cover our heads and be humble.[40] Verily we have sinned deeply. As to ministers, that there is blame I do not doubt. The Aberdeen element has done its worst, but our misfortune is that nobody is responsible; and that if you tear up Mr. So-and-so and Lord So-and-so limb from limb, as a mild {{politician}} recommended the other day, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> do a gross injustice against very well-meaning persons. It's the system, the system which is all one gangrene; the most corrupt system in Europe, is it not? Here is my comfort. Apart from the dreadful amount of individual suffering which cries out against us to heaven and earth, this adversity may teach us much, this shock which has struck {{to the heart of}} England may awaken us much, and this humiliation will altogether be good for us. We have stood too long on a pedestal talking of our moral superiority, our political superiority, and all our other superiorities, which I have long been sick of hearing recounted. Here's an inferiority proved. Let us understand it and remedy it, and not talk, talk, any more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I almost {{think you}} owe Mr. Austin a little, too. If he hadn't stopped the Estremedura <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{have been in}} Madeira now." ...|$|R

60|$|DEAR SIR:--You {{know how}} anxious I am that this Nebraska measure shall be rebuked and {{condemned}} everywhere. Of course I hope something from your position; yet I {{do not expect}} you to do anything which may be wrong in your own judgment; nor would I have you do anything personally injurious to yourself. You are, and always have been, honestly and sincerely a Democrat; and I know how painful it must be to an honest, sincere man to be urged by his party to {{the support of a}} measure which in his conscience he believes to be wrong. You have had a severe struggle with yourself, and you have determined not to swallow the wrong. Is it not just to yourself that you should, in a few public speeches, state your reasons, and thus justify yourself? I wish you would; and yet I say, don't do it, if you think it will injure you. You may have given your word to vote for Major Harris; and if so, of course you will stick to it. But allow me to suggest that you should avoid speaking of this; for it probably would induce some of your friends in like manner to cast their votes. You understand. And now let me beg your pardon for obtruding this letter upon you, to whom I have ever been opposed in politics. Had your party omitted to make Nebraska a test of party fidelity, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have been the Democratic candidate for Congress in the district. You deserved it, and I believe it would have been given you. In that case I should have been quite happy that Nebraska was to be rebuked at all events. I still should have voted for the Whig candidate; but I should have made no speeches, written no letters; and you would have been elected by at least a thousand majority.|$|E

6000|$|... "You might do, but you won't, my lad; for if <b>you</b> did <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{start your}} wound {{bleeding}} afresh. You two had best take your shoes off directly {{you get on}} deck." ...|$|R

5000|$|Finchley Central is a mind game {{in which}} two players take turns naming {{stations}} in the London Underground. The first person to name Finchley Central is the winner. Of course, the first player could say [...] "Finchley Central" [...] straight away, but as maths professor Jonathan Partington notes, An opening move of [...] "Finchley Central" [...] is {{too much of a}} cheat, and you might wish to start with, say, Liverpool Street, when, assuming that your opponent isn't rude enough to reply with Finchley Central, leaves you with a mate on your second move (though <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> prefer to stall by playing, say, Bank, in the hopes of a more spectacular win later).|$|E

40|$|I {{think we}} agree that {{this is quite a}} title, quite a promise I have to live up to. Well, the truth is I tricked you. Actually, there was a subtitle, but then I thought I would really like to have at least a few people in the audience, so I decided that {{if ever there was a}} time for being bold then this was it and I dropped it. Then of course – as you would – I had second {{thoughts}} and well: Here it is – the full title is actually: ”How library and information science can save the world and why to care [...] Or at least why we should let people know what we know about that unruly thing called information and how this might possibly contribute a little bit to help preventing things from getting even worse. “ This complicates things. <b>You</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not even have bothered getting up today for that much vagueness. It is – sort of – almost the same title, but it is full of maybes and academic blurriness – which is good and which is bad. Making things complicated We – I mean we library and information science people, scholars and practitioners alike- are excellent at making things complicated, at problematizing, at defining and redefining our subject- information- and thinking about our discipline.
