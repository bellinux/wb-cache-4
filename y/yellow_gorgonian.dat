50|$|Eunicella cavolini, {{commonly}} known as the <b>yellow</b> <b>gorgonian</b> or yellow sea whip, is a species of colonial soft coral in the Gorgoniidae family. It is native to parts of the eastern Atlantic Ocean and most of the Mediterranean Sea, where it is a common species.|$|E
40|$|The Mediterranean <b>yellow</b> <b>gorgonian</b> Eunicella cavolinii (Cnidaria, Octocorallia) {{is among}} sessile species who have {{suffered}} mass mortality events following thermal anomalies in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea. We present here the first data on the genetic diversity and structure of this species. The results obtained with four microsatellite markers indicate a strong differentiation between the most distant samples considered here (North Africa, Turkey and France). At a regional scale genetic differences are lower though often significant. No significant differentiation is observed between depths on the same site...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} {{explaining}} the observed patterns of genetic diversity {{is an important}} question in evolutionary biology. We provide the first data on the genetic structure of a Mediterranean octocoral, the <b>yellow</b> <b>gorgonian</b> Eunicella cavolini, along with insights into the demographic history of this species. We sampled populations in four areas of the Mediterranean Sea: continental France, Algeria, Turkey, and the Balearic and Corsica islands. Along French coasts, three sites were sampled at two depths (20 and 40 m). We demonstrated a high genetic structure in this species (overall F-ST = 0. 13), and most pairwise differentiation tests were significant. We did not detect any difference between depths at the same site. Clustering analyses revealed four differentiated groups corresponding to the main geographical areas. The levels of allelic richness and heterozygosity were significantly different between regions, with highest diversity in Algeria and lowest levels in Turkey. The highest levels of private allelic richness were observed in Algeria followed by Turkey. Such contrasted patterns of genetic diversity were not observed in other Mediterranean octocorals and could {{be the result of}} different evolutionary histories. We also provide new empirical evidence of contrasting results between tests and model-based studies of demographic history. Our results have important consequences for the management of this species...|$|E

They are commonly found under rocks or crevices, {{in the middle and}} low intertidal zone and in subtidal reefs. Pisidia magdalenensis (Glassell 1936) is a small species of Porcellanidae that lives among rocks, sand, polychaete cavities, algae, <b>yellow</b> <b>gorgonians,</b> corals and reef...|$|R
40|$|The {{members of}} family Ovulidae are always found living on {{cnidarian}} hosts, usually alcyonarians. The {{colors of the}} shells tend to blend with the host on which they are found being purple on purple <b>gorgonians</b> or <b>yellow</b> on <b>yellow</b> <b>gorgonians.</b> Simnia aequalis lives on the gorgonian Lophogorgia rigida in the northern Gulf of California. S. barbarensis lives on the sea pens, Acanthoptilum gravile, Ptilosarcus gurneyi and the gorgonian, Lophogorgia chilensis in Southern California. External morphology, mantle cavity and radula of Simnia aequalis and of S. barbarensis are described and compared {{to those of other}} members of the family Ovulidae. Larval development of both species was studied through laboratory culture over a one-year period. Development of S. aequalis is compared to that of S. barbarensis. This work is related to other researcher???s descriptions of the larvae of S. spelta and S. patula. Planktotrophic larval culture in a closed seawater system was carried out and the problems are discussed. Feeding behavior of adult snails was observed and is described...|$|R
5000|$|Alcyonacea is {{an order}} of sessile colonial cnidarians found {{throughout}} the oceans of the world, especially in the tropics and subtropics. The name [...] "Gorgonacea" [...] is no longer considered valid and Alcyonacea is now the accepted name for the order. Gorgonians are also known as sea whips and sea fans and {{are similar to the}} sea pen, a soft coral. Gorgonians are closely related to coral. Individual tiny polyps form colonies that are normally erect, flattened, branching, and reminiscent of a fan. Others may be whiplike, bushy, or even encrusting. A colony can be several feet high and across but only a few inches thick. They may be brightly coloured, often purple, red, or <b>yellow.</b> Photosynthetic <b>gorgonians</b> can be successfully kept in captive reef aquariums.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "coral" [...] gardens the Condor Seamount were {{discovered}} in 2006 during the Greenpeace campaign [...] "Defending our Oceans". The underwater pictures recorded {{on the top of}} the seamount showed large and dense aggregations of gorgonians, dominated by coral-whip (Viminella flagellum) and <b>yellow</b> spiral <b>gorgonian</b> (Dentomuricea sp.), accompanied by several species of abundant coral that varied with its associated fauna [...] The Condor Seamount hosts dense [...] "coral gardens," [...] especially on the top, up to 300 m depth. The [...] "gardens" [...] are a habitat for many species, and are recognized internationally as habitats of importance to conservation. The gorgonians are an important part of by-catch of demersal longline fishing, due to the large size and complex structure of the colonies.|$|R
