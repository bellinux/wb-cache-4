Experimental factors consisted of phosphorus chemical fertilizers at four levels(0, 90, 135 and 180 kg ha- 1) and bio-fertilizer at four levels (non-inoculation, inoculating with Azotobacter chroococcum, Pseudomonas Putida and Azotobacter plus Pseudomonas). Results of analysis variance showed that using chemical fertilizer significantly effected grain <b>yield,</b> harvest <b>index,</b> biological <b>yield,</b> plant height and protein content. The highest grain and biological yields were produced by applying 180 kg ha- 1, while its effects on other traits were not significantly different from that of 135 kg ha- 1.
