500|$|Gates was an {{executive}} who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, the managers described him being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk. He interrupted presentations with such comments as [...] "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!" [...] and [...] "Why don't {{you just give}} up <b>your</b> <b>options</b> and join the Peace Corps?" [...] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced. When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, {{he was known to}} remark sarcastically, [...] "I'll do it over the weekend." ...|$|E

2500|$|Doughty advocates reappropriating pejoratives like 'morbid', and [...] {{wants to}} reverse the {{attitude}} that [...] "talking about death is deviant". She says, [...] "Death is not deviant, it's actually the most normal and universal act there is." [...] She is working to overcome the belief that dead bodies are dangerous and can only be handled by trained professionals using technical equipment and specialized facilities. She says {{the most important thing}} she wants the public to know is that the corpse is the family's legal quasi-property, and that you have the power over what happens to that body. Don't let anyone, funeral home, hospital, coroner, etc., pressure you into making a quick decision you might regret. Take the time to do your research and understand <b>your</b> <b>options.</b> The dead person will still be dead in 24 hours; you have time to make the right decision for you. While a body is not commercial property, which can be transferred or held for a debt, for purposes of burial the body is treated as the next of kin's property. Her highest priority changes that she would like to see in US law would be the repeal of the laws in eight states that require a funeral home for at least some part of the process, and to make alkaline hydrolysis available in more than the current eight states.|$|E

50|$|The {{book was}} {{originally}} published chapter after chapter in Soviet newspapers and magazines. Later, it was fully reprinted by the magazine World of Socialism from 1971 to 1972 {{under the title}} How to become a genius. Afterwards, it was finally published as a book in Moscow in printing house Znanie in 1973 under the current name Tvoi vozmozhnosti, chelovek! (<b>Your</b> <b>options,</b> human!).|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, it {{has been}} found that older people as well as less educated people are happier and consume more {{relational}} goods. This may be an issue of choice, where they are less capable of doing solo activities, and are generally more dependent on a framework of people. Therefore, relationships are more vital, and thus they reap the rewards of relational good. Others have suggested that older people are happier due to an improved level of emotional intelligence. As for less educated people, findings about relational goods being more widely consumed within that demographic supports statistical evidence that shows that less educated people aren't necessarily less happy. This is an economical issue as choice and happiness are often correlated. While education significantly improves choice in material goods, the traditional yardstick for happiness, it does less to improve <b>your</b> <b>options</b> in relational goods, and may in fact reduce <b>your</b> <b>options</b> as more educated people tend to work longer hours, thus leavingless time for relationships.|$|E

Indeed, two different people analyzing the same issue with the Potter Box could arrive at two very different conclusions. Moreover, the same person analyzing the same issue could come to different decisions when using the Box at two different times. Nevertheless, the Potter Box can help you think through what to do. It offers a process to help you weigh <b>your</b> <b>options</b> in a methodical manner.|$|E

50|$|Al Hoceima National Park is a {{national}} park, outside the town of Al Hoceima in Morocco. It covers an area of 470 square kilometres, including 190 km2 at sea. The area is dotted with Berber settlements and criss-crossed by dirt roads, making it ideal trekking and mountain-biking territory. Its isolation has helped preserve several at-risk species, from its thuya forests to an important colony of fish eagles. While a 4WD opens up <b>your</b> <b>options,</b> a 2x4 will get you through the main tracks. The park offers two regions: the central Rif bordered by the N16 {{in the south and}} west, and the coast.|$|E

5000|$|Bootstrapping is {{becoming}} the most popular method of testing mediation {{because it does not}} require the normality assumption to be met, and because it can be effectively utilized with smaller sample sizes (N < 25). However, mediation continues to be most frequently determined using the logic of Baron and Kenny [...] or the Sobel test. It {{is becoming}} increasingly more difficult to publish tests of mediation based purely on the Baron and Kenny method or tests that make distributional assumptions such as the Sobel test. Thus, {{it is important to consider}} <b>your</b> <b>options</b> when choosing which test to conduct.|$|E

50|$|Two and a {{half years}} later, an {{exclusively}} online version of THK was released in its BETA stage. This version got rid of the single player element of the game in favour of a more social experience. Free to download and play, the game offered a whole slew of new features to the online community. Its UI is strikingly similar to the BlackBerry homescreen, having <b>your</b> <b>options</b> along the bottom of the screen; leaving the rest of the screen open for gameplay. In October 2011 it was released for Android. This allowed players on both platforms to play against each other at the same table.|$|E

Whichever {{means of}} contact {{a young person}} chooses, each contact usually includes three stages: going through the problem, seeing what <b>your</b> <b>options</b> are, and contacting further help. The Helpline Volunteer helps the young person decide {{what they want to}} happen next, whether it is to change their situation or simply talk to someone about it. Get Connected gives contact information for the young person’s chosen source of support by phone, text to their mobile, or via email or webchat if they are online. For those young people who have no credit, do not want a phone call to show up on their phone bill or are simply too scared to explain their worries themselves, Get Connected’s Helpline Volunteers may {{be able to make a}} one-off connection to another service.|$|E
