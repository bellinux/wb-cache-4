500|$|In {{spite of}} her {{disfigured}} face, Mileena is often rated among the most attractive characters in video games. UGO Networks counted Mileena among the best-looking female ninja-type characters in all media, and ranked her as the [...] "seventh-finest" [...] female fighter in 2010, but advised to [...] "be careful around that big scary demon mouth she keeps under the skarf." [...] Alongside Mileena and Jade, Kitana was included {{on the list of}} the [...] "hottest chicks of 2011" [...] by Univision. That same year, Ben Kendrick of Game Rant ranked Mileena as the [...] "fourth-most awesome" [...] character of the series and one of [...] "the most disgusting yet alluring" [...] game characters ever created, commenting it is [...] "like Ed Boon is constantly saying 'yeah, I dare you to be attracted to this character!'" [...] Mileena's breasts placed 31st and ninth on the lists of the finest chests in gaming by GameFront's Ross Lincoln in 2011 and Complex's Drea Avellan in 2012, respectively. In 2012, Gadget Review's Kristie Bertucci rated Mileena as the [...] "sixth-hottest" [...] female video game character and noted her being [...] "usually always {{at the top of the}} list as one of the most popular female characters (not to mention sexy)" [...] in all video games. Larry Hester of Complex ranked Mileena herself as the [...] "eighth-hottest" [...] video game character in 2012, writing [...] "Mileena is what some guys would call a paper bagger. Her body is crazy but the face doesn't really work for us." [...] In 2013, Sean Hinz of ScrewAttack deemed Mileena the worst-ever [...] "hot chick" [...] in video games for how she [...] "can make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> when you have a boner." [...] Stuart W. Bedford of WhatCulture placed her fourth on his list of [...] "most sexually charged" [...] female characters in gaming history, stating she [...] "has been confusing penises the world over since her creation". Belgian publication G MAG noted Mileena for her large cup size and minuscule outfits in an article discussing sexual themes in video games.|$|E

"Well, if I {{was in that}} town, or {{any other}} where the {{railroad}} folks only charge seventy-five cents to fetch me home, you can bet I wouldn't hang 'round the streets very long cryin' baby; I'd hustle an' earn money.

I ain't stickin' up for Jip Collins, 'cause when he set fire to Baxter's lumber-yard {{he knew he was}} doin' what would send him to jail; {{but at the same time}} 'twixt him an' Sam I ain't certain but I'd rather give Jip a boost." ...|$|E

50|$|The Society {{was founded}} in August 1998 in Irving, Texas, by Pamela Gail Johnson. In December 1998, it gained {{international}} reception, when it challenged advice columnist Ann Landers for discouraging people from writing happy holiday newsletters enclosed with their holiday cards. In a letter to Landers, Johnson demanded an apology “to {{the millions of people}} <b>you</b> made <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> for wanting to share their happy news.” The Society’s campaign persuaded Landers to change her advice on holiday letters, one of the rare occasions the columnist had a change of heart. Within the next few years the Society grew bigger being supported by thousands of fans from more than 34 countries.|$|R

[...] Lapham was ready, in his dense pride, to resent any affront to his blood, but doubtful, with the {{evidence}} of this invitation to the contrary, if any affront had been offered. Mrs. Lapham tried to tell him, but there was really nothing tangible; {{and when she came}} to put it into words, she could not make out a case. Her husband listened to her excited attempt, and then he said, with judicial superiority, [...] "I guess nobody's been trying to make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>bad,</b> Persis.

6000|$|Scraps {{was leaning}} so far over the hole {{trying to find}} Ozma in it that {{suddenly}} she lost her balance and pitched in head foremost. She fell upon Button-Bright and tumbled him over, {{but he was not}} hurt by her soft, stuffed body and only laughed at the mishap. The Wizard buckled some straps together and let one end of them down into the hole, and soon both Scraps and the boy had climbed up and were standing safely beside the others. They looked once more for Ozma, but the hole was now absolutely vacant. It was a round hole, so from the top they could plainly see every part of it. Before they left the place, Dorothy went to the Bear King and said, [...] "I'm sorry we couldn't believe what the little Pink Bear said, 'cause we don't want to make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> by doubting him. There must be a mistake, somewhere, and we prob'ly don't understand just what the little Pink Bear said. Will you let me ask him one more question?" ...|$|E
60|$|It didn't {{seem like}} we {{was the same}} lot that {{was in such a}} state to find land and git ashore, but it was. But we had got over that--clean over it. We was used to the balloon now and not afraid any more, and didn't want to be anywheres else. Why, it seemed just like home; it 'most seemed as if I had been born and raised in it, and Jim and Tom said the same. And always I had had hateful people around me, a-nagging at me, and pestering of me, and scolding, and finding fault, and fussing and bothering, and {{sticking}} to me, and keeping after me, and making me do this, and making me do that and t'other, and always selecting out the things I didn't want to do, and then giving me Sam Hill because I shirked and done something else, and just aggravating the life out of a body all the time; but up here in the sky it was so still and sunshiny and lovely, and plenty to eat, and plenty of sleep, and strange things to see, and no nagging and no pestering, and no good people, and just holiday all the time. Land, I warn't in no hurry to git out and buck at civilization again. Now, {{one of the worst things}} about civilization is, that anybody that gits a letter with trouble in it comes and tells you all about it and makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>bad,</b> and the newspapers fetches you the troubles of everybody all over the world, and keeps you downhearted and dismal 'most all the time, and it's such a heavy load for a person. I hate them newspapers; and I hate letters; and if I had my way I wouldn't allow nobody to load his troubles on to other folks he ain't acquainted with, on t'other side of the world, that way. Well, up in a balloon there ain't any of that, and it's the darlingest place there is.|$|E

6000|$|So Miranda Pryor {{was married}} to Private Joseph Milgrave on his last leave. It {{should have been a}} romantic wedding but it was not. There were too many factors working against romance, as even Rilla had to admit. In the first place, Miranda, in spite of her dress and veil, was such a flat-faced, commonplace, uninteresting little bride. In the second place, Joe cried bitterly all through the ceremony, and this vexed Miranda unreasonably. Long {{afterwards}} she told Rilla, [...] "I just felt like saying to him then and there, 'If <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> so <b>bad</b> over having to marry me you don't have to.' But it was just because he was thinking all the time of how soon he would have to leave me." ...|$|R

30|$|Moreover, {{we should}} also {{consider}} the nexus of demand and supply. From the supply side, the higher the ‘efficiency’ is (which can be evaluated by labor productivity and total factor productivity), the better as this is {{in accord with the}} objective of service providers' profit maximization. However, from the demand side, the more comfortable the ‘effect’ is (which can be measured by indices such as customer satisfaction), the better as this fits in with the objective of service consumers' utility maximization. But in reality, the efficiency of suppliers in providing services is often in diametric contradiction to the effect felt by service consumers. One example is the doctor-patient conflict. Suppose you went to see a doctor. <b>You</b> will <b>feel</b> better if the doctor spends more time examining and consulting with great care; otherwise, <b>you</b> will <b>feel</b> <b>bad.</b> If a doctor spends less time for each patient, he will handle more cases, and thus, he performs more efficiently. But this high efficiency would make patients feel very uncomfortable. Hence, the healthy development of the service industry is a balance between efficiency (for the supply side) and effect (for the demand side) rather than putting undue emphasis on the former while ignoring the latter. All the mechanisms and institutional and policy designs should take into consideration the interaction between them so as to promote the evolution of services from internalization to externalization.|$|R
