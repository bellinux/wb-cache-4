500|$|Professor David Nutt, former {{chair of}} the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in the UK has said, [...] "people are better off taking ecstasy or amphetamines than those [...] we know nothing about" [...] and [...] "Who knows what's in [...] when <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>it?</b> We don't have a testing system. It could be very dangerous, we just don't know. These {{chemicals}} have never been put into animals, let alone humans." [...] Les King, {{a former member of}} the ACMD, has stated mephedrone appears to be less potent than amphetamine and ecstasy, but that any benefit associated with this could be negated by users taking larger amounts. He also told the BBC, [...] "all we can say is [...] is probably as harmful as ecstasy and amphetamines and wait until we have some better scientific evidence to support that." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of the}} album, critic David Browne wrote: [...] "Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (...You were an island / And I passed you by in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest moment, you know you've got something extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin’s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, [...] "Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me," [...] he totally sells it, and <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>it.</b> And why not? The song's lovely.|$|E

6000|$|O why did {{you tell}} me about that cloak? Why didn't <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>it?</b> Isn't it in Julius Cæsar that Pompey blames--no not Pompey but a friend of Pompey's--well, Pompey's friend, I mean the friend of Pompey--blames {{somebody}} else who was his friend--that is who was the friend of Pompey's friend--because he (the friend of Pompey's friend) had not done something right off, but had come and asked him (Pompey's friend) whether he (the friend of Pompey's friend) ought to do it or no? There I fold my hands with some complacency: that's a piece of very good narration. I am getting into good form. These classical instances are always distracting. I was talking of the cloak. It's awfully dear. Are there no cheap and nasty imitations? Think of that--if, however, it were the opinion (ahem) of competent persons that the great cost of the mantle in question was no more than proportionate to its durability; if it were to be a joy for ever; if it would cover my declining years and survive me in anything like integrity for the comfort of my executors; if--I have the word--if the price indicates (as it seems) the quality of perdurability in the fabric; if, in fact, it would not be extravagant, but only the leariest economy to lay out £5 [...] .. 15 [...] .. in a single mantle without seam and without price, and if--and if--it really fastens with an agrafe--I would BUY it.

6000|$|In {{the course}} of a year after this conversation, one and another of my acquaintances were often heard {{speaking}} of John Morton's house. [...] "Such beautiful rooms,--so charmingly furnished,--you must go and see them. What does make them so much pleasanter than those rooms in the other house, which have everything in them that money can buy?" [...] So said the folk; for nine people out of ten only feel the effect of a room, and never analyze the causes from which it flows: they know that certain rooms seem dull and heavy and confused, but they don't know why; that certain others seem cheerful, airy, and beautiful, but they know not why. The first exclamation, on entering John's parlors, was so often [...] "How beautiful!" [...] that it became rather a byword in the family. Estimated by their mere money value, the articles in the rooms were of very trifling worth; but, as they stood arranged and combined, they had all the effect of a lovely picture. Although the statuary was only plaster, and the photographs and lithographs such as were all within the compass of limited means, yet every one of them was a good thing of its own kind, or a good reminder of some of the greatest works of art. A good plaster cast is a daguerreotype, so to speak, of a great statue, though it may be bought for five or six dollars, while its original is not to be had for any namable sum. A chromo lithograph of the best sort gives all the style and manner and effect of Turner or Stanfield, or any of the best of modern artists, though <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>it</b> for five or ten dollars, and though the original would command a thousand guineas. The lithographs from Raphael's immortal picture give you the results of a whole age of artistic culture, in a form within the compass of very humble means. There is now selling for five dollars at Williams & Everett's a photograph of Cheney's crayon drawing of the San Sisto Madonna and Child, which has the very spirit of the glorious original. Such a picture, hung against the wall of a child's room, would train its eye from infancy; and yet how many will freely spend five dollars in embroidery on its dress, that say they cannot afford works of art! ...|$|E
