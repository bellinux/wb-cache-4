5|$|One {{person could}} say that 'Hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide {{every day of my}} life for the last ten years until I heard that song, and I realized, after all, I can be my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>It</b> meant something to someone.|$|E
25|$|In his speech, Alcibiades {{goes on to}} {{describe}} Socrates' virtues, his incomparable valor in battle, his immunity to cold or fear. On one occasion he even saved Alcibiades' life and then refused to accept honors for it (219e-221c). Socrates, he concludes, is unique in his ideas and accomplishments, unrivaled by any man from the past or present (221c). But be warned: Socrates may present himself as your lover, but before <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> you will have {{fallen in love with}} him.|$|E
25|$|With Schelling again Cousin agrees in {{regarding}} this supreme ground of all as positively apprehended, {{and as a}} source of development, but he utterly repudiates Schelling's method. The intellectual intuition either falls under the eye of consciousness, or it does not. If not, how do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> and its object which are identical? If it does, it comes within the sphere of psychology; and the objections to it as thus a relative, made by Schelling himself, are to be dealt with. Schelling's intellectual intuition is the mere negation of knowledge.|$|E

25|$|A celebration to God’s {{glory and}} to the dignity of man. All that’s left most artists seem to feel these days, is man. Naked, poor, forked radish. There aren’t any celebrations. Ours, the {{scientists}} keep telling us, is a universe, which is disposable. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> might be just this one anonymous glory of all things, this rich stone forest, this epic chant, this gaiety, this grand choiring shout of affirmation, which we choose when all our cities are dust, to stand intact, to mark where we have been, to testify to what we had it in us, to accomplish.|$|E
25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
500|$|Drummond {{has said}} he was {{inspired}} by the hip-hop and scratch he was hearing regularly on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show, but looking back in 1991 he said [...] "If you listen to it now, it sounds nothing like a hip hop record, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> sounds a lot more like British punk... punk version of a hip hop record, I suppose." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with NME in 2014 whilst promoting his solo debut album Everyday Robots, Damon Albarn hinted at a collaborative project with Gallagher. Despite the years of animosity during Blur and Oasis' respective heyday, Albarn said: [...] "We’re talking. It’s not anything {{to get excited about}} yet. I mean, he’s doing his thing. He’s finishing a new record. I’ve got my record coming out, but the principle of us making music together is something, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> would be fair to say, we have discussed it at least once." ...|$|E
500|$|Harry Venning of The Stage {{believed}} that, plotwise, {{the collaboration}} between the British and French police forces and style were [...] "all very effectively done, creepily atmospheric and splendidly gruesome", but also stated {{that the best thing}} about the series was [...] "the interplay between Stephen Dillane's easygoing, laddish, rosbif detective inspector and his po-faced, glacial but – wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> – extremely sexy Gallic counterpart, played by Clémence Poésy." [...] Metro reviewer Keith Watson, having rated the series four stars out of five, stated: [...] "the idea is great. But what's surprising about The Tunnel (Sky Atlantic) is that it's less a version of, more a faithful remake." ...|$|E
500|$|The minor-key [...] "La Vida es Así" [...] (Life Is Like That) {{features}} vocal {{effects and}} synthesizers. The urban version [...] "attacks" [...] with a modern and aggressive beat; the bachata version is slower, with Luny Tunes' tropical rhythms. In the lyrics, Ivy Queen declares to a rival: [...] "The guy you're dating is mine, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> but here's the detail: He's worthless in bed. That's why I'm here to congratulate you for setting me free, I have to confess". The reggaeton rhymes {{tell a story}} of revenge and lovesickness.

500|$|In November 2008, during St. John's {{portrayal}} of the character, Todd is given a new scar by John McBain during a physical altercation in which John beats Todd with a gun. The scar symbolized Todd's [...] "second rape of Marty", and was considered [...] "a poetic nod" [...] to Todd's history. The scar was significantly smaller than the original but placed in the same spot; it was gone by January 2009. St. John stated, [...] "I know. It's too bad. I honestly {{have no idea why}} they wouldn't keep that reminder on Todd's face. It might be an economical thing. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> costs to apply that kind of makeup each day." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Slim Slow Slider" [...] is {{the only}} song on the album to not have string overdubs and {{according}} to John Payne, Morrison had not played it live before. [...] Like [...] in the song [...] "T.B. Sheets", the singer tells of watching a young girl die, but in [...] "Slim Slow Slider" [...] the girl seems bent on her own self-destruction: [...] "I know you're dying, baby/I know <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> too." [...] The song ends abruptly with the words, [...] "Every time I see you, I just don't know what to do." [...] It has been said to be about a junkie but Morrison has only said that it's about someone [...] "who is {{caught up in a}} big city like London or maybe is on dope, I'm not sure." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 May 1968, Lennon {{summoned the}} other Beatles {{to a meeting}} at Apple Corps to {{announce}} {{that he was the}} living reincarnation of Jesus: [...] "I have something very important to tell you all.

500|$|The Bostonians made a final {{effort to}} slow the proceedings.

[...] The court wanted a sentence but could not proceed until some of the ministers spoke. [...] Three of the ministers were sworn in, and each testified against Hutchinson. [...] Winthrop moved to have her banished; in the ensuing tally, only the Boston deputies voted against conviction. [...] Hutchinson challenged the sentence's legitimacy, saying, [...] "I desire to know wherefore I am banished." [...] Winthrop responded, [...] "The court knows wherefore and is satisfied." ...|$|E
