500|$|In Australia, EMI {{released}} the album on 10 September 2010. A special edition {{was released on}} 18 October 2010, featuring a second disc of acoustic versions of each track on the album. Moa said that [...] "I've chosen to record an acoustic version of the album because I believe in the vulnerable, simplistic side of music and writing. The way <b>you</b> <b>connect</b> the songs {{the first time you}} hear it, no drums, no effects, no funky bass lines, just your voice and a guitar... it feels like magic." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Haunted" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph {{felt that the}} [...] "modernist sonic approach is pushed to the fore" [...] on [...] "Ghost". Spin Brandon Sorderberg felt that the line [...] "nine-to-five" [...] just to stay alive" [...] was repeated [...] "way too many times". Anupa Mistry of the same publication described the song as [...] "multi-directional, mood-shifting". Cosmopolitan Alex Rees said the song is a [...] "sharp critique of postmodern culture, except {{then all of a}} sudden there's a bunch of nasty sex talk." [...] Mesfin Fekadu from the Associated Press described [...] "Haunted" [...] as a [...] "gloomy" [...] song. Writing for the website The 405, editor White Caitlin felt the singer offered part of her insecurities and flaws through the song and [...] "sheds slut-shaming, the shackled role of uptight matriarch or calculated star". Facts Chris Kelly described its composition as [...] "foreboding" [...] and found a [...] "seductive" [...] and [...] "haunting" [...] hook; he further described the first part as [...] "smoky ethereality". Mojos Priya Elan felt that some of the lines were a [...] "nihilistic streak". In a review for The Quietus, Mof Gimmers described [...] "Haunted" [...] as a [...] "perfect slice of vanguard-pop". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described it as a [...] "two-part dream". Robert Leedham of the website Drowned in Sound felt that the album's [...] "confessional moments are when <b>you</b> <b>connect</b> with it the most", exemplifying the statement with lyrics from [...] "Haunted". Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine felt that [...] "Haunted" [...] was one of the best songs on the album along with being [...] " [...] most insightful [...] ". They concluded that while the song was [...] "one of the album's most staunchly non-commercial moments, but endlessly listenable just the same". Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly chose [...] "Haunted" [...] as one of the best songs from the album, describing it as a [...] "moody, genre-melding epic" [...] and noting, [...] " [...] treat relationships with the same raw instinct that suffuses her sex songs". AllMusic reviewer Andy Kellman also chose [...] "Haunted" [...] as one of the highlights on Beyoncé. Una Mullally of The Irish Times deemed [...] "Haunted" [...] the best song on the album and an indicator of the prominent minimalism throughout the whole record.|$|E

2500|$|As Lee was savoring {{his victory}} at the Chancellorsville crossroads, he {{received}} disturbing news: Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick's force had broken through the Confederate lines at Fredericksburg and was headed toward Chancellorsville. On the night of May 2, {{in the aftermath of}} Jackson's flank attack, Hooker had ordered Sedgwick to [...] "cross the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg on the receipt of this order, and at once take up your line of march on the Chancellorsville road until <b>you</b> <b>connect</b> with him. You will attack and destroy any force you may fall in with on the road." [...] Lee had left a relatively small force at Fredericksburg, ordering Brig. Gen. Jubal Early to [...] "watch the enemy and try to hold him." [...] If he was attacked in [...] "overwhelming numbers," [...] Early was to retreat to Richmond, but if Sedgwick withdrew from his front, he was to join with Lee at Chancellorsville. On the morning of May 2, Early received a garbled message from Lee's staff that caused him to start marching most of his men toward Chancellorsville, but he quickly returned after a warning from Brig. Gen. William Barksdale of a Union advance against Fredericksburg. At 7 a.m. on May 3, Early was confronted with four Union divisions: Brig. Gen. John Gibbons of the II Corps had crossed the Rappahannock north of town, and three divisions of Sedgwick's VI Corps—Maj. Gen. John Newton and Brig. Gens. Albion P. Howe and William T. H. Brooks—were arrayed in line {{from the front of the}} town to Deep Run. Most of Early's combat strength was deployed to the south of town, where Federal troops had achieved their most significant successes during the December battle. Marye's Heights was defended by Barksdale's Mississippi brigade and Early ordered the Louisiana brigade of Brig. Gen. Harry T. Hays from the far right to Barksdale's left.|$|E
2500|$|Mad Catz based the Fender Mustang Pro-Guitar MIDI 102-button {{controller}} on {{the actual}} Fender Mustang bass guitar, for the game software's Pro mode, {{as a way for}} 5-button players to have an intermediary step up to a real guitar using a combination of buttons and strings. [...] Instead of five colored buttons, the Mustang has 6 buttons across 17 different frets, for a total of 102 buttons; the player needs to strike the corresponding buttons on the right frets similar to guitar strings. The player uses the [...] "string box" [...] that contains six stainless-steel strings which can detect which strings are being strummed, in place of a [...] "strum bar" [...] from the typical legacy [...] "5 button" [...] controller. Though modeled after a bass guitar which only has 4 strings, Mad Catz gave it 6 strings in order for it to also be used for pro lead guitar play. [...] In addition to Pro mode use, the Mustang can be used to play the game in Basic mode, and it functions as a full MIDI guitar, with a MIDI output connector providing compatibility with MIDI software sequencers and hardware devices. [...] For use in gaming mode, each Mustang controller can only be used with the game console it is designed for (except unofficially if <b>you</b> <b>connect</b> through a MIDI-Pro Adapter, then any console's Mustang can be used with any console for Pro mode game play, although direction pad buttons, overdrive detection and Basic 5-button game play will be disabled). [...] The Mustang Pro-Guitar is only a few inches smaller in length than the actual Mustang bass guitar, and being made of plastic, is much lighter to hold than an actual guitar. The neck is removable from the body for easier storage and transport.|$|E

6000|$|The {{eldest of}} her charge, {{at the time}} this story begins, was a girl just arrived at young ladyhood, and her name was Mary. Now we know that people very seldom have stories written about them who have not sylph-like forms, and glorious eyes, or, at least, [...] "a certain inexpressible charm {{diffused}} over their whole person." [...] But stories have of late so much abounded that they actually seem to have used up all the eyes, hair, teeth, lips, and forms necessary for a heroine, {{so that no one}} can now pretend to find an original collection wherewith to set one forth. These things considered, I regard it as fortunate that my heroine was not a beauty. She looked neither like a sylph, nor an oread, nor a fairy; she had neither l'air distingué nor l'air magnifique, but bore a great resemblance to a real mortal girl, such as you might pass a dozen of without any particular comment--one of those appearances, which, though common as water, may, like that, be colored any way by the associations <b>you</b> <b>connect</b> with it. Accordingly, a faultless taste in dress, a perfect ease and gayety of manner, a constant flow of kindly feeling, seemed in her case to produce all the effect of beauty. Her manners had just dignity enough to repel impertinence without destroying the careless freedom and sprightliness in which she commonly indulged. No person had a merrier run of stories, songs, and village traditions, and all those odds and ends of character which form the materials for animated conversation. She had read, too, every thing she could find: Rollin's History, and Scott's Family Bible, that stood in the glass bookcase in the best room, and an odd volume of Shakspeare, and now and then one of Scott's novels, borrowed from a somewhat literary family in the neighborhood. She also kept an album to write her thoughts in, and was in a constant habit of cutting out all the pretty poetry from the corners of the newspapers, besides drying forget-me-nots and rosebuds, in memory of different particular friends, with a number of other little sentimental practices to which young ladies of sixteen and thereabout are addicted. She was also endowed with great constructiveness; so that, in these days of ladies' fairs, there was nothing from bellows-needlebooks down to web-footed pincushions to which she could not turn her hand. Her sewing certainly was extraordinary, (we think too little is made of this in the accomplishments of heroines;) her stitching was like rows of pearls, and her cross-stitching was fairy-like; and for sewing over and over, as the village schoolma'am hath it, she had not her equal. And what shall we say of her pies and puddings? They would have converted the most reprobate old bachelor in the world. And then her sweeping and dusting! [...] "Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all!" ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{hundred years}} ago this apology for error was met by those high-minded and {{interesting}} men, the French believers in human perfectibility, with their characteristic dogma,--of which Rousseau was the ardent expounder,--that man is born with a clear and unsophisticated spirit, perfectly able to discern all the simple truths necessary for common conduct by its own unaided light. His motives are all pure and unselfish and his intelligence is unclouded, until priests and tyrants mutilate the one and corrupt the other. We who {{have the benefit of}} the historic method, and {{have to take into account}} the medium that surrounds a human creature the moment it comes into the world, to say nothing of all the inheritance from the past which it brings within it into the world at the same moment, cannot take up this ground. We cannot maintain that everybody is born with light enough to see the rational defences of things for himself, without the education of institutions. What we do maintain is--and this is the answer to the plea for error at present under consideration--that whatever impairs the brightness of such light as a man has, is not useful but hurtful. Our reply to those who contend for the usefulness of error on the ground of the comparative impotence of rationality over ordinary minds, is something of this kind. Superstition, blind obedience to custom, and the other substitutes for a right and independent use of the mind, may accidentally and in some few respects impress good ideas upon persons who are too darkened to accept those ideas on their real merits. But then superstition itself is the main cause of this very darkness. To hold error is in so far to foster erroneous ways of thinking on all subjects; is to make the intelligence less and less ready to receive truth in all matters whatever. Men are made incapable of perceiving the rational defences, and of feeling rational motives, for good habits,--so far as they are thus incapable,--by the very errors which we are asked silently to countenance as useful substitutes for right reason. 'Erroneous motives,' as Condorcet has expressed this matter, 'have an additional drawback attached to them, the habit which they strengthen of reasoning ill. The more important the subject on which you reason ill, and the more you busy yourself about it, by so much the more dangerous do the influences of such a habit become. It is especially on subjects analogous to that on which you reason wrongly, or which <b>you</b> <b>connect</b> with it by habit, that such a defect extends most powerfully and most rapidly. Hence it is extremely hard for the man who believes himself obliged to conform in his conduct to what he considers truths useful to men, but who attributes the obligation to erroneous motives, to reason very correctly on the truths themselves; the more attention he pays to such motives, and the more importance he comes to attach to them, the more likely he will be to go wrong.'[9] So, in short, superstition does an immense harm by enfeebling rational ways of thinking; it does a little good by accidentally endorsing rational conclusions in one or two matters. And yet, though the evil which it is said to repair is a trifle beside the evil which it is admitted to inflict, the balance of expediencies is after all declared to be such as to warrant us in calling errors useful! ...|$|E
