Both the mechanical properties and the biodegradable {{rate of the}} composite were investigated in terms of effect of initial length and mass content percentage <b>of</b> <b>sisal</b> fiber on. The {{results showed that the}} fibers tended to be shorter and thinner during the processing of twin-screw blending and the tensile and flexure strength of composites were enhanced, with the content or initial length <b>of</b> <b>sisal</b> fibers increasing. Furthermore, the biodegradation rate of the composite was forward at first, and gradually became slow in later period and then leveled off finally.

This study {{focuses on the}} environmental performance <b>of</b> <b>sisal</b> fibre production by quantifying the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use <b>of</b> producing <b>sisal</b> fibre in Tanzania and Brazil using life cycle assessment (LCA), based on region-specific inventory data. The results show that sisal fibre production has much lower GHG emissions (75 – 95 %) and non-renewable energy use (85 – 95 %) compared to glass fibre on a kg-basis, which {{is in line with}} published LCAs on natural fibres.

The optimum tensile strength and Young's modulus were obtained at 0. 16 % NaOH by weight. The stiffness <b>of</b> the <b>sisal</b> fibre bundles obtained using the cellulose content also referred to as the micro-fibril content was compared with the stiffness determined using the crystallinity index.

It had the highest chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies in the range of 80 - 93 % at OLRs in the range of 2. 4 - 25 g COD L- 1 d- 1. The degradation pattern of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) showed that the degradation of propionate was limiting at higher OLRs. The stable pH and higher partial alkalinity (PA) of the outflow illustrated that packed-bed bioreactors have a good ability to withstand the variations in load and volatile fatty acid concentrations that can occur in a two-stage anaerobic process. In conclusion, sisal fibre waste was shown to be a novel promising biofilm carrier and would work very well in methanogenic biofilm bioreactors treating sisal leaf tissue waste leachate.
