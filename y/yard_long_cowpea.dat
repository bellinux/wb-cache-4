40|$|Thirty hybrids {{involving}} six cowpea genotypes {{and five}} <b>yard</b> <b>long</b> bean and <b>cowpea</b> were evaluated {{and subjected to}} correlation and path analyses. The characters viz., number of clusters per plant, number of pods per cluster and 100 grain weight were significantly positive correlation with single plant yield. The direct effect of number of clusters per plant and 100 grain weight on single plant yield was high. Number of pods per clusters and number of seeds per pod recorded moderate and low level direct effect on single plant yield. Hence the traits, number of clusters per plant, 100 -grain weight and number of pods were considered as selection indices for yield improvement programme...|$|R

5000|$|A {{full-sized}} {{end zone}} in Canadian football is 20 <b>yards</b> <b>long</b> by 65 <b>yards</b> wide. Prior to the 1980s, the Canadian end zone was 25 <b>yards</b> <b>long.</b> The first stadium {{to use the}} 20 <b>yard</b> <b>long</b> end zone was B.C. Place in Vancouver, which was completed in 1983. The floor of B.C. Place was (and is) too short to accommodate a field 160 yards in length. The shorter end zone proved popular enough that the CFL adopted it league-wide in 1986. At BMO Field, home to the Toronto Argonauts, the end zones are only 18 yards. http://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/argos-finally-have-a-home-at-bmo-field~886589 ...|$|R

40|$|Incidence {{of yellow}} mosaic disease on <b>yard</b> <b>long</b> bean {{occurred}} widely {{in some areas}} in West and Central Java in 2008 – 2009. The causal agent of this disease is Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) which can be transmitted through seed and aphids. Research was conducted to determine response of five varieties of <b>yard</b> <b>long</b> bean (Vigna sinensis), i. e. Parade, New Jaliteng, Long Silk, Super Sainan, and Pilar to BCMV infection. <b>Yard</b> <b>long</b> bean plants was inoculated by BCMV mechanically, followed by observation of disease incidence and severity, incubation period, flowering time, and yield. All five varieties of <b>yard</b> <b>long</b> bean showed susceptible response to BCMV infection. Incubation period was 6 – 16 days, disease incidence was 90 – 100 %, and disease severity was 49. 1 – 69. 7 %. BCMV infection caused severe symptoms of leaf malformation and plant stunting. Flowering time was delayed 2 – 5 days on infected plants and yield was decreased up to 46. 6 %. Breeding program to develop resistance varieties to BCMV is necessary. </p...|$|R
