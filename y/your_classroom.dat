Suppose you teach in a school or university.

Indexing makes explicit a differentiating of studentsthis term from studentsprior terms. You survey the new students, and indexing explicitly differentiates student1 from student2 from student3, etc. Suppose you recognize one student - call her Anna - from a prior course in which Anna either excelled or did poorly. Again, you escape identification by your indexed awareness that Annathis term, this course is different from Annathat term, that course. Not identifying, you both expand and sharpen your apprehension of [...] "students" [...] with an awareness rooted in fresh silent-level observations.|$|E
50|$|David Labaree's Democratic Equality ideology, {{which is}} defined in Labaree's article, Public Goods, Private Goods: The American Struggle Over Educational Goals {{is a perfect example}} of {{different}} aspects of Multicultural Education. A teacher using Labaree's Democratic Equality, would have students who are able to feel like they belong in the classroom, which teaches students equal treatment, and gives support to multiculturalism, non-academic curriculum options, and cooperative learning (Labaree (1997), 45). Labaree use of Democratic Equality supports a multicultural education because “in the democratic political arena, we are all considered equal (according to the rule of one person, one vote), but this political equality can be undermined if the social inequality of citizens grows too great” (Labaree (1997), p. 42). By providing opportunities to engaged and enrich children with different cultures, abilities, and ethnicities we allow children to become more familiar with people that are different from them, hoping to allow a greater acceptance in society. Also by representing a variety of cultures reflected by the students in <b>your</b> <b>classroom,</b> children will feel like they have a voice or a place at school.|$|E

Have you wondered why you can search the full text of some books, but not others? Did you know that the full-text searching feature is the result of work done right here at UM? Can you imagine making uses for these texts that go beyond searching in EEBO? This workshop will introduce you to the Text Creation Partnership (TCP), the project that generates fully searchable, XML-encoded digital editions based on the 15 th, 16 th, and 17 th century English books represented in EEBO. We’ll look a bit at how this work is done, and how the resulting digital text archive can be used in your research and in <b>your</b> <b>classrooms.</b> We’ll also look “beyond EEBO” at how the digital editions produced by the TCP can be used on their own–independent of the EEBO database–in many different ways, from serving as the base text for a new scholarly edition to helping students think critically about how the structure of the book and conventions of print impact their understanding of a work. No prior knowledge of EEBO or the TCP is assumed (though it is welcome!).
