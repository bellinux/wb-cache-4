25|$|About 57 {{percent of}} Russia is tundra—a treeless, marshy plain. The tundra is Russia's northernmost zone, {{stretching}} from the Finnish border {{in the west to}} the Bering Strait in the east, then running south along the Pacific coast to the northern Kamchatka Peninsula. The zone is known for its herds of wild reindeer, for so-called white nights (dusk at midnight, dawn shortly thereafter) in summer, and for days of total darkness in winter. The long, harsh winters and lack of sunshine allow only mosses, lichens, and dwarf willows and shrubs to sprout low above the barren permafrost. Although several powerful Siberian rivers traverse this zone as they flow northward to the Arctic Ocean, partial and intermittent thawing hamper drainage of the numerous lakes, ponds, and swamps of the tundra. Frost weathering is the most important physical process here, gradually shaping a landscape that was severely modified by glaciation in the last ice age. Less than one percent of Russia's population lives in this zone. The fishing and port industries of the northwestern Kola Peninsula and the huge oil and gas fields of northwestern Siberia are the largest employers in the tundra. With a population of 180,000, the industrial frontier city of Norilsk is second in population to Murmansk among Russia's settlements above the Arctic Circle. From here <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> see the auroras (northern lights).|$|E

25|$|Alwar is {{the first}} major city when {{travelling}} from Delhi en route to Rajasthan. Its heritage is a major draw for tourists. The fort of Alwar, known as Bala fort, is about 595 meters high. It was constructed in the tenth century, making it the oldest building in the city. Despite {{being one of the}} princely states of Rajputana, the rulers here had left no stone unturned in building many forts. Seeing the fort of Baala, there is an impression that sometimes {{it would have been a}} very inaccessible fort, where there would have been many turrets, a large gate, a temple and a residential area. There is a state museum in the City Palace, where there is a rare collection of miniature paintings. Near the corner are Mousi's umbrella, Vinay Palace, Vijay Mandir Palace and Moti Dungri. In other tourist spots, the lake is situated in Silasedh Lake and Jaisamand Lake. Sariska, which is at a distance of 36 kilometers, after rain, for its green trees and greenery of bushes, is seen differently. In its beautiful valley, visions are visible with blue cow, chital, wild pig, other animals. Sariska is counted in old Tiger-projects. Due to poaching sighting tigers has unfortunately become rare. Do not be discouraged but go Sariska, which is still full of beautiful natural scenery and colorful birds. Historical significance of the nearby Biratnagar or Barrath, is due to the stupa and established inscription made by Emperor Ashoka the Great. According to legendary belief, Pandavas spent some time in their ignorance here.

They also revealed two spin-off series: Civil War II: Spider-Man from writer Christos Gage and artist Travel Foreman, and [...] Civil War II: X-Men from writer Cullen Bunn and artist Andrea Broccardo. Bunn explained, [...] "This tale is set into motion by the same catalyst that sets 'Civil War II' into motion. A new power emerges among the Inhumans. This power, in Magneto's eyes, could be very dangerous to the mutant population, so—in typical Master of Magnetism fashion—he decides to take it for himself. As you can imagine, something like that could very easily start a war between the Inhumans and the mutants. Storm sees this and decides to stand in Magneto's way." [...] In Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man, Spider-Man helps a precognitive Inhuman use his powers responsibly. [...] "Over the course of the miniseries, the Inhuman will make a prediction that, while not of the world-or universe-ending variety, could well mean the end of one character's world. It's really dealing with classic Spider-Man themes: power and responsibility; facing a situation where even if you win, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> lose -- or you can just lose," [...] Gage elborated.|$|E
500|$|After riders {{board the}} sim-cars and the seat belts are fastened, {{the car that}} they {{designed}} will undergo four different tests: capability, efficiency, responsiveness, and power. In the capability test the car first connects to OnStar, then accelerates past a rain projection and skids out of control. Next, the continuing path disappears and the sim-car turns around to speed up again. A short time later, the sim-car makes a sharp left turn as a lighting bolt strikes. The car then passes by a futuristic city. Following the capability test, the results of which car designs scored {{the best in the}} test are displayed. The sim-car then begins the efficiency test. In the first part, the sim-cars are scanned for [...] "optimum eco-efficiency". The second test performs an aero-dynamic test on the vehicle. Finally, a [...] "hyper-spectrum imaging" [...] takes place. Again, after the test is complete, the best scores are displayed. The third test, responsiveness, is next. The sim-car accelerates around hairpin turns with laser-projected trees. It then enters a tunnel to encounter the 18-wheeler from the original version though it is now shown with lasers. When the vehicle exits the tunnel, the results for the responsiveness test are displayed and all of the test icons are displayed. The final test is power where the sim-car stops for a moment then accelerates through flashing purple arches to a wall with the ride's logo on it leading to the outside portion of the ride. Just after the ride exits the building, a picture of the guests is taken. As the sim-car's speed is increased, it makes a right turn, followed by a wide left, a straight section, and one final long left turn. When the test is complete, the vehicle returns to the loading station where the next riders board. Then, guests use their MagicBand, ticket, or design key that has their Chevrolet Custom Concept Vehicle that they made in the Design Studio to play games and make an ad in the [...] "Chevrolet Showroom." [...] In the showroom, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> check out some of the newest vehicles Chevrolet has created in their lineup.
