500|$|Throughout the song, {{the narrator}} {{addresses}} an unidentified girl, asking [...] "When will <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me", and lamenting {{the fact that}} she laughs at him for having nothing to his name. He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is turning under your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me". As he sees her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really mean to tell me, you love me as I am?" ...|$|E
500|$|Three weeks later, Hubbard {{abducted}} both Northrup and Alexis. On {{the night}} of February 24, 1951, Alexis was being looked after by John Sanborne while Northrup had {{a night at the}} movies. Hubbard turned up and took the child. A few hours later, he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Northrup, who was now back at her apartment: [...] "We have Alexis and you'll never see her alive unless <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> us." [...] She was bundled {{into the back of a}} car and driven to San Bernardino, California, where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane. His search was unsuccessful and he released her at Yuma Airport across the state line in Arizona. He promised that he would tell her where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she had gone with him voluntarily. Northrup agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago, where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Northrup's accusations. Rather than telling Northrup where Alexis was, he called her and said that [...] "he had cut [...] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and it was my fault, I'd done it because I'd left him." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{looked at}} her, {{but a little}} unsteadily. [...] "They asked if you were my bride, and I replied no, that <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> Lawson." ...|$|R
2500|$|Qualitative {{psychological}} research emphasizes fieldwork, {{and this}} emphasis {{has been offered}} as a distinguishing mark. Qualitative psychological research is also described as holistic. That is, qualitative researchers believe in studying phenomena in its context rather than concentrating on narrow aspects of the phenomena. This means that they either observe or participate in the phenomena they are studying, e.g. attending a football game to understand the behaviours of fan, and/or they ask open-ended questions about the behaviour of fans at football games. These questions are holistic because {{they are designed to}} understand the context of behaviour—they will usually follow a pattern that replicates the experience, e.g. [...] "What did you do when you arrived? Who did <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with?</b> What did you do then?" [...] However, similar methods are used by quantitative researchers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, when he {{was barely}} four years old, Connolly's mother {{abandoned}} her children while their father was serving as an engineer in the Royal Air Force in Burma. [...] "I've never felt abandoned by her", Connolly explained in 2009. [...] "My mother was a teenager. My father was in Burma, fighting a bloody war. The Germans were dropping all kinds of crap on the town. We lived at the docks, so that's where all the bombs were happening. She was a teenager with two kids in a slum. A guy comes along and says, 'I love <b>you.</b> <b>Come</b> <b>with</b> me.' Given the choice, I think I'd have gone with him. It looks as though it might all end next Wednesday, from where you're standing. I don't have an ounce of feelings that she abandoned me. She tried to survive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me, Allaye. <b>You</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me, to Italy. You don't go to {{that other}} man. He is too old, not healthy. <b>You</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me to Italy. Why do you send a telegram?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As you yourself," [...] Julian remarked, [...] "are {{somewhat}} concerned in this matter, I {{think it}} would be well if <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> the others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; Nasmyth's waiting. I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> me, but I won't say good-by. I'll {{look forward}} to the journey we're to make {{together}} through British Columbia." ...|$|R
6000|$|And then <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> those red mournful lips, [...] And <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> {{the whole}} of the world's tears [...] And all the trouble of her labouring ships, [...] And all the trouble of her myriad years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me. I have money. <b>You</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me, to {{my place}} in the mountains, to my uncle's house. Fine house, you like it. Come with me, Allaye." ...|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [rising]. It's settled, then, that <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's one consolation--you won't {{have much}} time for such {{proceedings}} if <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me. You'll have to work in Canada." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never was}} frightened before, but just think! How terrible {{it would be}} to meet a really wild lion! Poor Bill! I'm so glad <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot smiled upon Sir Tristram very kindly and said, [...] "I do bid <b>thee</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me {{away from}} here," [...] and Sir Tristram said, [...] "I will go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay, but {{thou art}} indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,' she cried, {{and she fell}} on her knees, and held out her arms to him. 'The robbers stole thee from me, and left thee to die,' she murmured, 'but I {{recognised}} thee when I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised, the cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain. Therefore I pray <b>thee</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of <b>thee.</b> <b>Come</b> <b>with</b> me, my son, for I have need of thy love.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{must look}} {{in at the}} House Beautiful,' said Louis, presently. 'Clara, I can't lose your company. Won't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|BROADBENT [smiling indulgently]. Well, Tim, will <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me {{and help}} to break the ice between me and your warmhearted, {{impulsive}} countrymen? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Skall to the Viking!" [...] cried Robert, aping, {{as was his}} fancy, the Norse rovers' slang. [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me to Holland?" ...|$|E
60|$|CLEOPATRA. For {{that you}} would have knelt to Caesar. No, Pothinus: <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> some plan that {{depended}} on Cleopatra being a little nursery kitten. Now that Cleopatra is a Queen, the plan is upset.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{saw your}} name in the book, Miss Huntley, and know whom <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>with.</b> I think <b>you</b> ought {{to go back to}} Edinburgh at once and must urge you {{strongly}} not to go to Canada." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I {{should have}} liked it, as I thought it so good of <b>you</b> to <b>come.</b> But as <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> Mrs Stumfold, I {{was not quite}} sure whether it might be intended; and then I didn't know,--did not exactly know,--where you lived." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me, young sir, if you please,' he said, {{opening the}} door, 'and I shall have the {{pleasure}} of taking you home.' ...|$|E
60|$|And now I {{lift the}} curtain that hangs {{between here and}} No-man's-land. Will <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me, sweet Reader? I thank you. Give me your hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "And assuredly I {{shall be}} happy to see you, John--if <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> a certain purpose. If you have no such purpose, you had better remain away." ...|$|E

60|$|YOUNG M. There! That's enough! You're gettin' excited. <b>You</b> <b>come</b> away <b>with</b> me.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I you," [...] {{cried the}} guardsman. [...] "My name is Amory de Catinat, once of the {{regiment}} of Picardy. Surely you are Achille de la Noue de Sainte Marie, whom I remember when <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> your {{father to the}} government levees at Quebec." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That may be seen, young man, if <b>you</b> will <b>come</b> <b>with</b> me," [...] said Cennini.
