5|$|As the war <b>years</b> <b>went,</b> the newspaper's {{finances}} gradually improved. The Norwegian state {{became more}} active in production and trade and contributed many advertisements. Demokraten acquired its own type-setting machine in October 1918 and a printing press in 1917, which it used from 1 January 1918. From 1 July 1918, circulation once again increased to six days a week.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by {{with further}} childlessness, Ernest became more distant to his wife, and was {{continually}} unfaithful. Though Alexandrine {{continued to be}} devoted, choosing to ignore those relationships she was aware of, her loyalty became increasingly baffling to those outside her immediate family. By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest took no further interest in his wife.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>years</b> <b>went</b> on, {{the disease}} slowly {{destroyed}} Reagan's mental capacity. He was {{only able to}} recognize a few people, including his wife, Nancy. He remained active, however; he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches, played golf regularly, and until 1999 he often went to his office in nearby Century City.|$|E

5|$|Another {{key figure}} in Skagen, P.S. Krøyer, married Marie Triepcke after {{falling in love with}} her in Paris in 1888. The {{daughter}} of a prosperous German loomery engineer, she was said to be {{the most beautiful woman in}} Copenhagen. However, as the <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by, Krøyer's health began to deteriorate and Marie was increasingly unhappy with their marriage. The marriage finally ended in a divorce in 1905 when Marie became pregnant after an affair with the composer Hugo Alfvén whom she then married. Krøyer died in Skagen four years later, apparently as a result of mental illness.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, when Horatio was 14 and due {{to leave}} the orphanage, he ran away without waiting for the formalities. His aunt Caroline Praill—his mother's sister—who lived in nearby Edgbaston, gave him a home, while he worked as an errand boy in a Birmingham {{building}} firm. This arrangement lasted {{only a few months}} before Horatio, impatient to be reunited with his sister from whom he had been separated for six <b>years,</b> <b>went</b> to London where he began an apprenticeship with a wood engraver.|$|E
5|$|In later life, she {{eventually}} adopted more conventional behaviour, took up pious works and even reformed the convent that became her second {{residence in the}} Paris suburbs. As the <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by she suffered serious setbacks to her health and the sadness of mourning her eldest son, Grand Prince Ferdinando, for whom {{she had had a}} genuine affection. Rendered financially independent by a legacy, she purchased a house in Paris, from which she spent {{the end of her life}} dispensing charity and keeping up dignified correspondence.|$|E

5|$|Morse died in 1940, after 34 {{years as}} director, and several <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by without a strong local leadership. To ensure a sounder footing for the future, Coonley merged Avery Coonley with the National College of Education (NCE, {{formerly}} the Chicago Kindergarten College and now National-Louis University) in Evanston, Illinois, in 1943. The two institutions had close ties {{dating back to}} Morse's Kindergarten College days, and the arrangement {{took advantage of the}} NCE's financial and teaching resources while Avery Coonley provided a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. Under NCE management, ACS continued to offer a curriculum that emphasized practical learning, outdoor education—including farming—and hands-on activities like automobile repair. German and French were added in 1949, with students beginning conversational French in first grade.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{architect}} Władysław Horodecki originally {{constructed the}} House with Chimaeras {{for use as}} his own upmarket apartment building {{during the period of}} 1901–1902. However, as the <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by, Horodecki eventually had to sell the building due to financial troubles, after which it changed ownership numerous times before finally being occupied by an official Communist Party polyclinic until the early 2000s. When the building was vacated, its interior and exterior decor were fully reconstructed and restored according to Horodecki original plans.|$|E
5|$|With {{progress}} in palaeontology, {{the reputation of}} the models declined. In 1895, the American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh scorned the dinosaurs' friends as doing them a great injustice, and spoke angrily of the models. The models and the park fell into disrepair as the <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by, a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936, and the models became obscured by overgrown foliage. A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin, at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well-protected locations in the park, where they were exposed to wear and tear. The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|According to Aonuma, the team's {{starting}} point for development was the Wii version of Twilight Princess: feeling they had not fully realized their goal of creating a vast and realistic world with Twilight Princess, they used their previous work {{as a foundation for}} the next title. They also sought to create a memorable experience equivalent to , by that time considered the series' most memorable title. Development lasted around five years, and according to series producer Shigeru Miyamoto, the game's budget was considered quite high for a Nintendo project. The development time was initially estimated at three years, but difficulties and changes in the game's development extended development time by a further two years: despite this, Miyamoto felt that this was not wasted development time as the first two <b>years</b> <b>went</b> into experimentation. By June 2011, the game was complete aside from fine tuning and balancing its mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was said}} by chroniclers to be good-looking, red-haired, freckled, {{with a large}} head; he had a short, stocky body and was bow-legged from riding. Often he was scruffily dressed. Not as {{reserved}} as his mother Matilda, nor as charming as his father Geoffrey, Henry was famous for his energy and drive. He was also infamous for his piercing stare, bullying, bursts of temper and, on occasion, his sullen refusal to speak at all. Some of these outbursts, however, may have been theatrical and for effect. Henry {{was said to have}} understood a wide range of languages, including English, but spoke only Latin and French. In his youth Henry enjoyed warfare, hunting and other adventurous pursuits; as the <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by he put increasing energy into judicial and administrative affairs and became more cautious, but throughout his life he was energetic and frequently impulsive.|$|E
25|$|In the past, APL {{compilation}} {{was regarded}} as a means to achieve execution speed comparable to other mainstream languages, especially on mainframe computers. Several APL compilers achieved some levels of success, though comparatively little of the development effort spent on APL over the <b>years</b> <b>went</b> to perfecting compilation into machine code.|$|E

25|$|Yeltsin's {{personal}} and health problems received {{a great deal}} of attention in the global press. As the <b>years</b> <b>went</b> on, he was often viewed as an increasingly unstable leader, rather than the inspiring figure he was once seen as. The possibility that he might die in office was often discussed. Starting in the last years of his presidential term, Yeltsin's primary residence was the Gorki-9 presidential dacha west of Moscow. He made frequent stays at the nearby government sanatorium in Barvikha.|$|E

Schroeder, Lucy van Pelt, and her brother Linus debuted as very young children—with Schroeder and Linus both in diapers and pre-verbal.

25|$|Friends of Central Library {{presented}} an alternative {{plan to the}} Council and its developers which retained the library at {{the centre of the}} Paradise Circus scheme.

However Birmingham City Council, Birmingham Civic Society, CABE and Argent Group strongly opposed any plans to retain the library and consequently the battle was lost.|$|E
