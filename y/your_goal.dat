500|$|Dark Forces {{gameplay}} {{has been}} described as [...] "challenging" [...] and has generally received praise. Ron Dulin, reviewing the game for GameSpot, highlights the implementation of puzzles within levels: [...] "The levels are diverse and ingenious, with plenty of creative obstacles standing between you and <b>your</b> <b>goal.</b> While they can be occasionally frustrating, Dark Forces diverse gameplay requirements make this title more mentally challenging than your average key hunt." [...] The graphics and sound were both praised as helping to immerse the player in the environment.|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} [...] "Saw VI is the thinnest, draggiest, and most tediously preachy of the Saw films. It's {{the first one}} that's more or less {{consumed}} by backstory—which is to say, it's one of those hollow franchise placeholders in which far too many fragments from the previous sequels keep popping up in flashbacks." [...] He said, [...] "If <b>your</b> <b>goal</b> is to do a quick study for a round of Saw Trivial Pursuit, then {{this may be the}} movie for you. If you're looking to be jolted into fear or queasy laughter, skip this sequel and hope that the producers get their sick act together next time." [...] Rob Nelson of Variety wrote, [...] "Squeezing another pint of blood from its torture-porn corpus, Lionsgate slays again with Saw VI, a film so frighteningly familiar it could well be called 'Saw It Already'. At least the requisite moralism is more playful than pious in this edition", but added, [...] "Presumably owing to director Kevin Greutert's work as editor of all five previous Saw pics, the film's juggling of chronology is the franchise's best...." [...] Christopher Monfette of IGN Movies rated Saw VI three out of five and wrote that [...] "while Saw VI certainly offers a redemption for the series and the promise of a coming power struggle for Jigsaw's legacy, Saw Ⅶ will no doubt mark the time to either shake things up or watch this franchise get the ax".|$|E

500|$|With the Queen's Birthday match {{marketed as}} the club's biggest match during the year, then-senior coach, Dean Bailey, {{promoted}} {{the debut of}} Watts by imploring fans to come along so they [...] "will look back {{at this time in}} three, four or five years to see where it all began {{and to be able to}} say I was there the day Jack Watts made his debut". His first touch saw him gang tackled by three Collingwood players, another contest saw him beaten by Martin Clarke, which led to a Collingwood goal; Collingwood captain, Nick Maxwell, gestured to Watts [...] "that's <b>your</b> <b>goal,</b> mate! Welcome to real footy". The team ultimately lost by sixty-six points with Watts recording just eight disposals, a mark and a behind, playing on the half-forward line. He retained his spot the next week for a forty-eight point loss against [...] at Etihad Stadium in which he kicked his first AFL goal. Recording nine disposals in his second match, the excitement surrounding Watts quickly turned to criticism with his school football coach and former AFL footballer, Robert Shaw, stating that he was not ready for AFL football. Premiership player and coach, Leigh Matthews, said he had not seen anything in Watts' first two matches to warrant him being the number one draft pick. He played his third and final AFL match of the year the next week in the fifty-five point loss against [...] at the Gabba, where The Age journalist, Andrew Stafford, noted his confidence looked low. He spent the remainder of the year playing in the VFL.|$|E

2500|$|In 1926, at the {{suggestion}} of the students, Hilda Worthington Smith admitted the first five African-American students to the summer school. The decision was a controversial one, given that the college had never admitted a black student. M.

Thy Dungeonman has two sequels: Thy Dungeonman II, which expands on the features of the original game and can only be found on the Videlectrix site, and Thy Dungeonman III which adds basic graphics and {{can be found on the}} Homestar Runner site. [...] "Ye Flask" [...] and [...] "Ye can't get ye flask" [...] have become catch-phrases in the Homestar Runner universe, eventually spawning a T-shirt in the Homestar Runner store.|$|E

His philosophy of architectural work may be summed up in his quote [...] "The first thing you've got to remember is that it's your client's money you're spending. <b>Your</b> <b>goal</b> is to achieve the best results by following their wishes.

The moon, the planet of women, sways us back from our day-self, sways us back from our real social unison, sways us back, like a {{retreating}} tide, in a friction of criticism and separation and social disintegration. That is woman's inevitable mode, let her words be what they will. Her goal is the deep, sensual individualism of secrecy and night-exclusiveness, hostile, with guarded doors. And you'll have to fight {{very hard to make}} a woman yield her goal to yours, to make her, in her own soul, believe in <b>your</b> <b>goal</b> as the goal beyond, in her goal as the way by which you go.

You have not yet conceived what excellence is: you must unlearn your mistaken admirations. You must know what you have to strive for, and then you must subdue your mind and body to unbroken discipline. Your mind, I say. For you must not be thinking of celebrity: put that candle out of your eyes, and look only at excellence. You would of course earn nothing--you could get no engagement for a long while. You would need money for yourself and your family. But that," [...] here Klesmer frowned and shook his fingers as if to dismiss a triviality, [...] "that could perhaps be found." ...|$|E
