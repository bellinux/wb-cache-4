2500|$|The 2011/12 season saw Sammy improve as a batsman: in {{the series}} against India and Australia Sammy scored over 100runs, which he had not done {{previously}} in a Test series. This trend continued when the West Indies toured England in May 2012. Sammy began the series with scores of 17 and 37 in the first Test at Lord's, during which he passed 3,000runs in first-class cricket. In the following Test, in his 26th Test, Sammy registered his maiden Test century. It was just the seventh time a number eight batsman had scored a century for the West Indies. Sammy partnered Marlon Samuels in a 204-run stand, the second-highest for the West Indies' seventh wicket. The West Indies lost the Test and drew the next one to lose the series 2–0; Sammy finished with 201runs from five innings and was his team's third highest run-scorer {{in the series}} while his six wickets cost 48.50runs each.• Commenting on Sammy's performance in the series, former West Indies captain Viv Richards said [...] "All {{of a sudden there}} was this new-found confidence. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> leader who can come out to the middle and make some sort of contribution. He has done enough and should not feel he has one foot in and one foot out as far as the leadership in concerned. He has done his bit to provide a winning environment." ...|$|E
