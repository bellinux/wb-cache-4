In 1995, Professor Douglas Melton, of the Harvard University Biology department, said, [...] "If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. If <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> cold water, it will jump before it gets hot—they don't sit still for you." [...] Dr. George R. Zug, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the National Museum of Natural History, also rejected the suggestion, saying that [...] "If a frog had a means of getting out, it certainly would get out." ...|$|E

So one could well imagine—again, {{it depends on what}} the blue-ribbon panel says—one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymore—that's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.|$|E

500|$|Music critics universally {{criticized the}} video {{because of the}} limited amount of {{clothing}} Hilson wore in it. In an interview with gossip hound Perez Hilton, Hilson defended the clip, calling the video [...] "racy" [...] but {{in line with the}} perspective of her album: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> context with my album, my album is called No Boys Allowed but really it means no bullshit allowed. In this album, I was screaming in a room — just like I was screaming in the song — I was screaming in a room with all my girlfriends, yelling all the shit we really say." [...] Rebecca Thomas of MTV News wrote: [...] "A platinum-blond Keri gyrates, thrusts, licks and gets (way) low as she laces the song with enough saucy language and expletives to make your favorite rapper blush." [...] while Jocelyn Vena the same news division of MTV commented that even though there are several cameo appearances in the mini-move, it is ultimately Hilson's [...] "scantily clad popping and locking that has everyone buzzing." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine called the video [...] "overproduced and under-clothed." ...|$|E
500|$|Shakira and Amanda Ghost, the {{executive}} {{producers of the}} album, enlisted {{a diverse group of}} producers to collaborate on the tracks, such as Pharrell Williams, one half of the record production duo The Neptunes, who co-wrote four of the tracks on the album with Shakira. Other collaborators included John Hill, Sam Endicott, and Timbaland. Shakira later said that her collaboration with Williams helped her learn a lot, noting [...] "When collaborating you always try and capture something from the other person and I learnt a lot from his method". The singer revealed that the two readied four tracks in five days, and commented that [...] "What was interesting is that he's very fast and immediate in the studio and I'm a little slower". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, was personally called by Shakira to co-compose the title track of the album along with Hill. He explained how they both began working with the single, saying she [...] "contacted him , asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we put in there and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". Haitian-American rapper Wyclef Jean, who previously appeared as a featured artist on [...] "Hips Don't Lie" [...] with Shakira, talked about his chemistry with her, saying [...] "I have a natural chemistry with Shakira. I love the Latin vibe. The Lebanese vibe. I love the multicultural aspect of the CD. These days it's hard for you to pick up a CD and love it from beginning to end. Shakira represents that 360 degrees of: <b>You</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in,</b> and the whole CD rocks". In She Wolf, Jean appears as a featured artist on the track [...] "Spy".|$|E
2500|$|Conservative {{columnist}} Charles Krauthammer {{argued that}} between $60–200 {{billion per year}} could be saved through tort reform. Physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean explained why tort reform {{is not part of}} the bills under consideration: [...] "When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that, the more stuff <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> it, the more enemies you make, right?...And the reason tort reform is not on the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on.

2500|$|The {{supposed}} {{behavior of}} frogs illustrating nonaction is {{told in the}} often-repeated story of the boiled frog: put a frog in boiling water and it will jump out, but put it in cold water and slowly heat it, {{and it will not}} notice the danger and will be boiled alive. The story was based on nineteenth century experiments in which frogs were shown to stay in heating water {{as long as it was}} heated very slowly. The validity of the experiments is however disputed. Professor Douglas Melton, Harvard University Biology Department, says: [...] "If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die.

2500|$|The Water Babies, a {{fairy tale}} for a land baby by Charles Kingsley (serialised in Macmillan's Magazine 1862–63, {{published}} in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's On the Origin of Species, having [...] "long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species", and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin's theory, with the main scientific participants appearing, including Richard Owen and Huxley. In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Edward Linley Sambourne (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: Dear Grandpater– Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day?– Your loving Julian. Huxley wrote back: My dear Julian– I could never make sure about that Water Baby... My friend who wrote {{the story of the}} Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did– There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things.When you grow up I dare say you {{will be one of the}} great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing.|$|E
