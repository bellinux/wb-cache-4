His father had {{arranged}} the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> manual labour {{for the rest of}} your life you'll know that when you do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – if you decide what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> – being good at your craft or your skill." [...] Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job. Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in the storeroom.|$|E

500|$|There {{are over}} [...] of hiking trails at Worlds End State Park.

As John Young writes in Hike Pennsylvania, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some hiking in the Worlds End region, you should know that hiking here means climbing". Worlds End State Park is open during the winter months for snow mobiling and cross-country skiing. Most of the trails are too steep or rugged for either activity, but the park roads are open, as are trails on surrounding state forest lands.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between both managers was evidently hostile to begin with. Ferguson noted that Wenger {{was the only}} manager he came across in the league not to share a drink with after matches – an English football [...] "tradition". In a joint interview with The Times and Daily Mail in 2009, Wenger said his discourtesy was mistaken for mistrust and managers [...] "cannot be completely friendly and open up." [...] When asked {{if this was the}} reason he avoided the post-match drink, he replied: [...] "Most of the time, yes. What can you say if you have won? And if you have lost all <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is get home and prepare for the next game." ...|$|E

Sound {{designer}} Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team [...] "scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms" [...] in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to [...] "avoid sounding slick or sci-fi". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried [...] "affected his comedy", and [...] "the last thing <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in a story like this is affect performances".|$|E

The Wii version scored a bit higher, with a 53% at GameRankings and 53 out of 100 at Metacritic. The PS2 and Wii versions of Revenge of the Fallen were panned for having awful controls. Specifically, IGN stated that [...] "the game will often ignore what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and instead does something different", giving the game 4.2 out of 10. GameZone panned the controls of the Wii version, saying that [...] "control problems – among other missteps – ruined this game".|$|E
500|$|Campbell {{was seen}} refusing to shake Rooney's {{hand at the}} final whistle {{and there were no}} {{customary}} shirt swaps between both sets of players; it was alleged that the Arsenal players wore T-shirts emblazoned with [...] "50 not out", though this has never been proven. Tempers boiled over in the players' tunnel in front of police officers. Several Arsenal players were held back, one of whom was Henry, incensed that Ferdinand claimed the man-of-the-match award. The conflict sparked into life when Wenger confronted Van Nistelrooy as he was unhappy with the striker's challenge on Cole. Ferguson intervened and told Wenger to leave his players alone, but the Arsenal manager faced him and said [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about it?" ...|$|E

It was all Tony Wilson's idea {{to make it more}} classical. He had {{aspirations}} that I should be taken more seriously. That never interested me. Everyone's obsessed with form. 'Is it avant-garde?

500|$|The {{songs for}} Frozen were written and {{composed}} by the husband-and-wife songwriting team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, {{both of whom}} had previously worked with Disney Animation on Winnie the Pooh (2011) (also produced by Del Vecho, who then hired them for Frozen) and before that, with Disney Parks on Finding Nemo– The Musical (2007). Lopez first heard Disney Animation's pitch while in Los Angeles working on The Book of Mormon, but Disney was so eager to get both of them on board that the production team traveled to New York City to also pitch the film in person to Anderson-Lopez (who was busy raising the couple's two young daughters). Lopez believes Disney was particularly interested in his wife's strong story talent. The decision, of course, was easy: [...] "Whenever Disney asks if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a fairy tale musical, you say yes." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{shoots the}} {{entirety}} of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences. In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need to be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because then why did <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E

500|$|Pavement had {{attained}} {{a degree of}} success within the underground music scene with its 1989 debut EP Slay Tracks (1933-1969). While Malkmus was traveling to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, Kannberg managed Slay Tracks release on the band's self-owned label, Treble Kicker. Slay Tracks {{caught the attention of}} Dan Koretzky, an avid record collector working at Reckless Records in Chicago. Koretzky ordered 200 copies of the EP for the record store, and asked Kannberg to sign to his newly started independent label, Drag City. At the time the members of Pavement anticipated no further releases beyond Slay Tracks, and Kannberg initially expressed reluctance to sign to any label. Kannberg later said [...] "I started talking to [...] and in our conversations he said 'I'm starting this label. Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something for us?'

Carey explained the process behind the song's conception, saying that Margulies would play different notes on an electric keyboard with Carey directing him on chord changes, and provided the lyrics, chorus and melody. Producer Ric Wake later recalled that [...] "Someday" [...] was his favorite song from the beginning of recording sessions for the album, saying [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.'

Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound compared the song with the works of The Rapture and The Clash's 1982 album, Combat Rock; he said it was [...] "strictly for basement dancefloors everywhere". According to Armstrong, the lyrics of [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] can be considered as [...] "a sweeping political statement" [...] rather than being interpreted as [...] "a comment on electronic music figures". He told Rolling Stone the song is about [...] "static and noise...Like this government cannot, will not, agree with itself. They refuse to make it work. Right, left—it doesn’t matter.

The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all the Warners was [...] "Hello-o-o, nurse!" [...] Tom Ruegger said that the [...] "Hello-o-o, Nurse!" [...] line {{was intended to be}} a catchphrase much like Bugs Bunny's line, [...] "What's up, doc?" [...] Before the theme song for each [...] "Pinky and the Brain" [...] segment, Pinky asks, [...] "Gee, Brain, what do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> tonight?" [...] Brain replies, [...] "The same thing we do every night, Pinky: try to take over the world!" [...] During these episodes, Brain often asks Pinky, [...] "Are you pondering what I'm pondering?"
