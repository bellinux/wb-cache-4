500|$|A {{writer for}} PR Newswire praised the album, {{describing}} it as [...] "showcasing" [...] Jackson's vocal talent and viewed The Stripped Mixes as shining a [...] "bright, fresh light" [...] on Jackson's early career {{as both a}} solo artist and with his brothers in The Jackson 5. Natalie Salvo of TheDwarf.com.au commented that the mix of [...] "Ain't No Sunshine" [...] made the album [...] "personally" [...] worth buying. She added that [...] "the music does what it's supposed to do", which was [...] "evoking the right mood but not being overly showy." [...] Despite the praise, she did state that the album could be clinically looked at as an [...] "element of bad taste" [...] from a [...] "greedy record company" [...] and noted that it was [...] "difficult" [...] to [...] "stop yourself being overcome with cynicism towards this album". Jeff Dorgay of Tone Publications described all of the album's tracks as being [...] "quite strong" [...] and added that [...] "regardless of <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Michael Jackson" [...] The Stripped Mixes is a disc [...] "you should have in your collection" [...] because it offers a [...] "rare look" [...] at [...] "classic" [...] material by Jackson {{when he was just}} beginning his career.|$|E

You're not saving me, I take it, for <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> myself, but for <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> our friend. The one's at any rate wholly dependent on the other. You can't in honour not see me through," [...] she wound up, [...] "because you can't in honour not see HIM." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Without {{giving an}} {{unqualified}} assent {{to what you}} say,' returned Arthur, gloomily, 'I am much obliged to you for <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing whatever! You may {{possibly}} {{consider my}} attitude selfish," [...] the Marquis added, [...] "but I find myself wholly indifferent to <b>your</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> this matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will stay, Checco,' I said. 'I am {{not well}} known as you are. I {{will take care of}} your father, and you can watch over your family and <b>your</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> safety.' ...|$|R
60|$|But he need be in no haste about it, and of course, {{it would}} be the very {{farthest}} from his desire to imperil, in the slightest degree, <b>your</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> order to save his own.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, you have; it's Ben Franklin, of City-Hall yard. You know him; and {{he wished}} me {{to thank you}} for <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't be broke so long's you've {{still kept}} <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the firm, an' that eighty-six cents {{has grown to}} more'n two dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am most {{flattered by}} <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> me," [...] she declared. [...] "Pray {{consider}} Mr. Englehall disposed of. You {{have some other}} plans, perhaps?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] ejaculated Carroll. [...] "I won't ask why she {{was willing}} to do so--it {{concerns}} you more than me--but I think that as regards <b>your</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> the Clermont a warning from her would be worth as much as one from Nairn; that is, if she could be depended on." ...|$|R
6000|$|Forel did so, {{and nodded}} when Alton concluded, [...] "I {{think you should}} do what I want you to, because {{in the first place}} it will give you very little trouble, and if you can't take my word so far, I'm not fit to be trusted with <b>your</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> the big deal we have in hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'One last question,' he said, and {{suddenly}} came closer to me, suddenly {{spoke with a}} marked emphasis on his next words: 'What is <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> this?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am much {{obliged to}} you for <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> my niece; but I fear there would be objections. More than that, she is devoted to this man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could be}} nothing so discourteous," [...] said Mr. Caryll. [...] "Would it be prying {{on my part}} to inquire what may be <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> my papers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe I can get <b>your</b> uncle <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> my land," [...] {{suggested}} Mr. Franklin. [...] "I wish he'd look it over. It wouldn't {{cost him}} anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A part of it. Because I have {{ventured to}} ask <b>your</b> daughter's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> a native woman I brought down I {{will tell you}} what it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then you {{perceive}} I have <b>your</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> view when I {{tell you}} it is your duty to use what influence {{you have to get}} some provision made.' ...|$|R
60|$|Allow me {{to thank}} you {{beforehand}} for <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the cause, and {{to look forward to}} the pleasure of doing so in person, when I come to Manchester.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{inclined}} to think your visit concerned me. I've noticed <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> young Crestwick--it's obvious--I don't know whether one {{could say the same}} of the cause of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt, Mr. Newcome; and {{you will}} also find a {{covenant}} in the same lease, by which <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the property is to cease in a few days." ...|$|E
5000|$|Queen's Diamond Jubilee - 2012 [...] "for your {{contribution}} to radio journalism, your {{many years as}} {{a radio talk show}} host, and <b>your</b> keen <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> human and public affairs" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray don't think I am {{unworthy of}} <b>your</b> kind <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> my welfare," [...] he pleaded. [...] "Can {{you tell me}} of any facts which justify what you have just said?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR MISS GARTH--I {{have just}} written, {{with a heavy}} heart, to my uncle, and I think I owe it to <b>your</b> kind <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> me not to omit writing next to you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I quite {{understand}} <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> your family pictures--and all of it,' she remarked more gently, willing {{not to hurt}} the sensitive feelings of a man so full of romance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{fear that}} it would be idle, madame. Yet <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> me is very flattering, and I thank you. It is unfortunate for me that I am so headstrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{forgiveness}} is needed, madam. I {{thank you for}} <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> him, and for your plain speaking according to your lights. I can but act according to those vouchsafed unto me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I {{understand}} that your principal reason {{in coming to}} Leigh was that your son should in time be able to sail your boat. That reason does not exist any longer, and you might therefore be as well anywhere else as here. Your brother can look after <b>your</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> boat, and you will get the same share of its profits {{as if you were}} living here. I think for your son's sake as well as your daughter's, it would be pleasanter and better that you were away from here.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he said, [...] "that <b>your</b> friend's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> you was {{not entirely}} unselfish. For three days he has carried in his pocket an order instructing him to produce you here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To pay my bills," [...] {{replied the}} captain, with a {{touching}} simplicity. [...] "Pray understand! I never was--and never shall be--personally desirous of paying a single farthing to any human creature on the habitable globe.

6000|$|... "Yes; {{but he must}} {{be brought}} from Buffalo. It will be expensive, sir. That is why I ask if <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the girl {{warrants}} our going to the limit to save her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We mean to {{keep you}} by us, sir," [...] said Mr. Green on his other side, [...] "until you have {{explained}} {{what you were doing}} with those papers--what is <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Then the {{arrangement}} wouldn’t suit me. I {{know more about}} the vessel than you do, and I’ve been accustomed to directing things. But I’ll bid you five thousand dollars for <b>your</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the wreck.” ...|$|E
