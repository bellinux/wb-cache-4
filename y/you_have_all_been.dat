500|$|Napoleon breakfasted off {{silver plate}} at Le Caillou, {{the house where}} {{he had spent the}} night. When Soult {{suggested}} that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, [...] "Just because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Monkey! what's {{the matter}} now?' exclaimed Albinia; 'I suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> spoiling him. But what's become of Lucy?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For that matter, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> canny {{enough to}} have means enough to balance all that barren moorland. You are a richer man than I shall ever be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, indeed, for {{the first}} forty minutes. I wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> there. It was better fun I take it than {{shooting}} rabbits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} anxious about you all," [...] I said, [...] "for it is some little time since I have {{seen or heard}} from any of <b>you.</b> How <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> keeping?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, Dr. Kenn {{has been}} preaching against buckram, and <b>you</b> ladies <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> sending him a roundrobin, saying, 'This {{is a hard}} doctrine; who can bear it?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} Miss Helstone <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> palavering about. She's an ugly girl. I hate her. I hate all womenites. I {{wonder what they}} were made for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now then, my dear," [...] she said, [...] "I {{have known}} a talk must soon come. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> {{very good to}} me to leave it so long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have changed}} one 'Southern brother' from an enemy into a friend. Whether I live or die, I never can forget how generous and kind <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look, Aunt Pen! what lovely {{shells and}} moss I've got! Such a splendid {{scramble}} over the rocks as I've had with Mrs. Duncan's boys! It seemed so like home {{to run and}} sing with a troop of topsy-turvy children that it did me good; and I wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> there to see." [...] cried Debby, running into the drawing-room, one day, where Mrs. Carroll and a circle of ladies sat enjoying a dish of highly flavored scandal, as they exercised their eyesight over fancy-work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "this is {{a painful}} case. The circumstances, {{as you will}} readily admit when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> heard <b>all,</b> <b>are</b> peculiar. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> asked me where Mr. Wilberfloss is. I do not know." ...|$|R
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> {{through your}} meditations? [They all gather round him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Not {{much change}} since last night," [...] he said. [...] "I feel quite ashamed of myself, {{for having been}} {{sleeping}} in my berth while <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> exposed to this gale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} awfully sorry {{to go away}} from you, Mr. Medlin, and from Mrs. Medlin and the others. It has been so jolly with you, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> so kind." ...|$|E
60|$|There <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> that <b>is</b> {{known of}} Dorotea Caracciolo's abduction, which later writers--including Bembo in his Historiae--have {{positively}} assigned to Cesare Borgia, drawing upon their imagination {{to fill up}} the lacunae in the story so as to support their point of view.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{man who was}} at {{its head}} when it existed. The {{criminal}} department, as <b>you</b> know, <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> done away with.

6000|$|... "That," [...] {{he pointed}} out, [...] "is my signal, {{and there is}} the answer. The {{documents}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> read about <b>are</b> in that envelope." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is such a}} fine {{evening that}} I was tempted {{to come and see}} the {{magnolia}} that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> boasting of: and really it is worth seeing. Those white blossoms are magnificent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I did--what wonder? I {{had heard}} {{much about the}} great heiress, Eliza Laurance, and the great beauty, Eliza Laurance. I {{supposed}} they were one and the same. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> careful not to undeceive me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{paper in}} the Spectator beats thy best, Dick, thou sluggard," [...] the Right Honorable Mr. Addison exclaimed. [...] "He {{is the author of}} that famous No. 996, for which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> giving me the credit." ...|$|E
60|$|The letters {{spoken of}} by <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>all</b> <b>been</b> received. One sent to Galena I got and answered. My promise {{to write to}} you every two weeks has been {{complied}} with, and however busy I may be I shall continue to write if it is but a line.|$|R
60|$|THE CLERK. I heard <b>you.</b> Would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>all</b> {{right if}} it had been the widows you wanted to get round.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{man who was}} at {{its head}} when it existed," [...] Peter replied. [...] "The {{criminal}} department, as <b>you</b> know, <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> done away with.

60|$|VIOLET. You! Oh, how infamous! how abominable! How disgracefully <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> {{talking about}} me! If my husband knew it {{he would never}} let me speak to any of you again. [To Ramsden] I think you might have spared me, at least.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it is I {{who must}} go; {{but it seems}} so hard to leave this safe and happy home, and wander away into the wide, cold world again. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> too kind to me, and now {{separation}} breaks my heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} would, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> so {{kind to me}} I {{did n't want to}} trouble you with my little plans till the first steps were taken. Besides, I did n't know as you would like to {{recommend}} me as a teacher, though you like me well enough as plain Polly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>all</b> {{alone in}} the house, my poor child," [...] said Carey, as she felt the girl shuddering in her close embrace.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bless you!' said Miss Knag, bestowing a kiss upon Kate at the {{conclusion}} of the second day's work, 'how very awkward <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>all</b> day.' ...|$|R
40|$|I {{dedicate}} {{this thesis}} to my family. Without <b>you</b> <b>all,</b> I would <b>have</b> given {{up a long}} time ago. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> my biggest supporters from the start, and I {{want you to know}} that your guidance and love has not been forgotten. I would never have been able to complete this degree without you all. Thank you! I also want to make an individual dedication to my wife, Sam. All of my life I have tried to be my best, but you make me my best. You bring out the best of me in everything I do. You will never know how much you truly mean to me. Thank you so much! i...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes that {{is another}} plan," [...] said the teacher, [...] "but there are {{objections}} to it. Can any of you think what they are? I suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been,</b> either at this school, or at some other, required to bring written excuses, {{so that you have}} seen the plan tried; now have you never noticed any objection to it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Doctor, I will obey your instructions. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> {{very kind}} to me, and a Malay chief never forgets benefits. I have been hostile to the white men, but now I see I have been mistaken, and that you are good and kind. Is it true that your boat is going up the river? Soh Hay tells {{me that it is}} so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They did knock {{me on the}} head, {{and very}} hard too, Captain Dave. If my skull hadn't been quite so thick, I should, as you say, have been food for fishes before now, for {{that is what they}} meant me for, and there is no thanks to them that I am here at present. I am sorry that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> made so uncomfortable about me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless me!" [...] cried Dr. May, in some anger; [...] "what <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> {{thinking}} about {{to keep this}} to yourselves all this time?" ...|$|R
