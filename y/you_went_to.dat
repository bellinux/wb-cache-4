500|$|Even though Besman had his {{own record}} label, Sensation Records, he {{licensed}} [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] to Los Angeles-based Modern Records. [...] On November 3, 1948, it was released nationally and Hooker commented on its immediate appeal: [...] "The thing caught afire. [...] It was ringin' all around the country. [...] When it come out, every juke box <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to,</b> every place <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to...</b> they were playing it there". [...] Because of the response, Nashville, Tennessee, radio station WLAC, a 50,000 watt clear-channel station that reached fifteen states and Canada, played the song ten {{times in a row}} during one broadcast night. [...] It entered the Billboard Race Records chart on January 8, 1949, where it remained for eighteen weeks, and reached number one on February 19, 1949. It became the most popular race record of 1949 and reportedly sold [...] "several hundred thousand" [...] to one million copies. [...] In an experience similar to Muddy Waters' 1950 hit [...] "Rollin' Stone", the song's popularity allowed Hooker to give up his factory job and concentrate on music.|$|E
500|$|Australian {{novelist and}} critic Robert Drewe gave a {{positive}} review, praising {{the performance of}} Breuls, the cinematography by Martin McGrath, and director Steven Vidler's choice of such a controversial subject for a first film. Upon noting that the filmmakers deliberately insisted that their characters be portrayed as different from the actual {{people involved in the}} Leigh Leigh murder as possible, Drewe said the film is [...] "asking a lot of Australian audiences to expunge reality from their memories", though he concluded that the film should be [...] "compulsory viewing for all Australian teenagers." [...] Rob Lowing from The Sun-Herald noted that the film belonged to a slew of Australasian films that focused on middle class life and ultimately gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, stating, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> see Romper Stomper, Metal Skin, Idiot Box or Once Were Warriors, this gritty, punchy social drama ably fits into that class." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures.

The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E

Ollie Barbieri did some research to help him in playing JJ, who has Asperger syndrome. He said that, in initial episodes, he played JJ as [...] "quite mad and I jumped around a lot", though by this episode his portrayal was [...] "watered down a bit". Charles Martin shot an unscripted scene that involved Barbieri destroying the set of JJ's bedroom; Martin believed this would help Barbieri to get into JJ's mindset. Barbieri was also able {{to learn more about}} his character by creating the collage in JJ's room himself, in which JJ has tried to organise his thoughts about his friends and his life. Martin said that he and Barbieri had a [...] "very involved director-actor relationship" [...] and that he enjoyed [...] "JJ" [...] the most out of all the episodes he directed in the series. According to runner Laurence Wigfield, JJ's clinic was described in the script as [...] "a desolate shabby place, the kind of place <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> die", with the bracketed suggestion of Fishponds Studio, where the Skins offices are. Though Wigfield initially [...] "couldn't believe" [...] this, the studio was used for filming the scene, which Wigfield admitted [...] "worked quite well". The scene in which JJ and Emily bond after meeting at the clinic was filmed in Bristol's Brandon Hill Park, near Cabot Tower.|$|E
500|$|Arnold Wayne Jones {{from the}} Dallas Voice gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, writing that the show [...] "has all of the Material Girl's majesty and fetishistic eroticism, merged with lots of disturbing, violent imagery and a huge catalog of songs". Jones {{concluded}} that Madonna was more provocative than before with the release. Chuck Campbell from The Republic gave the album three and a half stars out of five, writing that [...] "an ambitious woman like Madonna will not let herself become a nostalgia act". He added that Madonna makes that clear every time she goes on tour: [...] "she's living in the moment, and she's all about her newest material." [...] The Advocates review for the release was positive, saying that the DVD affirms the fact that Madonna's [...] "musical reign continues". Entertainment Focus Pip Ellwood felt that the highlights of the record were the live performances of [...] "Human Nature" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". He concluded the review by saying that [...] " [...] Making perfect use of her dancers, the video screens and the sets, the MDNA World Tour is one of [...] most spectacular to date and she still performs with the passion and the energy she always has done. If <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the show then get your copy of this and treat it like a souvenir. If you didn't you need to check it out as it's one of the best shows she's ever done." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic awarded the release three out of five stars, saying that [...] "there are unexpected musical moments that do make MDNA World Tour worth hearing", including the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". However, he felt that the CD release was unnecessary since the album would be a better experience with its video.|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} in Sellers's {{flailing}} career came in 1974, when he teamed up with Blake Edwards to make The Return of the Pink Panther, starring alongside Christopher Plummer, Herbert Lom and Catherine Schell. The film was shot on a budget of £3 million and earned $33 million {{at the box office}} upon release in May 1975, reinvigorating Sellers's career as an A-list film star and restoring his millionaire status. The film earned Sellers a nomination for the Best Actor– Musical or Comedy award at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards. In 1976, he followed it with The Pink Panther Strikes Again. During the filming from February to June 1976, the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had seriously deteriorated. Edwards says of the actor's mental state at the time of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> an asylum and you described the first inmate you saw, that's what Peter had become. He was certifiable." [...] With declining physical health, Sellers could at times be unbearable on set. His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and he frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects. Peter Evans mentioned that Sellers was a [...] "volatile and perplexing character [...] left a trail of misery in his private life". He also noted that Sellers had a [...] "compulsive personality and [...] an eccentric hypochondriac" [...] who became addicted to various medicines aside from his recreational drug habits during this period. His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry {{at a time when he}} most needed the work. Despite Sellers's deep personal problems, The Pink Panther Strikes Again was well received critically. Vincent Canby of The New York Times said of Sellers in the film, [...] "There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers' Clouseau, a fellow who, when he attempts to tear off his clothes in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in his necktie, and who, when he masquerades—for reasons never gone into—as Quasimodo, overinflates his hump with helium." [...] Sellers's performance earned him a further nomination at the 34th Golden Globe Awards.|$|E

2500|$|In 1801, David Hartley first {{postulated}} that dreaming altered the associative planetary links within the brain during dreaming periods of dreams. The idea that sleep had a mentally restorative effect, sorting out and consolidating memories and ideas, was intellectually acceptable {{by the end}} of the 19th century. In ‘Peter and Wendy’, J.M. Barrie wrote [...] ‘It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. …When you wake in the morning, the naughtinesses and evil passions with which <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind; and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.’ The stories of Peter Pan take place in a mental world and contain many allusions to aspects of cognitive psychology, some of which predate their formal scientific investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{was raised}} as a Presbyterian. In college, however, he became {{increasingly}} dissatisfied with organized religion after reading William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902). Around 1919 he stopped attending the Presbyterian church {{and spent the}} next ten years exploring other religious faiths and traditions, including spiritualism and esoteric religion. He later said, [...] "I know I am often called a mystic, and in the years following my leaving the United Presbyterian Church I was probably a practical mystic ... I'd say I was a mystic in the sense that George Washington Carver was – who believed God was in everything and therefore, if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> God, you could find the answers." [...] Wallace joined the Theosophical Society on June 6, 1925, and that same year helped organize a Des Moines parish of the Liberal Catholic Church, a denomination with ties to theosophy, but which had no ties to the Roman Catholic Church. He resigned from the Theosophical Society on or before November 23, 1935, and in 1939 formally joined the Episcopal Church.|$|E

[...] When he explained to Beckett that he was playing Lucky as if he were suffering from Parkinson's, Beckett said, [...] "'Yes, of course.'
