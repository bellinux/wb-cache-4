500|$|Arista Nashville {{released}} Brooks & Dunn's second Greatest Hits package, The Greatest Hits Collection II, in October 2004. The album included singles from If <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>Her,</b> Steers & Stripes and Red Dirt Road, and {{the previously}} unreleased [...] "That's What It's All About" [...] and [...] "It's Getting Better All the Time". Respectively, these cuts peaked at numbers two {{and one on}} the country music charts, as well as 38 and 56 on the Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|Brooks & Dunn {{collaborated with}} Reba McEntire to perform [...] "If You See Him/If You See Her", {{which was the}} lead-off single to Brooks & Dunn's If <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>Her</b> and McEntire's If You See Him, {{both of which were}} {{released}} on the same day. Arista Nashville and MCA Nashville, the label to which McEntire was signed, both promoted the single. This cut went to number one, as did If You See Hers next two singles: [...] "How Long Gone" [...] and a cover of Roger Miller's [...] "Husbands and Wives", which also became the duo's first top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Dunn recorded the vocals for [...] "Husbands and Wives" [...] in one take. Also included on the album was [...] "Born and Raised in Black and White", the first song of the duo's career in which they alternated on lead vocals. The album's fourth single was [...] "I Can't Get Over You", which was a top five country hit. Following it was [...] "South of Santa Fe", which peaked at number 41 on the country charts and thus became the duo's lowest-peaking single there. In 2001, If <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>Her</b> reached double-platinum certification in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Rick Stein, a {{more recent}} chef, says that David was such an {{influence}} on his early work that he used one of Minton's illustrations from A Book of Mediterranean Food on his menus when he first opened a restaurant. Others, including Nigel Slater, Gordon Ramsey, Jamie Oliver, Prue Leith and Clarissa Dickson Wright, {{have been influenced by}} David; Dickson Wright said that David [...] "taught me that food is more than cooking; it is poetry and passion as well. She also taught me never to settle for culinary second-best". Norman quotes Leith as being quite shocked when she asked students at a catering college how many of them had read David's books, and not a single one raised a hand. [...] "But the books do sell—I see the royalty statements—and <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> influence in the cooking of Jeremy Lee, Shaun Hill and Rowley Leigh".|$|E
500|$|In 1997, McEntire headlined a {{tour with}} Brooks & Dunn {{that led to}} the {{recording}} of [...] "If You See Him/If You See Her" [...] with the duo the following year. This song was included on McEntire's If You See Him album and Brooks & Dunn's If <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>Her</b> album, both of which were released on June 2. Thom Owens of AllMusic reported in its review that both album titles were named nearly the same as [...] "a way to draw attention for both parties, since they were no longer new guns—they were veterans in danger of losing ground to younger musicians". The duet reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in June 1998 and spawned an additional three Top 10 hits during that year: [...] "Forever Love", [...] "Wrong Night", and [...] "One Honest Heart". In addition, If You See Him peaked within the Top 10 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums chart, reaching No. 8 and No. 2, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Louise Nevelson {{has been}} a {{fundamental}} key in the feminist art movement. Credited with triggering the examination of femininity in art, Nevelson challenged the vision of what type of art women would be creating with her dark, monumental, masculine and totem-like artworks. Nevelson believed that art reflected the individual, not [...] "masculine-feminine labels", and chose to take on her role as an artist, not specifically a female artist. Reviews of Nevelson's works in the 1940s wrote her off as just a woman artist. A reviewer of her 1941 exhibition at Nierendorf Gallery stated: [...] "We learned the artist is a woman, in time to check our enthusiasm. Had it been otherwise, we might have hailed these sculptural expressions as by surely a great figure among moderns." [...] Another review was similar in its sexism: [...] "Nevelson is a sculptor; she comes from Portland, Maine. You'll deny both these facts and you might even insist Nevelson is a man, when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> Portraits in Paint, showing this month at the Nierendorf Gallery." ...|$|E

500|$|In the US and Canada, {{the cover}} {{did not have}} any logo, but in the European nations, they were sold with Madonna's name and album title on the cover. Heiden {{explained}} in an interview with Aperture magazine that they thought it would be [...] "cool" [...] to use a shrink wrap on the US covers, so that when one took it off, there would only be the photo of Madonna. For the European nations, Warner felt that the name was needed on the cover, as {{they did not want to}} take chance with Madonna's popularity there. The back sleeve and the booklet inside featured the song titles in Heiden's own handwriting. About cropping the image for the cassette and the vinyl versions, Heiden said: [...] "I think the image became more interesting cropped into a square—and at that time we always started with the album cover configuration. It was like she was floating—her clothing was not visible. She took on the appearance of a marble statue—Goddess like. In the vertical cropping <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> leather jacket and the wall, and it becomes more typical, editorial, earthly." ...|$|E
500|$|Jill {{is known}} for her feud with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), which took place over four decades. BuddyTV wrote that, [...] "Nothing spells rivalry like the {{on-going}} feud between Jill Foster Abbott and Katherine Chancellor." [...] In 1993, Katherine {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and shared several tender scenes with Jill. Nancy Reichardt of the Los Angeles Times noted that the characters were acting out of character; she wrote: [...] "Katherine's breast cancer scare was touching and seeing Katherine and Jill come together added an intriguing new dimension to their relationship. To confuse us, the show has thrown out this budding friendship as if it never happened. How much more moving it would have been if these two women faced Katherine's request for Jill to name her child Phillip as former adversaries trying to put the past behind them instead of as bitter enemies of days gone by." [...] Of working with Cooper, Walton has stated: [...] "I thank God every day for that woman. She feeds me. She is like a shot in the arm when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> in the morning. [...] She is funny and sharp and I love her." ...|$|E

In 2010, James Hawkins of Joystick Division ranked her as number one top [...] "badass lady" [...] in video games, adding that she [...] "made every other character on this list possible," [...] while UGO.com ranked her as 20th in a list of top heroes of all-time. In 2011, Nintendo Power listed Samus as their third-favourite hero, citing her bravery in the face of dangerous situations, while UGO.com also included her on the list of video game characters who need their own movies. That same year, Empire ranked her as the 26th-greatest video game character, adding, [...] "whether <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> as a breakthrough for feminism or just another faceless sci-fi warrior, 1986's unexpected reveal that showed women could be more in gaming lore than eye candy for geeky boys was a refreshing and unforgettable moment." [...] In 2012, GamesRadar ranked her as the [...] "fifth-most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in video games, adding: [...] "Whether she's 2D or 3D, in a sidescroller or FPS, her strength and determination always shine through, allowing her the power to defeat floating aliens and space pirates alike." [...] In 2013, Complex ranked her as the [...] "11th-most badass" [...] video game character of all time, as well as the greatest heroine in video game history, and the third-greatest soldier in video games.|$|E

The first book has been given a first printing of one million copies and was released on October 23, 2012.

2500|$|Clarice {{is one of}} the escaped {{inmates and}} was {{originally}} intended to be an homage to Chop Top Sawyer, a character from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, but was later developed into her own character. Seth M. Sherwood stated that [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> you can see a little of that DNA in there", describing Chop Top as his favourite Sawyer. A revisionist take on Chop Top was added due to the diminished role of the family in earlier drafts of the script, but was removed when the filmmakers began to feel that she was more of a [...] "rip-off" [...] than a genuine tribute. The version of Clarice that appears in the final film emerged when Sherwood imagined [...] "an image of this little girl in pigtails burning down her house with her parents inside". Out of all the performances in Leatherface, Sherwood called Jessica Madsen's the most accurate of what he envisioned while writing. Deciding that Clarice is [...] "much more than just a pyromaniac", Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo removed scenes detailing her backstory, such as her weaponising fire for the first time, her addiction for [...] "watching the flames dancing", and exposition on her family's disappearance. As the film begins, it remains ambiguous as to which inmate is actually Jedidiah Sawyer, the eventual Leatherface. Maury and Bustillo even considered leading the audience to believe that Clarice could become the titular character, [...] "It wasn’t a so crazy idea to have regarding the passion Leatherface had for dresses and makeup in the previous movies." ...|$|E
