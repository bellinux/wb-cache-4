500|$|The song's {{critical}} {{response has}} been mostly positive, though so too were the two prior singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, which both performed poorly in the charts. Like these two, [...] "Who Really Cares" [...] was released to radioplay and music video stations, but with little inclusion in circulation, leading speculators to believe the single will follow [...] "I Don't Remember" [...] and [...] "Nobody Sees" [...] with poor charting performance. This speculation proved to be accurate, leading to [...] "Who Really Cares" [...] {{to be the first}} single by Powderfinger since their 2004 release [...] "Bless My Soul" [...] to fail to achieve a position on the ARIA Charts. Although B-side [...] "One More Kiss As <b>You</b> <b>Fly</b> Away" [...] was the number 81 on the ARIA Charts.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, DoraDoraBoBora from Jay Is Games {{described}} {{the game as}} a beautiful point-and-click fantasy game that [...] "mixes puzzles and slight hidden-object hunting to create a beautiful adventure series that might not pose too great of a challenge to some players, but is still a captivating experience while it lasts. [...] Visually the game is striking, and wandering through it feels appropriately dreamlike." [...] Like Gamezebo's Erin Bell, Dora noted that The Book of Air was [...] "to {{set the stage for}} the next", and said: [...] "The Book of Air mostly just sends you from place to place solving puzzles.

2500|$|Throughout the song, Beyoncé sings with [...] "a sassy attitude", {{setting a}} [...] "futuristic tone", {{as stated by}} Jocelyn Vena. According to Dombal, [...] "Countdown" [...] finds Knowles as the female protagonist {{delivering}} her [...] "message of ten years of loyalty" [...] to her love interest. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, who described [...] "Countdown" [...] as a [...] "monogamous romance", added {{that it is a}} love song that is [...] "no less sexy for being unblinkingly true to life", and Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the song is [...] "all about the rapture of true love".
