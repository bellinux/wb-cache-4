His poetry, in other words, is that of the here and now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. <b>Yet</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> he {{had to say about the}} present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative.

25|$|And <b>yet,</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> that, Halbertsma's {{literary}} works {{did not take}} centerstage in his life: that place was reserved for his scientific non-fiction books. More than fifty years he laboured to complete his dictionary of Western Frisian titled Lexicon Frisicum, for which he chose Latin as the descriptive language, but it remained unfinished. He organised it {{along the lines of}} the German dictionary by the Brothers Grimm, but became enmeshed in the addition of insertions and in reworkings, and in writing long semantic etymologies, a part of the work for which he especially had a predilection. In the end, he never got past the letter F, and the dictionary remained a manuscript, which was published in its unfinished form after Halbertsma's death, in 1872. In the 20th century, the material Halbertsma gathered for his Lexicon Frisicum was used by de Frisian Academy to develop several Western Frisian dictionaries, notably the 25 part Wurdboek fan de Fryske Taal ("Dictionary of the Western Frisian Language"; published 1984–2011).|$|E

25|$|From {{the death}} of Burebista {{to the rise of}} Decebalus, Roman forces {{continued}} to clash against the Dacians and the Getae. Constant raiding by the tribes into the adjacent provinces of Moesia and Pannonia caused the local governors and the emperors to undertake a number of punitive actions against the Dacians. <b>Yet</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> this, there existed a measure of social, diplomatic, and political interaction between the Roman Empire and the Dacians during much of the late pre-Roman period. This saw the occasional granting of favoured status to the Dacians in the manner of being identified as amicii et socii– friends and allies– of Rome, although by the time of Octavianus this was tied up with the personal patronage of important Roman individuals. An example of this was seen in Octavianus's actions during his conflict with Marcus Antonius. Seeking to obtain an ally who could threaten Antonius's European provinces, in 35 BC Octavianus offered an alliance with the Dacians, whereby he would marry the daughter of the Dacian King, Cotiso, and in exchange Cotiso would wed Octavianus' daughter, Julia.|$|E

500|$|The {{military}} setbacks of 1707 {{continued through}} the opening months of 1708 with the defection of Brugge and Gent to the French. Marlborough remained despondent about the general situation, but his optimism received a major boost with the arrival in theatre of Prince Eugene, his co-commander at Blenheim. Heartened by the Prince's robust confidence, Marlborough set about to regain the strategic initiative. After a forced march, the Allies crossed the river Schelde at Oudenaarde just as the French army, under Marshal Vendôme and the duc de Burgundy, was crossing farther north {{with the intent of}} besieging the place. Marlborough – with renewed self-assurance – moved decisively to engage them. His subsequent victory at the Battle of Oudenaarde on 11 July 1708 demoralised the French army in Flanders; his eye for ground, his sense of timing and his keen knowledge of the enemy were again amply demonstrated. The success, aided by the dissension of the two French commanders, restored the strategic initiative to the Allies, who now opted to besiege Lille, the strongest fortress in Europe. While the Duke commanded the covering force, Eugene oversaw the siege of the town, which surrendered on 22 October; however, it was not until 10 December that the resolute Boufflers yielded the citadel. <b>Yet</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the difficulties of the winter siege, the campaign of 1708 had been a remarkable success, requiring superior logistical skill and organisation. The Allies re-took Brugge and Gent, and the French were driven out of almost all the Spanish Netherlands: [...] "He who has not seen this", wrote Eugene, [...] "has seen nothing".|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles of The New York Times {{compared}} the DVD with Taylor Swift's [...] which aired {{as a special}} {{the same day as}} I Am... World Tour. He noted, [...] "Beyoncé's I Am... World Tour placed her before much larger audiences, documenting her choreographed razzle-dazzle as she played arenas and stadiums in 2009-10." [...] He further said, [...] "Beyoncé didn't explain: she performed. With costumes that made her a comic-book heroine, a cyborg, a club hottie, and a white-clad vision of purity, she worked her big stages with hip-pumping moves and a soul diva's voice, from creamy to raspy. The documentary quietly flaunted her consistency as a trouper in montages that segued multiple shows — supertitled in small type — with Beyoncé in the same outfit making the same moves, while the fans' nationalities changed around her. <b>Yet</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> her superhuman pep, she also came across as warmer than Ms. Swift. She grinned knowingly after belting a phrase into the bleachers, and she drew listeners into her own pop generalities. Andy Gill of The Independent was much less impressed with the DVD, qualifying it as an [...] "unsatisfying, incoherent entertainment experience" [...] even though she liked the way [...] "the visual spectacle put everything in perspective". The concert film received a nomination for a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Variety – Series or Special in 2011. I Am...

500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, writing: [...] "I give the movie a {{negative}} review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying {{us what we}} more or less deserve from a Batman story. No matter how hard you try, superheroes and film noir don't go together; {{the very essence of}} noir is that there are no more heroes." [...] He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that [...] "the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum called DeVito [...] "a pale substitute for Jack Nicholson from the first film" [...] and felt that [...] "there's no suspense in Batman Returns whatsoever". Batman comic book writer/artist Matt Wagner was quoted as saying: [...] "I hated how Batman Returns made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing. Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked." [...] Ty Burr in Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-; he wrote that [...] "Burton still hasn't figured out how to tell a coherent story: He's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string.... <b>Yet</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the wintry weirdness, there's more going on under the surface of this movie than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by Batman Returns: Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Heidegger's silence {{about the}} stark {{similarities}} between {{his account of}} temporality and Husserl's investigation of internal time-consciousness contributes to a misrepresentation of Husserl's account of intentionality.

2500|$|During teacher {{training}} at St Joseph's Teacher Training College in Belfast (now merged with St Mary's, University College), Heaney {{went on a}} placement to St Thomas' secondary Intermediate School in west Belfast. The headmaster of this school was the writer Michael McLaverty from County Monaghan, who introduced Heaney to the poetry of Patrick Kavanagh. With McLaverty's mentorship, Heaney first started to publish poetry in 1962. Hillan describes how McLaverty was like a foster father to the younger Belfast poet. In the introduction to McLaverty's Collected Works, Heaney summarised the poet's contribution and influence: [...] "His voice was modestly pitched, he never sought the limelight, <b>yet</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> that, his place in our literature is secure." [...] Heaney's poem Fosterage, in the sequence Singing School from North (1975), is dedicated to him.|$|E

2500|$|The Serioso is a {{transitional}} work that ushers in Beethoven's late period – {{a period of}} compositions of great introspection. [...] "The particular kind of inwardness of Beethoven's last style period", writes Joseph Kerman, gives one the feeling that [...] "the music is sounding only for the composer and for one other auditor, an awestruck eavesdropper: you." [...] In the late quartets, the quartet conversation is often disjointed, proceeding like a stream of consciousness. Melodies are broken off, or passed {{in the middle of}} the melodic line from instrument to instrument. Beethoven uses new effects, never before essayed in the string quartet literature: the ethereal, dreamlike effect of open intervals between the high E string and the open A string in the second movement of quartet Op. 132; the use of sul ponticello (playing on the bridge of the violin) for a brittle, scratchy sound in the Presto movement of Op. 131; the use of the Lydian mode, rarely heard in Western music for 200 years, in Op. 132; a cello melody played high above all the other strings in the finale of Op. 132. <b>Yet</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> this disjointedness, each quartet is tightly designed, with an overarching structure that ties the work together.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{three years}} after his Best Actor triumph in African Queen, Bogart dropped his asking price to get the role of Captain Queeg in Edward Dmytryk's 1954 drama The Caine Mutiny. Though he griped {{with some of his}} old {{bitterness}} about having to do so, he delivered a strong performance in the lead, earning him his final Oscar nomination as well as being the subject of the cover story in the June 7, 1954 issue of TIME. [...] <b>Yet</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> his success, Bogart was still his melancholy old self, grumbling and feuding with the studio, while his health was beginning to deteriorate. The character of Queeg mirrored in some ways those Bogart had played in The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca and The Big Sleep–the wary loner who trusts no one—but without either the warmth or humor of those roles. Like his portrayal of Fred C. Dobbs in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Bogart played a paranoid, self-pitying character whose small-mindedness eventually destroyed him. Three months before the film's release, Bogart appeared as Queeg on the cover of TIME magazine, while on Broadway Henry Fonda was starring in the stage version (in a different role), both of which generated strong publicity for the film.|$|E
