In 1978, {{in an effort}} to produce Monty Python's Life of Brian, they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. Harrison explained: [...] "The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke. I'd been to Wooky Hole in Somerset... an old paper mill where they show <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> old underpants into paper. So I bought a few rolls, and they had this watermark 'British Handmade Paper'... So we said... we'll call it Handmade Films." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't believe it," [...] he {{answered}} hoarsely. [...] "We have come too close together {{for me to}} believe it. You care for me a little, I know. I will teach <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> that little sufficient." ...|$|E

6000|$|Martin {{regarded}} the young man, unmoved. [...] "That stuff' you're smoking's rank," [...] he said. [...] "Have some of mine; I'll show <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them. It'll save you {{one and three}} per pound of baccy, and won't rot your lungs." ...|$|E

6000|$|Stormont smiled. The {{young man}} had told Watson much about himself one night when he was drunk. [...] "I don't think it matters. You'd like to get rich and hinted that <b>you</b> knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> your pile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The good father," [...] said Dwining, [...] "is--he, he!--already a worshipper of {{the deity}} whom I have served. I {{therefore}} prefer {{to give the}} altar of mine idol a new worshipper in thee, Catharine. This scrap of parchment will tell <b>thee</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> your way into my chapel, where I have worshipped so often in safety. I leave the images which it contains to thee as a legacy, simply because I hate and contemn thee something less {{than any of the}} absurd wretches whom I have hitherto been obliged to call fellow creatures. And now away--or remain and see if the end of the quacksalver belies his life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{going to}} tell you how to have trained service and how to make your hotels distinctive. They're good hotels, as hotels go, and you really do give people good coffee and good beds and credit conveniences, as you promise, but your hotels are not distinctive. I'm {{going to tell}} <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} like it, for we mean {{to have you}} come here a great deal.

6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{said the}} stranger, [...] "if thou art a true soldier of Rome, thou wilt not pause from thy purpose because thou hast {{the odds of}} years and of {{strength}} on thy side. Hearken to me, my son. I have showed <b>thee</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> thy peace with Heaven, and thou hast rejected my proffer. I will now show <b>thee</b> <b>how</b> thou shalt make thy reconciliation with the powers of this world. Take this gray head from the frail body which supports it, and carry it to the chair of proud Abbot Boniface; and when thou tellest him thou hast slain Piercie Shafton, and his ire rises at the deed, lay the head of Henry Warden at his foot, and thou shalt have praise instead of censure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What does it matter?" [...] she {{answered}} contemptuously. [...] "I {{am not a}} rich woman, Guy, but I know how to earn money. Mostyn Ray would not believe it, perhaps, but I loved your father. Yours has been a miserable little life. Come with me, and I promise that I will show <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it great. You have no relatives or any ties. I promise you that I will be a model stepmother." ...|$|E

Give him the fever medicine, every two hours, {{until there is a}} change; and whenever you can get him to take it, give him a little broth made of a spoonful of the essence of meat in a liter of boiling water or, for a change, some arrowroot. I will show <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it, when we get back to the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll have to {{work all}} night, both of you--that's your {{punishment}} for disobeying orders--and without the solace of a pipe too," [...] said Mark, when order was somewhat restored and work resumed. [...] "The garden party, you know, is fixed for to-morrow, and it's as much as our heads are worth to disappoint the Queen of her expected amusements. Time, tide, and Ranavalona the First wait for no man! I've {{got to go out}} for an hour or so. When I return I'll show <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> stars and crackers and red rain, etcetera." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know <b>how</b> <b>you</b> managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up {{your mind}} to come to Redmond at all, if you are really such an {{undecided}} person," [...] said amused Priscilla.|$|R
6000|$|... '"My sons, I have no riches to {{bequeath}} to you; my only wealth {{was those}} secrets of magic which you know. Some stones you already have, engraved with mystic signs, and long ago I taught <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> others. But you still lack {{the most precious}} of all talismans--the three rings belonging to the daughters of Siroco. Try to get possession of them, but take heed on beholding these young girls {{that you do not}} fall under the power of their beauty. Their religion is different from yours, and further, they are the betrothed brides of the sons of the Bassa of the Sea. And to preserve you from a love which can bring you nothing but sorrow, I counsel you in time of peril to seek out the daughter of Moïzes the Rabbi, who cherishes a hidden passion for Izaf, and possesses the Book of Spells, which her father himself wrote with the sacred ink that was used for the Talmud." [...] So saying, our father fell back on his cushions and died, leaving us burning with desire for the three rings of the daughters of Siroco.|$|E
6000|$|If {{designing}} {{could be}} taught, {{all the world}} would learn: as all the world reads--or calculates. But designing {{is not to be}} spelled, nor summed. My men continually come to me, in my drawing class in London, thinking I am to teach them what is instantly to enable them to gain their bread. [...] "Please, sir, show us how to design." [...] "Make designers of us." [...] And you, I doubt not, partly expect me to tell you to-night how to make designers of your Bradford youths. Alas! I could as soon tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> or manufacture an ear of wheat, as to make a good artist of any kind. I can analyze the wheat very learnedly for you--tell you there is starch in it, and carbon, and silex. I can give you starch, and charcoal, and flint; but you are as far from your ear of wheat as you were before. All that can possibly be done for any one who wants ears of wheat is to show them where to find grains of wheat, and how to sow them, and then, with patience, in Heaven's time, the ears will come--or will perhaps come--ground and weather permitting. So in this matter of making artists--first you must find your artist in the grain; then you must plant him; fence and weed the field about him; and with patience, ground and weather permitting, you may get an artist out of him--not otherwise. And what I have to speak to you about, tonight, is mainly the ground and the weather, it being the first and quite most material question in this matter, whether the ground and weather of Bradford, or the ground and weather of England in general,--suit wheat.|$|E
6000|$|You were forever {{finding some}} new play. [...] So when I saw you down {{on hands and}} knees [...] In the meadow, busy with the new-cut hay, [...] Trying, I thought, to set it up on end, [...] I went to show <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it stay, [...] If that was your idea, against the breeze, [...] And, if you asked me, even help pretend [...] To make it root again and grow afresh. [...] But 'twas no make-believe with you to-day, [...] Nor was the grass itself your real concern, [...] Though I found your hand full of wilted fern, [...] Steel-bright June-grass, and {{blackening}} heads of clover. [...] 'Twas a nest full of young birds on the ground [...] The cutter-bar had just gone champing over [...] (Miraculously without tasting flesh) [...] And left defenseless to the heat and light. [...] You wanted to restore them to their right [...] Of something interposed between their sight [...] And too much world at once--could means be found. [...] The way the nest-full every time we stirred [...] Stood up to us as to a mother-bird [...] Whose coming home has been too long deferred, [...] Made me ask would the mother-bird return [...] And care for them in such a change of scene [...] And might our meddling make her more afraid. [...] That was a thing we could not wait to learn. [...] We saw the risk we took in doing good, [...] But dared not spare to do the best we could [...] Though harm should come of it; so built the screen [...] You had begun, and gave them back their shade. [...] All this to prove we cared. Why is there then [...] No more to tell? We turned to other things. [...] I haven't any memory--have you?-- [...] Of ever coming to the place again [...] To see if the birds lived the first night through, [...] And so at last to learn to use their wings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary," [...] said Mrs. Hanbury, again, [...] "I realize <b>how</b> <b>you</b> worked <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{the child}} that velvet coat. Do you {{think you ought to}} dress her that way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monty {{knew one}} at his Club. He brought him here to dinner once. Monty was always {{thinking}} {{of writing a}} book, <b>you</b> know, about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money on the turf. He tried to interest that man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you {{are rather}} small--but {{no doubt you}} will grow. Boys have a queer habit of doing that. I think <b>you</b> know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{yourself}} useful. I need a boy here to run errands and look after my horse. If you like, I'll try you. You can live here, and go to school. I sometimes hear of places for boys in my rounds, and the first good one that will suit you, I'll bespeak for <b>you.</b> <b>How</b> will that do?" ...|$|R
