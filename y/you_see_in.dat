She is expected to cut only the tip of the sexual sensitive part in the girl, so that she is not hypersexually active. This is the purpose... <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> societies where circumcision of girls is completely prohibited, hypersexuality takes over the entire society, and a woman is not satisfied with one person, or two, or three. This, God forbid, is now happening even in Muslim societies where they prohibit circumcision. They use a mistake in practice to prohibit the tradition, and they end up causing a lot of damage on the extreme side of the sexual life of the woman.|$|E

Csupó chose to have Weta Digital render the 3D animation because he [...] "was impressed with their artistic integrity, the teamwork, the [...] people were really nice, and also they responded to our designs very positively". Weta modified some of the creature designs, but ultimately remained faithful to Csupó's original designs.|$|E

Hossington revealed in an interview with Radio Times that the show had been working with the Association of Air Ambulances for over half a year on the storyline. The storyline was also created by the Association of Air Ambulances, who suggested the idea of an air ambulance colliding with a drone.

Marshall Fine, of the Huffington Post, gave the film a mixed review. He criticized it for jumping through different events in a [...] "jerky fashion", but summed up the review by calling it a [...] "movie {{with a lot of}} meat on the bone, even if some of it is tough or stringy.

The Sri Chakra can be visually rendered either as a two-dimensional diagram (whether drawn temporarily {{as part of the}} worship ritual, or permanently engraved in metal) or in the three-dimensional, pyramidal form known as the Sri Meru. It is not uncommon to find a Sri Chakra or Sri Meru installed in South Indian temples, because – as modern practitioners assert – [...] "there is no disputing that this is the highest form of Devi and that some of the practice can be done openly.

He made several incriminating statements during the interviews, at first admitting he had thrown stones, then during the second interview saying he had seen the attack on Blakelock. During the third, he said he had spoken to Silcott about the murder, and that Silcott owned a hammer with a hook on one side. After the fifth interview he was charged with affray, and during the sixth he described the attack on Blakelock: [...] "It was like <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> a film, a helpless man with dogs on him.

Although unsure {{what he wanted to}} do with his life, Pirkis was cast for his first professional role in 2003, when he appeared in the successful film, [...] The hire occurred after production staff visited Eton to hire boys for the ship's teenage crew. Pirkis attended a workshop and auditions as [...] "a joke", ultimately securing the part of the 13-year-old, eventually one-armed midshipman Lord Blakeney of HMS Surprise. Director Peter Weir thought Pirkis [...] "stood out very early on, but not to the extent that <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the film. That was a complete surprise."

[...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend to dwell on the ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> his movies." ...|$|E
500|$|The ride {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} July 2014 opening. Lance Hart from Screamscape {{was impressed with}} the fact that the King's Cross entrance was hidden from the rest of the Diagon Alley area.

In terms of the overall experience Hart said, [...] "Universal has managed to turn what would simply be a method of transporting guests between their two parks into yet another must-see attraction ... tying together the overall story and theme of visiting Hogwarts at Islands of Adventure and Diagon Alley inside Universal Studios Florida".|$|E

500|$|Psycho is now {{considered}} to be the first film in the slasher film genre, and has been referenced in films numerous times; examples include the 1974 musical horror film Phantom of the Paradise, 1978 horror film Halloween (which starred Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh's daughter), the 1977 Mel Brooks tribute to many of Hitchcock's thrillers, High Anxiety, the 1980 Fade to Black, the 1980 Dressed to Kill and Wes Craven's 1996 horror satire Scream.

500|$|Horowitz {{revealed}} the film would contain many light cycles battles, and {{asserted that the}} script for the scenes were [...] "incredibly detailed", and involved an intricate collaborative process. For the disc game, Horowitz and Kitsis wrote a rough draft of the scene, and sent the script to Kosinski; he summarized his perspective of the sequence's visuals to them. [...] "He described them as these underlying platforms," [...] said Horowitz, [...] "that would then coalesce and then {{the way you would}} go from round to round in the game is you defeat someone, they kinda come together as <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the movie." [...] After giving his intake, Kosinski sent various sketches of the scene to the writers and would often revise the script. Kitsis thought that illustrating the character's stories to be the most difficult task in writing Tron: Legacy.

[...] "I got well enough to do what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on.

Later editions incorporated comparisons and contrasts between Harry Potter and the more overtly Christian works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, [...] "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a simple question, 'Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that {{will enable them to}} replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?' If you go to The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in,</b> story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can't replicate it. But if you go to something like Harry Potter, you can find references to astrology, clairvoyance, and numerology.
