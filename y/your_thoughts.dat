5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

Hit it first and think afterwards. If you look up and work it out he will read <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> and stop it." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by the Manchester City forward Neil Young, who recalled that [...] "the only way to beat him with a shot in training was to mis-hit it". As a former handball player, Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves, particularly after witnessing the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics use such tactics to good effect in Hungary's 6–3 victory over England in 1953.|$|E

500|$|Musically, A Thousand Leaves was {{considered}} more expansive and relaxed than previous Sonic Youth albums, with less feedback and more guitar playing and improvisation. According to David Browne, the record explored post-rock sounds that were [...] "subtler" [...] and [...] "quirkier" [...] than most mainstream rock at the time. The {{title of the}} album was inspired by Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. According to Moore, [...] "The same way he improvises with images and words, we improvise with sounds and notes". He also attributed {{the style of the}} album {{to the fact that the}} band was getting older, commenting, [...] "You also become much involved with <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> about life experience in general. Having children is incredible in that way." [...] The song [...] "Snare, Girl" [...] explored these topics. The longest song on the album, [...] "Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)", referenced American poet Allen Ginsberg and contains an instrumental interlude that was described as [...] "a subtle, drawn-out passage of Morse code guitar lines and lazy afternoon with wah-wah pedal licks—bliss in slow motion." ...|$|E

Her manager Larry Rudolph confirmed the singer would spend [...] "her summer in the recording studio" [...] to work on it. Despite no official album confirmation at the time, Rudolph revealed they were happy with her progress and that she had been working with a range of producers, such as Sean Garrett, Guy Sigsworth, Danja and Bloodshy & Avant. Sigsworth and Spears were approached by the songwriters of [...] "Out from Under", who suggested the singer to re-record the song for the album. Spears recorded her vocals for the song at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, while audio mixing and vocal recording was done by Andy Page. Background vocals were provided by Leah Haywood. The song appeared on a six-song mix of Circus that was released on November 13, 2008. In an interview included on the deluxe edition of Circus, Spears revealed that she [...] " [...] always loved ballads.

500|$|Usher and Minaj {{shot the}} music video on March 9, 2010 in Los Angeles with {{director}} Taj Stansberry, represented by Leah Harmony and Ciarra Pardo. In {{an interview with}} Vibe, Stansberry commented on the video's sex appeal and the pairing of Usher and Minaj, stating, [...] "This probably {{has the potential to}} be [...] Usher’s one of the best entertainers in the world, then you have Nicki Minaj who’s fresh on the scene. Put them together and there’s just sparks, it was real good." [...] When asked about the music video's concept would redefine the word [...] "freak", commenting: [...] "My general idea was to take the word and show its many faceted sides, twisting and turning it to where there’s really no distinguishing between one freak and another. Usher went there. When you’re engaging in sexual activity, there are many transitions and this is not about what they look like literally, but what they look like metaphorically. It’s about luring people into a situation. Because you have <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> on a ménage à trois, but then we’re doing it in a non-obvious way." [...] On Minaj and her pairing with Usher, Stansberry said, [...] " [...] had a few looks that I really liked. She played the part, but still was her. If you really listen to her words in the song, you can kinda visualize her outfit." [...] Stansberry also confirmed that R singer Ciara and singer-actor Jamie Foxx would make appearances in the video. In an interview with MTV News on the set of her video for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said that [...] "The video is freaky. And it's a great concept, a great story line," [...] Minaj told MTV News. [...] "It felt just like one of the sequels to Saw. It was dope." [...] Stating that the video had a [...] "secret society" [...] concept, Usher told Access Hollywood that the place symbolized locations where people use to get away from pressures, and also said the movie Eyes Wide Shut was some sort of inspiration of the video. On March 22, 2010 a thirty second preview of the music video was surfaced onto the internet. Two days later on March 24, 2010, Usher premiered the full music video on BET's 106 & Park.|$|E
