500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money {{in order to create a}} conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that will give you a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|HARRY. Here's {{a dollar}} for <b>you,</b> amah. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> missy {{and tell her}} it's all right and will she come chop-chop. Sabe? ...|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly Neale had a happy thought. [...] "Red, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Slingerland's {{and help}} {{take care of}} Allie. I'd feel she was safer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps. But <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fire," [...] and Slavin went back, {{but with}} a {{look on his face}} that rivaled the black clouds in the heavens outside.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you can't stay here, an' {{the sooner}} <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village the better we'll like it, for we don't {{want anybody to}} know what we're talkin' about." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> them; <b>you</b> must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the world}} <b>you</b> belong to; and you'd better not carry any queer habits back with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Jerry. Now <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> work. You'll {{never lose}} {{anything}} by sticking to us, I promise you that. Keep {{your eyes and}} ears open." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you, Blakeney--how will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{that awful}} Paris?" [...] he said, {{when he had}} made his choice and was once more back beside Percy.|$|R
6000|$|Tommy Tit laughed. [...] "That's {{the very}} wisest {{thing you could}} have done," [...] said he. [...] "But why don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dear Old Briar-patch in the Green Meadows?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not that! Do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{company and}} make some excuse for me. Do not alarm them. And {{if you get the}} chance, tell Lord Comyn where to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to make a trial to overhear them, Harry, and it is better that only one of us should be here. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inn, and wait for me there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{your old}} tricks again," [...] groaned the hired man. [...] "Now, I reckon {{the house will}} be turned upside down till <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> college." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{whatever}} Mr. Briggs {{may have}} proposed {{to you to}} do, when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Forks, you are to write him a letter, and say that you will simply hold the judgment without levy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{just take}} it easy for awhile," [...] was Mr. Rover's advice, on leaving. [...] "Rest up all you can, and then, when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school, you'll feel as bright as a dollar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{human life}} is chancy at any kind of trade, [...] But most of all, as well you know, when the steers are mad-afraid; [...] So <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cattle-boats an' preach 'em as I've said.|$|E

60|$|ANN. No, Jack. I {{must speak}} to you about Rhoda. Ricky: will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house and {{entertain}} your American friend? He's rather on Mamma's hands {{so early in the}} morning. She wants to finish her housekeeping.|$|E
6000|$|... "The details {{ought to}} be simple enough," [...] said Tom. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Peacock you can {{take one of the}} small boats, stock her with provisions, and then go off in her. Then we can join you." ...|$|E
60|$|CAESAR (taking {{him into}} his {{confidence}} in his most winning manner). Apollodorus: {{this is no time}} for playing with presents. Pray <b>you,</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Queen, and tell her that if all goes well I shall return to the palace this evening.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it is by}} {{no means}} certain. Will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Ireland to-morrow morning, and {{undertake}} not to see me again, until you come prepared to marry me? If not we must break it off." ...|$|R
