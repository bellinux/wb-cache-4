2500|$|Speaking of Vietnam, <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Congress in 1971, {{after you}} came from Vietnam, and you said, quote, [...] "How do you ask {{a man to be}} the last man to die for a mistake?" [...] Are Americans now dying in Iraq for a mistake? ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. H. [Looking at her steadily] I don't {{quite know}} why <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|E
60|$|WELLWYN. Didn't you say <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Sir Thomas, too. Suppose {{he comes}} in while the Professor's here. They're cat and dog.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a bargain, lad, and I'm roight glad it be off my mind, for I ha' been bothering over't {{ever since}} <b>thee</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me last." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. COADE. A bachelor! And you {{are sure}} <b>you</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me before? Do think.|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet, sir, I {{know that}} I could be {{faithful}} and true {{to anyone who}} would not treat me like a dog. <b>You</b> <b>spoke</b> kindly <b>to</b> me in the stable, {{and gave me a}} crown. No one had ever given me a crown before. But I cared less for that than for the way <b>you</b> <b>spoke.</b> Then I saw you start, and <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> pleasantly <b>to</b> your men; and I said to myself, 'that is the master I would serve, if he would let me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Shrewsbury," [...] he said, [...] "don't {{you mention}} to Mrs. Whitney that <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> {{me about this}} matter. Do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{to speak}} to Nanda herself--though of course too if <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> others," [...] Vanderbank went on, [...] "they'd {{immediately}} rush and tell her." ...|$|E
6000|$|HOTCHKISS. No you shant. I {{have one}} card left {{to play that}} youve forgotten. Why were you so unlike {{yourself}} when <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the Bishop? ...|$|E
6000|$|Afterward the Industrialist said, [...] "You'll pardon me. I can't {{conceive}} your playing so elaborate a hoax. <b>You</b> really <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me, Charlie, {{about that}} uncle of whom <b>you</b> once <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me--long ago--in rather disrespectful tones, if not terms. Was he rich?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he intervened, [...] "you go too far, my friend. <b>You</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me of this. What {{have you}} against Hunterleys?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did not I tell you, Sir John, when <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> {{me about}} it before, {{that it could not}} be done? They dined with us last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if I make {{my words}} good," [...] said Ormond.--"My Lord of Buckingham, will you name the man <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> as {{you left the}} boat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|George Hatchard coughed agin. [...] "I 'ope you haven't {{been going}} on with that wicked plan <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me about the other night," [...] he ses.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Scudamore {{was silent}} for some time. Then {{she went back to}} the subject with which the {{conversation}} had commenced. [...] "What is the objection <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> of <b>to</b> the room?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father," [...] {{said the}} boy, {{in a serious}} tone, {{as they entered the}} forest, [...] "surely you don't mean to carry out in earnest the plan <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> of <b>to</b> Grummidge and the others yesterday?" ...|$|R
60|$|Do {{you think}} you shall get hold of the female MS. <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> of <b>to</b> day? if so, you will {{let me have a}} glimpse; but don't tell our master (not W's), or we shall be buffeted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you {{forgotten}} what we agreed on, Godfrey, when <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> {{me in the}} country? We agreed that we were to be cousins, and nothing more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But tell me this, {{my sweet}} girl," [...] I continued. [...] "You never {{addressed}} me in Spanish; what strange musical language was it <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How did Grace {{seem to be}} when <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> her?" [...] {{questioned}} Tom, as Sam ran the car {{as rapidly}} as the semi-darkness of the night permitted.|$|E
60|$|Father, {{the hour}} is come. Glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify <b>thee.</b> I <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> lately of the beatific vision of God. I will {{speak of it}} again to-day; and say this.|$|R
60|$|Q. Still, I don't {{understand}} it at all. <b>You</b> say he <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{and that he}} was dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "He would, if <b>you</b> hadn't <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> {{him that}} way. He'd say he wouldn't, and go away, and Maryanne would blow up; but I should have worked {{the money out}} of Jones at last, and then Brisket would have waited." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{precisely}} the reason. Leave her alone. Don't {{try to find}} out. I mean," [...] he explained, [...] "about what <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me of--the way she feels." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] she said, [...] "that {{this makes}} me think of the first night <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me? You {{remember}} it--up on the roof at Blenheim House?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Was--was {{that what}} you meant, that day we thought you dying, when you said to me--for it was to me <b>you</b> <b>spoke,</b> <b>to</b> me alone--that it was better so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I looked worried, of course; I {{had no time}} {{to change}} or even fix my hair; I had on that green dress, and it NEVER was becoming. And <b>you</b> only <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me on account of my awful looks?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} he hoped {{to get out of}} me, for I told him that <b>you</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> your mother or to me about your {{political}} business, and that I was not in the habit of listening at the keyholes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would ask}} you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no more than this when <b>you</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me, why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he, or anyone else, could object." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Dane {{has clearly}} {{been a good}} friend to your brother, but may I ask whether that evening at the Hallows Bridge {{was the only time}} <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my boy," [...] {{said the}} priest, {{as he put}} on more turf, [...] "we'll be alone for half an hour, or it is odd. Well, <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Feemy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{may take}} ten years if you like,” said Lady Beauchemin. “I’m {{in no hurry}} {{whatever}} to make you my brother-in-law. Only you must remember that <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me first.” ...|$|E
6000|$|It kept Strether himself silent a little. [...] "I've {{made it out}} for myself," [...] he {{then went}} on; [...] "I've really, within the last half-hour, got hold of it. I {{understand}} it in short at last; which at first--when <b>you</b> originally <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me--I didn't. Nor when Chad originally <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Old fool of a fellow! Why couldn't {{my father}} {{have made me}} your guardian, and then {{there would have been}} none of this row! One would think I had had her down to act barmaid to the fellows. And <b>you</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> one, did <b>you,</b> Phoebe?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary, it {{has been}} the truth," [...] Dominey objected. [...] "I assured you at the Carlton, when <b>you</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me, and I have assured you a dozen times since, that I was Everard Dominey. That is my name. That is who I am." ...|$|R
