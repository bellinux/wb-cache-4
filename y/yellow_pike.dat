50|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>pike</b> conger (Congresox talabon) is an eel in {{the family}} Muraenesocidae (pike congers). It was {{described}} by Georges Cuvier in 1829. It is a tropical eel which migrates between marine and brackish waters, though not for breeding purposes. It is known from the Indo-West Pacific, including Sri Lanka, the Bay of Bengal, and Indonesia.

Males can reach a maximum total length of 80 cm, but more commonly reach 50 cm.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted in March-April 2015 in the Laboratory of Fish Processing Technology, Laboratory of Microbiology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Sciences, University of Riau, Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Science, University of Riau and the Laboratory of Chemical Physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Science, University of North Sumatra. This study aims to produce peptone from waste <b>yellow</b> <b>pike</b> conger entrails as bacterial nutrients to support the growth of bacteria in the growth medium. Waste <b>yellow</b> <b>pike</b> conger entrails autolysis hydrolysed by activating proteolytic enzymes (pepsin) in the stomach of fish using 12 N HCl at pH (1, 2, 3 and 4) the hydrolysis temperature 40 oC for 24 hours to determine the optimum hydrolysis conditions. The optimum hydrolysis conditions of waste <b>yellow</b> <b>pike</b> conger entrails occurs at pH 3, the temperature of 40 oC hydrolysis with hydrolysis time of 24 hours, the solution was centrifuged extract peptone hydrolysis and then dried with a freeze dryer. The results showed peptone fish entrails have cunang content of 79. 06 % protein content; total nitrogen 12. 66 %; free Î±-amino nitrogen 1. 97 %; the ratio AN / TN 15. 56 %; water content of 5. 43 % and 93. 03 % solubility in water. Growth of test bacteria Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Staphylococcus aereus 6538 showed peptone <b>yellow</b> <b>pike</b> conger entrails {{can be used as}} a nutrient growth of bacteria on the growth medium...|$|E
