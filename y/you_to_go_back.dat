500|$|Lyrically, Backspacer {{displays}} {{a more positive}} outlook than the band's last few albums. Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to that when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and it comes down to a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E
2500|$|The note read [...] "Khartoum all right. Can {{hold out}} for years. C.G. Gordon", but the {{messenger}} (who knew very little English) had memorised another, darker message from Gordon, namely: [...] "We {{want you to come}} quickly". In the same month, Gordon received a letter from the Mahdi offering safe passage out of Khartoum: [...] "We have written to <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to your country...I repeat to you the words of Allah, Do not destroy yourself. Allah Himself is merciful to you".|$|E
2500|$|In Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935), the Court also voted {{unanimously}} to declare the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) unconstitutional {{on the grounds that}} it gave the president [...] "unfettered discretion" [...] to make whatever laws he thought were needed for economic recovery. Economics author John Steele Gordon writes that the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was [...] "the first iteration of Roosevelt's New Deal ... essentially a government-run cartel to fix prices and divide markets ... This was the most radical shift in the relation between government and the private economy in American history." [...] Speaking to aides of Roosevelt, Justice Louis Brandeis remarked that, [...] "This is the end of this business of centralization, and I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and tell the president that we're not going to let this government centralize everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Additional {{recording}} {{took place}} at Auerbach's Easy Eye Sound Studio in Nashville in February 2014, including all of Auerbach's vocals. According to the band, they wrote 30 songs while recording the album, but were unable to complete all of them. Carney spent about three-to-four days sequencing the album at his studio before soliciting Auerbach's input. The only change made to the running order was the addition of [...] "Gotta Get Away" [...] to the end; Carney had wanted [...] "In Our Prime" [...] to close the record, but Auerbach thought the song was too sad and preferred a catchy, upbeat track to conclude the album. Carney agreed with the change, saying, [...] "Actually, I think it works well at the end, too. It erases your brain from whatever heavy elements {{there are in the}} record. I think maybe it encourages <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and listen to the record again." ...|$|E
2500|$|The shuttle astronauts went {{to sleep}} as planned but were awakened {{by the sound of}} a master alarm on board Atlantis at 22:07 GMT. The tone {{signaled}} a failure with one of Atlantis's five IBM AP-101 General Purpose Computers (GPCs) No. 4. The alarm prompted Commander Ferguson to head to Atlantis and evaluate the issue. GPC-4 was running system management software at the time of failure. Ferguson with the help of Ground Control later transferred the failed GPC's programs onto GPC-2. The transfer took about 45 minutes, bypassing an expected period of loss of signal by utilizing communications at White Sands, New Mexico. After activating GPC-2 and with Atlantis in good shape, Ferguson and other crew members went back to sleep. [...] "You all have done an absolutely fabulous job. We have polled the room, everyone is ready for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to sleep," [...] radioed CAPCOM Shannon Lucid from Mission Control.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's {{opposition to the}} nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, [...] "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: [...] "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass." [...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He {{was sitting in his}} office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from the Iran–Contra scandal, Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was a good president. In 1988 during that year's [...] presidential campaign, he pointedly told vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle at a campaign event in Arizona [...] "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and tell George Bush to start talking about the issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|... “One day Colonel Cody {{sent for}} me to come to his private office. [...] Wondering what he would want of me, I knocked at his door. [...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
