500|$|In early {{planning}} stages of Final Fantasy VII, Aerith {{was to be}} one of only three protagonists; herself, Cloud and Barret. During a phone call to Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview: [...] "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... well, that's maybe too obvious." [...] While designing Final Fantasy VII, Nomura was frustrated with the [...] "perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love." [...] He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked [...] "Is it right to set such an example to people?" [...] Kitase concluded: [...] "In the real world things are very different. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness.

Pharr, 706 / 542 - 5172, pharr@jd. lawsch. uga. edu CONTACT: Ed Larson, 706 / 542 - 2660 FRANKLIN 2 ̆ 7 S DEFINITION OF IMPEACHMENT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ASSASSINATION SHOULDN 2 ̆ 7 T BE TAKEN LITERALLY, SAYS UGA HISTORIAN ATHENS, Ga. - When many pundits cite Benjamin Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s {{statement}} that 2 ̆ 7 in a democracy, impeachment {{is a way}} to avoid assassination, 2 ̆ 7 they take him too literally, says University of Georgia law and history professor Ed Larson, who won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for history. 2 ̆ 2 There sometimes may come a political imperative {{to get rid of this}} person, 2 ̆ 2 says Larson. 2 ̆ 2 That 2 ̆ 7 s how he [Franklin] viewed impeachment: not when there was legal reason - not when he technically committed crimes that were bad enough - but when the policies that were being imposed on America were so bad that it mandated it. 2 ̆ 2 Impeachment served this purpose, Larson says, in the nation 2 ̆ 7 s only other presidential impeachment - that of Andrew Johnson in 1868. Congress reined in Johnson, a Southerner who had been blocking Radical Republicans 2 ̆ 7 attempts at Reconstruction, by forcing him to stop interfering in exchange for acquittal. 2 ̆ 2 Historians tend to look very negatively at Andrew Johnson because the acts that drove the Republicans to impeach him seem to historically have had a devastating effect on America [...] Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s acts in some ways were responsible for reviving the notion of the Lost Cause which ended up leading to 80 years of real trouble in America which played out through the Jim Crow laws, the continued segregation, and the turmoil clear up to the 1950 s. And some historians lay that all at the legacy of Andrew Johnson. Well, that might actually rise to the level that if there hadn 2 ̆ 7 t been a way to control him, some people would have rationally concluded <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> kill him. It turned out that impeachment was a way to control him. 2 ̆ 2 Johnson was acquitted of impeachment by just one vote. Larson predicts history will repeat itself in 1999, although by a much more comfortable margin for President Bill Clinton. 2 ̆ 2 Clinton hurts himself as much as anything by his show of arrogance towards the process, but no one could have acted more arrogant towards the process than Andrew Johnson, 2 ̆ 2 says Larson. 2 ̆ 2 And despite his arrogance toward the process, in the end people couldn 2 ̆ 7 t vote for impeachment, because in the end they didn 2 ̆ 7 t think he committed 2 ̆ 7 high crimes and misdemeanors. 2 ̆ 7 And that 2 ̆ 7 s a factor here today. 2 ̆ 2 Larson joined UGA 2 ̆ 7 s law and history faculties in 1987. He received the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for his book, Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America 2 ̆ 7 s Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion.

5000|$|The first-ever virtual {{concert in}} Germany was {{launched}} on smartphone on August 5, 2013 at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. It {{is based on}} a unique concert, which was staged on May 9, 2008, at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Specially composed for the occasion, Vor dem Verstummen by Harald Weiss received its world premiere in the field of stelae, when it was performed for an appreciative audience of thousands for the one and only time by musicians of the Berliner Kammersymphonie orchestra under the baton of celebrated conductor Lothar Zagrosek. The sound experienced by each individual was different, depending on his or her precise location amongst the stelae. Now <b>you</b> <b>just</b> will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> visit the Memorial with your smartphone to experience the concert in all its unique interactivity. The sound of the instruments changes depending on your location and route through the field of stelae, growing louder or softer, more passionate or muted. This means that the concert you hear will be personal to you. Outside the Memorial, you can listen to the piece in offline mode in the conventional, non-interactive way. In order to stage this virtual concert, a complex process was used to re-record all of the instruments in December 2012. Geo-coordinates were assigned to each individual instrument {{as well as to the}} female vocalist, and a completely new type of software was developed. This enables the instruments to be perceived in a virtual 3D space within the smartphone application, and to simulate the concert at the Memorial. The listener’s location at the Memorial is identified using the smartphone’s GPS function, and the sound associated with those specific coordinates is determined. Daniel-Jan Girl, a member of the Board of Sponsors of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, was the driving force behind the initiative. He was particularly motivated by how future generations would regard the Holocaust and the issue of coming to terms with the past, what form the culture of remembrance would take in the 21st century, and how it could be made relevant to young people.|$|R
