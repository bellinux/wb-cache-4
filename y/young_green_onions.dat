40|$|The radical {{scavenging}} activity (RAS), chain-breaking activity, H 2 O 2 -scavenging, reducing {{capacity and}} total phenolics of {{four types of}} <b>onions</b> (<b>Green</b> <b>onion,</b> Yellow, Red and Purple) and garlic were investigated. Total phenolics varied from 30 mg (<b>green</b> <b>onion)</b> to 49 mg. 100 g- 1 fresh weight (garlic). Garlic extract showed the highest RAS, while <b>green</b> <b>onion</b> showed the lowest one. The chain-breaking activity of <b>green</b> <b>onion</b> extract was higher (0. 48) than garlic extract (0. 029). Chain-breaking activity of yellow, red and purple onion extracts was 0. 19, 0. 048 and 0. 032 respectively. However, heating treatment (90 ºC, 3 h) caused an increase in this activity. Low ability of <b>green</b> <b>onion</b> extract to scavenge hydrogen peroxide was noted (35 %), whereas high ability was noted in other onion and garlic extracts and ranged from 60 to 90 %. The lowest reducing capacity was noted in <b>green</b> <b>onion</b> extract (18 %), whereas the highest in garlic extract (196 %).

40|$|Wu, ChangqingImported <b>green</b> <b>onions</b> {{have been}} {{associated}} with three large hepatitis A outbreaks in the United States. Contamination has been found on both domestic and imported <b>green</b> <b>onions.</b> Raspberries {{have been associated}} with outbreaks caused by C. cayetanensis, Calicivirus, hepatitis A and norovirus. C. cayetanensis, hepatitis A as well as norovirus contamination happened through a fecal-oral route which indicates that foodborne pathogens that share this transfer route, such as Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella spp. may also contaminate <b>green</b> <b>onions</b> or raspberries leading to outbreak. The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential of using pulsed light (PL) technology alone or in combination with other hurdles to decontaminate <b>green</b> <b>onions</b> and raspberries from Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and/or Salmonella spp. The first study on <b>green</b> <b>onions</b> was conducted to evaluate decontamination ofSalmonella Typhimurium using new formula sanitizer washing, PL, as well as synergy between the sanitizer wash and PL. The results showed that for spot inoculated <b>green</b> <b>onions,</b> 0. 4 mg/mL thymol individually and the five new formula sanitizers all achieved higher log reduction of Salmonella (4. 5 - 5. 3 log 10 CFU/g reduction) than 200 ppm chlorine washing. The 5 second dry PL (4. 6 log 10 CFU/g) or 60 second wet PL treatment (3. 6 log 10 CFU/g) was better or comparable to chlorine washing. For dip inoculated <b>green</b> <b>onions,</b> none of our treatments provided > 0. 8 log 10 CFU/g (0. 6 - 0. 8 log 10 CFU/g) reduction of Salmonella. In the second study, <b>green</b> <b>onions</b> were cut into two segments, stems and leaves, to represent two different matrixes. Stems were more difficult to be decontaminated. Spot and dip inoculation method were compared as well. Similar to the first study, dipped inoculated <b>green</b> <b>onions</b> were found to be more difficult to be decontaminated. To further increase the degree of microbial inactivation, combined treatments were applied. PL combined with surfactant (Sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) was found to be more effective. The third study we investigated whether PL-surfactant combination would provide similar inactivation efficacy of Salmonella on <b>green</b> <b>onions.</b> Different surfactants (SDS and Tween 80) as well as different concentrations (10, 100 and 1000 ppm) of each surfactant combined with PL were tested. Survival populations of Salmonella and quality of <b>green</b> <b>onions</b> (color and texture) were evaluated after treatments as well as during storage (15 days) at 4 ??C. The results showed that PL-SDS and PL-Tween 80 combinations at various surfactant concentrations provided similar additive inactivation efficacy on <b>green</b> <b>onion</b> leaves, but not on the stems. PL- 1000 ppm SDS combination negatively impacted color and texture of <b>green</b> <b>onions</b> during 15 day storage at 4 ??C. To consider both safety and quality of <b>green</b> <b>onions,</b> PL combined with lower concentration of surfactant is recommended. For fresh raspberries, we investigatedSalmonella and E. coli O 157 :H 7 inactivation efficacy of dry PL. Raspberries were spot inoculated with pathogens and treated by PL for 5, 15 or 30 s. PL 30 s provided 4. 5 and 3. 9 log 10 CFU/g onSalmonella and E. coli O 157 :H 7, respectively. All the PL treatments maintained lower pathogen survival population during 10 day storage at 4 ??C compared with the control. We also evaluated the quality of raspberries after PL treatment and during 10 days storage. The results showed that color and texture of raspberries treated by PL 30 s changed significantly in 10 days storage. PL 30 s did not {{have a negative impact on}} total phenolic content (TPC) but increased total anthocyanin content (TAC) significantly. PL 30 s provided the lowest total bacterial count (TBC) and total yeast and mold counts (TYMC) at day 0, but failed to maintain its advantage during storage. To consider both safety and quality of fresh raspberries, 5 or 15 s PL treatment is recommended. In the end we observed the bacterial attachment and inactivation results under microscope using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that dry PL, wet PL and PL-SDS treatments led to different cell morphology and viability of E. coli O 157 :H 7. Different attachment behaviors have been observed on different food matrixes. Taken together, we can ascertain that PL is an intervention strategy that can potentially deliver > 3 log reduction and elimination of E. coli O 157 :H 7 andSalmonella on <b>green</b> <b>onions</b> and raspberries. PL can be applied in both dry and wet conditions which make it readily to adapt into the <b>green</b> <b>onion</b> or raspberry industries. PL-surfactant combinations provided significantly better decontamination efficacy on <b>green</b> <b>onions.</b> Dry PL for < 15 s provided a decent decontamination efficacy on raspberries without compromising the quality during storage.
