500|$|Propagation is {{generally}} by seed although semi-hardened cuttings {{have also been}} successful. Cuttings can be slow to strike, and the resulting plants may have weak root systems early on {{and need to be}} supported with stakes. Semi-hardened cuttings have been most successful in experiments applying the rooting hormone indole-3-butyric acid at 8000 milligrams per litre concentration, intermittent misting, and a warmer root temperature of [...] Plants grown from seed may take seven or eight years to flower, with flowering occurring soon after the foliage changes from juvenile to adult leaves. An alternative method used has been to graft mature scions onto <b>young</b> <b>stock</b> to combine a strong root system with material capable of flowering quickly. The species has also been considered as a rootstock for the considerably harder to grow A.pinnatum. Alloxylon flammeum has potential as a cut flower crop.

The {{population}} of ponies on the Forest has fluctuated in response to varying demand for <b>young</b> <b>stock.</b> Numbers fell to fewer than six hundred in 1945, but have since risen steadily, and thousands now run loose in semi-feral conditions. The welfare of ponies grazing on the Forest is monitored by five Agisters, employees of the Verderers of the New Forest. Each Agister takes responsibility for a different area of the Forest. The ponies are gathered annually {{in a series of}} drifts, to be checked for health, wormed, and they are tail-marked; each pony's tail is trimmed to the pattern of the Agister responsible for that pony. Purebred New Forest stallions approved by the Breed Society and by the New Forest Verderers run out on the Forest with the mares for a short period each year. Many of the foals bred on the Forest are sold through the Beaulieu Road pony sales, which are held several times each year.|$|E

Named after Mount Barr in the Skagit Range of the Cascade Mountains, this {{plutonic}} complex ranges in {{age from}} 21to 16million years old. It consists of at least four plutons. The main pluton, comprising 80% of the complex, comprises felsic and intermediate intrusive rocks ranging from quartz diorite to quartz monzonite. It is roughly circular in shape, forming [...] high Mount Barr. Subsequent magmatism created two <b>younger</b> <b>stocks</b> in the main pluton.
