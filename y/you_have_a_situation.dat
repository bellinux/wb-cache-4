500|$|It is {{very unusual}} {{to find a}} helmet of this type on a native {{ceremonial}} site. It was probably made between 25 and 50 AD, close to {{the date of the}} conquest of Britain in 43 AD; this makes it one of the earliest Roman helmets ever found in Britain. Other British examples of later date were found in isolation away from settlements, as in the cases of the Guisborough Helmet and Crosby Garrett Helmet, or on Roman sites, as with the Newstead Helmet. Various suggestions have been put forward as to why the helmet ended up at Hallaton; it may have been owned by a Briton who served in the Roman cavalry, it may <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> diplomatic gift from the Romans or it may have been captured in war. According to Dr Jeremy Hill of the British Museum, the first explanation is the most likely: [...] "Here <b>you</b> probably <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where local Britons are fighting on the Roman side."

The categories ranged from highest response to lowest as follows; (l) Nurse Therapist; (2) Companion; (3) Mechanical Nursing Functions; (H) Parent Substitute; and (5) Housekeeping Functions. Recommendations made were: (1) the nurse 2 ̆ 7 s role with adolescent patients should be reconsidered, since in most of the literature reviewed little was mentioned about the nurse as a therapist and this was the most frequent response offered by the patients; and (2) the opinions of the adolescents which indicated the nurse might function secondly as a companion could be used in in-service education with nursing personnel...|$|R

Those chemicals are: 1) massive leverage — by everyone from consumers who bought houses for nothing down to hedge funds that were betting $30 for every $1 they had in cash; 2) a world economy that is so much more intertwined than people realized, which is exemplified by British police departments that are financially strapped today because they put their savings in online Icelandic banks — to get a little better yield — that have gone bust; 3) globally intertwined financial instruments that are so complex that most of the C.E.O.’s dealing with them did not and do not understand how they work — especially on the downside; 4) a financial crisis that started in America with our toxic mortgages. When a crisis starts in Mexico or Thailand, we can protect ourselves; when it starts in America, no one can.

40|$|I {{would like}} to make a few {{comments}} and pose a question or two concerning the question of the lymphohematogenous spread of asbestos. The paper by Godwin and Jagatic (1) {{is one of the more}} important publications that I have come across concerning the distribution of fibers in patients in whom there was both asbestosis and mesothelioma. This study was done very carefully and demonstrated rather nicely the presence of fibers in various organs throughout the body including the spleen and lymph nodes, hilar lymph nodes particularly. Another study with of considerable interest is by Kanazawa et al. (2). They injected crocidolite subcutaneously in rats and found the regional lymph nodes to be rather heavily involved by these fibers. The fact that these fibers apparently can cross various natural barriers such as the endothelial wall and the gastric, small intestinal, and even colonic epithelium seems to be fairly well shown. This raises several very interesting questions. Those of us who <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> opportunity over the years to look at the gastric and intestinal mucosa are very impressed by the dynamic nature of this epithelial surface. The epithelial surface of the gastro intestinal tract is a highly dynamic structure, the cells changing shape and size continuously. The renewal rate varies somewhat, but is in the range of 2 - 5 days. So when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very dynamic <b>situation</b> all sorts of things can happen, including the insorption of relatively large particles, which you would not ordinarily predict from the static...|$|R

40|$|Helicobacter pylori have {{accompanied}} {{humanity in}} all its migration routes across the planet. Being the cosmopolitan H. pylori bacteria that evolved and adapted the most adverse conditions through mutation and genetic exchange that resulted in favorable changes morph physiological. Such changes contributed {{to the development of}} highly virulent strains of bacteria which cause different pathophysiological conditions in the host. The high genetic variability of H. pylori hinders research to uncover associations with certain gastrointestinal conditions. However, bacterial virulence markers have been identified and associated with different gastrointestinal diseases. H. pylori strains that express proteins Cag A and Vac A has been found in patients with gastric cancer, others expressing Dup A and Oip A are found in patients with gastric ulcer were considered protective genes, since they are not related with development of gastric cancer. The methods used to detect H. pylori infection can be divided into invasive and non-invasive. The endoscopy is an invasive method is where the biopsy urease test to detect the presence of bacteria. The problem is that endoscopy canât identify discrete points of colonization of H. pylori, or else, is indicated when the patient is already symptomatic, where <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> of advanced gastric epithelial cell injury. Among the non-invasive methods have serological methods. Among these serological methods have immunoblotting method that searches the presence of specific antibodies (Ig G). The antibodies against virulence factors and specific proteins (Cag A, Vac, Ure A, Ure B, and flagellar protein) serves both to detect infection and measure the type strain of H. pylori present in the infected individual. This method can be used to investigate the humoral response in patients with and without gastric cancer infected with H. pylori. O Helicobacter pylori tem acompanhado a humanidade em todas as suas rotas de migraÃÃo pelo planeta. Sendo o H. pylori uma bactÃria cosmopolita que evoluiu e se adaptou as condiÃÃes mais adversas atravÃs de mutaÃÃes e troca de material genÃtico que resultaram em mudanÃas morfofisiolÃgicas favorÃveis. Tais mudanÃas contribuÃram no desenvolvimento de estirpes da bactÃria altamente virulentas e que provocam diferentes condiÃÃes fisiopatolÃgicas no hospedeiro. A grande variabilidade genÃtica do H. pylori dificulta a investigaÃÃo para se descobrir associaÃÃes com determinadas patologias gastrointestinais. No entanto, marcadores de virulÃncia da bactÃria jÃ foram identificados e associados a diferentes doenÃas gastrointestinais. Cepas de H. pylori que expressam as proteÃnas Cag A e Vac A tem sido encontradas em pacientes com cÃncer gÃstrico, jÃ outros que expressam Oip A e Dup A sÃo encontrados em pacientes com Ãlcera gÃstrica sendo considerados como genes de proteÃÃo, pois nÃo estÃo relacionados com o desenvolvimento de cÃncer gÃstrico. Os mÃtodos utilizados para detectar a infecÃÃo pelo H. pylori se dividem em invasivos e nÃo invasivos. A endoscopia Ã um mÃtodo invasivo onde se faz a biopsia e teste da urÃase para detectar a presenÃa da bactÃria. O problema Ã que endoscopia nÃo consegue identificar discretos pontos de colonizaÃÃo do H. pylori, ou entÃo, Ã indicada quando o paciente jÃ esta sintomÃtico, onde se tem uma situaÃÃo avanÃada de injÃria das cÃlulas epiteliais gÃstricas. Entre os mÃtodos nÃo invasivos temos os mÃtodos sorolÃgicos. Entre esses mÃtodos sorolÃgicos temos o immunoblotting um mÃtodo que pesquisa a presenÃa de anticorpos especÃficos (Ig G). A pesquisa de anticorpos contra fatores de virulÃncia e proteÃnas especÃficas (Cag A, Vac A, Ure A, Ure B, proteÃna flagelar), serve tanto para detectar a infecÃÃo como mensurar o tipo de cepa de H. pylori presente no individuo infectado.
