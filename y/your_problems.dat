Meg cries {{all the way home}} to Peter from cheerleading practice, and has been having trouble fitting in at school. Later, she discovers a new friend named Jennifer. Meanwhile, Stewie makes {{it all the way to}} the airport looking for tickets but then is stopped by a member of staff. The man then gives Stewie some advice saying that running from <b>your</b> <b>problems</b> never solves anything. Stewie then reflects on this, deciding to finally face [...] "The Man in White". But before he leaves, he wishes the man luck before freezing him in carbonite.|$|E
500|$|DeeKay of SoulCulture {{commented that}} [...] "even with the straightforward, hugely {{predictable}} electro-pop on the Swedish House Mafia-produced 'Numb' and 'Euphoria', Usher is operating {{at a level}} above his David Guetta and RedOne-loving peers." [...] Meelz of ThisGoesIn concluded that [...] "Numb" [...] is a single quality track, [...] "which we can see seeping through the radio {{in the latter half}} of 2012– with the mantra of letting <b>your</b> <b>problems</b> go and dance." [...] The Lanterns Alex Antonetz wrote that both [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Euphoria" [...] are future Charlie Bear fare. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush commented that the song is perfect for the clubs. Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labeled [...] "Numb" [...] together with [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as essential tracks on Looking 4 Myself. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust wrote that the single's production is appropriate for an Usher and Swedish House Mafia collaboration, though criticised its lack of originality. Despite this, Unterberger commended the song, writing [...] "it does have the mind-numbing, body-activating effect the song is so explicitly searching for" [...] and even though you can call it [...] "an EDM cash-in [...] Usher was embracing club music way before most of his American pop star peers hopped on the bandwagon".|$|E
500|$|Lady Gaga {{collaborated with}} RedOne and Space Cowboy {{in writing and}} {{producing}} [...] "So Happy I Could Die". All {{three of them were}} the main instrumentalists behind the song and recorded it at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Other personnel who worked on the song includes Johny Severin for vocal editing and audio engineering, Dave Russell for audio engineering and Mike Orton for mixing the song at Sarm West Studios. An occasional drinker, the song represents Gaga's fear of what she describes as the [...] "Alcohol Monster", as evident of several lyrics in the song, such as the chorus; [...] "Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine, stars in our eyes and we're having a good time." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaga professed that the song is about the euphoric effects of alcohol—the so-called [...] "happy place"—and explained that her fear is split between two songs. [...] "My fear of alcohol. My fear of drugs... fear of addiction. [...] But alcohol is funny because it takes you down to this very happy place and just like forgetting all <b>your</b> <b>problems</b> and for just a minute you're so happy, {{and then all of a}} sudden, [...] stomach turns and go way down... And that's my relationship with consumption and abuse." [...] Other meaning behind the song was given by a writer for Elle magazine, which described it as [...] "about masturbating while thinking about a woman". The singer also acknowledged on her Twitter account that while writing the song she was inspired by English singer Lily Allen.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} refereed. Computational {{complexity}} measures {{how much work}} is required to solve different problems. It provides a useful classification tool for OR/MS practitioners, especially when tackling discrete deterministic problems. Use it to tell, in advance, whether a problem is easy or hard. Knowing this won’t solve <b>your</b> <b>problem,</b> but {{it will help you}} to decide what kind of solution method is appropriate. Complexity analysis helps you to understand and deal with hard problems. It can pinpoint the nasty parts of <b>your</b> <b>problem,</b> alert you to a special structure you can take advantage of, and guide you to model more effectively. You will solve <b>your</b> <b>problem</b> better when you know the borders between hard and easy. Locating the difficulty can indicate where to aggregate, decompose, or simplify. To detect and prove computational difficulty, show that a known hard problem from the literature is embedded within <b>your</b> <b>problem.</b> Fix parameters of <b>your</b> <b>problem</b> to arrive at the known hard problem, or use specialization, padding, forcing, or the more difficult gadget proofs. Study contrasting pairs of easy and hard <b>problems</b> to develop <b>your</b> intuitive ability to assess complexity. (Analysis of algorithms: computational complexity. ...|$|R

Madhavan wanted to demand outright temple entry, but he was denied permission to even introduce the resolution in the Legislature. [...] Madhavan met the then Divan Raghaviah at his residence and requested him to reconsider his decision. The Divan refused; Madhavan then requested for permission to make a representation to the Maharaja himself which was denied. Frustrated and enraged, Madhavan raised his voice of protest before the Divan, proclaiming We are denied the right to present our problems to the legislatures, and we are denied permission to represent to the Maharaja. How are we to resolve our problems? Are we to leave Travancore? The Divan retorted, You may leave Travancore to solve <b>your</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E
