500|$|When {{asked about}} the album's title, Lords said: [...] "I think that fire is {{something}} that's really representative of the record. It's really, really peaceful and you're drawn to it. But if you get too close, it can torch you and kill you. But if <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> close enough, it's warm and it's soothing, it's mesmerising and it's peaceful. It can give you everything or destroy you, depending on how smart you are." [...] The cover sleeve was shot by Joshua Jordan.|$|E
500|$|The Rescue {{was written}} as a short vehicle to {{introduce}} Vicki {{as the new}} companion, replacing Carole Ann Ford (Susan) when Ford decided she wanted to leave the series, and is thus more character-driven than anything that had preceded it. Vicki was a replacement for the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan (Carole Ann Ford). In contrast to Susan, Vicki is an Earth orphan from the future; the production team considered many names from here, some of them odd like [...] "Lukki" [...] and [...] "Tanni". Doctor Who creator Sydney Newman told actress Maureen O'Brien that they were considering having her cut her hair and dye it black. O'Brien refused, saying, [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> Carole Ann Ford back?" ...|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} soundtrack for Watchmen, {{director}} Zack Snyder {{decided to go}} with covers instead of original songs, saying [...] "If you go with the original song, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> the moment. But if you go with covers you also {{get all of the}} baggage you bring to it, [...] I like the baggage. It kind of resonates and rings across time, it's not just of the moment." [...] The soundtrack was produced by composer Tyler Bates and musical producer Marius de Vries. While Bates' job was initially only writing a musical score and helping the song transitions, the composer ended working closely with de Vries as [...] "the songs and the score just began bleeding into one another" [...] - the only track in which de Vries worked alone was the remix of [...] "Army of Me".|$|E

500|$|... "Sober" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock ballad that uses addiction {{as a metaphor for}} a relationship, and evolves around the line [...] "Three months and I'm still sober". The song is composed in the key of D major and is set in time signature of common time, with a moderately slow tempo of 120 beats per minute. Clarkson's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to F#5. It begins softly, propelled by an acoustic guitar reminiscent of U2's [...] "With or Without You" [...] (1987), and takes [...] "nearly four minutes to reach its climax layering Kelly's desperate vocals over each other", as noted by Talia Kraines of BBC Music. Clarkson deemed [...] "Sober" [...] as her favorite song from My December, and commented that [...] "musically, [...] almost hypnotic. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> lost in it, it's just so beautiful." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{the process}} for Yield and Binaural, band members worked on {{material}} individually before starting the recording sessions together. According to Cameron, everyone in the band had [...] "four or five" [...] ideas coming into the sessions, and there was [...] "a lot to just kind of weed through and work on." [...] The band often recorded material intended to be demo recordings, but lead vocalist Eddie Vedder would come along and record his vocals afterwards, stating, [...] "I just sang it, that's the take." [...] Regarding the creative process, guitarist Stone Gossard said that while playing alone [...] "the anal-retentive side of you goes, 'I think I could play better.'", but when reuniting [...] "the entire band goes 'No, it's great as it is,' then <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> in the mood and embrace it." [...] Gossard stated that [...] "the process of letting go is constant in this band", adding that bandmembers would arrive with [...] "a clear idea of what a song is going to be" [...] but eschew for other musical ideas while discussing the song with the group. Riot Act was the first Pearl Jam album to feature Kenneth [...] "Boom" [...] Gaspar on Keyboards, most notably on the song [...] "Love Boat Captain". According to Gaspar, the song initially developed out of a jam session he had with Vedder in Hawaii shortly after the two first met. When they were done, Vedder asked Gaspar if he was [...] "ready to go to Seattle." [...] According to Gossard, bringing in Gaspar was about being [...] "open to new things," [...] while Vedder stated Gaspar [...] "was able to find his place" [...] and fit in easily with the band dynamics. Guitarist Mike McCready {{said that he had}} always wanted the band to feature keyboards.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Sargent (a {{close friend}} and {{photographer}} of the band) described their relationship as like [...] "first love, and all the jealousy and obsessiveness that comes with that" [...] - adding [...] "I think there's, y'know, obsession and jealousy on both of their sides. They bitch about each other to each other or to other people. They have a bond, intellectually and spiritually, like nothing I've ever seen ... but sometimes, you know, you just think, God, why don't <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> a room?!" [...] In the same interview, a Radio One documentary, upon being asked just how close their relationship was, Doherty responded [...] "I love him. Wouldn't go, um - certainly not on Radio 1 - go into too much detail, but... we had lots of wonderful times together, yeah." [...] Barât, when questioned similarly, steadfastly denied that the relationship had involved anything [...] "physical". Barât has insisted that [...] "people are really into conjecture" [...] and has frequently denied having {{a sexual relationship with}} Doherty. However, in a 2011 interview when asked if the two had ever had a physical relationship he replied [...] "There have been moments in our relationship where physicality has ensued." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following a ratings success, What Not to Wear was {{promoted}} to BBC One in 2004 to air its fourth series. The format was changed slightly, where a 30-minute show with one makeover {{was replaced by a}} 60-minute show featuring two makeovers. The series that aired {{for the first time on}} BBC One began on 29 September 2004, and had success with viewing figures which peaked at 5.26 million during the episode aired on 20 October 2004. For a Christmas special aired on 22 December 2004, Trisha Goddard was madeover by Constantine and Woodall, where the episode generated 7.42 million viewers. Other What Not to Wear specials saw them giving David Baddiel and Ingrid Tarrant makeovers. Tarrant, however, did not wear what Constantine and Woodall had selected, and changed her dress in the back of the taxi whilst driving to the award ceremony. The fifth series began on 19 October 2005, where viewing figures still remained strong. On 16 November and 23, 2005 ratings reached 4.91 million and the series averaged with 4.8 million viewers. In 2005, Britney Spears revealed that she was a fan of the show when she commented [...] "The girls are so dramatic in the makeovers, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> caught up in it. Would I go on the show? Never say never.?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{additional}} shortened versions {{were also}} used occasionally when episodes ran over the allotted time: the version used in a few episodes of season two cut half of the first stanza and the entire second, going directly to the first chorus following the verse, [...] "Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> a feeling/Like you {{need some kind of}} change...", reducing the length to 65 seconds, but the version used from season three onward used all but the second stanza, reducing the length to 48 seconds; the season four short version added a shorter harmonica portion near the end, which was absent in the season three short version. It has been a common misconception that the theme was reduced to the 48-second version from season three onward but that version was only used in syndicated reruns to allow stations added commercial time. The 72-second version was used for all episodes originally broadcast on ABC from seasons 3 to 8, with exceptions where ABC airings used the 48-second version when episodes ran over the allotted time. A shorter instrumental version of the theme, also composed by Frederick and Salvay, was also used as a closing theme in all but a few episodes (and was dropped entirely for season eight), which was rearranged in season three to sound nearly identical to the main theme, with another rearrangement for season five that saw it elongated from 30 seconds to 40 seconds.|$|E

500|$|Donald Harington's satirical novel The Cockroaches of Stay More (Harcourt, 1989) imagines a {{community}} of [...] "roosterroaches" [...] in a mythical Ozark town where the insects are named after their human counterparts.
