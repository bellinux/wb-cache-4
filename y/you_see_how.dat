500|$|Relations {{between the}} two nations began to cool in 1956, with Mao angered both by the Secret Speech and {{by the fact that the}} Chinese had not been {{consulted}} in advance about it. Mao believed that de-Stalinization was a mistake, and a possible threat to his own authority. When Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1958, Mao refused proposals for military cooperation. Hoping to torpedo Khrushchev's efforts at détente with the U.S., Mao soon thereafter provoked the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, describing the Taiwanese islands shelled in the crisis as [...] "batons that keep Eisenhower and Khrushchev dancing, scurrying this way and that.

500|$|The {{co-operation}} between monarch and Parliament {{following the}} Gunpowder Plot was atypical. Instead, {{it was the}} previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides {{for the rest of}} the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity. On 7 July 1604, James had angrily prorogued Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies. [...] "I will not thank where I feel no thanks due", he had remarked in his closing speech. [...] "...I am not of such a stock as to praise fools... <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> many things you did not well...

500|$|In late July 1843 Balzac {{visited her}} in St. Petersburg, {{the first time}} they had seen one another in eight years. He was struck by Hańska's {{resilient}} beauty, but his condition had deteriorated over the years. Biographers agree that she was much less physically attracted to him at this time. Still they renewed their vows of love and planned to marry as soon as she won her lawsuit. In early October he returned to Paris. Soon afterwards, she wrote a story based on her own experience writing to Balzac for the first time. Unhappy with it, she threw it into the fire, but the French author begged her to rewrite it so he could adapt it. He assured her that she would [...] "know something of the joys of authorship when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> much of your elegant and delightful writing I have preserved". Her story became Modeste Mignon, Balzac's 1844 novel about a young woman who writes to her favorite poet.|$|E

500|$|He {{recalled}} later: [...] "He {{positioned himself}} {{off to one}} side of-and some distance away from-the last Il-2 in a formation of six. He then turned in quickly and opened fire at the enemy's cockpit from an angle of some 30 degrees. The Il-2 immediately burst into flames and crashed. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> it's done?', Oberst Mölders' voice came over the R/T. 'Right, now you take the next one.' I carried out the same manoeuvre and, sure enough, the next Il-2 went down on fire. 'And again!' It was like being on a training flight. Another short burst and the third Il-2 was ablaze. The whole lesson had lasted no more than 12 minutes!" [...] In this way, Kaiser scored his 23rd and 24th kills. But because Mölders was officially banned from operational flying, the first Soviet aircraft was never officially credited to him. Within the next two months, it is speculated that Mölders unofficially shot down around another 30 Soviet aircraft. At least six of Mölders' unofficial victories are recorded in his fellow pilots' private log books.|$|E
500|$|Todd {{found the}} pack's {{difficulty}} to be [...] "wildly careening" [...] and stated, [...] "Some battles are amazingly easy. You can soar through many scraps in moments, with your party carving up the opposition {{before you can}} tell if you're fighting a mummy or a zombie. However, others are absolutely brutal ... There {{are more than a}} couple of moments in the game in which your party is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces before you can even think about a proper response." [...] He praised the game's music as blending in seamlessly with that of the original game, but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting, with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text. Steve Butts commented on this, saying, [...] "the dialogue here really needs some work ... you'll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences. 'Wait till <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> deep into the backside of evil I insert my boot in the name of justice!' is probably my favorite. It's too bad there's not more voice acting in the game, because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given the developers an opportunity to edit some of the worst offenders." ...|$|E
500|$|This theme {{resonated}} with other {{visitors to the}} site. The American writer Edith Wharton visited in 1920 and highlighted what she saw as the contrast between [...] "two dominations {{look at each other}} across the valley", the ruins of Volubilis and [...] "the conical white town of Moulay Idriss, the Sacred City of Morocco". She saw the dead city as representing [...] "a system, an order, a social conception that still runs through all our modern ways." [...] In contrast, she saw the still very much alive town of Moulay Idriss as [...] "more dead and sucked back into an unintelligible past than any broken architrave of Greece or Rome." [...] As Sarah Bird Wright of the University of Richmond puts it, Wharton saw Volubilis as a symbol of civilisation and Moulay Idriss as one of barbarism; the subtext is that [...] "in ransacking the Roman outpost, Islam destroyed its only chance to build a civilised society". Fortunately for Morocco, [...] "the political stability which France is helping them to acquire will at last give their higher qualities time for fruition"—very much the theme that the French colonial authorities wanted to get across. Hilaire Belloc, too, spoke of his impression being [...] "rather one of history and of contrast. Here <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> completely the new religion of Islam flooded and drowned the classical and Christian tradition." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aleister Crowley {{had great}} admiration {{for the use of}} the ouija board and it played a passing role in his magical workings. Jane Wolfe, who lived with Crowley at Abbey of Thelema, also used the Ouija board. She credits some of her {{greatest}} spiritual communications to use of this implement. Crowley also discussed the Ouija board with another of his students, and the most ardent of them, Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones): it is frequently mentioned in their unpublished letters. In 1917 Achad experimented with the board as a means of summoning Angels, as opposed to Elementals. In one letter Crowley told Jones: [...] "Your Ouija board experiment is rather fun. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> very satisfactory it is, but I believe things improve greatly with practice. I think you should keep to one angel, and make the magical preparations more elaborate." [...] Over the years, both became so fascinated by the board that they discussed marketing their own design. Their discourse culminated in a letter, dated February 21, 1919, in which Crowley tells Jones, [...] "Re: Ouija Board. I offer you the basis of ten percent of my net profit. You are, if you accept this, responsible for the legal protection of the ideas, and the marketing of the copyright designs. I trust that this may be satisfactory to you. I hope to let you have the material in the course of a week." [...] In March, Crowley wrote to Achad to inform him,"I'll think up another name for Ouija." [...] But their business venture never came to fruition and Crowley's new design, along with his name for the board, has not survived. Crowley has stated, of the Ouija Board that, ...|$|E
2500|$|Leonard Woolf {{wrote about}} Sackville-West, who, as an aristocrat, {{came from a}} very {{different}} world than {{he and his wife}} : [...] "She [...] belonged indeed to a world which was completely different from ours, and the long line of Sackvilles, Dorsets, Da La Warrs and Knole with its 365 rooms had put into her mind and heart an ingredient which was alien to us and at first made intimacy difficult". While Sackville-West was visiting Nicholson in Tehran, Woolf wrote to her: [...] "Then there's my character (<b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> egoistical I am, for I only answer questions that are about myself), I agree with the lack of jolly vulgarity. But then think about how I was brought up! No school, mooning about alone among my father's books, never a chance to pick up all that goes on in the schools-throwing balls: ragging: slang: vulgarity: scenes: jealousies: only rages with my half brothers and being walked off my legs round the Serpentine by my father". In her reply, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "But indeed, my upbringing wasn't so different from yours: I move about too, at Knole mostly, and haven't had a brother or sister to knock the corners off me. And I never went to school. If I am jolly and vulgar, you can cry quits on another count, for you have that interest in humanity which I can never manage-at least I have the interest, but not the diabolical skill in its practice which is yours. As I get older...I get more and more disagreeably solitary". Besides for having similar childhoods, both women had grown up with a profound sense of the weight of English history as Woolf's father Sir Leslie Stephen had been a leading contributor to The Dictionary of National Biography while Sackville-West had grown up at Knole House, one of the grand country houses of England. Likewise, Sackville-West had felt torn between her Spanish heritage which contrasted with the English grandeur she had been brought up in at Knole House while Woolf felt torn between the [...] "sobriety" [...] of her father's family vs. the [...] "flamboyance" [...] of her mother's family.|$|E
