500|$|Enio Chiola of PopMatters, {{included}} the song {{on his list}} of [...] "Top 15 Madonna Singles of All Time". He opined that [...] " [...] features a more demure Madonna, confident in her termination of a doomed relationship, and the music is accented by characteristically Asian orchestration and lovely poetic lyrics", concluding that [...] " [...] quickly learned that the {{way back into the}} public's collective hearts was to focus more attention on the music than on the frankness of her sexual image". In his 2011 review of Bedtime Stories, Brett Callwood of the Detroit Metro Times called the song [...] "spectacular". NPR Multimedia senior producer Keith Jenkins gave a positive review of the song, stating that it [...] "washes over you and gets your blood boiling. You may not walk on water after hearing it, but you may want to get <b>your</b> <b>focus</b> back by walking on broken glass". Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] at number 27 of his list [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs". He wrote; [...] "Madonna's most successful single to date is a melancholic evisceration of a lover's artifice, and its hopeless plain-spokenness makes it one of the finest examples of 90s balladry". Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, was less impressed with the track. Although he felt that it sounded [...] "shockingly normal" [...] after the [...] "ambient 'Bedtime Story'", he found the song's length as over-long and deduced it to be [...] "communica no sense whatsoever of the pain of a real goodbye." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the first two, Season 3 of the series was met with mostly negative reception. After the eventual cancellation of the show, Schwartz admitted that [...] "the whole {{first half of the}} third season was a total mess." [...] IGN faulted a season which, in their opinion, had [...] "far too much time and too many episodes spent with the less than beloved character Johnny." [...] IGN also noted that [...] "Kirsten and Sandy both suffered from unsatisfying stories," [...] and that the departure of character Caleb Nichol had been a mistake [...] "as he had been a great character to bounce off both of the elder Cohens." [...] In September 2007, Schwartz admitted in an interview for New York that the show [...] "went down the wrong road" [...] with Johnny. The season did, however, receive some praise. The new character Taylor Townsend was stated as being [...] "played to perfection by Autumn Reeser" [...] and her character was described as [...] "one of the greatest elements of The O.C." [...] Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk described the storylines as [...] "very intelligent and also incorporate a great deal of humor to keep your interest." [...] While looking back on the series in an interview for the complete series box-set, Schwartz explained that [...] "somewhere around Season 3, for reasons too numerous to discuss, I lost focus. The network wasn't really supporting the show." [...] Schwartz {{went on to say that}} Season 3 was probably [...] "the most important season, because it's where I learned the most. About television, about myself as a writer, about discipline and trying to hold onto <b>your</b> <b>focus</b> even if you're hearing a lot of opinions or being forced to add things creatively that you don't agree with. And I don't think Season 4 would have been as fun or as adventurous or as weird and zany and ultimately emotional if it weren't for that experience." ...|$|E

At Christian Broadcasting Network, Hannah Goodwyn rated the album four-and-a-half spins, writing that [...] "The music, the lyrics, the movement, {{it all comes}} together in Zion." [...] Matt Conner of CCM Magazine rated the album four stars, stating that this is yet [...] "Another strong United release." [...] Andrea Hunter of Worship Leader rated the album four-and-a-half stars, writing that listeners will [...] "find songs across generations and traditions to honor God and transform hearts." [...] At Cross Rhythms, Tony Cummings rated the album a perfect ten squares, saying that the band [...] "have released a peach of an album". In addition, Cross Rhythms' Stephen Curry rated the album a perfect ten squares, indicating how the release contains [...] "a variety of sounds and moments of creativity", and the band [...] "should be applauded for their subtle but brave changes in musical direction." [...] Ryan Barbee of Jesus Freak Hideout rated the album four-and-a-half stars, stating that he takes his hat off due [...] "to your art." [...] According to Scott Fryberger of Jesus Freak Hideout, who rated the album four stars, says that this is [...] "the best album United has ever released". Jonathan Andre of Indie Vision Music rated the album four stars, writing that the release [...] "is full of lyrically rich themes and messages {{against the backdrop of}} electronic music that presents a unique way of creating worship music". At New Release Today, Mary Burklin rated the album four-and-a-half stars, stating that [...] "a richly textured release that manages to achieve an intimate, organic feel despite the band's massive international reach." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic rated the album three-and-a-half stars, writing that the release is [...] "just a touch overstuffed." [...] At Louder Than the Music, Jono Davies rated the album a perfect five stars, remarking how the release is [...] "Epic, Brilliant and Original." [...] Emily Kjonaas of Christian Music Zine rated the album three-and-a-half stars, saying that [...] "this is a great worship album that will help you keep <b>your</b> <b>focus</b> on Christ." ...|$|E
