500|$|A second album, We Are the Way Forward, was {{recorded}} over an eight-day period and released by Out On a Limb in 2005. It received three from five {{stars in a}} review by RTÉ's Harry Guerin who said: [...] "you'll get what <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> from their stomp and swing". Phil Udell's Hot Press review gave the album 4.5 out of five stars, saying it [...] "gives you that much sought after visceral thrill" [...] and that the duo [...] "wrote it, recorded it, fucked off. A classic".|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dere's more 'gradin' works dan dat, chile, and dem dat's bin 'bliged to do um finds dis sort bery easy. <b>You's</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it, honey; {{and if you}} does it willin, it won't {{hurt you}} more dan washin' de marster's dishes, or sweepin' his rooms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There; {{you see it}} says 'for a consideration.' That means I {{have bought}} it of <b>you</b> and <b>paid</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> it. Here's a dollar for you. Now you sign it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Not {{of the hat}} exactly,' said mother, 'though I {{consider}} it in doubtful taste for so young a girl--but of the price <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{even the}} night you gave that luau {{when you were}} twenty-one and insisted on {{breaking}} the glassware after every toast. But of course <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo, I didn't know you'd be here!" [...] cried Dan. [...] "Why didn't {{you come}} home last night? Mother {{expected}} you to use the room, and <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|E
25|$|<b>You</b> {{should have}} <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> {{all the items}} yourself.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{comes from}} {{not knowing what}} wages is. I do want wages. If I do a thing I like to be <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it. <b>You</b> are <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it after one fashion, I prefer the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{why does}} my father still owe you money? <b>You</b> were <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> nursing my mother. And, if your demands are merely blackmail, why does not my father defy you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You seem {{a trifle}} worried, sir, and if you're busy I needn't keep you long," [...] he said. [...] "I {{just wanted to}} hand you a cheque for the {{subscription}} <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It all hinges {{upon the}} {{question}} of survey. If the lines run twenty years ago are incorrect, as he claims, then the land you bought {{is located in the}} valley, and in that event not worth half <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What are you {{laughing}} at?" [...] she asked. [...] "It's true. And I said to my aunt at the time, I wouldn't buy anything {{that had been in}} the window like that, for everyone to know how much <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; neither after dinner, nor before breakfast; {{not all the}} coffee, nor all the claret of the Bedford shall tempt me. Remember, my friend, <b>you</b> are <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it; I am not.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Selim the Baker, and {{he slipped}} the gold ring of good-luck on his finger, [...] "I have driven a good bargain, and <b>you</b> have <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> your loaf of bread." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's an impudent idle good-for-nothing scoundrel, and I {{hope to see}} him hanged!" [...] shouted Mr. Hayes. [...] "And pray, madam, whose {{carriage}} {{was that}} as you came home in? I warrant <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> something <b>for</b> the ride--ha, ha!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Down cellar, an' you needn't take on no airs, ol' woman. I've {{known you}} to buy things you didn't need time an' time an' agin-tins an' things, an' I guess {{you wish you had}} back that ten dollars <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> that {{illustrated}} Bible," ...|$|E
60|$|Today, for {{the first}} time, she {{revealed}} something of her woes. There was that about the mop-headed young man which invited confidences. She told him of the stony-heartedness of music-publishers, {{of the difficulty of}} getting songs printed unless <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> them, of their wretched sales.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] Quest replied coolly. [...] "You garrotted {{and robbed}} {{an old man}} and had the spree of your life. The old man {{happened}} to be a friend of mine, so I took the trouble to see that <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it. Well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I mean our, for He is {{your father}} as well as mine, whether you admit it or not. Jesus has bought <b>you</b> and <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> Tom, with His own blood. You are not your own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't talk of that, dearest. We {{never knew}} how little we could live on till we tried; and if No. 12 is taken, and <b>you</b> are <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the new edition of the lectures, and Walter's pay besides--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{they would}} soon {{know that you are}} the swindler who escaped from San Francisco {{eighteen}} months ago. Do you think it wouldn't be found out that it was <b>you</b> who <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the shares in forged notes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{were all}} that you will get. What kind of notes were they you had when <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the shares at 'Frisco?" [...] This {{question}} he asked out loud, before all the passengers. Then Robert Lefroy left the car, and Mr. Peacocke never saw him or heard from him again.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, ma'am, I {{found that}} knife after all. It had slipped behind {{the lining of}} my valise, and fell out {{the other day when}} I was putting in a new stock of goods. I thought I'd call and let you know, as <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it, and maybe would like it, so here it is.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For yourself, my dear Gabriel, {{you must}} be {{satisfied}} with the fact that Messrs. Peter Gunn & Sons will take back your wildcat stock at the price <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it. It is the price they pay for their share in this little transaction, as I had the honor of pointing out to Mr. Gunn {{on our way to the}} station this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, do {{give us a}} rest,' he said. 'Here you {{are just}} going to do a most {{important}} exam., and you sit jawing away as if <b>you</b> were <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it. Oh, I say, by the way, who's setting the paper tomorrow?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "`Well,' says I, `I won't go for to say I'm over rich, {{for times}} air raither hard just now; but it ain't me {{as is the}} friend. I assure <b>you</b> I'm <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it in full, so you make your mind easy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a little. You haven't told me {{very much}} yet." [...] Then her eyes sparkled with amusement. [...] "Mr. Kermode, I'd better say that my brother will be {{responsible}} for the expenses of this journey. I suppose <b>you</b> haven't <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the horse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sixty-seven," [...] {{said the}} Colonel. [...] "That {{is not worth}} much. Nobody thinks she'll go less than 270. However," [...] he added, in a {{careless}} tone, [...] "I'll give you twelve shillings for it. That is two shillings over what <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it--nearly half a dollar.[C] You'd better make sure of half a dollar than {{run the risk of}} losing every thing on such a poor ticket as that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you {{not afraid}} that I should stop there?" [...] she asked again, with {{a flash of}} her eyes. [...] "It is true that I never learned all the story, yet I thought that the prince was not so glad to hand me back to you as {{you would have had}} me to believe. The price <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> me must have been good, Hokosa, and mayhap {{it had to do with}} the death of a king." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he {{took the}} cheque out of his pocket, and holding it in his hand, spoke to them as follows: 'I have {{explained}} to Mr. Bollum, and have explained to my friend here, Mr. Gray, the reasons which induce me to pay to you, Timothy Crinkett, and to you, Euphemia Smith, the large sum of twenty thousand pounds. The nature of our transactions has been such that I feel bound in honour to repay {{so much of the}} price <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the Polyeuka mine.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{the magic}} of the pin was not over yet. Very soon after Mrs. Brough's grand party, our {{director}} called me up to his room at the West Diddlesex, and after examining my accounts, and speaking awhile about business, said, [...] "That's a very fine diamond-pin, Master Titmarsh" [...] (he spoke in a grave patronising way), [...] "and I called you on purpose to speak to you upon the subject. I do not object to seeing the young men of this establishment well and handsomely dressed; but I know that their salaries cannot afford ornaments like those, and I grieve to see you with a thing of such value. <b>You</b> have <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it, sir,--I trust <b>you</b> have <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it; for, of all things, my dear--dear young friend, beware of debt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{that is a}} {{different}} matter," [...] said Desiree, coldly. [...] "These ladies pay {{far more than a}} thing is worth. Now <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> ten francs <b>for</b> the handkerchief itself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a cowardly {{trick to}} charge a {{man when he}} was {{otherwise}} engaged," [...] Hal said. [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> him well <b>for</b> it, master; you fairly crushed his helmet in." ...|$|R
