60|$|SIBYL. But do {{they all}} perish there? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> {{was a way}} through the valley, and out of it.|$|E
6000|$|EVE. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> {{would be}} no killing because the Voice would tell our {{children}} that they must not kill. Why did it not tell Cain that? ...|$|E
6000|$|He had {{suddenly}} perceived a possibility. He {{tried to speak}} calmly, but his face was white. [...] "There is are chance. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was a monoplane--?" ...|$|E
60|$|ERNEST. Stop a moment. It {{seems to}} me that in {{everything}} that <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>there</b> is something radically immoral.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>there</b> was {{a terrible}} sequel," [...] {{suggested}} Cecily smilingly: [...] "tell us THAT. Perhaps Mr. Bracy may receive {{it a little more}} politely." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>You</b> have <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was a, quote, [...] "miscalculation of {{what the}} {{conditions}} would be in postwar Iraq." [...] What was the miscalculation, and how did it happen? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was thinking, sir, that, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> were a {{good many}} of that class in the army, the man might have the option of enlisting given him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Nettie, “I was, but I {{should like}} to see the kind of men to whom they put them up. From what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> are still some of them living in this part of your country?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You mean to {{sacrifice}} us. When you marched down, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> {{would be no}} fighting for us Indians; we might go down and smoke our pipes; whereas numbers of our warriors have been killed, and you mean {{to sacrifice}} us also.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Litten: <b>You</b> <b>said</b> that <b>there</b> {{will be no}} {{violent acts}} {{on the part of}} the National Socialist Party. Didn't Goebbels create the slogan, [...] "one must pound the adversary to a pulp?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I do. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> were {{training}} me for marriage. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> that <b>there</b> were no happy marriages {{except where}} the wife didn't mind {{the smell of}} tobacco. Well, it's lucky, {{as a matter of}} fact, for Derek smokes all the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|GUENDOLEN. I have thought. First {{lead this}} Mildred to her room. [...] Go {{on the other}} side; and then we'll seek [...] Your brother: and I'll tell you, by the way, [...] The {{greatest}} comfort in the world. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> [...] <b>There</b> was a clue to all. Remember, Sweet, [...] He <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was a clue! I hold it. Come! ...|$|R
6000|$|... [wringing her hands] For you! For you! I {{did it all}} for you: {{have you}} forgotten? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was a barrier between us; That barrier lies now i' the upper chamber Upset, overthrown, beaten, and {{battered}} down, And will not part us ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would ask}} you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your brother to overhear what <b>you</b> <b>said?</b> <b>There</b> is nothing to which he, or anyone else, could object." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Or {{search for}} {{a needle in a}} haystack," [...] {{observed}} the Captain, as he gazed with curious interest around and above him. [...] "Well, Ben, I give in. You were right when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no probability of my finding any of the outlaws here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mark, {{there is}} {{something}} about this that I cannot understand. Those are about the same words <b>you</b> <b>said</b> before; <b>there</b> {{does not seem to be}} anything in them, and yet they nearly break my heart when you say them. Punch in the--how is it they go?" ...|$|R
60|$|Quest. But {{how should}} we find out what sinners shall be saved? All, it seems, shall not. Besides, for aught can be {{gathered}} by what <b>you</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> is as bad saved as damned, set him that hath sinned the unpardonable sin aside.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} {{from something}} <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> Joseph, that <b>there</b> {{was a reason}} for your leaving home suddenly; but I can't believe, my boy, you have done anything wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] I said, [...] "you {{were quite}} right in what <b>you</b> <b>said.</b> <b>There</b> {{is no reason}} why we should have secrets from one another. Tell me about these people, and why on earth they have any {{connections}} at all with persons of the class of Louis and those others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "`Well, {{you were}} that to me; you spoke with authority, {{and not as}} the scribes. Nobody could comfort me if <b>YOU</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no comfort. If you really thought there was nothing anywhere, it was because you had been there to see. Don't you see that I HAD to prove you didn't really mean it?-- or else drown myself in the canal.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, sir," [...] said Jack, {{when our}} repast was about concluded, [...] "as {{you are going}} to leave us soon, you had better arrange with the king about getting us an {{interpreter}} and supplying us with a few men to carry our goods. I think <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was once a man in the tribe who spoke a little English. Have you found out whether he is alive?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{told you}} to!" [...] she cried. [...] "It is no sense denying it, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{yourself}} that <b>there</b> was nothing farther from your thoughts. He told you to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] said Mrs. Lecks; [...] "I'll keep a {{watch on}} the water. One of them cans was filled with lobster, which {{would be more than}} likely to {{disagree}} with us, and I've throwed it out; but the other had baked beans in it, and the best {{thing we can do is}} to eat some of these right away. They are mighty nourishin', and will keep up strength as well as anythin', and then, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>there's</b> a keg of water in the boat, we can all take a drink of that, and it'll make us feel like new cre'tur's. You'll have to take the beans in your hands, for we've got no spoons nor forks." ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I am {{delighted with}} your review, {{and so is}} Mrs. Clemens. What <b>you</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>there,</b> will {{convince}} anybody that reads it; a body cannot help being convinced by it. That {{is the kind of}} a review to have; the doubtful man; even the prejudiced man, is persuaded and succumbs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no wish, no regret, {{nothing but}} the old doubt of my {{unstable}} self, and the fear that I may fail to make you happy. But I should {{like to tell you}} something. I don't know that you will care for it, or that there is any need to tell it, but when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> should be confidence between us, I felt that I wanted you to know that I had loved some one before I loved you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The reader may perhaps {{venture to}} think this rather a trifling fact. We are not so sure of that. In this world of fancies, to have any fact incontestably proved and {{established}} is a comfort, and whatever {{is a source of}} comfort to mankind is worthy of notice. Surely our reader won't deny that! Perhaps he will, so we can only console ourself with the remark that there are people in this world who would deny anything--who would deny that there was a nose on their face if <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Un dragon volant, {{flying over}} the empty sea!' said Logan. 'The Highlanders beat the world for fantastic visions, and the Islanders beat the Highlanders. But, look here, am I too inquisitive? The night when we first thought of the Disentanglers <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was--somebody. But I {{understood}} that she and you were of one mind, and that only parents and poverty were in the way. And now, from {{what you told me}} this morning at Inchnadampf, it seems that there is no understanding between you and this lady, Miss Macrae.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought that}} <b>you</b> just <b>said</b> that <b>there</b> were no {{soldiers}} in Lothar," [...] said the Heliumite, {{with a gesture}} toward the guardsmen. [...] "What are these?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wrote to}} you, after Sir Patrick had left me," [...] Anne replied. [...] "I meant {{you to have}} {{received}} my letter to-morrow, in time to prevent any little imprudence into which your anxiety might hurry you. All that I can say to <b>you</b> is <b>said</b> <b>there.</b> Spare me the distress of speaking. Read it, Blanche." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{have been}} {{thinking}} of what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> about business. <b>There</b> is one thing I must do, and then I can remain quiet for a fortnight, unless I should {{be called upon to}} disturb my rest by dying." ...|$|R
60|$|He was asleep; Come closer, love, and I {{will tell}} you all. I had {{resolved}} to kill myself to-night. About an hour ago I waked from sleep, And took my dagger from beneath my pillow, Where I had hidden it to serve my need, And drew it from the sheath, and felt the edge, And thought of you, and how I loved you, Guido, And turned to fall upon it, when I marked The old man sleeping, full of years and sin; There lay he muttering curses in his sleep, And as I looked upon his evil face Suddenly like a flame there flashed across me, There is the barrier which Guido spoke of: <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> lay a barrier between us, What barrier but he? - I hardly know What happened, but a steaming mist of blood Rose up between us two.|$|E
6000|$|... “It is that gold. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> {{were five}} hundred {{thousand}} dollars, which {{comes to a}} hundred thousand pounds in our money. That, as we know, is lying safely in the stern, for we looked {{the day after the}} wreck. So long as it is there it is safe enough, but the next storm that comes will certainly smash up the wreck altogether, and the boxes may be swept into the deep water between her and the shore. Now at the present moment we may consider that gold to be common property. If a Spanish ship ever comes here she will, of course, capture it; if, on the other hand, an English or a Chilian vessel arrives, I shall hand it over to them as their lawful prize. If neither of them come, which is most likely by far, it is worth nothing to anyone. I think we ought to get it ashore, and bury it in the sand above high-water mark.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{what passed}} between {{us a few}} days ago you will perhaps be [...] {{surprised}} at hearing from me, but, if you have the patience to [...] read this short letter, its contents will not, I fear, be [...] altogether displeasing to you. They are very simple. I write to [...] say that I accept your verdict, and that you need fear no further [...] advances from me. Whether I quite deserved all the bitter words [...] you poured out upon me I leave you to judge at leisure, seeing [...] that my only crime was that I loved you. To most women that [...] offence would not have seemed so unpardonable. But that is as it [...] may be. After what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> is only one course left for a [...] man who has any pride--and that is to withdraw. So let the past be [...] dead between us. I shall never allude to it again. Wishing you [...] happiness in the path of life which you have chosen, ...|$|E
60|$|SAVOYARD. Then I went to Vaughan, {{because he}} does music {{as well as the}} drama: and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> thought <b>there</b> would be music. I told him Trotter would feel lonely without him; so he promised like a bird. Then I thought youd like one of the latest sort: the chaps that go for the newest things and swear theyre oldfashioned. So I nailed Gilbert Gunn. The four will give you a {{representative}} team. By the way [looking at his watch] theyll be here presently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it is very}} ingenious," [...] said I, laughing; [...] "but since, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> just now, <b>there</b> {{has been}} no crime committed, and no harm done save {{the loss of a}} goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy." ...|$|R
25|$|INTERVIEWER: Suppose {{someone called}} <b>you</b> and <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was a kid, {{nineteen}} or twenty years old, {{who has been}} a very good boy, {{but all of a sudden}} this week he started walking around the neighborhood carrying a large cross. The neighbors are upset and the family's upset, and would you do something about it. How would you think about that as a problem? Some kind of bizarre behavior like that.|$|R
