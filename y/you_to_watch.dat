500|$|Moore {{frequently}} {{moved around}} the United States as a child, due to her father's occupation. She was close to her family as a result, but has said she never had the feeling of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Panama, Nebraska, Alaska, New York, and Virginia, and Moore attended nine different schools. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. Despite these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: [...] "When you move around a lot, you learn that behavior is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was... It teaches <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> to reinvent, that character can change." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2001, Moore further {{explained}} his opposition, citing how a reader {{can take the}} time to absorb the character backgrounds, by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had just read to past elements, but that film forces <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the story at 24 frames per second. Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was released, and he intends to give any resulting royalties from Watchmen to the comic's artist, Dave Gibbons. In Moore’s opinion, Hayter’s script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic, but added {{that he would not be}} going to see the film when completed. Moore said, [...] "My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It's been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way: in an armchair, nice and cozy next to a fire, with a steaming cup of coffee." ...|$|E

500|$|Shubhra Gupra of The Indian Express was {{particularly}} {{critical of the}} length of the film and wrote: [...] "Ashutosh Gowariker's latest, which stretches close to four hours running time, starts feeling like bargain-basement from the get go. It's much too long, and, despite Priyanka's valiant efforts, just not engaging enough." [...] Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave it a negative review, criticising the writing and the length and saying that [...] "What's Your Raashee? has some wonderful moments and award-worthy performance by Priyanka Chopra, but everything pales into insignificance when the written material is weak." [...] Anupama Chopra of NDTV was highly disappointed with the film, terming it a [...] "gargantuan misstep" [...] for Gowariker: [...] "This epic length simply doesn't work for romance. At nearly four hours, What's Your Raashee? is a marathon watch. And the rewards for enduring it are slim." [...] Sudhish Kamath was also disappointed with the film, criticising the time taken (over 25 minutes) in the first act to reach the first episode: [...] "Priyanka Chopra acquits each of these types with unique quirks associated with these signs and is quite charming in most of her avatars, but there is seriously, no other reason for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Pete Schulberg of The Oregonian wrote, [...] "Forget all {{the commotion}} about NYPD Blue. Homicide {{delivers}} without the lewd language and skin shots. It depicts violence {{in a most}} compelling way: You don't see it. You just feel it." [...] Bob Wisehart of The Sacramento Bee said, [...] "The {{bottom line is that}} while NYPD Blue is a fine show [...] it was on my 10-best list for 1993 [...] Homicide is better. There's been nothing like it since the heyday of Hill Street Blues." [...] Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, who called Homicide [...] "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from NYPD Blue, and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in [...] "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "If [...] is what it took to get <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> NYPD Blue and you decided to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that Homicide is so far superior to NYPD Blue in all those categories that if you're not , you're missing the best hour of episodic television since Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere left the air." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} promote the album and MTV Unplugged, Shakira {{embarked}} on the Tour Anfibio which began on 17 March 2000 in Panama City, Panama, and ended on 12 May 2000 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was sponsored by Nokia. The name [...] "anfibio" [...] was chosen by Shakira for its resemblance with her: earthy, viscerally connected to the water element, capable of adapting and willing to undergo metamorphosis. Shakira said about the tour's name: [...] "You'll have to find out. It's an invitation for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the show and find out. It {{has nothing to do}} with past performances. You'll see an evolved and renewed Shakira. It's a spectacle of many transformations that will prevent the public from getting bored". The tour's setlist consisted of songs from her albums Pies Descalzos and Dónde Están los Ladrones? In addition, she included an a capella song, [...] "Alfonsina y el Mar", originally by Argentine folk singer Mercedes Sosa. Criticism of the tour included the high ticket prices, overselling of tickets in Guatemala, which according to the press could have caused a tragedy, the long delays at the start of the show and its short duration, and the accusation of the use of pre-recorded music in Puerto Rico. Despite the criticism, the tour was a financial success, earning Shakira a position in the list of Top 50 Tours published in the summer of 2000 by Pollstar magazine.|$|E

500|$|In an NPR {{interview}} via affiliate WBUR-FM, Mumbai Mirror columnist Aseem Chhabra called Chak De! India [...] "an {{example of}} a film that's been made {{within the framework of}} Bollywood and yet it is a very different film. It does take up some realistic issues, and what I really liked about the film was that the women who acted, you know, who are part of the team, each one of them got a chance. Their personality, their characters, were very well-written, and so, the superstar in the film was Shahrukh Khan, who was the coach of the team; he doesn't sort of take over the whole film. Every supporting character gets a role, and it's a very inspiring movie that really changed the mood in India. People loved it". Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film four out of five stars stating that it was a film of [...] "great performances by a bunch of unknowns." [...] India Today called Chak De! India [...] "the most feisty girl power movie to have come out of Bollywood ever." [...] Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu wrote, [...] "At another level, Chak De is about women's liberation. It {{is one of the best}} feminist films of our times." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Chak De's ... a winner all the way." [...] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called the film [...] "the most authentic, meticulously researched sports movie India has made". [...] In Kolkata's Telegraph, Bharathi S. Pradhan wrote that the film combines [...] "an extremely well-knit screenplay with unrelentingly deft direction, 16 unknown, and not even glamorous, girls simply carried you with them, with one single known actor compelling <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> Chak De India without blinking". Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave Chak De! India four out of five stars stating that [...] "while the tale of the sporting underdog is hardly new, Jaideep Sahni's screenplay offers a rare look at a popular Indian sport often overshadowed by cricket." [...] Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that the film gave a fresh look to the conventional underdog sports film, comparing its premise to the U.S. victory in the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Derek Elley of Variety called Chak De! India [...] "a patriotic heartwarmer that scores some old-fashioned entertainment goals." [...] In The Hollywood Reporter, Kirk Honeycutt wrote that the [...] "technical credits are first rate with excellent cinematography, quicksilver editing, musical montages of practice and a fine use of locations." ...|$|E
