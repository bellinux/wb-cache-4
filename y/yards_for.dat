5|$|Tech {{received}} Miami's post-score kickoff {{needing to}} score quickly {{in order to}} have a chance to have a second opportunity on offense — needed because Tech was now two scores behind. Tech returned the kickoff to the 24-yard line but were penalized 12 <b>yards</b> <b>for</b> an illegal block. Casey passed for an eight-yard gain and ran for three <b>yards</b> <b>for</b> a first down. After that gain, things went against the Hokies. Casey was penalized 15 <b>yards</b> <b>for</b> intentional grounding, and Tech was unable to gain another first down. The Hokies punted, and Miami took over on offense at its 46-yard line. In possession of the lead, Miami began to run out the clock, executing multiple rushing plays in succession in order to force the game clock to continue to count down. Tech's defense forced a stop, but because Miami punted the ball with just 2:20 remaining in the game, there was little chance that Tech would be able to make up the needed two scores.|$|E

5|$|Chicago {{started the}} game with Robbie Gould's field goal, {{followed}} by Matt Forté and Michael Bush's touchdown runs to take a 17–0 lead in the first quarter. Pittsburgh then scored on Shaun Suisham's 27-yard field goal, but the Bears then scored after Major Wright returned Roethlisberger's interception 38 <b>yards</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown for the 24–3 lead at halftime. In the second half, the Steelers began to rally with Roethlisberger throwing two touchdown passes of 33 and 21 yards to Antonio Brown, followed by Suisham kicking two more field goals to narrow the margin to 27–23. However, Jay Cutler threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Earl Bennett; the pass was initially ruled as incomplete, but was reversed. Eventually, Lance Briggs stripped Roethlisberger, and Julius Peppers returned the fumble 42 <b>yards</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown.

Graham then threw two more touchdowns {{in the second quarter}} to Bob Cowan and Mac Speedie.

Lavelli caught another touchdown {{at the beginning of the}} third quarter to give the Browns a 28–0 lead.
