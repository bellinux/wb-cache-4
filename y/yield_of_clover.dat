Dry matter {{production}} of white clover (Trifolium repens L.), Caucasian clover (T. ambiguum M. Bieb.) and their associated hybrids when grown with a grass companion over 3 harvest years. ? Grass and Forage Science, 58, (1), 63 - 69. Sponsorship: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in England and Wales. The dry matter (DM) {{production of}} Trifolium repens, T. ambiguum and the backcross 1 (BC 1) and backcross 2 (BC 2) hybrids with T. repens as the recurrent parent were compared in mixtures with an intermediate heading variety of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) under a cutting-only management over 3 harvest years. Plots of parental legume species and backcross hybrids were established from small plantlets and oversown with the companion grass. In the first harvest year, the DM <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> <b>clover</b> in T. repens plots {{was greater than}} that in the BC 2 plots and both greater than in the BC 1 plots, whilst {{in the second and}} third harvest years differences between the DM <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> <b>clover</b> in the T. repens and the BC 1 and BC 2 hybrid plots were small. Similar results were obtained for the DM yield of total herbage. There were also differences in seasonal growth in the first harvest year, when <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> <b>clover</b> in T. repens plots was greater than in the BC 1 and BC 2 hybrid plots at early cuts but not at later cuts. Few differences in seasonal growth were observed between parental species and hybrids in subsequent harvest years. Comparison of above- and below-ground biomass showed more DM in roots and rhizome of clover in the backcrosses than in the T. repens plots in the second harvest year but differences were less evident in the third harvest year. The clover in the backcross hybrid plots also had fewer stolon growing points per quadrat than the T. repens plots, but the BC 2 had more than the BC 1 plots. The exploitation of these hybrids in breeding programmes as a strategy to improve the persistence and drought tolerance of white clover is discussed and implications for forage production considered.

40|$|Mixed-cropping {{of barley}} (Hordeum vulgar L.) and clover (Trifolium alexanderium L.) was studied in a {{randomized}} complete block design with 4 replications to detect their best planting patterns at Agriculture Research Center of Miandoab. The experiment comprised of 10 treatments: 9 B: 1 C (nine rows of barley: one row of annual clover), 8 B: 2 C, 7 B: 3 C, 6 B: 4 C, 5 B: 5 C, 4 B: 6 C, 3 B: 7 C, 2 B: 8 C, 1 B: 9 C and sole croppings of each plants. The {{results indicated that}} intercropping as a whole {{had a significant effect}} on number of stem, plant height and <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> <b>clover.</b> On other hands, the highest clover yields (8. 3 t/ha) was achieved in sole cropping and lowest (1. 2 t/ha) in 10 : 90 (Barley: Clover) treatment. Results also showed that spike length, number of seed per spike, 1000 -grain weight, protein percent, economical yield and biological yield were affected by mixed-cropping. Reducing planting rows of barley relative to clover caused 87 % reduction in both economical and biological yields. 1000 -grain weight also decreased from 45. 82 to 39 g.

Sponsorship: Germinal Holdings LtdAbstractTwo experiments {{were carried out}} to evaluate the performance of blends <b>of</b> three white <b>clover</b> (Trifolium repens L.) varieties {{in comparison with the}} component varieties and three other varieties sown individually in a mixture with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The plots were grazed rotationally in Experiment 1 by cattle and sheep and in Experiment 2 by sheep alone. In both experiments, the blend was composed of three medium-leaved varieties (AberDai, AberVantage and AberHerald), but with different relative contributions of the three varieties in the two experiments. Dry matter (DM) <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> white <b>clover</b> and perennial ryegrass were assessed in replicate plots for two years (1999 and 2000) after the establishment year. In Experiment 1, {{there was no significant difference}} between the DM <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> white <b>clover</b> or perennial ryegrass in either year. The decline in DM <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> white <b>clover</b> between years that was observed for some varieties was not found for the blend. In Experiment 2, significant differences were found in DM <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> white <b>clover</b> in both years. In 1999, AberDai had the highest DM yield. In 2000, AberHerald and AberVantage had the highest DM yields, and AberDai showed a decline in DM yield that was mirrored by the mean for all the white clover varieties. In both experiments, the blend did not show significantly higher DM yield than one or more of its components; indeed, in Experiment 2, it was significantly lower yielding than AberDai in 1999. However, where one component of the blend declined in DM yield between years, this was compensated for by an increase in the <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> another component.

40|$|The {{progress}} of N 2 fixation by subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) was followed throughout a growing season in adjacent grazed and ungrazed portions of a pasture at Mount Barker, W. A. Proportions of plant nitrogen {{derived from the}} atmosphere (%Ndfa) were determined at a sequence of sampling times using the 15 N natural abundance technique with capeweed (Arctotheca calendula L.) as non-fixing reference species. Cumulative yields of fixed N by above ground biomass of clover were determined from %Ndfa values, concurrent estimates of dry matter (DM) yields, and percentage nitrogen in clover shoot DM. Seasonal DM yields of clover, capeweed and mixed grasses were in the approximate ratio 60 : 20 : 20. Total herbage yields were 11. 8 and 7. 8 t ha- 1 for the grazed and ungrazed swards respectively. Poorer performance of the latter was attributed to shading by taller grasses late in the season. Starting from a low value of 58 %, Ndfa of the ungrazed sward became uniformly high (73 - 88 %) {{for the rest of}} the season. Clover of the more productive grazed sward behaved similarly except for a significant mid winter depression to 55 %Ndfa, probably caused by excessive defoliation through overgrazing. Fixed N recovered from clover shoot biomass was 103 and 188 kg N ha- 1 for ungrazed and grazed pasture respectively. Mineral N under the grazed sward first consisted mostly of nitrate, and then predominantly of ammonium. Soil-derived N was utilized roughly equally by clover, grasses and capeweed and a field study of %Ndfa of subterranean clover grown in varying proportion with either the main pasture grass (Lolium rigidum Gaudin) or capeweed indicated the grass to be the more effective competitor for soil N against the clover. The data suggested that reliable estimates of seasonal accumulation of fixed N by pastures would be obtained from assessments of cumulative biomass <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> <b>clover</b> N with a single determination of %Ndfa at peak productivity in mid to late spring.

The seasonal <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> <b>clover</b> and grass plus clover were measured under a cutting regime {{during the second}} and third years after establishment. A series of destructive detailed sward measurements was made during the late autumn to spring period preceding each harvest year. In this way changes in the amounts of stolon, leaf plus petiole and numbers of growing points were monitored during the winter. There were large differences in clover yield between populations in both years. These were evident from the first (spring) harvest in each year. Higher-yielding clovers in spring tended to produce higher annual clover yields. No grass ? clover interaction was evident at any harvest. Large differences between clovers were also apparent in the morphological characteristics measured, with the Swiss material generally having greater amounts of stolon, leaf plus petiole and numbers of growing points present in early spring. It is proposed that these factors contribute to the high spring yield in the Swiss populations. Loss of stolon length over each winter was less in the Swiss material, indicating that its good spring growth was not obtained at the expense of winter hardiness. Annual clover yield was found to be significantly positively correlated with the amount of stolon present in spring, exemplifying the importance of stolon survival over the winter.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the best method to establish subterranean clover on medusahead infested ranges in Western Oregon. Secondary objectives of this study were to determind the effects of management treatments on (a) subterranean clover density, (b) density of medusahead and other vegetation, and (c) <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> subterranean <b>clover.</b> Four treatments for establishing subterranean clover were compared including two seeding methods superimposed over six old treatments for controlling medusahead. The results of this experiment are as follows: Subterranean clover density was found to be significantly higher early in the season in the sod plus broadcast seeded area, in all but the chemically treated areas, when compared with the sod seeded area. The number <b>of</b> subterranean <b>clover</b> plants per square foot in May was significantly higher in the sod plus broadcast seeded areas in all but the chemical treatment. There was a great loss <b>of</b> subterranean <b>clover</b> plants in both methods of seeding from March through April; this was due to poor nodulation. Vegetation density was significantly lower in the chemical-mowed and sheep-grazed treatments in May. Medusahead density was lower in only the chemical-mowed treatment. It appears that removing the old vegetation before applying paraquat makes the chemical more effective in controlling medusahead and other vegetation. The <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> vegetation other than subterranean clover ranged from 1, 871 to 2, 437 pounds per acre. The <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> vegetation in the chemical-mowed and sheep-grazed treatment was significantly lower than in the mechanical and control treatment. Subterranean clover yields, which were highest in the sod plus broadcast seeded areas, ranged from 22 to 397 pounds per acre. The chemical-unmowed treatment along with a previous control treatment had the highest yield: the lowest yield was obtained in the mechanical treatment combined with a late grazed treatment. Low <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> subterranean <b>clover</b> were attributed to lack of nodulation which probably was caused by dessication of rhizobja prior to sowing (a 24 hour delay in broadcast inoculated seed), drying after seeding because of poor coverage in drill rows and lack of available phosphorus. In establishing subterranean clover on similar sites, reduction of vegetation would be of prime importance. Prior grazing would be beneficial as shown, but because of the unpalatable and low nutritional value of annual grasses in summer and autumn, vegetation removal might depend on use of fire or mechanical means, with or without herbicides. For stand establishment sod- seeding was more effective than broadcasting the seed. A higher rate of seeding is suggested when surface broadcasting seed onto undisturbed soil. Continued work on establishing <b>of</b> subterranean <b>clover</b> on medusahead infested sites should include the variables mentioned above...|$|R

Improving persistence <b>of</b> red <b>clover</b> (Trifolium pratense L) varieties {{is an important}} target of the IBERS red clover breeding programme. Identification of the factors contributing to poor persistence and testing improved varieties in field trials is integral to the breeding <b>of</b> persistent red <b>clover</b> varieties. Red clover varieties and selection lines bred for greater persistence were grown in mixed swards with hybrid ryegrass or a mixture of hybrid ryegrass and perennial ryegrass over four harvest years. A {{significant difference in the}} DM <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> the red <b>clover</b> varieties was observed with yield in harvest year 1 greater than in harvest year 4. The red clover varieties differed in the extent of this decline, due to differences in the persistence <b>of</b> red <b>clover</b> plants within swards.

In one experiment with alfalfa, additional K⁺ was added after each forage cut to replace {{that which was}} removed. Nematode populations were not consistently affected by K⁺ fertilization. Nematode infection stunted red clover and alfalfa and resulted in lower yields at all K⁺ levels, except for alfalfa at the lowest K⁺ level. Nematode infection {{had no effect on}} taproot yields. However, it resulted in lower rootlet yields from red clover at all K⁺ levels, lower rootlet yields from alfalfa only at the highest K⁺ level in one experiment, and lower rootlet yields at all but the lowest K⁺ level in a second experiment, potassium fertilization enhanced <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> red <b>clover</b> and alfalfa.

Grass and Forage Science, 57 (3), 232 - 238 Sponsorship: MAFFIntrogression of reproductive traits from ball clover (Trifolium nigrescens Viv.) into white clover (Trifolium repens L.) is one breeding strategy to improve seed <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> T. repens {{that must be}} achieved without sacrificing agronomic performance and persistency. The <b>yield</b> and persistency <b>of</b> hybrids between white clover and the annual, profuse flowering species T. nigrescens were compared under a cutting regime over three harvest years. The hybrids included the F 1 and the backcross (BC) 1, 2 and 3 generations produced using T. repens as the recurrent parent. Parental species and hybrids were sown with a perennial ryegrass companion; clover and perennial ryegrass dry-matter (DM) yield and the proportion <b>of</b> <b>clover</b> present were measured over the growing season. In the third harvest year, a portion of each plot was grazed. Differences were observed between T. nigrescens, the F 1 and the backcross hybrids and T. repens. In {{the first and second}} harvest years, clover DM <b>yield,</b> the proportion <b>of</b> <b>clover</b> present and total DM <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> the backcross hybrids were similar to T. repens, whereas that of the T. nigrescens and the F 1 hybrid were negligible. No significant difference in perennial ryegrass production was observed between the parental species and the hybrids when grown, respectively, in combination with these species and hybrids. In the third harvest year, clover DM yield and the proportion <b>of</b> <b>clover</b> present with the BC 3 was lower than with T. repens.

40|$|White clover (Trifolium repens L.) {{is the key}} to the {{international}} competitive advantage of New Zealand’s pastoral industries, which are reliant on a cheap, high quality feed source. White clover benefits pastoral agriculture through its ability to fix nitrogen, its high nutritive value, its seasonal complementarity with grasses, and its ability to improve animal feed intake and utilisation rates. The annual financial contribution <b>of</b> white <b>clover</b> through fixed nitrogen, forage yield, seed production and honey production is estimated as $ 3. 095 billion. The impact <b>of</b> white <b>clover</b> has resulted from understanding how it grows, and then developing appropriate management systems, fertiliser strategies, and improved cultivars. While the future <b>of</b> white <b>clover</b> as the legume base of our pasture is secure there are challenges and opportunities ahead. These include the increasing use of mineral nitrogen, competitiveness with high endophyte ryegrasses, filling gaps in our knowledge base, responding to industry signals, the advent of transgenic technologies, the removal of anti-quality characters particularly those associated with the incidence of bloat, and assuring that nitrogen fixation rates, in grazed pastures, increase as the <b>yield</b> potential <b>of</b> white <b>clover</b> is itself increased...|$|R
40|$|The seed <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> berseem <b>clover</b> (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) {{is usually}} {{obtained}} from regrowth after forage utilization. In stockless, cereal-growing, or specialized seed farms the forage {{is not needed}} and the mowed herbage is seldom marketable. Three different experiments were conducted in a Mediterranean environment to evaluate the effect of returning the cut biomass to the soil/crop on the regrowth, seed yield, and seed quality <b>of</b> berseem <b>clover.</b> Different forms <b>of</b> cut and post-cut management were examined, in which the time of cutting, the amount of biomass returned to the crop/soil, {{and the size of}} the returned material (unchopped or chopped) all varied. In addition, the effect of the berseem management on the grain yield and N content of a subsequent durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) crop was evaluated. The study showed that when cutting takes place during the early spring, removing and returning the herbage both result in similar seed yields but when cutting takes place later it is necessary to chop the herbage to eliminate or strongly attenuate the negative effects of mulching on seed yield. In farms in which it is not convenient or possible to use the cut herbage, returning the herbage to the crop/soil (without detrimental effects on seed yield) would increase N availability for subsequent non-legume crops.
