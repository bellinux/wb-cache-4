25|$|I {{just had}} to lay it down, more or less: first track... second track – you know, really fast working on that. And all the guitar overdubs on Presence were done in one night. But I didn't think I {{would be able to}} do it in one night, I thought I'd have to do it across maybe three {{different}} nights to get the individual sections. Everything sort of crystallised and you'll notice everything was just pouring out. I was very happy with the guitar playing on that whole album, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> far as the maturity of playing goes.|$|E

[...] I just wanted to do the best job I could do for her. When we would play back 'Holiday' or 'Lucky Star', you could see that she was overwhelmed by how great it all sounded. You wanted to help her, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>As</b> much as she could be a bitch, when you were in groove with her, it was very cool, very creative." ...|$|E
500|$|Alex's {{friendships with}} her fellow {{trainees}} also form {{the crux of}} the character as well as the series, especially her friendship with her roommate and best friend Shelby. Johanna Braddy, who plays Shelby, told TV Guide that Shelby's friendship with Alex {{is a big part of}} Quantico. Safran talked to Entertainment Weekly that the idea for their friendship came from the similarity between the characters. He said [...] "So for Alex and Shelby, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>as</b> roommates and as friends, we just really loved the idea of these two people from two different parts of the world, all these things that don't touch upon each other, but they actually at their core are both very driven, successful, smart, and kind humans that find each other." [...] One of the other characters Alex is very close to, other than Shelby, was Simon, who is killed in the finale. Talking about losing a friend and its repercussions on the Season2, Chopra explained: [...] "She's extremely affected [...] doesn't believe in sharing her emotions or opening up with someone." ...|$|E

500|$|Brent Spiner {{returned}} to the Star Trek franchise, having previously played the character of Data in [...] In Enterprise he {{played the role of}} Dr. Arik Soong, an ancestor of Data's creator. Coto compared the character to Hannibal Lecter and talked about the fear that he inspired in the human authorities during the time of Enterprise due to Soong's actions involving illegal genetics. The storyline involved several references to The Original Series, such as the genetic supermen in the vein of Khan Noonien Singh as first seen in the episode [...] "Space Seed" [...] and later in the 1982 film, [...] The first episode of this Enterprise story arc also saw the re-appearance of the Orion slave girls as seen in the first pilot of Star Trek, [...] "". Coto credited this to his idea for the fourth season saying, [...] "What I really wanted to do this season is make the episodes that I as a Star Trek fan would have to see. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>as</b> a fan of the original series, if I heard that they were doing the Orion slavers and the Eugenics Wars, I would have to be in front of that TV." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul McCartney finally stated, in his Wingspan {{documentary}} in May 2001, {{that the}} sacking of Pete Best {{had nothing to}} do with his ability as a drummer. Explaining why one particular member of his subsequent band, Wings, [...] "didn't last long" [...] in that group McCartney said: [...] "It's like in the Beatles, we had Pete Best, who was a really good drummer, but there just was something, he wasn't quite like the rest of us, we had like a sense of humour in common and he was nearly in with it all, but it's a fine line, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>as</b> to what is exactly in and what is nearly in. So he 'left' the band and we were looking for someone who would fit." [...] He told Mark Lewisohn, similarly, that when George Martin suggested [...] "changing their drummer" [...] the Beatles responded: [...] "Well, we're quite happy with him, he works great in the clubs," [...] but also that [...] "Pete had never quite been like the rest of us. We were the wacky trio and Pete was perhaps a little more sensible; he was slightly different from us, he wasn't quite as artsy as we were." ...|$|E
500|$|A black marketeer {{who makes}} a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, [...] "I {{actually}} think this character {{was designed to be}} played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, [...] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>as</b> you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, {{you can make your own}} story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience." [...] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.|$|E

2500|$|Oswald was interrogated {{several times}} during his two days at Dallas Police Headquarters. He {{admitted}} {{that he went to}} his rooming house after leaving the book depository.

However, Oswald denied killing Kennedy and Tippit, denied owning a rifle, and said two photographs of him holding a rifle and a pistol were fakes. He denied telling his co-worker he wanted a ride to Irving to get curtain rods for his apartment (he said that the package contained his lunch). He also denied carrying a long, bulky package to work the morning of the assassination. Oswald denied knowing an [...] "A. J. Hidell". Oswald was then shown a forged Selective Service System card bearing his photograph and the alias, [...] "Alek James Hidell" [...] that he had in his possession {{at the time of his}} arrest. Oswald refused to answer any questions concerning the card, saying [...] "you have the card yourself and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> much about it as I do." ...|$|E

Furthermore, she stated [...] "whether it's gospel or not, I wrote about it", therefore expecting [...] "some of her gospel fans to be a little upset" [...] but wanted to [...] "keep it real". She also discussed one of the album's [...] "primary themes" [...] – [...] "what it's like to be in love" [...] – explaining [...] " [...] mistakes you make when you're in love and how they affect your life" [...] after saying [...] "I was able to experience some things this year and I wrote about them." [...] In describing the album during another interview, this time for GospelCity, Williams said [...] "these songs are just about the real me" [...] and that she [...] "just wrote from [...] heart" [...] before acknowledging that [...] "it didn't turn out to be as 'gospel-ly' as some would have liked", but [...] "the stuff" [...] that's on the album [...] "is stuff [...] went through". Williams then said [...] "this whole album is about God's love and me". After being asked [...] "Michelle, as people listen to the album, Do <b>You</b> <b>Know,</b> <b>as</b> they get acquainted with the songs, what are you hoping to bring to their lives?", Williams responded [...] "That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants to bring your way. I know what I went through, I know God is taking me to another level. I had people around me that were not going where I was going – I had to release them from my life." ...|$|E
