5|$|The North American {{premiere of}} Hard Boiled was in September 1992 at the Toronto International Film Festival. At the premiere the {{audience}} response was very positive with people stomping {{their feet and}} <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> screen. This reception surprised producer Terence Chang who did not expect such a positive reaction. Hard Boiled received wide release in the United Kingdom on 8 October 1993.|$|E
25|$|An {{eyewitness}} {{described an}} incident during {{the pursuit of}} the Austrians. As the French cavalry advance guard approached Crema in a cloud of dust, the observer made out the leading horseman <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Austrian stragglers whom he encountered on the road. It was Beaumont. The general dismounted his men, who were on their best behavior, and requested refreshment for his unit. At the time much of the army was on a plundering rampage, looting everything in sight.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate is}} famous {{due to the}} fact that Newt Gingrich spent three minutes <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{moderator}} at the beginning of the debate after Gingrich was asked a question about whether he had been asked to enter into an open marriage. Gingrich felt that the question was an extremely unfair way to begin a presidential debate and was an attempt to protect President Barack Obama. The incident resulted in a great amount of applause for Gingrich, and was widely broadcast on YouTube. It was also credited with raising Gingrich's support in South Carolina, leading to his win in that state's primary two days later.|$|E
50|$|Kicking {{the cat is}} {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} behaviour of staff abusing coworkers or subordinates as a mechanism to relieve stress. This behaviour can result in a chain reaction, where a higher-ranking member of the company abuses his or her subordinate, who takes it out on his or her own subordinate, and so on down the line. This domino effect can also be seen in family dynamics, where <b>the</b> father <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mother who <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> older child who <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> younger child who <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pet.|$|R
50|$|The carrier's senior {{officers}} sharply rebuke Sakomizu for the Vajras strange behavior, <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> {{him that his}} Vajra is not only dangerous, but is also uncontrollable. Later, Sakomizu <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Vajra for embarrassing him.|$|R

25|$|Perry {{used his}} {{reputation}} to psyche out the hitters as well. As {{he looked in}} to his catcher for the pitch selection, Perry would touch various parts of his head, such as his eyebrows and his cap. In this manner, he {{may or may not}} have been applying a foreign substance to the ball on any particular pitch. Reggie Jackson was so upset after striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game. Jackson returned from the dugout with a container of Gatorade, splashing Gatorade onto the field while <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> umpire that Perry should be allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball.|$|E
25|$|On May 27, 2016, several {{passengers}} {{boarded the}} White Water Landing ride. The ride operator was {{not paying attention}} and started the ride without putting the restraint bars down. As the raft ascended the lift hill, the onboard guests started to panic and started <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ride operators. One of the passengers stood up, {{trying to get the}} ride operator's attention. Soon after this, one of the ride operators realized what was going on, and stopped the ride. The same ride operator jumped onto the catwalk, and closed the restraints through a panel. The ride went through the layout normally. No injuries were reported, but some guests were shaken up. The ride operated normally {{for the rest of the}} day.|$|E
25|$|Marinovich {{entered the}} 1990 {{season as a}} Heisman Trophy candidate, with {{speculation}} on his leaving school early for the NFL. Head coach Larry Smith set for Marinovich {{the goal of a}} 70% pass completion rate. However, his play became erratic due to his personal difficulties. After finding out Marinovich had been skipping numerous classes Smith suspended him from the Arizona State game, but his play against Arizona had been so poor that he might have been kept out of the game regardless. Smith had a difficult relationship with Marinovich, and the relationship worsened when the quarterback began <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coach on national television during a loss in the Sun Bowl. Marinovich was arrested for cocaine possession a month later, and entered the NFL draft after the season.|$|E

25|$|The rivalry would {{continue}} into the 2013 NBA Playoffs when the Heat would play the Bulls {{in the second}} round. The Bulls ended another Miami Heat winning streak by beating the Heat 93–87 in game 1. The Heat came back in game 2 and set a record for the largest margin of victory in franchise playoff history with a 115–78 win. The Bulls also set a record for the worst playoff defeat in franchise history. The 51 personal fouls were the most in a playoff game since 1995. In Game 3, Nazr Mohammed was ejected for shoving LeBron James {{early in the second}} quarter. Norris Cole had his jersey ripped by Taj Gibson while driving to the basket for a layup. Joakim Noah was seen applauding and cheering on the image of Chris Bosh arguing with Mario Chalmers. Noah received a technical foul for shoving Chris Andersen after he fell on Nate Robinson. Chalmers received a flagrant foul for ringing his arm around Noah's neck. Taj Gibson and Noah were both ejected in the same game for <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> referees.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} 37head coaches for the Blackhawks. The franchise's first head coach was Pete Muldoon, who coached for 44 {{games in the}} 1926–27 season. However, he is also well remembered for {{allegedly}} [...] "putting a curse" [...] on the Blackhawks, which stipulated that the team would never finish in first in the NHL. The Blackhawks never had a first-place finish until 40 years after that incident. Hughie Lehman, originally the team's goaltender, became the Blackhawks' third head coach after <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first Blackhawks owner, Frederic McLaughlin, that his proposed plays were [...] "the craziest bunch of junk [...] ever seen".|$|E
500|$|Shooting for {{the episode}} was a {{departure}} from the norm of the series, {{due to the fact that}} filming was not on the Dunder Mifflin set. Furthermore, the episode was not filmed during the day, but rather during the night, from 6pm to 6am. Principal filming took place in Long Beach Harbor, California. Because the episode took place on an actual boat, many cast members got sea sick. Rainn Wilson got especially nauseated on the second night; Jenna Fischer and David Denman felt nauseated on the last night of shooting. During the final sound mixing for the episode, Greg Daniels recalls <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shot of Jim and Pam on deck. He noted that he had [...] "seen it many, many times, but I was yelling, 'Do it, you idiot! Kiss her!'" ...|$|E

500|$|John Gentile from Rolling Stone was {{impressed}} with the song, noticing that it is built in volume and complexity until Leto [...] "was <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of his lungs." [...] Reviewing the piano version of the song, Gentile commented that [...] "it focuses on delicate piano until a breathy Leto gently enters and spins the tale of his decision to move to Los Angeles and his earliest days there." [...] He wrote that [...] "the song rises and falls until finally, it locks into a snapping beat and Leto exclaims, 'I am home! Alex Lai from Contactmusic gave the song a positive review, finding the band in a [...] "less aggressive mood" [...] as they move toward [...] "U2-style stadium rock" [...] and Leto tones down his vocal delivery. Lai described it as [...] "essentially a love song for the city of Los Angeles on which the sentiment seems genuine". Alternative Addiction ranked [...] "City of Angels" [...] at number 11 on its list of the 100 Best Songs of 2014.|$|E
500|$|After arguing, {{the boys}} unintentionally {{discover}} a secret stash of illegal video clips. Bart and Milhouse charge admission for viewing such clips as a [...] "good version" [...] of The Godfather Part III, {{a clip of}} Mr. Rogers drunkenly <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> director of his show, a secret government plan to use Springfield as a testing zone for nuclear missiles, and Ned Flanders' alerting the police that Homer released a radioactive ape in his house. The scheme works until Chief Wiggum conducts a raid on the store. Despite this, the boys manage to keep the profits from their time managing the store.

Bart and Milhouse, freed from running the Android's Dungeon, decide that they had fun, but {{it was time to}} go back to school. The episode ends with Ned still under the thumb of the radioactive ape.|$|E
500|$|Voyager was an {{adventure}} game {{based on the}} [...] license. The player guided Kathryn Janeway and other characters aboard the USS Voyager through three [...] "episodes". The game began as the USS Voyager resupplied at an agricultural planet, only to have certain members of its crew kidnapped by the [...] As Janeway and the surviving team tracked the Kazon, they encountered such things as other alien races and [...] "an abandoned planet occupied only by a single computer system". Unlike in other Star Trek video games of the time, the player manipulated the crew at a high and general level. The player selected the crew's course of action {{from a list of}} options during [...] "decision point" [...] scenes, after which the crew would carry out their orders automatically. Certain decisions continued the plot, while others led to dead ends or to a game over. Producer Alan Dickens said, [...] "We want to make it a lot like you're watching the TV and <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> characters. You're giving them, as a team, guidance and direction on where they should go and how they should address the various problems that come before them." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} game with the Dodgers, playing center field, Bradley went 2-for-3, with two singles and two walks. On June 1, he was ejected from a game by home plate umpire Terry Craft for arguing over balls and strikes. After being {{restrained}} by manager Jim Tracy, {{he returned to the}} dugout and threw a ball bag onto the field. Bradley was suspended for four games and Tracy for one game. On September 19, he hit a 479-foot home run against the Colorado Rockies in Coors Field. On September 28, during a home game against the Rockies, Bradley mishandled a line drive and was charged with an error. [...] A fan threw a bottle at Bradley, who left his position in right field, picked up the bottle and threw it into the stands, <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fan. [...] Bradley was immediately ejected from the game. [...] The next day, MLB suspended him {{for the remainder of the}} season and fined him an undisclosed amount.

500|$|At {{the end of}} September and {{beginning}} of October the Squad as a whole began a losing streak, with separate members losing singles matches to Ric Flair on consecutive episodes of Raw. After Johnny and Mikey lost to the debuting Cryme Tyme on October 16, Kenny started <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{other members of the}} Spirit Squad in the ring and walked off shouting [...] "I'm tired of losing". Tensions further escalated the following week, when the Spirit Squad lost to Cryme Tyme for the second consecutive week. After the defeat, Kenny attacked Mikey, then announced he would defeat Flair, since no other member of the group could do it. Later in the night he was successful, with help {{from the rest of the}} Squad, despite Flair bringing a number of fellow [...] "Legends" [...] (Dusty Rhodes, Sgt. Slaughter, and [...] "Rowdy" [...] Roddy Piper) to the ring with him to even the odds. It was then decided that Flair and one of those legends, of the fans choosing, would wrestle the Squad at Cyber Sunday for the World Tag Team Championship. At Cyber Sunday the fans chose Piper and he and Flair defeated Kenny and Mikey to win the title. At the time of their loss the team had held the title for 216 days, the longest since the team of Owen Hart and The British Bulldog held it for 241 days in 1996 and 1997. At Survivor Series, The Squad (with Mitch) went on to face the legends consisting of captain Ric Flair, Sgt. Slaughter, Dusty Rhodes, and Ron Simmons (with Arn Anderson) in a losing effort.|$|E
