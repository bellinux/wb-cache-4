The essayist Richard Steele found her pitching to a newly arrived girl {{when he went to}} meet a wagon bringing him items from the countryside. He described her as [...] "artful", and it seems that she was friendly and engaging with her potential employees, revealing her vicious character only when they were under her roof; in The Dunciad, Alexander Pope warns not to [...] "...lard <b>your</b> <b>words</b> with Mother Needham's style". Pope mentions her once more at the end of The Dunciad (1728), making reference to her foul mouth, and again, alongside other notorious madams of the day, in the last verses of his Coronation Epistle (which were suppressed in editions of the poem from 1769 until 1954): ...|$|E

500|$|West {{has been}} an outspoken and {{controversial}} celebrity throughout his career, receiving both criticism and praise from many, including the mainstream media, other artists and entertainers, and two U.S. presidents. On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief on NBC (A Concert for Hurricane Relief), he deviated from the prepared script to criticize the media's portrayal of, and the federal response to, black hurricane victims. He criticized President George W. Bush for not [...] "car about black people". Bush stated {{in an interview that}} the comment was [...] "one of the most disgusting moments" [...] of his presidency. In November 2010, in a taped interview with Matt Lauer for the Today show, West expressed regret for his criticism of Bush. Reactions were mixed, but some felt that West had no need to apologize. [...] "It was not the particulars of <b>your</b> <b>words</b> that mattered, it was the essence of a feeling of the insensitivity towards our communities that many of us have felt for far too long", argued Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} episode, Rhimes put an {{emphasis}} on the character of O'Malley, detailing his relationships with both Stevens and Torres. On the topic, Rhimes elabroated, [...] "The interns are residents now, with interns of their own. Except for George, poor George, who is stuck repeating his intern year. It's not easy being a repeater. He's the only who hasn't gone through any change when we begin the episode. But by the end, he has. He tells Izzie that he loves her too. Which takes guts. Because he knows what he is getting into. He's a married man with a great wife, and he never intended to be a married man who loved another woman." [...] Regarding Meredith's story arc, Rhimes felt that she cannot deal with all that is expected of her in her relationship with Shepherd, choosing their genuine love as the greatest obstacle in their decision to break up. [...] Writing for Yang's storyline, Rhimes focused on her unsuccessful attempts at moving on, exposing her devastation at the realization of Burke's departure, which would be the main seasonal storyline for the character. The episode also deals with Sloan and Shepherd's path to reconciliation. Rhimes disclosed that the concept for the plot point was to have the two characters go back to being friends, as a result of Montgomery's departure. Rhimes offered her insight on Lexie's arrival, [...] "Lexie Grey is here now. And she's here to stay. I love that she's a bit of a dork. Being a dork myself, I am fond of the girls with verbal diarrhea. Because it's not easy to keep all <b>your</b> <b>words</b> in, believe me." [...] Regarding Webber and Bailey's storyline, Rhimes noted that the latter's intentions are not to let the former [...] "off the hook" [...] for choosing Torres over her for the position of Chief Resident, which was righteously hers. Rhimes highlighted the unfairness in Webber's choice, noting his unusual manner of comprehending the situation. [...] "She's Bailey. She's worked hard, she's been the best. And isn't it just like the Chief to decide what is best for her? It's his flaw, the Chief. He's an old school man and like an old school man, he's taking care of his women. Whether they like it or not. This isn't gonna be an easy pill for Bailey to swallow." ...|$|E

This {{was in the midst of}} Banksy's highly publicized month-long residency in New York City, during which he released a new piece each day somewhere in the city and posted clues to its whereabouts on his website. There was no response from Banksy until October 31, the final day of his residency, when the message posted on his website which accompanied his last piece read, [...] "Thanks for your patience.

2500|$|Gao did not listen, {{and he went}} {{to greet}} Emperor Zhuangzong. [...] Emperor Zhuangzong treated him with great honor, but for months kept him at the {{imperial}} court and did not return him to Jingnan, and had him follow the emperor to the new Later Tang capital Luoyang. [...] Emperor Zhuangzong further considered keeping him at Luoyang permanently. [...] Emperor Zhuangzong's chief of staff, Guo Chongtao, however, argued that keeping Gao at the imperial court would discourage other former Later Liang subjects from fully devoting themselves to Later Tang, so Emperor Zhuangzong allowed Gao to leave to return to Jingnan around the new year 924. [...] When Gao reached Jiangling, he held Liang's hands and stated, [...] "I did not follow <b>your</b> <b>words,</b> sir, and I almost got stuck in the tiger's mouth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the direct}} {{confrontation}} between Mackenzie’s rebels and Bond Head’s militia forces on December 7, there were various encounters between both sides {{which resulted in}} small skirmishes. [...] On December 4, Mackenzie and some fellow rebels encountered Alderman John Powell (Canadian politician) and Archibald McDonald when riding down Yonge Street to scout the city. Upon meeting them, Mackenzie took both men prisoner {{and sent them to}} Montgomery’s Tavern. Although there were concerns over whether Powell and McDonald possessed arms, Mackenzie accepted their denials and said, “well, gentlemen, as you are my townsmen, and men of honor, I would be ashamed to show that I question <b>your</b> <b>words</b> by ordering you to be searched.” Despite such assurances, Powell had hidden a pistol and shot rebel Captain Anthony Anderson before escaping back to Toronto, thereby dealing a large blow to the rebel’s military expertise.|$|E

His disciple, Swami Karpatri is reported to have been the person who brought the request for Brahmānanda to take the post after a search for a proper candidate was initiated by Dharma Maha Mandal. Brahmananda is reported to have responded to the request by saying: [...] "You want to put a lion to chains who moves about in the jungle freely. But if you so like, I honour <b>your</b> <b>words</b> and am ready to shoulder the responsibilities of the pitha (monastery) management.

In a speech at Chatham House for the launch of the book on 6 September, he advised Thatcher to fight the next general election on a nationalist theme as many Eastern European nations previously under Russian rule were gaining their freedom. At the Conservative Party conference in October, he told a fringe meeting, [...] "I find myself today less on the fringe of that party than I have done for 20 years". After Thatcher resisted further European integration at a meeting at Strasbourg in November Powell asked her parliamentary private secretary Mark Lennox-Boyd to pass to her [...] "my respectful congratulations on her stand... she both spoke for Britain and gave a lead to Europe—in the line of succession of Winston Churchill and William Pitt.

2500|$|The Gemara {{attributes}} to Solomon (or others say Benaiah) {{the view that}} the word [...] "only" [...] ( [...] , rak) in [...] limited the application of the death penalty mandated by the earlier part of the verse.

Joab answered that Amasa disobeyed the king's order (and thus under [...] should be put to death), when (as [...] reports) King David told Amasa to call the men of Judah together within three days and report, but Amasa delayed longer than the time set for him. Solomon replied that Amasa interpreted the words [...] "but" [...] and [...] "only" [...] ( [...] , ach and , rak). Amasa found the men of Judah just as they had begun Talmudic study. Amasa recalled that [...] says, [...] "Whoever rebels against [...] commandments and shall not hearken to <b>your</b> <b>words</b> in all that you command him, he shall be put to death." [...] Now, one might have thought that this holds true even if the king were to command one to disregard the Torah.

2500|$|At that time, the {{imperial}} administration was selecting many officials to fill its posts, {{and there were}} many officials who received positions after lying about their lineages or past experiences. [...] Emperor Taizong issued an edict ordering the officials to admit to their falsehoods, promising to spare them if they did so before a deadline, but stating that they would be executed if their falsehoods were discovered after the deadline. [...] When some officials were indeed discovered after the deadline to have falsified their lineages or past experiences, Emperor Taizong ordered that they be executed, but Dai rejected the order and instead sentenced them to exile. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "I issued an edict that those who did not admit would be executed, but you, lord, sentenced them only to exile. [...] This made my words not stand up to the people. [...] Are you betraying justice, lord?" [...] Dai responded, [...] "If Your Imperial Majesty had killed them on the spot, there would be nothing I could do. [...] Now that you have sent them to the supreme court, I have to follow the law." [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "You, lord, are following the law, but you are making me lose credibility." [...] Dai responded, [...] "The law is how the empire can keep its credibility. [...] Your Imperial Majesty made <b>your</b> <b>words</b> based on your feelings at that time, and you declared executions based on your anger. [...] By repudiating your action and putting them {{in the hands of the}} law, you are showing that you can hold back your anger and respect the state's credibility.

[...] Emperor Taizong was pleased and responded, [...] "I now know that if there is a problem with the law, you, Duke, will correct it. [...] I do not worry any more." [...] It was said that Dai often spoke against Emperor Taizong's wishes in this way, and that as a result, people were not falsely convicted or punished while he was serving.|$|E
