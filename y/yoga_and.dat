5|$|Crowley's {{thought was}} not always cohesive, and was {{influenced}} {{by a variety of}} sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu <b>yoga</b> <b>and</b> Buddhism, scientific naturalism, and various currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, Rosicrucianism, Kabbalah, and the Tarot. He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done. Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like <b>yoga</b> <b>and</b> Tantra into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems.|$|E

5|$|According to David White, Yoga Yajnavalkya {{was more}} {{significant}} in practice than the Patanjali's Yogasutras before the 12th century. Among the texts on asanas and meditation, it dominated the Indian yoga scene. Along with texts such as Yoga Vasistha, chapters embedded inside the Hindu epic the Mahabharata and literature related to traditions such as Hatha Yoga, Pashupata <b>Yoga</b> <b>and</b> Tantric Yoga, the Yoga Yajnavalkya was historically influential in Indian spiritual traditions.|$|E

Gandhi began experiments with these, and in 1906 at age 37, although married and a father, he vowed to abstain from sexual relations.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{influence}} of Vivekananda, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are nowadays considered as the foundational scripture of classical yoga, a status which it only acquired in the 20th century. Before the twentieth century, other works were considered as the most central works, such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Vasistha, while Tantric <b>Yoga</b> <b>and</b> Hatha Yoga prevailed over Ashtanga Yoga.|$|E
5|$|In Hindu philosophy, yoga is {{the name}} of one of the six {{orthodox}} (which accept the testimony of Vedas) philosophical schools.

5|$|Rigveda, however, {{does not}} {{describe}} <b>yoga</b> <b>and</b> {{there is little}} evidence as to what the practices were. Early references to practices that later became part of yoga, are made in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the earliest Hindu Upanishad. For example, the practice of pranayama (consciously regulating breath) is mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. 900 BCE), and the practice of pratyahara (concentrating all of one's senses on self) is mentioned in hymn 8.15 of Chandogya Upanishad (c. 800–700 BCE).|$|E
5|$|The Gita {{consists}} of 18 chapters and 700 shlokas (verses), with each chapter named as a different yoga, thus delineating eighteen different yogas. Some scholars divide the Gita into three sections, {{with the first}} six chapters with 280 shlokas dealing with Karma yoga, the middle six containing 209 shlokas with Bhakti <b>yoga,</b> <b>and</b> the last six chapters with 211 shlokas as Jnana yoga; however, this is rough because elements of karma, bhakti and jnana are found in all chapters.|$|E

5|$|The text {{operates}} {{on a number}} of levels, containing references not just to the Devi's physical qualities and exploits but also an encoded guide to philosophy and esoteric practices of kundalini <b>yoga</b> <b>and</b> Srividya Shaktism.

5|$|With few ties in Britain, {{he decided}} to emigrate to Canada, {{arriving}} in Nova Scotia in 1907, where he gained work {{on a farm in}} Saskatchewan. From 1909 to 1911 he worked at a confectioner's warehouse, and then for a further nine months at a logging camp, before gaining a job as an accounting clerk at the British Columbia Electric Railway in April 1912. He had come to loath Christianity and the Victorian moral systems that he associated with it; instead he began reading about Eastern religion, <b>yoga,</b> <b>and</b> Western esotericism. While at work, he met Charles Stansfeld Jones, a Thelemite who shared Smith's interest in these subjects and who lent him copies of Aleister Crowley's Book 4 and volume one, number one of The Equinox. Intrigued, Smith paid to join Crowley's Britain-based magical order, the A∴A∴, in doing so obtaining more of Crowley's writings. He began performing many of the practices encouraged by the group, including <b>yoga</b> <b>and</b> the keeping of a diary recording his magical endeavours.|$|E
