Pick this up {{before or after}} <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> see Dallas Buyers Club." [...] Matt of Homo Razzi said about the album, [...] "Overall this soundtrack {{has a little bit}} of everything and it works perfectly, mirroring some of the themes, emotions and moments of the film." [...] Stephanie Ochona reviewed for Renowned for Sound and gave the soundtrack 4.5 out of 5 ratings, she said, [...] "Set in the 80s where drugs and other experimentation was all the rage, music plays a big factor in the entire atmosphere of the movie. The soundtrack includes a diverse group of artists, from country stars, indie icons and modern rockers. All the songs featured help bring out the kind of mood a movie like Dallas Buyers Club is." [...] Ochona also said that, [...] "Without such an accurate soundtrack, the film wouldn't have made such a big impact, and both the visual and aural aspects work together to create a beautiful story of a man fighting for the right to live his life." ...|$|E
500|$|Obsidian drew {{on older}} {{computer}} RPGs for inspiration on the storyline and gameplay, like Fallout and the Ultima series. Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said [...] "We've {{been thinking about}} a lot of older RPGs, and we have this feeling that something has been lost with recent RPGs." [...] He compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to Baldur's Gate II, stating that he wanted to expand upon the city of Neverwinter as Baldur's Gate II had done with its setting, Athkatla. [...] "We're looking at how to make Neverwinter a really intriguing place to be, and make it a place where <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> come back to and go and come back to and have it really be a center for the game," [...] Urquhart said. The game's story, while still revolving around the city of Neverwinter, would be unrelated to Neverwinter Nights. Instead of starting the game as a powerful, important character, players would begin Neverwinter Nights 2 as nobodies. Obsidian wanted realism in the game and concrete consequences for the player's actions. The story would be centered on the player character, who would have to gradually earn the respect of Lord Nasher and the city of Neverwinter.|$|E

500|$|... "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] is a midtempo R and hip hop ballad that [...] "mixes a soft {{beat with}} piano accompaniment." [...] Written during a {{difficult}} time in Carey's personal life, the song boasts inspirational lyrics of self-worth and achievement. The song begins with an introductory verse from Mill, followed by Ross on the second verse. Though [...] "cooing" [...] throughout the chorus, Carey's begins singing during the song's bridge and final crescendo, where she displays her whistle register. The track opens with Mill, whose verse quickly sums up {{the theme of the}} track: [...] "The only way {{to make it to the}} top is if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> get it from the bottom ... I remember they said that it ain't my turn/ Just look at me now/ Try to hold me down, but I ain't gonna stop/ 'Cause I'm gonna climb to the mountaintop." [...] During the song's chorus, Carey sings of not being able to be torn down by others and [...] "staying triumphant", before continuing: [...] "Don't let 'em ever count you out/ Realize all things are possible/ In your heart who's the greatest/ Reach for the stars/ Be all that you are." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1933, Gernsback {{dismissed}} Lasser as editor. Lasser {{had become}} active in promoting workers' rights and was spending less {{time on his}} editorial duties. According to Lasser, Gernsback told him [...] "if you like working with the unemployed so much, I suggest <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> join them". It is likely that cost-cutting was also a consideration, as Lasser was paid $65 per week, a substantial salary in those days. Soon after Lasser was let go, Gernsback received a fanzine, The Fantasy Fan, from a reader, Charles Hornig. Gernsback called Hornig to his office to interview him for the position of editor; Hornig {{turned out to be}} only17, but Gernsback asked him to proofread a manuscript and decided that the results were satisfactory. Hornig was hired at an initial salary of $20 per week. That same year, Gernsback dissolved Stellar Publications and created Continental Publications as the new publisher for Wonder Stories. The schedule stuttered for the first time, missing the July and September 1933 issues; the recent bankruptcy of the company's distributor, Eastern Distributing Corporation, may have been partly responsible for this disruption. The first issue with Continental on the masthead, and the first listing Hornig as editor, was November 1933.|$|E

The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd. The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: [...] "I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'"

2500|$|Beatles for Sale was the Beatles' fourth album {{release in}} the space of 21 months. Neil Aspinall, the band's road manager, later reflected: [...] "No band today would come off a long US tour at the end of September, go into the studio and start a new album, still writing songs, and then go on a UK tour, finish the album in five weeks, still touring, and have the album out in time for Christmas. But that's what the Beatles did at the end of 1964. A lot of it was down to naiveté, {{thinking}} that this was the way things were done. If the record company needs another album, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> make one." [...] Noting the subdued and melancholy tone of much of the album, producer George Martin recalled: [...] "They were rather war weary during Beatles for Sale. One must remember that they'd been battered like mad throughout 1964, and much of 1963. Success is a wonderful thing but it is very, very tiring." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{decision}} to have Lexa betray Clarke, a significant moment for the series that allowed the writers to strain the characters' relationship, Rothenberg said Lexa {{was under the impression}} Clarke would likely die in the battle and Mount Weather would possibly remain to keep her people united. [...] "She was probably—master strategist that she is—thinking several moves ahead. Thinking she could keep her alliance together, the 12 clans, because they would still have this evil empire out there to unite them," [...] he stated. Lexa was not expecting Clarke to win, and to subsequently become a legend. [...] "Everywhere she goes it's like, 'I heard it was 5,000 people! No, I heard it was 10,000 people!' Everywhere she goes, [...] a legend now," [...] said Rothenberg. [...] "Certainly it means that her alliance now no longer has a real reason to be held together. [...] I'm really excited to play out the ramifications of all of that." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke would eventually {{come to terms with the}} likelihood that, if she had been in a similar position as Lexa, she would have done the same thing: Protect her own people at all costs. He said she did as much in the season 2 finale. [...] "That was kind of the theme of the entire season, which was how far can <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> still be the good guy in order to save your people. Lexa had that choice in [...] 15. Obviously, it landed very emotionally for both of them, but especially on Clarke," [...] he stated. [...] "In [...] 16, Clarke had a similar choice and I hope that over the course of the first part of , Clarke will eventually come to see it that way.

2500|$|While record-breaking {{years can}} attract {{considerable}} public interest, individual years are less significant than the overall trend. Some climatologists {{have criticized the}} attention that the popular press gives to [...] "warmest year" [...] statistics; for example, Gavin Schmidt stated [...] "the long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are {{far more important than}} whether any single year is a record or not." [...] Of the 2015 and 2016 records, Schmidt stated that the 2014–16 El Niño event was [...] "a factor ... but both 2015 and 2016 would have been records even without it"; he attributed about 90% of the warming in 2016 to anthropogenic climate change. [...] Consistent with Schmidt's comment, the NASA / NOAA announcement stated that [...] "lobally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean" [...] and that the impact of El Niño warming was estimated to have [...] "increased the annual global temperature anomaly for 2016 by 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit (0.12 degrees Celsius)." [...] Comments from climate scientists reported in The Washington Post showed strong agreement in attributing the warming primarily to anthropogenic climate change, with some contribution from El Niño warming, though there were differing views on the significance of individual records. [...] Deke Arndt leads the monitoring group at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information and offered an analogy in a report on NPR: [...] "The long-term warming is a lot like riding up an escalator over time. The longer you're on the escalator, the higher <b>you</b> <b>go.</b> <b>And</b> the El Niño phenomenon is like jumping up and down while you're on the escalator." [...] Arndt also stated that the [...] "long-term warming is driven almost entirely by greenhouse gases." [...] Peter Stott, acting director of the Met Office, noted the influence of the El Niño event on 2016 temperatures but also stated that [...] "the main contributor to warming over the last 150 years is human influence on climate from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere." [...] Tim Osborn, Director of Research at the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit, agreed stating that [...] "ultiple lines of independent evidence confirm that the planet has warmed over the last 150 years: warmer oceans, warmer land, warmer lower atmosphere and melting ice. This long-term trend is the main cause for the record warmth of 2015 and 2016, surpassing all previous years – even ones with strong El Niño events." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Goforth’s {{address the}} first morning an elder stood up before all the people and confessed to having embezzled church funds. The effect on the hearers was “instantaneous”. One person gave a [...] “piercing cry” then many, now in tears, began {{spontaneous}} prayer and confession. For three days these incidents continued. Goforth recorded, [...] "On the fourth morning an unusually large congregation had assembled. The people seemed tense, expectant… Just then the hymn ended, and I rose to speak. All through that address I was acutely conscious {{of the presence of}} God. Concluding, I said to the people: [...] "You may pray." [...] Immediately a man left his seat and, with bowed head and tears streaming down his cheeks, came up {{to the front of the}} church and stood facing the congregation. It was the elder who, two days before, had given vent to that awful cry. As if impelled by some power quite beyond himself, he cried out: [...] "I have committed adultery. I have tried three times to poison my wife." [...] Whereupon he tore off the golden bracelets on his wrist and the gold ring from his finger and placed them on the collection plate, saying: [...] "What have I, an elder of the Church, to do with these baubles?" [...] Then he took out his elder's card, tore it into pieces and threw the fragments on the floor. [...] "You people have my cards in your homes," [...] he cried. [...] "Kindly tear them up. I have disgraced the holy office. I herewith resign my eldership." [...] For several minutes after this striking testimony no one stirred. Then, one after another, the entire session rose and tendered their resignations. The general burden of their confession was: [...] "Though we have not sinned as our brother has, yet we, too, have sinned, and are unworthy to hold the sacred office any longer." [...] Then, the deacons one by one got up and resigned from their office. [...] "We, too, are unworthy," [...] they confessed. For days I had noticed how the floor in front of the native pastor was wet with tears. He now rose and in broken tones said, [...] "It is I who am to blame. If I had been what I ought to have been, this congregation would not be where it is to day. I'm not fit to be your pastor any longer. I, too, must resign." [...] Then there followed one of the most touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. From different parts of the congregation the cry was heard: [...] "It's all right, pastor. We appoint you to be our pastor." [...] The cry was taken up until it seemed as if every one was endeavouring to tell the broken man standing there on the platform that their faith and confidence in him had been completely restored. There followed a call for the elders to stand up; and as the penitent leaders stood in their places, with their heads bowed, the spontaneous vote of confidence was repeated, [...] "Elders, we appoint you to be our elders." [...] Then came the deacons' turn. [...] "Deacons, we appoint you to be our deacons." [...] Thus were harmony and trust restored. That evening the elder whose confession had had such a marked effect was remonstrated with by one of his friends. [...] "What made <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> disgrace yourself and your family like that?" [...] he was asked. [...] "Could I help it?" [...] he replied." ...|$|E
