500|$|At the {{sentencing}} hearing on April 27, 2016, the government presented two witnesses. Jolene Burdge, {{the sister of}} Stephen Reinboldt, read a letter that her brother had written {{shortly before his death}} in 1995. Addressing Hastert, Burdge stated that she wanted to [...] "hold you accountable for sexually abusing my brother. I knew <b>your</b> <b>secret,</b> and you couldn't bribe or intimidate your way out. ... You think you can deny your abuse of Steve because he can no longer speak for himself -- that's why I'm here." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} the lyrics, Streisand opens the song by humming the first few lines ("Badodiodiodi / Odiodo"), {{followed}} by the chorus, where she questions, [...] "Gee, whee, wow, how lucky? / How lucky can you get?". The short musical interlude in [...] "How Lucky Can You Get" [...] switches from a four-bar to an eight-bar phrase, just as it [...] "returns to its original key" [...] and the lyrics become [...] "outwardly straightforward". During the final two verses of the song, Streisand talks to herself and questions, [...] "Hey there, gorgeous! / Big success! / What's <b>your</b> <b>secret?</b> / Just lucky I guess". James Leve, who wrote the biography book Kander and Ebb, referred to these lyrics as ironic and claimed that the music that accompanies the aforementioned four lines was borrowed from Giacomo Puccini's 1896 opera, La bohème.|$|E

2500|$|Some of Morath's signal {{achievements}} are in portraiture, including posed {{images of}} celebrities {{as well as}} fleeting images of anonymous passersby. Her pictures of Boris Pasternak's home, Pushkin's library, Chekhov's house, Mao Zedong's bedroom, as well as artists' studios and cemetery memorials, are permeated {{with the spirit of}} invisible people still present. The writer Philip Roth, whom Morath photographed in 1965, described her as [...] "the most engaging, sprightly, seemingly harmless voyeur I know. If you're one of her subjects, you hardly know your guard is down and <b>your</b> <b>secret</b> recorded until it's too late. She is a tender intruder with an invisible camera." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fifteen minutes later, {{the cruiser}} signalled, [...] "Show <b>your</b> <b>secret</b> sign". Detmers {{knew there was}} no chance of fooling Sydney for much longer, so ordered Kormorans {{disguise}} dropped, the German battle ensign raised, and for all weapons to commence firing. The raider's opening salvo bracketed the ship, while the next four salvoes destroyed Sydneys bridge, gun direction tower, forward turrets, and aircraft. Two torpedoes were launched simultaneously with the raider's attack, and the close proximity of the target allowed the use of lighter weapons to rake Sydneys flank and interfere with attempts to man the cruiser's secondary weapons. In contrast, Sydney was only able to fire a single full salvo before her forward turrets were knocked out, shells from which punched through Kormorans exhaust funnel and wireless room, and caused shrapnel wounds to two sailors. Kormorans gunners shifted their aim to Sydneys waterline with their next three salvoes. Sydney responded from her aft turrets: one damaged the raider's machinery spaces and started a fire in an oil tank, while the other fired only a few ineffective shells. Around the time of the eighth or ninth German salvo, one of Kormorans torpedoes struck Sydney forward of [...] "A" [...] turret, ripping a hole in her side and causing her to settle by the bow. After the torpedo hit, Sydney turned hard to port in what the Germans assumed was an attempt to ram, but the cruiser passed harmlessly aft.|$|E

2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding <b>your</b> <b>secret.</b> It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't know until we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
