5000|$|In 1970, Pat Summerall {{and then}} Boston Bruins' {{television}} announcer Don Earle did a short post-game segment {{from inside the}} team's dressing room {{at the end of}} CBS' coverage of the fourth (and {{what turned out to be}} the final game) of the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals. WSBK-TV, which was the Bruins' television flagship at the time, simulcast the CBS coverage and did a longer post-game locker-room segment after CBS' coverage ended. After Bobby Orr scored the championship-winning goal after just 40 seconds, so the story went, Summerall turned to Bobby's father, Doug Orr (who was reportedly, too nervous to go back to his seat from the Bruins' dressing room for the start of overtime) and yelled over the crowd in the stands above [...] "Mr. Orr, your son has scored and Boston has won the Stanley Cup!" [...] Doug Orr is said to have told Summerall, [...] "I know Boston scored, but we didn't see it! What makes you think my son scored?" [...] Summerall supposedly replied, [...] "Because they wouldn't be <b>yelling</b> <b>this</b> loudly if Esposito had scored!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Based on the {{original}} pandemonium architecture, John Jackson has extended the theory to explain phenomena beyond perception. Jackson offered the analogy of an arena to account for [...] "consciousness". His arena consisted of a stand, a playing field, and a sub-arena. The arena was populated by a multitude of demons. The demons that were designated in the playing fields were the active demons, as they represent the active elements of human consciousness. The demons in the stands are to watch those in the playing field until something excites them; each demon is excited by different things. The more excited the demons get, the louder they yell. If a demon yells pass a set threshold, it gets to join the other demons in the playing field and perform its function, which may then excite other demons, and this cycle continues. The sub-arena in the analogy functions as the learning and feedback mechanism of the system. The learning system here is similar to any other neural styled networks, which is through modifying the connection strength between the demons; in other words, how the demons respond to each other’s <b>yelling.</b> <b>This</b> multiple agent approach to human information processing became the assumption for many modern artificial intelligence systems.|$|E

[...] He <b>yelled</b> <b>this</b> again and again. All round him broken glass was falling, chairs were being swung in the air, people were taking each other by the throat. The police dashed in.

In an attempt to excite the crowd, Pinky Downs, a 1906 Texas A graduate and member of the school's Board of Regents, asked the crowd [...] "What {{are we going to do}} to those Horned Frogs?"

5000|$|Poet {{and critic}} Nikolai Poyarkov used the debut Collection of Poems as an {{occasion}} for tracing down Gippius' development ('from sticky atheism to Christianity', as he put it) and found her earlier 'decadent' pieces artistically more interesting than her later religious poems. [...] "The God-searching poems are cold, dry and un-prayer-like. Logical and schematic, they lack the true sinner's <b>yell,</b> <b>this</b> passion of the one at crossroads, longing for God. Their mannerisms and pretentiousness would rather appeal to a pure esthete, than a true Christian believer... Old pieces are better, they were really sincere prayers and in them Gippius's soul resonates richly, full of tiny nuances." ...|$|R

5000|$|This serial {{features}} an alternate {{version of the}} famous Tarzan <b>yell.</b> <b>This</b> version is variously described as a rising pitch [...] "Man-gan-i" [...] or [...] "Tar-man-gan-i" [...] sound. The [...] "Tar-man-gan-i" [...] version originally comes from the 1932 Tarzan radio serial starring James Pierce. In the ape language used in the Burroughs' Tarzan novels, [...] "Tarmangani" [...] means [...] "Great White Ape". MGM's Johnny Weissmuller films, featuring the now standard yell, had been in production for some time when this serial was created, starting with Tarzan the Ape Man (1932).The original version of the plot involved munitions runners and government agents, focussing more on the super-explosive formula hidden in the idol. This was re-written during production but some elements remain, such as the otherwise nonsensical final chapter name [...] "Operator No. 17" [...] (Ula Vale was originally written as a government agent using [...] "Operator No. 17" [...] as her codename but this entire plot line was dropped from the final script).|$|R

They were going to put the boot on me at first, but the officer in command ordered them to try the thumbscrews. This was lucky, for a man may get along with damaged thumbs, {{but it would have been}} hard to travel with crippled legs! I held out though, until the pain became so great that I couldn't help giving a tremendous <b>yell.</b> <b>This</b> seemed to touch the officer with pity, for he ordered his men to let me be. Soon afterwards your mother and I managed to give them the slip, and we came on here." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Neurotic Society (Compulsory Mix)" [...] is Ms. Hill's first {{official}} studio recording since {{the release of}} [...] "Turn Your Lights Down Low" [...] in November 1999. Neurotic society is a mid-tempo alternative hip hop song in which Hill raps lyrics at an alarming speed. The lyrics discuss social corruption and corporate manipulation, and their effect on today's youth. The single was announced and released on May 4, 2013 during Ms. Hill's tax troubles. During this time Hill reported that she had entered into an agreement with Sony that would allow her to release her own music. Upon the single's release, Ms. Hill posted an open letter on her official Facebook page: [...] "Here is a link to a piece that I was 'required' to release immediately, {{by virtue of the}} impending legal deadline. I love being able to reach people directly, but in an ideal scenario, I would not have to rush the release of new music... but the message is still there. In light of Wednesday's tragic loss (of former label mate Chris Kelly), I am even more pressed to <b>YELL</b> <b>this</b> to a multitude that may not understand the cost of allowing today's unhealthy paradigms to remain unchecked!" [...] Hill performed the song live {{for the first time on}} May 14, 2013 at Brooklyn's Music Hall of Williamsburg.|$|R

40|$|Nihilistic act embraces doomsday The Age – December 2012 By Rebecca Harkins-Cross For The Book of Revelations A WOMAN stumbles {{backwards}} {{through the}} audience, burdened by an overflowing backpack, muttering about the home she’s left behind. When {{she reaches the}} mountain onstage, she looks upon its cloud-swirled peak with awe. This stillness is ruptured by an involuntary outburst as she begins spitting out the scourges {{of the modern world}} – “nuclear explosion… war… car salesman”, she <b>yells.</b> <b>This</b> is the final show in La Mama’s explorations season, which allows performers to stage works still in development. Devised and performed by theatre maker and academic Alison Richards, it questions our eschatological paranoia that the end times are upon us. It is fitting then that it is premiered {{on the eve of the}} Mayan’s prophesised doomsday. Like many pilgrims before her, Ada (Richards) ascends the mountain in search of salvation, but her journey evokes sublime terror; she speaks in tongues, collapses into fitful sleeps. Richards combines operatic singing with an ethereal score by Faye Bendrups, her eruptions into song apparently brought on by the mountain’s ecstatic pull. Richards’ seraphic voice is haunting, the lyrics evoking visions of birth and death. But when Ada finally converses with the heavens, she does not receive the revelations she hopes for: the voice of the divine is nihilistic, urging her to accept the universe’s chaos. While the work is still fragmentary, unfolding like a dream, this is a powerful performance by Richards. Its striking imagery fails to cohere yet in narrative terms, but it is promising nonetheless.
