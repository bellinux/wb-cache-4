The court heard testimony from Intertainment that according to Franchise's bank records the real cost of Battlefield Earth was $44million, not the $75 million declared by Franchise.

The neo soul song [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] is a self-empowerment anthem that decries society's obsession with harmful and unattainable standards of beauty. The song uses audio snippets of beauty pageants which Beyoncé contested in to frame the song in the context of her childhood.|$|E
