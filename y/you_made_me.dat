Loveless, which {{has been described as}} the band's magnum opus {{and one of the best}} albums of the 1990s, was a major critical success. However, the band were dropped by Creation Records after its release due to the album's extensive production costs.

Following the departure of Googe and Ó Cíosóig in 1995, My Bloody Valentine later disbanded in 1997.|$|E

500|$|Albert Brooks {{plays the}} foul-mouthed, morose Bernie Rose.

[...] "There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part, and I like that the director was thinking outside of the box. For me, it was an opportunity to act outside the box. I liked that this mobster had real style. Also, he doesn't {{get up in the morning}} thinking about killing people. He's sad about it. Upset about it.

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "City Girl" [...] {{received}} moderate critical acclaim. Pitchfork Media writer Mark Richardson {{said that}} [...] "on first listen {{it sounds like}} a demo of a pre-Loveless track, possibly from the <b>You</b> <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> Realise era" [...] and while there was [...] "no exploration on that front … the melody and voice are familiar and welcome." [...] Writing for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger called [...] "City Girl" [...] "a worthy opener" [...] and added that [...] " [...] where Kevin's at right now—making pretty pop songs. There is so little to this song that it's almost enough to make you think Kevin's lost his mind." [...] Unterberger summarised the song as [...] "gorgeous, and definitely has that sighing quality to it that makes the film so delectable." [...] Exclaim! journalist Michael White noted that it was [...] "the indisputable highlight of the soundtrack" [...] and AllMusics Heather Phares described [...] "City Girl" [...] as an [...] "open-ended piece" [...] and [...] "naïve [...] guitar-driven" [...] but added that it did not compare to Shields' compositions on Loveless (1991).|$|E

Lyrically, Aguilera wants to thank {{the man who did}} her wrong rather than insult him, because he helped make her stronger and work harder, thus making her a fighter. At the chorus, she sings, [...] "'Cause it makes me that much stronger/ Makes me work a little bit harder/ Makes me that much wiser/ So thanks for making me a fighter". The chords in the guitar part are E5 – F5 – G5 – A5 – B5 − C5 – B5 – A5 – G5 – F5 [...] E5.

While singing the first and second verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E

500|$|Lennon {{later said}} he [...] "couldn't {{remember}} any of the words but it didn't matter—I just made them all up and we made a great wonderful noise." [...] Carl Perkins said to Lennon after the {{show that he was}} [...] "so beautiful <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> cry." [...] A bootleg album of the concert appeared, under the title JL-YO-EC, thanks to an audience recording, which was released {{a few months after the}} official album. After Lennon's death, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set, which was released in the UK on 15 June 1981. The album was reissued in the US in 1982, on Capitol, and again in the same country on the same label, in 1986. The album was originally scheduled to appear on CD for the first time in June 1989, but the plan was scrapped. Ono, with the help of Rob Stevens from Quad Recording, supervised a remixing of Live Peace in Toronto 1969 for its compact disc issue, released on 1 May 1995.

500|$|My Bloody Valentine's musical style progressed {{throughout}} their career. The band were originally influenced by post-punk, in particular The Birthday Party, The Cramps and Joy Division, and as author Mike McGonial noted, [...] "brought together the least interesting elements" [...] of their influences. Their debut mini album, This is Your Bloody Valentine (1985), incorporated a further gothic rock sound which AllMusic {{referred to as}} [...] "unfocused and derivative". However, when the band began experimenting with indie pop melodies on The New Record by My Bloody Valentine (1986), it marked [...] "a vital point {{in the development of}} their sound", which was influenced primarily by The Jesus and Mary Chain. The band later took a [...] "rarified, effete and poppy approach to Byrdsian rock" [...] with their two successive releases, [...] "Strawberry Wine" [...] and Ecstasy (1987). Isn't Anything, and its preceding release <b>You</b> <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> Realise (1988), were influenced by American indie rock bands, most notably Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic Youth, as well as hip hop music. Loveless (1991) was influenced by a wide range of genres, including dream pop, noise rock and house music. In the mid-1990s, during the recording of m b v (2013), Kevin Shields and Colm Ó Cíosóig began experimenting with drum and bass music, which was an underground trend in London at the time. Elements of jungle music were incorporated into m b v, particularly the final three tracks—"In Another Way", [...] "Nothing Is" [...] and [...] "Wonder 2"—which marked a further shift in My Bloody Valentine's sound that Pitchfork referred to as [...] "so surprising and ultimately powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Gosling {{appeared}} as a disturbed young art student in Stay, a psychological thriller film co-starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that Gosling [...] "like his fans, deserves better." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the [...] "capable" [...] McGregor and Gosling [...] "deliver nothing new from what they've shown before". The film grossed $8 million worldwide. Gosling was unfazed by the negative reaction: [...] "I had a kid {{come up to me}} on the street, 10 years old, and he says, 'Are you that guy from Stay? What the f--- was that movie about?' I think that's great. I'm just as proud if someone says, 'Hey, <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> sick in that movie,' as if they say I made them cry.” Gosling next starred in 2006's Half Nelson as a drug-addicted junior high school teacher who forms a bond with a young student. To prepare for the role, Gosling moved to New York for one month before shooting began. He lived in a small apartment in Brooklyn and spent time shadowing an eighth grade teacher. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described [...] "a mesmerizing performance ... that shows the kind of deep understanding of character few actors manage." [...] Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle drew comparisons with Marlon Brando and declared that [...] "nobody who cares about great acting will want to miss his performance". Roger Ebert felt the performance [...] "proves he's one of the finest actors working in contemporary movies." [...] He was nominated for an Academy Award. The film grossed $4 million at the worldwide box office. In 2007, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.|$|E
