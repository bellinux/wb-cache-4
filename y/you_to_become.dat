The event {{coincided with the}} start of the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein, and Dylan performed [...] "Masters of War". Dylan then made a short speech, saying [...] "My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways.'" [...] This sentiment was subsequently revealed to be a quote from 19th-century German Jewish intellectual, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.|$|E
500|$|The {{play has}} {{received}} modest reviews. Julian Hall of The Independent criticized {{it for a}} lack of inside stories about The Simpsons, writing that [...] "Cartwright never allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> bored but that means some issues are skirted over faster than American closing credits on television. You never really get a feel what it is like recording the show." [...] Brian Logan of The Guardian described Cartwright as [...] "a lively host [...] eager to please", but found the play to be [...] "an overweeningly upbeat collection of Simpsons chitchat." [...] David Chatterton of British Theatre Guide described it as [...] "interesting and entertaining, but not really a 'must see' even for Simpsons fans." [...] Clive Davis of The Times wrote that [...] "In contrast to The Simpsons itself, where not a line, not a syllable, goes to waste, Cartwright has a habit of losing herself in anecdotes that stumble into dead-ends. [...] The half-hearted trivia quiz involving volunteers from the audience soon dies a death too. The performance really cries out for a hard-headed director. The video clips of Cartwright at large are fun, however." ...|$|E
500|$|Destructoids Chris Carter commended Ashly Burch and Lance Reddick {{for their}} performances, with the {{character}} of Aloy receiving credit for maintaining a [...] "captivating" [...] and [...] "interesting" [...] consistency in the narrative and action sequences. Carter also lauded the focus on exploration and discovery, which he said grew more effective as he traversed more of the land. The game world itself was subject to compliment for its [...] "beautiful" [...] day-night cycle and weather system. According to Carter, the challenging nature of the machines and varied methods with which to battle them brought {{a real sense of}} fun to the combat. Matt Buchholtz of Electronic Gaming Monthly likewise praised Burch as well as the game world, which he found to be mesmerising. Thought as the most powerful part of the game, the Focus feature gained approval for complementing the combat in a way that [...] "forces <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a hunter". Writing for Game Informer, Jeff Marchiafava opined that, unlike with other open world video games, searching for audio logs and emails provided the plot with a [...] "remarkable sense of discovery". He was thankful that story-based missions dominated the overall experience, arguing that they worked to detail the game world and inspired variation in the gameplay.|$|E

2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E

[...] They agreed to race around the mountain. [...] The boys ran fast, and the two Holy People ran slower. [...] But soon the boys became tired and the Holy People came up behind them and began taunting them and {{whipping}} them with switches of mountain mahogany. [...] As they approached home, Talking God and Water Sprinkler ran past them and won the race. [...] "We will return in four days to race again," [...] they said, and departed. [...] In the evening, the boys were sore and tired. , the Wind came to them and said, [...] "Practice each day and grow stronger." [...] In four days, Talking God and Water Sprinkler returned, and the four raced again around the mountain. [...] It was a faster pace, but just as before, Talking God and Water Sprinkler ran just behind the twins and whipped them with switches. [...] Again the Holy People said they would return in four days to race again. [...] And again in the evening [...] came and encouraged them and urged them to train. [...] Each day the boys trained, and in the third race, Talking God and Water Sprinkler no longer whipped the twins, but had to run their strongest to win the race at the end. [...] Four days later they returned to race a final time. [...] Again, the boys started very fast, but this time they did not tire and slow their pace. [...] They led the whole way and won the race.

2500|$|The {{premiere of}} Broadchurch series two {{met with a}} highly {{positive}} critical reception. The Independent awarded the premiere episode four stars out of five and labelled it [...] "a brilliant demonstration of the risks a writer {{can get away with}} when there’s a proven cast to fall back on". When questioning whether the series would be able to retain the quality of the previous series, reviewer Ellen E. Jones stated, [...] "On the evidence of last night's twist-packed opener, perhaps even more so". Ben Lawrence in The Daily Telegraph also awarded the premiere episode 4/5, praising the performances of Tennant and Colman. They closed their review by stating [...] "Broadchurch continues to be a rich and complex tapestry which respects the viewer's intelligence and commands <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> an armchair detective". Kevin O'Sullivan, writing for the Daily Mirror, called the first episode [...] "tension-packed" [...] and [...] "an impressive opening salvo looks set to grip the nation all over again." [...] He also singled out the [...] "chilling Nordic noir-style music" [...] for praise. Awarding the episode a full 5/5, Andrew Billen of The Times labelled the first episode [...] "expansively told and imaginatively filmed". He also stated, [...] "With an extraordinary ensemble cast that churns the narrative like waves in a harbour, Broadchurch will this time free us with nothing but the truth". Mark Lawson in The Guardian called the premiere episode [...] "an ingeniously seamless reboot" [...] and went on to say, [...] "Chibnall has gathered enough old loose ends and intriguing new strands to suggest that Mondays may again become a bad night for the nation's pubs and restaurants". They also praised Tennant and Colman's performances, saying [...] "the pleasure comes from Tennant and Colman's scenes together, forcing them together, each on the edge of disintegration". Natalie Corner at the Daily Mirror singled out Olivia Colman's acting, calling it [...] "fantastic". The Independent Neela Debnath called the cinematography [...] "stunning".|$|E
2500|$|Wide-scale {{growth in}} the {{religion}} across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in the 1950s and extend in the 1960s. After the conference in February 1953 Bill and Marguerite Sears arrived in September 1953 visiting from Johannesburg for an extended stay into October giving many classes and traveling to many villages. It was also during this time the first pioneer from Uganda went to Mwanza, Tanganyika. In 1954 Uganda had 500 Bahá'ís in 80 localities, including 13 Local Spiritual Assemblies, representing 30 tribes, and had dispatched 9 pioneers to other African locations. In 1955 there were over 800 Bahá'ís having just added seventeen assemblies. In 1956 Olinga was elected as Chairman of the North West regional Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly and the Ugandan Bahá'í community came under the newly formed regional National Spiritual Assembly of Central & Eastern Africa, of which Nakhjavani was the Chairman and the Ugandan community alone topped 1000 members. The {{other members of the}} regional assembly over Uganda were Philip Hainsworth, Hassan Sabri, Oloro Epyeruj, Aziz Yazdi, Jalal Nakhjavani, Tito Wanantsusit, Sylvester Okurut, and Max Kenyerezi. In early 1957 Olinga attended the laying of the foundation stone of the first Bahá'í House of Worship of Africa (which was in Uganda) and in the fall he was appointed a Hand of the Cause and Knight of Bahá'u'lláh Clare Gung, formerly of Germany, moved from Tanganyika to Uganda where she founded a multi-racial kindergarten nursery. Systems were initiated to deal with the rate of growth of the religion - weekend Bahá'í schools were set up for any Bahá'í who could attend and individuals who were judged to have a substantial understanding of the religion and were able to travel were selected for training as presenters who would then travel locally in their area to make presentations on many of the same themes. By the summer of 1957 13 weekend schools had been held. It was believed these schools lent impetus to the continued growth of the religion in the area by empowering local members of the religion and the schools were repeated in 1958. And the same year regional and local assemblies were registered with the civil government. In 1957 a lone Bahá'í, a member of the Tesa, Yokolamu Okello, reached the relatively remote and pagan region of Moroto in Karamoja and in 1958 the first spiritual assembly was formed there. Conversions to the Bahá'í Faith in Uganda even reached into the prisons where Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, responded to letters by encouraging the inmates to use their [...] "stumbled" [...] history not to become [...] "embittered or defeated" [...] but [...] "determined to make it a means of purifying your natures, improving your characters, and enabling <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> better citizens in the future." [...] The quick growth of the religion in Uganda was attributed by Bahá'ís to the sincerity of their purpose and to the demonstrated lack of racial prejudice.|$|E
