500|$|It was in New Hampshire where Huntsman adopted his new [...] "Country First" [...] {{campaign}} slogan. The slogan was {{borrowed from}} John McCain's 2008 campaign, though {{the context of}} the slogan was different. Huntsman, who, as Governor of Utah at the time, endorsed McCain over Mitt Romney in the 2008 Republican presidential primary, had hoped McCain would return the favor; however, McCain endorsed Romney in a rally at Manchester's Manchester Central High School on January 4. Huntsman later characterized McCain's endorsement of his main rival as a [...] "petty betrayal". He told McCain [...] "I don't care if <b>you</b> <b>support</b> Romney, that's great – but just to have given me the dignity of waiting until after the New Hampshire primary." [...] McCain replied, [...] "I didn't mean to offend. I hope your family is well." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the firm}} did not release the poll results before the election. The {{day after the}} election, when Giron had been {{recalled}} by 12 points, they released the poll and company director Tom Jensen explained why they had not initially done so, citing numerous unusual results. These included the district supporting her recall by such a wide margin, despite having been carried by 20 points by Democratic President Barack Obama in the 2012 election; and voters saying they supported universal background checks by 68% to 27% and being split 47% to 47% on limiting high-capacity ammunition magazines to 15 bullets. Jensen opined that [...] "if voters were really making their recall votes based on those two laws, that doesn't point to recalling Giron by a 12 point margin" [...] and that the NRA had done a [...] "good job of turning the election more broadly into 'do <b>you</b> <b>support</b> gun rights or are you opposed to them.'" [...] Their decision not to release the poll before the election caused significant controversy, with some statisticians and journalists criticising them and others supporting them.|$|E
500|$|St. Laurent and the Liberals {{suffered}} {{other problems}} during the campaign. According to Newman, St. Laurent sometimes seemed {{unaware of what}} was happening around him, and at one campaign stop, shook hands with the reporters who were following him, under the apparent impression they were local voters. On the evening of Diefenbaker's Vancouver speech, St. Laurent drew 400voters to a rally in Sherbrooke, Quebec, where he had once lived. C.D. Howe, under heavy pressure from the campaign of CCF candidate Doug Fisher in his Ontario riding, intimated that Fisher had communist links. At a rally in Manitoba, Howe offended a voter who told him the farmers were starving to death, poking the voter in the stomach and saying [...] "Looks like you've been eating pretty well under a Liberal government." [...] At another rally, Howe dismissed a persistent Liberal questioner, saying [...] "Look here, my good man, when the election comes, why don't you just go away and vote for the party <b>you</b> <b>support?</b> In fact, why don't you just go away?" ...|$|E

500|$|On May 14, 1995, a {{referendum}} {{was conducted in}} all regions of Belarus. Out of four questions, one was the following: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>support</b> {{the introduction of the}} new national symbols?" [...] With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new state symbols were approved by a ratio of 3:1 (75.1% to 24.9%). The way the referendum was carried out was heavily criticized by the opposition, including the exact wording of the question about the national insignia. Supporters of the Pahonia also criticize that the Pahonia and the former white-red-white flag were compared to ones, used by collaboration forces, in propaganda that was published during the run-up to the vote. The comparison was made due to the white, red, white flag and Pahonia being used on the patches and symbols of the Belarusian Central Rada, the Belarusian government under the control of Nazi Germany. Alexander Lukashenko claimed the selection of the Soviet-inspired symbols as a victory, especially to his Great Patriotic War veteran base, by saying [...] "we have returned to you the flag of the country for which you fought. We have returned to you both memory and a sense of human pride." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{election}} was called in April 1957 for 10 June, Howe raised sufficient money to enable the Liberals to heavily outspend their opponents. [...] As there were few Liberal ministers from western Canada, Howe was called upon to make appearances throughout the region. He found that the Manitoba Farmers Union was organizing opposition to the Liberals; at some meetings Howe had difficulty getting heard at all. At other meetings, Howe engaged in well publicised conflicts with audience members. On 19 May in Morris, Manitoba, Howe told one man demanding to speak that when his own party held a meeting, he could ask all the questions he wanted. The man, Bruce Mackenzie, {{proved to be the}} head of a local Liberal association. As Howe left, another man asked why he had not answered his question, posed earlier. Howe replied, [...] "Look here, my good man, when {{the election}} comes, why don't you go away and vote for the party <b>you</b> <b>support?</b> [...] In fact, why don't you just go away?" [...] At another meeting a few days later, Howe was asked why he did not care about the farmers's economic plight. [...] "Looks like you've been eating pretty well under a Liberal government", Howe replied, poking the questioner in the midsection.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Górecki {{learned of}} an {{inscription}} scrawled {{on the wall}} of a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane, which lies {{at the foot of the}} Tatra mountains in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna, a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read O Mamo, nie placz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. [...] Immaculate Queen of Heaven, <b>you</b> <b>support</b> me always). The composer recalled, [...] "I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words". He later explained, [...] "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me." ...|$|E
