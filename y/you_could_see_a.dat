500|$|In 1996, while {{attending}} the successful revival of The King and I, Chinese-American playwright David Henry Hwang considered whether other Rodgers and Hammerstein shows could be revived {{and decided to}} work on Flower Drum Song. [...] To Chinese Americans, the musical [...] "represented political incorrectness incarnate. [...] But [...] had a secret soft spot for the movie version. 'It {{was kind of a}} guilty pleasure ... and one of the only big Hollywood films where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> lot of really good Asian actors onscreen, singing and dancing and cracking jokes.'" [...] Ted Chapin, president of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, announced that an unnamed [...] "Asian playwright" [...] had approached him about revising Flower Drum Song. [...] Chapin called the musical [...] "a naive, old fashioned, anti-feminist story with a truly great score.... It's one that ... needs changes." [...] Rodgers' will urged his heirs to do what they believed he would have agreed to (Hammerstein's instructions are unknown), but during her lifetime, his widow Dorothy had refused to countenance major changes in the plays. [...] Hwang's involvement was soon revealed, and in 1997, C. Y. Lee announced that the rewrite had his approval.|$|E

500|$|She {{explained}} that {{in developing the}} relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. We wanted {{to see what would happen}} if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of the season four finale, with which D. Williams of After Ellen noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." [...] Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout.

6000|$|And {{after him}} comes Brace Dunlap, {{and he was}} looking very mournful, and most crying; {{and there was a}} rustle and a stir all around, and {{everybody}} got ready to listen, and lots of the women folks said, [...] "Poor cretur, poor cretur," [...] and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> many of them wiping their eyes.|$|E

25|$|The next change came at ECTS 2001, {{when the}} {{interface}} became almost {{what it is}} today.

60|$|The more {{he thought}} about it, the more Johnny wanted to build his house over by the lone elm-tree where he had first seen Polly Chuck. It was a splendid place.

60|$|I {{looked at}} the {{pictures}} around me, the noiseless, neat-uniformed waiter behind me, the oak-ribbed ceiling above, the velvet carpet beneath.

60|$|The highroad was {{now to be}} quitted, as the {{remaining}} distance to Hollow's Mill might be considerably reduced by a short cut across fields. These fields were level and monotonous. Malone took a direct course through them, jumping hedge and wall. He passed but one building here, and that seemed large and hall-like, though irregular. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> high gable, then a long front, then a low gable, then a thick, lofty stack of chimneys. There were some trees behind it. It was dark; not a candle shone from any window. It was absolutely still; the rain running from the eaves, and the rather wild but very low whistle of the wind round the chimneys and through the boughs were the sole sounds in its neighbourhood.|$|E
60|$|Save in the squares, {{where the}} bourgeoning trees made green-lighted spaces for noon-time lovers, {{there was no}} change; no blossomy stir in asphalt and cement and brick and steel. Yet {{everything}} was changed. Between the cornices twenty stories above the pavement <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> slit of softer sky, {{and there was a}} peculiar radiance in just the light itself, whether it lay along the park turf or made its way down an air-well to rest on a stolid wall of yellow brick. The river breeze, flowing so persuasively through streets which had been stormed by dusty gales, bore happiness. Grind-organs made music for ragged, dancing children, and old brick buildings smelled warm. Peanut-wagons came out with a long, shrill whine, locusts of the spring.|$|E
60|$|Cheerfulness, {{it would}} appear, {{is a matter}} which depends fully as much {{on the state of}} things within as on the state of things without and around us. I make this trite remark, because I happen to know that Messrs. Helstone and Moore trotted forth from the mill-yard gates, at the head of their very small company, in the best {{possible}} spirits. When a ray from a lantern (the three pedestrians of the party carried each one) fell on Mr. Moore's face, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> unusual, because a lively, spark dancing in his eyes, and a new-found vivacity mantling on his dark physiognomy; and when the rector's visage was illuminated, his hard features were revealed all agrin and ashine with glee. Yet a drizzling night, a somewhat perilous expedition, you would think were not circumstances calculated to enliven those exposed to the wet and engaged in the adventure. If any member or members of the crew who had been at work on Stilbro' Moor had caught a view of this party, they would have had great pleasure in shooting either of the leaders from behind a wall: and the leaders knew this; and the fact is, being both men of steely nerves and steady-beating hearts, were elate with the knowledge.|$|R
2500|$|Graham [...] "Green" [...] Bailey, {{and would}} meet Steve Budd, closely {{involved}} with his band The Sound {{in their early}} years, in his early teens.

Borland played guitar left-handed.|$|R
60|$|One {{day there}} came a dark horse to Paloma, a young lawyer who at once flaunted his shingle and himself spectacularly upon the town. His name was C. Vincent Vesey. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> at <b>a</b> glance {{that he was a}} recent {{graduate}} of a southwestern law school. His Prince Albert coat, light striped trousers, broad-brimmed soft black hat, and narrow white muslin bow tie proclaimed that more loudly than any diploma could. Vesey was a compound of Daniel Webster, Lord Chesterfield, Beau Brummell, and Little Jack Horner. His coming boomed Paloma. The next day after he arrived an addition to the town was surveyed and laid off in lots.|$|R
6000|$|In {{those years}} a visible {{section of the}} London population, and {{conspicuous}} out of all proportion to its size or value, was a small knot of Spaniards, who had sought shelter here as Political Refugees. [...] "Political Refugees:" [...] a tragic succession of that class {{is one of the}} possessions of England in our time. Six-and-twenty years ago, when I first saw London, I remember those unfortunate Spaniards among the new phenomena. Daily in the cold spring air, under skies so unlike their own, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> group of fifty or a hundred stately tragic figures, in proud threadbare cloaks; perambulating, mostly with closed lips, the broad pavements of Euston Square and the regions about St. Pancras new Church. Their lodging was chiefly in Somers Town, as I understood: and those open pavements about St. Pancras Church were the general place of rendezvous. They spoke little or no English; knew nobody, could employ themselves on nothing, in this new scene. Old steel-gray heads, many of them; the shaggy, thick, blue-black hair of others struck you; their brown complexion, dusky look of suppressed fire, in general their tragic condition as of caged Numidian lions.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes we'd {{have that}} whole river all to {{ourselves}} {{for the longest}} time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts. It's lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, {{and we used to}} lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to MAKE so many. Jim said the moon could a LAID them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now {{and again}} when things got too bad they would toll the city bell, and the Vigilance Committee turned out and hanged the {{suspicious}} characters. A man didn't begin to be suspected in those days till he had committed at least one unprovoked murder," [...] said a calm-eyed, portly old gentleman. I looked at the pictures around me, the noiseless, neat-uniformed waiter behind me, the oak-ribbed ceiling above, the velvety carpet beneath.

50|$|Penn & Teller's Sin City Spectacular was {{a weekly}} American {{television}} variety show hosted by Penn and Teller that {{appeared on the}} FX Networks from August 10, 1998 - June 30, 1999.

5000|$|Jonathan Edward Stoll {{was born}} in Mamaroneck, N.Y. on November 6, 1953 to Marjorie and Larry Stoll. As a 15-year-old student in Mamaroneck, Stoll decided {{to raise money for}} his school by staging a battle of the bands. He also gained {{valuable}} experience working backstage at New York-area theaters, and at 18 he was managing a rock band. While at Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I., he continued to stage shows, and when his parents bought a condominium in Fort Lauderdale, he soon began promoting concerts at South Florida drive-in theaters. [...] "For $3 or $4 <b>you</b> <b>could</b> go <b>see</b> <b>a</b> concert, film, etc.," [...] he said in 1985. [...] "We'd draw 6,000 to 10,000 people." ...|$|R
60|$|You couldn't {{see very}} {{far in the}} fog, of course; but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> great deal! It's {{astonishing}} how much you may see in a thicker fog than that, if you will only take the trouble to look for it. Why, even to sit watching for the Fairyrings in the fields, and for the patches of hoar frost still lingering in the shade, near hedges and by trees, was a pleasant occupation, to make {{no mention of the}} unexpected shapes in which the trees themselves came starting out of the mist, and glided into it again. The hedges were tangled and bare, and waved a multitude of blighted garlands in the wind; but there was no discouragement in this. It was agreeable to contemplate; for it made the fireside warmer in possession, and the summer greener in expectancy. The river looked chilly; but it was in motion, and moving at a good pace--which was a great point. The canal was rather slow and torpid; that must be admitted. Never mind. It would freeze the sooner when the frost set fairly in, and then there would be skating and sliding; and the heavy old barges, frozen up somewhere near a wharf, would smoke their rusty iron chimney-pipes all day, and have a lazy time of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "More fools {{they who}} {{gave them to}} them, but what can one expect from such a Government. There is not among them a single {{practical}} man except Gambetta, and he is away at Tours.

I would rather, infinitely rather, that the women at the Halles should chose {{a dozen of the}} most capable women among them and establish them as the Government. I will guarantee you would see a change for the better before twenty-four hours were over. I doubt if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> change for the worse. Jules Fauvre with his ridiculous phrase, not one foot of our territory, not one stone of our fortresses, is no better than a mountebank, and the others are as bad. Would that either Ducrot or Vinoy had the firmness and half the talent of a Napoleon. They would march the troops in, sweep away this gathering of imbeciles, establish martial law, disarm Belleville and Montmartre, shoot Floureus, Pyat, Blanqui, and a hundred of the most noxious of these vermin; forbid all assemblages, turn the National Guards into soldiers, and after rendering Paris impotent for mischief turn their attention to the Germans. The one thing that can save Paris to my mind is a military dictator, but I see no sign of such a man being forthcoming." ...|$|E
6000|$|Joan, on {{her black}} horse, with the Lieutenant-General and the {{personal}} staff grouped about her, took post for a final review and a good-by; for she was not expecting to ever be a soldier again, or ever serve with these or any other soldiers any more after this day. The army knew this, and believed it {{was looking for the}} last time upon the girlish face of its invincible little Chief, its pet, its pride, its darling, whom it had ennobled in its private heart with nobilities of its own creation, call her [...] "Daughter of God," [...] "Savior of France," [...] "Victory's Sweetheart," [...] "The Page of Christ," [...] together with still softer titles which were simply naive and frank endearments such as men are used to confer upon children whom they love. And so one saw a new thing now; a thing bred of the emotion that was present there on both sides. Always before, in the march-past, the battalions had gone swinging by in a storm of cheers, heads up and eyes flashing, the drums rolling, the bands braying paens of victory; but now there was nothing of that. But for one impressive sound, one could have closed his eyes and imagined himself in a world of the dead. That one sound was all that visited the ear in the summer stillness--just that one sound--the muffled tread of the marching host. As the serried masses drifted by, the men put their right hands up to their temples, palms to the front, in military salute, turning their eyes upon Joan's face in mute God-bless-you and farewell, and keeping them there while they could. They still kept their hands up in reverent salute many steps after they had passed by. Every time Joan put her handkerchief to her eyes <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> little quiver of emotion crinkle along the faces of the files.|$|E
