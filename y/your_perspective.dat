And I think that the American viewing audience can tell when somebody's not being honest—when somebody's peeing on their leg and telling them it's raining. I think part of the reason I was selected to do this job was because I don't filter myself very well. But I was never a great filter of myself even when I sat on the bench in New York. Now sometimes that got you into a little bit of hot water; here they seem to like it. Fortunately for me, I don't have to act. This is it.

From a scientific perspective, the [...] "wind pushing {{on the side of}} the projectile" [...] is not what causes horizontal wind drift. What causes wind drift is drag. Drag makes the projectile turn into the wind, much like a weather vane, keeping the centre of air pressure on its nose. This causes the nose to be cocked (from <b>your</b> <b>perspective)</b> into the wind, the base is cocked (from <b>your</b> <b>perspective)</b> [...] "downwind."

I am perhaps one of the fortunate few students able to say that I have only had good history teachers, so thanks first to Mike Dammann and Cheryl Retrum. To the history department faculty at Gustavus Adolphus College, thank you for what you contributed to my early intellectual and professional development as a historian. Your kindness has left me with many fond memories of departmental work, morning coffee breaks, history club events, and the annual meat grilling. I am especially indebted to my advisors, Tom Emmert and Kate Wittenstein. As specialists in modern European history and American race and gender respectively, they were the first to give me an intuitive sense of thinking transnationally. It was also Tom, who I credit with coaxing me into a history minor, then a major, followed by a semester in Germany, and graduate school applications...|$|R

40|$|Congratulations on your {{selection}} {{as a public}} library board member! Public libraries build communities, increasing {{the quality of life}} for residents.
