40|$|Informal {{settlements}} {{are associated}} with higher prevalence of HIV. There is empirical evidence that HIV prevalence is higher in the North-Western suburbs (Katutura) of Windhoek which primarily consist of low-income housing and informal settlements. It is reported that {{a large proportion of}} young women in these suburbs who are 25 years and younger are HIV positive. This study sought to explore the linkage between urban livelihood strategies and the risk of acquiring HIV among <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> women (aged 18 to 24) in Havana informal settlement in Katutura in Windhoek, Namibia. The study focuses on the lived experiences of internal <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> women to explore the linkage between their livelihood strategies and the risks of acquiring HIV. A desk review was undertaken in order to analyse existing documents related to urban livelihoods and HIV from studies that have been conducted in the City of Windhoek. Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions as research instruments were administered to collect primary data. Thematic analysis has been employed to analyse the data to help extract descriptive information concerning experiences of <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> women in Katutura informal settlements and construct meanings {{in order to be able}} to understand how livelihood strategies of <b>young</b> internal <b>migrant</b> women in Havana relate to the risk of acquiring HIV. The study reveals that <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> women in Havana informal settlement moved to Windhoek in order to have their livelihoods improved. Based on the data, income; education; employment and housing are some of the social and economic factors found to be affecting the livelihoods of the <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> women. Furthermore, the study unveils that <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> women engage in risky sexual behaviours such as low condom use, transactional sex and multiple concurrent partnerships as a strategy to earn livelihoods. Engaging in risky sexual behaviour such as transactional sex enhances the risk of acquiring HIV once they are exposed, as it influences their sexual decision making due to their dependency on men. The study concludes that there is a linkage between urban livelihoods and the risk of HIV infection. Therefore, exclusion of migrant communities from services as well as their limited access to sustainable livelihoods encourages <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> women to engage in risky sexual behaviour. The findings of this study do not portray that all young women in Havana informal settlement engage in risky sexual behaviour because <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> women are a heterogeneous group however, participants who took part in this study are a representative of all <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> women (aged 18 - 24) in Havana. Therefore, their risky behaviour can be one of the major factors contributing to high prevalence of HIV among young women in Katutura.

Young people who face discrimination and abuse of their human rights - including the right to education - are at greatest risk of poor SRH outcomes. Young people who face particular challenges in accessing education may also be at increased risk of HIV (re)infection and sexual and gender-based violence. This includes young people with disabilities, young people without parental care, <b>young</b> <b>migrants,</b> young workers, pregnant and married girls, and those from key populations such as young people who sell sex, young people living with HIV, young transgender people, young people using drugs and young {{men who have sex with}} men.|$|E

Additionally, attacks on the children by lions, snakes and other wild animals were not uncommon. It is estimated that {{over half of the}} <b>young</b> <b>migrants</b> died along their epic journey, due to starvation, dehydration, sickness and disease and attack by wild animals and enemy soldiers.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether the}} introduction of citizenship education in New Zealand would increase the levels of active citizenship of <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> New Zealanders, using voter turnout as a measure. This research draws attention to an overlooked part of New Zealand political science research by studying <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> New Zealanders. The theories and topics covered in this research include the notion of citizenship, education, political participation, social capital and multiculturalism. Both surveys and interviews are used to gauge young New Zealanders’ political attitudes and opinions, and their levels of political knowledge, interest, sophistication and socialisation are examined. The findings of this research suggest that citizenship education would not only be beneficial to <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> New Zealanders but that citizenship education would benefit all young New Zealanders. It is argued that an increase in all young New Zealanders’ levels of political knowledge and interest {{are likely to have}} a positive effect on voter turnout levels. It is also argued that the current education curriculum does not explicitly encourage such learning. Using these findings in conjunction with theory, it is recommended that citizenship education is implemented into the New Zealand secondary school curriculum to ensure that New Zealand’s democracy is in good health for the current and future generations...|$|R
50|$|The area {{encompassing}} {{these four}} places has relatively high social mobility {{and those who}} gain status often move towards Bamako, the capital. The dialects follow this pattern, as those closer to the capital are perceived as more prestigious; the most peripheral form in Sagabari can even prompt mockery of the individual using it. Thus, those speaking a dialect different from Bambara {{are likely to be}} affected by linguistic insecurity, particularly those closer to the Malinke end of the continuum. Since migration is common, there are many examples of <b>young</b> <b>migrants</b> to the area who display linguistic insecurity. Most migrants who speak Malinke try to hide their origins and assimilate to the higher status society by changing the way that they speak. In their attempts to escape their geosocial status, however, they tend to hypercorrect {{to the point where they}} create non-existent terms in Bambara. One example is replacing every /h/ in Malinke with the /f/ used in Bamako, leading one to say 'young boy' /foron/ (which does not exist in Bamako) for 'noble' /horon/.|$|E

In thinking about the ethics and politics of integration and particularly those that are promoted through discursive frameworks generated by EU institutional mechanisms I argue that they reflect a politics of assimilation that does not allow educational processes of becoming different. A politics of difference, {{in spite of the}} possibilities of generating conflict within schools and classes would better inform our thinking about an education that democratically attends to student differences.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the factors that influence young migrant’s duration of stay in a high risk environment. Studies on return migration have predominantly focused on former migrants who have return to their home countries, in the case of international migration, or former migrants who have returned to their villages or hometowns, in the case of internal migration. Differing from the predominant cases in this literature, this study, examined the determinants of the estimation of return migration propensities among <b>young</b> <b>migrants</b> in a slum in the city of Accra (place of destination). Drawing on the concepts of urban environmental vulnerability or risks and human encumberments, this study explained the justification for analyzing the determinants of estimated return migration propensities in a slum setting. Using ordinal regression, this study undertake multivariate analysis of the determinants of return migration among <b>young</b> <b>migrants</b> in the face of risks and stressors at the place of destination. It was found that sex, marital intentions of <b>young</b> <b>migrants,</b> the current income being earned, whether an individual is learning a trade or not and whether <b>young</b> <b>migrants</b> know where to go to get information concerning how to deal with stressors are statistically significant and in fact, are the proximate determinants of the estimation of return migration propensities...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the mental health}} status among HIV-positive <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) residing in a city in Southern China through an ethnographic study. Nineteen HIV-positive young MSM aged from 18 to 25 were included in the current analysis. Most HIV-positive young MSM (14 / 19) self-reported depressive symptoms, almost half (8 / 19) had experienced anxiety, and about one third (6 / 19) had experienced both symptoms. The HIV diagnosis brought on such testified stressors including frightening images of HIV/AIDS, side-effects of antiretroviral treatment (ART), and social restrictions due to the disease, serving to make the men feel disabled and worthless. Participants’ life history accounts provided evidence of their problems being embedded in social ecological contexts, such as social adversity in the process of migration, social suffering as MSM, cultural trauma, stigma and discrimination. We theorize that HIV/AIDS is a trigger that amplifies pre-existing stress and conflicts that are deeply embedded at different socio-ecological levels among <b>young</b> <b>migrant</b> MSM...|$|R
