5|$|At {{first it}} always bothers you {{even though you}} say it doesn't. But I think {{if you want to}} exceed limits, you have to suck that all in and be happy with what <b>you</b> <b>have.</b> <b>At</b> first it was painful to watch all those things but now I take it as {{constructive}} criticism or I don't bother to look at it.|$|E
5|$|Being {{exceedingly}} {{alarmed at}} the misery into which I had fallen, {{and much more}} at that which threatened me in view of eternal death, I, duty bound, made it my first business to betake myself to your way, condemning my past life, not without groans and tears. And now, O Lord, what remains to a wretch like me, but instead of defence, earnestly to supplicate you not to judge that fearful abandonment of your Word according to its deserts, from which in your wondrous goodness <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> last delivered me.|$|E

500|$|Paul Ferrill {{wrote that}} [...] "Windows Server 2012 Essentials {{provides}} {{all the pieces}} necessary to provide centralized file storage, client backups, and remote access," [...] but Tim Anderson contended that [...] "Many businesses that are using SBS2011 and earlier will want to stick with what they have", citing the absence of Exchange, the lack of ability to synchronize with Active Directory Federation Services and the 25-user limit, while Paul Thurott wrote [...] "you should choose Foundation only if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> least some in-company IT staff and/or are comfortable outsourcing management to a Microsoft partner or solution provider" [...] and [...] "Essentials is, in my mind, ideal for any modern startup {{of just a few}} people." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming for Crossroads {{initiated}} in March 2001 in Baton Rouge and Hammond, Louisiana, near Spears' hometown. Due {{to the fact}} that Spears was also recording her third studio album along with the film's production, filming only wrapped up after six months. Additional scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Crossroads had a total budget of $10 million; a relatively low budget by industry standards. According to the Louisiana Film and Video Commission, the film was originally titled What Friends are For. Spears described it as a teen movie that deals with real issues that normal teenagers live on a daily basis. She continued to explain the film's content, saying that it [...] "is about this journey that the three of us best friends take, finding ourselves and what we want out of life and getting our friendship back. Friends are all <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> the end of the day. When your boyfriend breaks up with you, who do you call? Your girlfriend. I just love that message." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)" [...] also concern Furtado's teenage period, with the singer {{describing}} the song's lyrical content as [...] "my swagger-in-spades, rhyme-writing 14-year-old self find liberation through hip hop and R attending 'music jams' in suburban Victoria". There are references to Furtado's favourite {{groups at the}} period [...] such as Salt-n-Pepa, A Tribe Called Quest and Blackstreet, {{many of whom were}} produced by Jerkins himself [...] and her teenage wardrobe. The song's title references the hoop earrings she liked to wear. Furtado said that the song describes [...] "a certain unique swagger <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> that young age and that the music gives you," [...] and that she was [...] "the kid who used to pick up the mic at parties and just rock the crowd, sing my way through the storm and know my voice could penetrate." [...] The singer stated that as [...] "hip-hop was super-exotic to us in Canada", she felt that [...] "it was very liberating, finding that confidence through the music".|$|E

2500|$|However, using true and {{expressive}} intonation requires careful coordination {{with the other}} players, especially when a piece is going through harmonic modulations.

2500|$|According to Ed Belt, retired {{professor}} of geology at Amherst College, the Medicine Rocks sandstone is almost unique. [...] "You {{have to go}} a long way to find a sand deposit of a similar age. And even then, you won't find thick sand and such a large concentration like <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> Medicine Rocks." [...] It is also possible that the state park lies atop an unexposed fault.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{explained}} in the novel as follows: [...] "To believe in a contradiction is to abdicate your belief {{in the existence of}} the world around you {{and the nature of the}} things in it, to instead embrace any random impulse that strikes your fancy – to imagine something is real simply because you wish it were. A thing is what it is, it is itself. There can be no contradictions. In reality, contradictions cannot exist. To believe in them you must abandon the most important thing you possess: your rational mind. The wager for such a bargain is your life. In such an exchange, you always lose what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> stake." ...|$|E
