5|$|Mississippi's Steve Hindman {{was named}} the game's most {{valuable}} player after he rushed the ball for 121 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> touchdown in addition to catching three passes for 32 yards. Ole Miss quarterback Archie Manning finished the game with 141 passing yards and two touchdowns. Virginia Tech was led on offense by Ken Edwards, who finished with 119 rushing <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> touchdown, and Terry Smoot, who finished with 91 rushing <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> touchdown. Tech turned the ball over five times, committing three fumbles and throwing two interceptions to the Mississippi defense. Despite Tech's relative offensive success on the ground, the Hokies were completely inept through the air, completing just one pass for two net passing yards. Both marks remain Liberty Bowl records for the fewest passes and fewest passing yards gained by a team.|$|E

Tech's 80-yard touchdown drive in the third quarter remains tied for the longest ever recorded by a Tech offense during a bowl game.

From there, Frost threw an incomplete pass, then Sims ran twice for fifteen <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> first down, crossing into the Virginia Tech half of {{the field in the}} process. Now at the Tech 38-yard line, Frost completed a 23-yard throw to Lance Brown, who picked up another first down at the Tech 15-yard line.
