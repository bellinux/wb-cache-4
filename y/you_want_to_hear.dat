[...] The review also commented that the movie [...] "is beautifully produced, better than the stagy 1958 film" [...] and praised the singing. Kenrick, however, dislikes the adaptation: [...] "You {{certainly}} won't ever want to put this disaster in your player, unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the sound of Rodgers and Hammerstein whirling in their graves. Glenn Close {{is up to the}} material, but her supporting cast is uniformly disastrous. [...] A pointless and offensive waste of money, time and talent." ...|$|E

[...] Anita Li writing for Mashable praised the character's friendship with Yusef stating [...] "despite the depressing circumstances of their meeting, the pair's chemistry is entertaining for viewers to watch." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{said that the}} song was [...] "Perfectly acceptable, though {{not in the same}} class as 'Who's That Girl'." [...] Christian Wright from Spin called the song celebratory. Camille Paglia, {{one of the authors of}} The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, said that Madonna's command of massive, resonant basslines impressed her. She wrote: [...] "I recall my stunned admiration as I sat in the theater in 1987 and first experienced the crashing, descending chords of Madonna's 'Causing a Commotion', which opened her dreadful movie Who's That Girl. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the essence of modernity, listen to those chords, infernal, apocalyptic, and grossly sensual. This is the authentic voice of fin de siècle." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] and [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] were not among Madonna's best singles.|$|E

500|$|Spin {{journalist}} Charles Aaron positively {{reviewed the}} song and joked: [...] "this exquisitely crafted, heart-pumping l-u-v song has been droning in the produce department of my grocery store {{for about a year}} now, but I'd just like to go on record as saying that if it ever stops, I'll really be heartbroken." [...] Bob McCann, author of Encyclopedia of African American actresses in film and television (2010), considered it [...] "simply one of the most haunting R records ever made", while Robert Christgau named it [...] "miraculous" [...] and explained [...] "the miracle being that it's by Diane Warren and <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it again." [...] About.com reviewer Mark Edward Nero named it one of the best R break-up songs and considered it Braxton's [...] "finest moment". He further commented, [...] "damn, this song is so sad it can make people cry for hours at a time." [...] In 1997, [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.|$|E
500|$|John Anderson of Los Angeles Times commented [...] "Spears acquits {{herself as}} well as anyone might, in a movie as {{contrived}} and lazy as this one". Chris Kaltenbach of Baltimore Sun said, [...] "go see Crossroads if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Britney sing or see her wear next-to-nothing. But otherwise, avoid this train wreck at all costs". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly, however, gave the movie a positive review, commenting Crossroads [...] "not only makes excellent use of the singer's sweetly coltish acting abilities, but it also promotes a standardized set of sturdy values with none of Mariah Carey's desperate Glitter, or any of Mandy Moore's gummy pap in A Walk to Remember". Bret Fetzer of Amazon.com also gave a positive review, noting that the movie [...] "could have been trite schmaltz, but the script has some grit and the direction is fresh and relaxed--and, most significantly, Spears is far more sympathetic and engaging than you might expect". Jane Crowther of BBC applauded Cattrall and Aykroyd's interactions with the characters, and said that [...] "Spears manages to come across on film as natural, endearing, and extremely likable". Time named it one of the top 10 worst chick flicks.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Angels Cry" [...] {{is about}} {{maintaining}} {{hope that a}} fading relationship can be salvaged because true love only happens once. Carey sings [...] "I’m willing to live and die for our love/Baby {{we can get back}} that shine." [...] However, the lyrics [...] "Super natural love conquers all" [...] could also be interpreted as feeling God's love. Adam Holz of Plugged In thought that the lyrics were [...] "depressing," [...] while Lauren Murphy of Entertainment IE felt that the lyrics [...] "When you and I say goodbye, I felt the angels cry" [...] were too sentimental. Although Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times thought that the song had a [...] "sad" [...] tone, she praised its production. Bill Lamb of About.com placed [...] "Angels Cry" [...] in his list of the album's best tracks. Michael Cragg of musicOMH was critical of the song, writing that it is a [...] "limp ballad" [...] which he thought was trying too hard at recreating some of Carey's previous material, and concluded by writing that it [...] "ultimately ends up making <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the original version more than anything". A reviewer for DJ Booth commented that the song sounded as thought it could have been released in 1994.|$|E

500|$|The Ecstatic {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 28 reviews. After two poorly received records, The Ecstatic was viewed by critics as a return for Mos Def {{to the form}} of his 1999 debut album Black on Both Sides. In Spin magazine, Aaron wrote that the [...] "internationalist return to form" [...] was also [...] "perhaps his liveliest work yet". Mick Middles from The Quietus hailed it as [...] "the joyful sound of a rampant artist, unrestrained by expectation or commercialism", with free-flowing music that escaped the boundaries his previous albums had merely pushed. Thompson believed the diverse range of samples made The Ecstatic [...] "a crate-digger's wet dream" [...] and [...] "a thrillingly accessible demonstration of hip-hop's limitless creative possibilities" [...] to a layperson. Writing in MSN Music, Christgau felt the songs were [...] "devoid of hooks but full of sounds <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> again", along with [...] "thoughtfully slurred" [...] yet intelligible lyrics by Mos Def, whose creative vision warranted the introductory Malcolm X sample. Steve Jones of USA Today said his reflections on politics, love, religion, and societal conditions were full of insight and sincerity while calling the album his strongest effort so far. Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine was less impressed, writing {{that much of the}} music lacked song structure and [...] "careened wildly, free from the constraints of chorus and verse"; Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard found the quality of the songs inconsistent.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "We Wanna" [...] was {{met with}} {{positive}} to mixed reviews by music critics. Henry Einck, writing for German music website Dance Charts, praised the song's [...] "pleasant" [...] melody, which he described as being [...] "suitable for dancing". Additionally, Einck was positive towards Stan's, Inna's and Yankee's vocal parts, but felt they didn't match together. Direct Lyrics's Kevin Apaza labelled the recording as a [...] "future-European-summer-smash", and saw its drop as [...] "going to cause some fierce-dancing moments at clubs". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse felt [...] "We Wanna" [...] was a [...] "super solid, club-ready summer jam bound to blow up from Argentina to Morocco, full of catchy hooks ('Bout to go!') and infectiously sax-y sax noises borrowed from the home of Mr. Saxobeat." [...] He eventually found Stan and Inna outperformed Rihanna and Shakira, and Lady Gaga and Beyoncé, who previously formed female duos. Mike Wass, writing for Idolator, expressed that the track was [...] "a guilty pleasure of the highest order". German portal Hitfire was generally positive towards [...] "We Wanna", explaining that its [...] "verses are disappointingly quiet until the chorus turns up something. Nevertheless, [...] is after a few plays a catchy tune that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> again and again." [...] Music website Pop Shock's Dijei Zasin criticized Yankee's vocal collaboration on the single for [...] "unnecessary [...] down the song", suggesting that American rapper Pitbull would be an option to feature on a version of [...] "We Wanna" [...] destined to the United Kingdom and the United States. He further concluded that, [...] "What works here are the verses laced in the singers’ trademark attitude, contrasting with the vibey, chilled chorus." ...|$|E
500|$|Like the {{original}} release, The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition received positive reviews from critics. Sean Ely of GamePro praised its updated audio, {{and said that}} the new graphics [...] "blow the old clunker visuals ... out of the water". He cited its script, humor, plot, puzzles and balanced difficulty level as high points, and finished, [...] "The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is impressive, hilarious and downright worth your money." [...] Daemon Hatfield of IGN wrote, [...] "Almost 20 years after its release, [...] remains a blast to play." [...] He called the new graphics [...] "slick, if a little generic", and noted that the [...] "original graphics have a certain charm to them that the fancy pants new visuals just don't." [...] However, he enjoyed the redone music, the new hint function, and the added sound effects and voice acting. He summarized it as [...] "one of the best times you'll ever have pointing and clicking", and noted that [...] "few games are this funny." [...] Justin Calvert of GameSpot noted that [...] "the Special Edition looks much better and {{is the only way to}} play if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> ... what characters are saying, whereas {{the original}} game's interface is less clunky." [...] However, he wrote that [...] "the voice work is such a great addition to the game that it's difficult to go back to the original edition." [...] He praised its humor, writing, puzzles and characters, and he believed that it had aged well. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead wrote, [...] "Purists like me will almost certainly find something to grumble about over the span of the game, but the overall impact of the redesign is undeniably for the better." [...] However, he preferred the original game's Guybrush design, and believed that the new control system was [...] "rather less intuitive" [...] than the old one. He finished by stating that [...] "few games can stand the test of time with such confidence".|$|E

500|$|Weezer {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a rating}} out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave the}} album a [...] rating of {{four and a half}} stars, stated that [...] "this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but nobody else does it this [...] so well, no matter how many bands try." [...] PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: [...] "The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words. And even the songs' lengths are nice and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> these songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board {{was one of the best}} ideas the band had, as the Green Album is certainly water tight all around." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album a very positive review, saying [...] "After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third. One listen to the Green Album has you eating out of Rivers Cuomo's hand just like in the past. [...] Rivers Cuomo is one of the greatest song-writers that has picked up a guitar. Anyone who can with hold the charms of the Geek-rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes. Sorry to be blunt but it's the way it is. God I think the sun's finally taking its toll." [...] The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001, tying with System of a Down's Toxicity and Mogwai's Rock Action. Q listed Weezer as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.|$|E

2500|$|The Nacirema Dream was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. Reed Jackson of XXL praised his storytelling, colorful metaphors and overtly complex word play. He also said, [...] "The production is so outdated you can’t help but think that these songs have literally just been sitting around this whole time. But ultimately, The Nacirema Dream should be celebrated – not only for it’s long overdue release, but because Papoose actually made the album he had always planned on making." [...] Logan Smithson of PopMatters gave the album a seven out of ten, saying [...] "The Nacirema Dream {{is a prime example}} of how hip-hop can serve as a platform for storytelling. Papoose confirms that the hype around his lyrical prowess was real. However, the album isn’t without its faults. Coming out seven years behind schedule, the production is noticeably a little dated. [...] While the beats are solid, The Nacirema Dream isn’t an album that you’ll be listening to because <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> great production. It also could have benefited from being slightly trimmed. Listeners might feel fatigued while sitting through the 75 minutes that this album has to offer. Regardless, The Nacirema Dream is an admirable achievement. Papoose fought through label issues and made the album that he wanted to make, even if it took him seven years to finally get that album out to the public." [...] Del F. Cowie of Exclaim! gave the album a six out of ten, saying [...] "Papoose gamely battles on, delivering some of his trademark punch lines, and you can tell he genuinely attempted to deliver a well-rounded record. However, there's not enough innovation to interest casual fans in the project." ...|$|E
