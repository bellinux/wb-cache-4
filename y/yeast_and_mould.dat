The effects of different concentrations of natamycin on survival of <b>yeasts</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> in Feta cheese at room temperature, refrigeration condition, and pH values were evaluated.

This study evaluated the effects of sun-drying on microbiological load (E. coli, coliform, <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> <b>and</b> total bacterial count) in waste vegetables from the fresh produce market, since smallholder farmers tend to use the by-products without processing given the opportunity. Cabbage and beetroot wastes were sun dried to 14 % moisture and micro-organisms were enumerated on both wet and dried samples. The results showed that sun drying reduced the level of micro-organisms significantly in both cabbage and beetroot. Although microbial load varied from batch to batch in the wet samples, coliforms were significantly more abundant in wet beetroot than in the dried samples. However, dried beetroot contained significantly more <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds.</b> Wet cabbage contained more coliform <b>and</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> compared to sun-dried cabbage.

Ninety- six commercial yoghurt samples, from different manufacturers produces plain set yoghurt from recombined milk powder (A, B), and fresh milk (C, D), were collected from 4 shops in Khartoum North during the period November 2008 - February 2009. Analysis of yoghurt samples, collected from different manufacturers revealed significant (P< 0. 01) differences in total solids (TS), solids not fat (SNF), fat, protein and ash contents and titratable acidity due to the variations of manufacturers and type of milk used. The titratable acidity showed no significant effect due to the type of milk used. Yoghurt samples obtained from different manufacturers and type of milk significantly (P< 0. 01) affected TS, SNF, protein contents, and titratable acidity during storage period, whereas fat and ash contents were not significantly affected by storage period. Microbiological analysis showed that total bacterial count, coliform count and <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> count were significantly (P< 0. 05) affected by the manufacturers.

High-pressure treatment was an effective process to control <b>yeasts</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> spoilage <b>and</b> extend the shelf-life of fresh lactic curd cheese without adverse effects on the sensory and textural attributes of the products...|$|R
