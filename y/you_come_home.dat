500|$|... 1902 – [...] "Bill Bailey". Ragtime song {{written by}} Hughie Cannon. It {{continued}} {{the story of}} an earlier coon song, [...] "Ain't Dat a Shame" [...] by Walter Wilson and John Queen. The song was introduced by Queen in vaudeville and first recorded by Arthur Collins in 1902.

Originally titled [...] "Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home?", the song is also known as [...] "Won't <b>You</b> <b>Come</b> <b>Home</b> Bill Bailey".|$|E
500|$|On July 20, Thome hit {{his first}} home {{run with the}} Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field. On August 6, Thome {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21. In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E

[...] On television, Dzhokhar's uncle from Montgomery Village, Maryland, pleaded with him to turn himself in.|$|E

2500|$|Brown {{grew up in}} South Otselic, New York, the {{daughter}} of a successful Chenango County farmer. She was reportedly given the nickname [...] "Billy" [...] because of her love of the contemporary hit song Won't <b>You</b> <b>Come</b> <b>Home</b> Bill Bailey; Brown often signed her love letters [...] "The Kid", after the Western outlaw Billy the Kid. She attended grammar school in the village, and became close friends with the teacher, Maud Kenyon Crumb, and her husband. In 1904, she moved to nearby Cortland to live with a married sister, and went to work at the Gillette Skirt Company.|$|E

Deal?" [...] In October 2006, one of the miners took up his offer, joining Grohl for a drink after the Foo Fighters {{acoustic}} concert at the Sydney Opera House. Since then, Foo Fighters have written an instrumental tribute song called [...] "Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners" [...] appearing on the album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, no; not for them,' rejoined Mrs Squeers; 'on {{purpose for}} <b>you</b> against <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home.</b> Lor! <b>you</b> didn't think I {{could have made}} such a mistake as that.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Bailey {{was educated}} at King Edward's School, an {{independent}} school in Bath {{where he was}} initially a highly academic pupil winning most of the prizes. At {{about the age of}} 15, he started to become distracted from school work when he realised the thrill of performance {{as a member of a}} school band called Behind Closed Doors, which played mostly original work. He was the only pupil at his school to study A-level music and he passed with an A grade. He also claims to have been good at sport (captain of KES 2nd XI cricket team 1982), which often surprised his teachers. He would often combine music and sport by leading the singing on the long coach trip back from away rugby fixtures. It was here that he was given his nickname Bill by his music teacher, Ian Phipps, for being able to play the song [...] "Won't <b>You</b> <b>Come</b> <b>Home</b> Bill Bailey" [...] so well on the guitar.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to England {{after two years}} abroad, he presented to his parents a mature, sophisticated, well-mannered, [...] "modish" [...] gentleman, though Samuel Pepys noted young Penn's [...] "vanity of the French". Penn had developed a taste for fine clothes, {{and for the rest}} of his life would pay somewhat more attention to his dress than most Quakers. The Admiral had great hopes that his son then had the practical sense and the ambition necessary to succeed as an aristocrat. He had young Penn enroll in law school but soon his studies were interrupted. With warfare with the Dutch imminent, young Penn decided to shadow his father at work and join him at sea. Penn functioned as an emissary between his father and the King, then returned to his law studies. Worrying about his father in battle he wrote, [...] "I never knew what a father was till I had wisdom enough to prize him...I pray God...that <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> secure." [...] The Admiral returned triumphant but London was in the grip of the plague of 1665. Young Penn reflected on the suffering and the deaths, and the way humans reacted to the epidemic. He wrote that the scourge [...] "gave me a deep sense of the vanity of this World, of the Irreligiousness of the Religions in it." [...] Further he observed how Quakers on errands of mercy were arrested by the police and demonised by other religions, even accused of causing the plague.|$|E
