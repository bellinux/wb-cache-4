25|$|Why did I take my own life? Well, {{when you}} {{committed}} two double murders you would too. Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin {{in the city}} park that night, and killed Mr. Starks {{and tried to get}} Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, I think it should go to him, and tell him I don't want the car now.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{think much}} of all these hamfatters," [...] growled Carl. [...] "Actors always go broke and have to walk back to Chicago. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>'d</b> be better to be a civil {{engineer}} or something like that, {{instead of having to}} slick up your hair and carry a cane? They're just dudes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Read away, and digest it well, {{then write}} {{and tell me}} what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>it.</b> <b>Will</b> you?" [...] he asked as they paused where the four roads met.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll never pay me. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will.</b> <b>It's</b> {{your way}} of {{glossing}} over the ethical position. It's the sort of way a woman always does gloss over her ethical positions. You're all dependents--all of you. By instinct. Only you good ones--shirk. You shirk a straightforward and decent return for what you get from us--taking refuge in purity and delicacy and such-like {{when it comes to}} payment." ...|$|R
60|$|SIR PETER. Certainly {{a little}} mortification appears very {{becoming}} in a wife--don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> do her good {{to let her}} Pine a little.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of {{course not}} a steamer in your case, but a long railway journey {{the next time}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> trouble you. It sounds absurd, but--' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Beatrice, [...] "we never condescend {{to repeat}} ourselves. We {{have a new}} word and a beauty, and don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> do very well?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{has been}} in an agony to go these three days. It was all I could do {{to get him to}} stay to-day. <b>You</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> do Frank harm? Then I would stay, if I took lodgings in the village; but otherwise--poor papa--I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is my duty--and he can't do without me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] cried Violet, [...] "you {{are very}} generous. After all, I {{expected}} that from <b>you,</b> and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not hurt <b>you</b> {{very much to}} give me up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> know, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be all nicer now. Mr. White {{is doing}} so much, and Mr. Stebbing hates it so, that Mrs. Stebbing says {{he is going to}} {{dissolve}} the partnership and go away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How is he now?" [...] she asked. [...] "Is he nervous? is he out of temper? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> succeed? Are {{you sure}} it will do no harm?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder how}} long <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be before my father falls into line," [...] said Gerald with a {{careless}} laugh. [...] "Everything considered, I rather admire your pluck." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, Cherry," [...] said Clement. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> over <b>you</b> <b>will</b> {{see that}} we must investigate. I should be {{relieved}} indeed to let it alone, {{but it would not}} be fair towards Lance there and his boys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} you all that happened, Mr. Hopkins," [...] she said, wearily. [...] "Could you not repeat it for me? Well, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> necessary, I <b>will</b> tell these gentlemen what occurred. Have they been in the dining-room yet?" ...|$|R
5000|$|David Wiegand of San Francisco Chronicle {{wrote of}} the {{military}} policy of 'Don't ask, don't tell' being predominant at the Frameline festival in 2010, with [...] "Marine Story {{being one of the}} winners, regardless of what happens with the official U.S. policy toward gays in the military."

6000|$|Is that picturesque? A {{lady has}} told me that in a chapel of the Mosque in Boston there is a picture or image of Mrs. Eddy, and that before it burns a never-extinguished light. Is that picturesque? How long do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be before the Christian Scientist will be worshipping that picture or image and praying to it? How long do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be before it is claimed that Mrs. Eddy is a Redeemer, a Christ, and Christ's equal? Already her army of disciples speak of her reverently as [...] "Our Mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must see}} the carriage, Jane, {{and tell me}} if <b>you</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.

6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to go very much," [...] Herrara said. [...] "I have not yet had the {{pleasure}} of introducing myself to my family and friends as a lieutenant-colonel. Of course, I wrote to my people when I received the commission from Lord Beresford; but it would be really fun to surprise some of my school-fellows and comrades, so if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not be inconvenient I should like very much to go." ...|$|R
60|$|Sure enough, when he waked at tea-time, Winton {{proposed}} to take Mullins all through {{every one of}} his day's lapses from grace, and 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> count against me?' said he.|$|E

6000|$|... "I make {{no excuse}} for my weakness. I ask no {{forgiveness}} for what I know you never can forgive. That, when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of me, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> always be with loathing and contempt is the best that I can hope.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Dave!"
