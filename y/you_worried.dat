500|$|Seattle Weeklys Joe Williams {{enjoyed the}} song, writing [...] "even with the slow, {{bubbling}} beat and energetic keyboards, topped with top-notch delivery by Jay and Kay, it's Redding {{in the background}} that gives the single its true life and flair." [...] Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! magazine commented that [...] "if the over-the-top aggression of [...] "H•A•M" [...] had <b>you</b> <b>worried</b> {{that this would be}} a Waka Flocka ripoff, fear not, as [...] "Otis" [...] makes the most of its Otis Redding sample with some soulful feel-good boom-bap." [...] Sam Gould The Independent remarked [...] "having seen oddball rap collective Odd Future become the talking point of the blogosphere, Eminem and old partner-in-crime Royce da 5'9" [...] start work on their own bruising , and hazy vibe rappers Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y take steps in the same direction, Jay and Ye have recognised the throne is far from unchallenged, and have come together in the most remarkable dual alliance since André 3000 and Big Boi became Outkast." [...] The New York Observer writer Foster Kamer mused, [...] "remember early Kanye? These guys finally do. 'Otis' is the perfect anti-single for this album, because it's a reminder that what we always loved about these two collaborating is still very much there. Not only do they not need hooks, neither of them need to remind us that they don't. There was that first line of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, 'I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago,' and then, the relief after it, where you didn't have to worry about the rest of that album", and Billboard claimed [...] "Otis gets better with each play".|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} with USSR was tested (and proven) during the 1971 war with Pakistan, {{which led to}} the subsequent liberation of Bangladesh. Soon after the victory of the Indian Armed Forces, one of the foreign delegates to visit India was Admiral S.G. Gorshkov, Chief of the Soviet Navy. During his visit to Mumbai (Bombay) he came on board INS Vikrant. During a conversation with Vice Admiral Swaraj Prakash, Gorshkov asked the Vice Admiral, [...] "Were <b>you</b> <b>worried</b> about a battle against the American carrier?" [...] He answered himself: [...] "Well, you had no reason to be worried, as I had a Soviet nuclear submarine trailing the American task force all the way into the Indian Ocean." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trinny and Susannah {{arrive at}} Worthington, where they hold a clothes master class. They makeover three older women, fitting them with high street clothing. One {{woman in her}} 70s is given a new look with a jacket from Kate Moss's TopShop range. Susannah {{comments}} [...] "if any of <b>you</b> <b>worried</b> about not finding things in a top like Topshop, you're wrong." [...] This is aimed to persuade the group of older women that they will find clothes to suit them in high street shops. A convoy of limousines arrive to take 100 of the older generation to Oxford Street where they reclaim the high street. They explore shops such as New Look and Miss Selfridge in search of fashionable items to enhance their figures. After the spree, {{all of the women}} attend the nightclub, The Ministry of Sound where the selected women model the catwalk.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 March, {{an arrest}} warrant was issued for Bassem Youssef, host of the satirical news program El Bernameg, for {{allegedly}} insulting Islam and Morsi. The move was seen by opponents {{as part of an}} effort to silence dissent against Morsi's government. Youssef confirmed the arrest warrant on his Twitter account and said he would hand himself in to the prosecutor's office, jokingly adding, [...] "Unless they kindly send a police van today and save me the transportation hassle." [...] The following day, he was questioned by authorities before being released on bail of 15,000 Egyptian pounds. The event sparked international media attention as well as a segment on Jon Stewart's The Daily Show in which he declared his support for Youssef, calling him a [...] "friend" [...] and [...] "brother" [...] and saying to Morsi: [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>worried</b> about? You're the President of Egypt! You have an army! Youssef's got puns and a show; you've got tanks and planes." ...|$|E

And your husband, who might have the best, remains utterly indifferent, content with something far below the second best. And there is so much in life, too," [...] he went on, regretfully.

60|$|A {{voice from}} the {{perambulator}} beside him broke the thread of Solomon Appleyard's discourse. The sole surviving son of Hezekiah Grindley, seeking distraction and finding none, had crept back unperceived. A perambulator! A thing his experience told him out of which excitement {{in some form or}} another could generally be obtained. <b>You</b> <b>worried</b> it and took your chance. Either it howled, in which case you had to run for your life, followed--and, unfortunately, overtaken nine times out of ten--by a whirlwind of vengeance; or it gurgled: in which case the heavens smiled and halos descended on your head. In either event you escaped the deadly ennui that is the result of continuous virtue. Master Grindley, his star having pointed out to him a peacock's feather lying on the ground, had, with one eye upon his unobservant parent, removed the complicated coverings sheltering Miss Helvetia Appleyard from the world, and anticipating by {{a quarter of a century}} the prime enjoyment of British youth, had set to work to tickle that lady on the nose. Miss Helvetia Appleyard awakened, did precisely what the tickled British maiden of to- day may be relied upon to do under corresponding circumstances: she first of all took swift and comprehensive survey of the male thing behind the feather. Had he been displeasing in her eyes, she would, one may rely upon it, have anteceded the behaviour in similar case of her descendant of to-day--that is to say, have expressed resentment in no uncertain terms. Master Nathaniel Grindley proving, however, to her taste, that which might have been considered impertinence became accepted as a fit and proper form of introduction. Miss Appleyard smiled graciously--nay, further, intimated desire for more.|$|E
6000|$|Arranging her few {{possessions}} in Maggie's fewer receptacles, {{she caught}} a glimpse of the bright side of the fact that her old things were not such a problem as Mrs. Gereth's. Picking her way with Maggie through the local puddles, diving with her into smelly cottages and supporting her, at smellier shops, in firmness over the weight of joints and the taste of cheese, it was still her own secret that was universally inter-woven In the puddles, the cottages, the shops she was comfortably alone with it; that comfort prevailed even while, at the evening meal, her brother-in-law invited her attention to a diagram, drawn with a fork on too soiled a tablecloth, of the scandalous drains of the Convalescent Home. To be alone with it she had come away from Ricks; and now she knew that to be alone with it she had come away from London. This advantage was of course menaced, but not immediately destroyed, by the arrival, on the second day, of the note she had been sure she should receive from Owen. He had gone to West Kensington and found her flown, but he had got her address from the little maid and then hurried to a club and written to her. [...] "Why have you left me just when I want you most?" [...] he demanded. The next words, it was true, were more reassuring on the question of his steadiness. [...] "I don't know what your reason may be," [...] they went on, [...] "nor why you've not left a line for me; but I don't think you can feel that I did anything yesterday that it wasn't right for me to do. As regards Mrs. Brigstock, certainly, I just felt what was right and I did it. She had no business whatever to attack you that way, and I should have been ashamed if I had left her there to worry you. I won't have <b>you</b> <b>worried</b> by any one; no one shall be disagreeable to you but me. I didn't mean to be so yesterday, and I don't to-day; but I'm perfectly free now to want you, and I want you much more than you've allowed me to explain. You'll see if I'm not all right, if you'll let me come to you. Don't be afraid--I'll not hurt you nor trouble you. I give you my honor I'll not hurt any one. Only I must see you, on what I had to say to Mrs. B. She was nastier than I thought she could be, but I'm behaving like an angel. I assure you I'm all right--that's exactly what I want you to see. You owe me something, you know, for what you said you would do and haven't done; what your departure without a word gives me to understand--doesn't it?--that you definitely can't do. Don't simply forsake me. See me, if you only see me once. I shan't wait for any leave--I shall come down to-morrow. I've been looking into trains and find there's something that will bring me down just after lunch and something very good for getting me back. I won't stop long. For God's sake, be there." ...|$|E
