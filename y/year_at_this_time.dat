5|$|Beckingham at {{the time}} he was {{mentioned}} in 1258 was working, probably as chief clerk, for Gilbert of Preston, the English crown's senior royal justice. This was an itinerant position, travelling in a circuit (or eyre); Gilbert's last eyre–and therefore also Beckingham's as his chief clerk–was that of 1268–72. In 1274, Beckingham himself was named an itinerant justice for Middlesex, although as yet this was not a permanent position and he was replaced by the next <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> he seems to have held the rank of king's serjeant. He received the commission of justice of assize in 1276. From 1273 to 1278, he was a senior clerk to the Court of Common Pleas, and was then made keeper of the writs and rolls of the court (custos rotulorum et brevium de banco) until 1285. In that year, Beckingham was appointed a Justice of the Common Pleas.|$|E

He rode Rocquefort II at Haydock Park in December of that <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> Cazalet was building a stable of steeplechasers at Fairlawne. They were trained by Harry Whiteman. Cazalet gave Elizabeth Taylor instruction in horse-riding when she was a girl.|$|E

25|$|Crisp {{worked as}} an {{assistant}} to Griffith for several years and learned much during this time from Griffith, an early master of film story telling who was influential in advancing a number of early techniques, such as cross cutting in editing his films. This experience fostered a similar passion in Crisp to become a director in his own right. His first directing credit was Little Country Mouse, made in 1914. Many directors (and actors) would find themselves turning out a dozen or more films in a single <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> Over the next fifteen years, Crisp directed some 70 films in all, most notably The Navigator (1924) with Buster Keaton and Don Q, Son of Zorro (1925) with Douglas Fairbanks.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, {{workshops}} {{were completed}} at the airfields at Zagreb and Mostar, allowing for repairs and modifications {{to be carried}} out without transferring aircraft to the main factories and workshops closer to the capital. In May of that year, the first aircraft of entirely Yugoslav manufacture was completed at Kraljevo, and it was estimated that factory was capable of producing 100 Breguet 19 aircraft per <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> the factory had a French workforce and was under French management, but the contract was due to expire in 1932, after which the Yugoslav government would be at liberty to produce whichever aircraft it could obtain licences to build. The privately owned Ikarus plant at Zemun continued to produce seaplanes of its own design as well as Potez 25 aircraft under licence. The strength of the air force was estimated at 26 squadrons of about twelve aircraft each, indicating a total of approximately 312 aircraft, although there were almost no reserve aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The New South Wales School of Gunnery was {{established}} at Middle Head in 1885, while full volunteers were instituted again that <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> {{it was decided}} to raise a volunteer corps of cavalry who although they were required to supply their own horses, were to also be partially paid, and had uniforms and weapons supplied. They were eventually formed as a light horse unit and were known as the New South Wales Lancers. Another unit to be raised at this time was the Upper Clarence Light Horse, which had initially been raised by its colonel, Sir Charles Chauvel, father of Harry Chauvel, with the intention of being sent to India if the Russians became involved in Afghanistan; the offer was later rejected, however, when the men were attested they swore to volunteer for overseas service. Previous mounted rifles were merged with the Lancers. A further four batteries of reserve artillery were raised in 1885, but disbanded in 1892. The permanent forces also added units of submarine miners and mounted infantry, which were also soon disbanded.|$|E

In 1671, the ban was lifted and the Jesuits returned.|$|R
25|$|The 1870s and 1880s in Malawi were unsettled, {{and local}} chiefs sought to gain European {{protection}} from their enemies by granting settlers what they probably considered {{was only a}} right to cultivate vacant land. Soon after the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed in 1891, these Europeans secured legal ownership of this land from the protectorate administration. The new owners also claimed all rights that the traditional leaders had or were thought to possess, asserting that thangata work was an obligation that the landlord could impose on tenants. In the early colonial period, thangata took on a new meaning of performing labour in lieu of rent. In {{the early years of}} the protectorate, the estates established in under-populated areas needed workers to establish plantations. Few Africans were resident on estate lands, and some of those who remained left when labour rents were introduced. New workers, who were often migrants from Mozambique, were encouraged to move onto estates and grow their own crops, but were required to pay rent and Hut tax, usually satisfied by two months’ labour a <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> Before 1905, relatively little land on the estates was planted, as the owners were experimenting with a variety of crops. However, from 1905, cotton was successfully grown in commercial quantities. Cotton has a 5 or 6 month growing season, throughout which it needed much labour for a successful result. Between 1910 and 1925, tobacco was also grown in plantations and, like cotton it required a great deal of labour to grow successfully. As tenancies were based on verbal contracts, tenants had little or no chance to dispute the owners’ interpretations of them. On several estates, the obligations of labour tenants were extended, sometimes to a total of four or five months a year for thangata and Hut tax, much of this in the growing season leaving tenants with little time to grow food. As the Crown lands near the estates were already crowded, and as most of estate tenants were migrants from Mozambique with no claim to communal land, they had little option but to stay. In this situation thangata came to mean forced labour.|$|E

2500|$|Infants {{begin to}} break {{contact with their}} mothers after five months, {{but only for a}} brief period each time. By 12 months old, infants move up to [...] from their mothers. At around 18–21 months, the {{distance}} between mother and offspring increases and they regularly spend time away from each other. In addition, nursing decreases to once every two hours. Infants spend only half of their time with their mothers by 30 months. They enter their juvenile period at their third year, and this lasts until their sixth <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> gorillas are weaned and they sleep in a separate nest from their mothers. After their offspring are weaned, females begin to ovulate and soon become pregnant again. The presence of play partners, including the silverback, minimizes conflicts in weaning between mother and offspring.|$|E

2500|$|The {{incident}} in which Otter was used to effect the rescue of Thomas Muir, a famous Scottish political exile, is well documented. Muir was sentenced to be transported for sedition for the space of fourteen years on 31 August 1793. In the middle of April 1794, he left England on board , and after a tedious voyage reached Sydney on September 25 of the same <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> Sydney was still a very small colony at Sydney Cove with about 1,500 people. Muir stated in letters that he purchased a [...] "small hut and several acres of land". Accounts indicate that the land was located {{in the immediate vicinity}} of Jeffrey Street in the modern suburb of Kirribilli. After Muir had been in this penal settlement about two years, a project was formed in America to rescue him from captivity. Some sources credit the American president, George Washington, with the rescue attempt. Other sources discredit this idea. An authoritative paper titled [...] "The Odyssey of Thomas Muir" [...] by Marjorie Masson and J. F. Jameson examines the escape of Muir from the convict settlement at Sydney.|$|E

[...] "Michael Angelo," [...] I said, [...] "you are still (by courtesy) young: if you had five hundred thousand a year, and were a great prince, I would lay a wager that men would discover in you a magnificent courtesy of demeanour, and a majestic presence that only belongs to the sovereigns of the world.

If you had such means of purchasing pleasure, you think, you rogue, you could relish it with gusto. But fancy being brought to the condition of the poor Light of the Universe yonder; and reconcile yourself with the idea that you are only a farthing rushlight.
