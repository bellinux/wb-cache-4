Editions of the album sold at Walmart stores in North America feature a censored version of [...] "The Devil Beneath My Feet". Manson later criticized the store and its gun sales policy, categorizing Walmart in an Australian interview as [...] "that store in America which sells guns to kids but won't sell R-rated lyrics." [...] Manson went on to joke that he might [...] "do a signing at a Walmart store where I just sign guns, {{and you get a}} free record with it when <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> gun." [...] American CD versions of the album were packaged with black polycarbonate discs identical to those used by Sony for the original PlayStation in the early 1990s; the discs were sourced by Brian Schuman of Concord Music from the same plant Sony used. A heat-sensitive thermal texture was added to the CD, so that it appeared black when first opened but revealed a white pattern when exposed to the heat from a CD player.|$|E

[...] During his tenure, Krens has increased the Guggenheim’s endowment to $118 million from $20 million, although he has been known to dip into the endowment to cover operating costs.|$|E
2500|$|Taken together, {{these two}} {{elements}} allowed DeLorean to successfully defend himself at trial with the procedural defense of police entrapment. DeLorean's lawyers successfully {{argued that the}} FBI and DEA had unfairly targeted and illegally entrapped DeLorean when they allowed Hoffman (an active FBI informant who only knew DeLorean casually) to randomly elicit DeLorean into a criminal conspiracy simply because {{he was known to}} be financially vulnerable. Another factor was DeLorean's lack of criminal history, whereas Hoffman was a career criminal who stood to directly benefit if he was able to convince DeLorean to incriminate himself on tape. The DeLorean defense team did not call any witnesses. DeLorean was found not guilty on August 16, 1984, but by then DMC had already collapsed into bankruptcy and DeLorean's reputation as a businessman was irrevocably tarnished. When asked after his acquittal if he planned to resume his career in the auto industry, DeLorean bitterly quipped [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> used car from me?" ...|$|E
