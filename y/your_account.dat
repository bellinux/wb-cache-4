500|$|As {{part of a}} {{cast that}} {{includes}} characters from each of Barth's first six books the characters Jake and Joe resurface in Barth's 1979 novel LETTERS on the Doctor's Remobilization Farm, relocated to Fort Erie, Ontario. [...] The End of the Road is presented in that book as a discarded manuscript Jake had titled What I Did Until the Doctor Came. [...] Barth's fictitious version of himself in LETTERS uses the manuscript {{as the basis for}} The End of the Road; decades later he writes to Jake of his appropriation, and of the film based on the book, calling the latter [...] "as false to the novel as was the novel to <b>your</b> <b>Account</b> and <b>your</b> <b>Account</b> to the actual Horner-Morgan-Morgan triangle".|$|E
500|$|Reckitt and Colman {{approached}} Stanley Wagner to buy Coldcrops, {{and after}} a very long negotiation a deal was concluded. A letter from Barclays Bank dated 21 June 1956 reads [...] " [...] Dear Mr Wagner, I have pleasure in enclosing two copies of the Draft for £......... credited to <b>your</b> <b>account,</b> which the Bank will be pleased if you will accept as a souvenir of this most successful transaction". The deal transferred ownership of the packaging and concept from Coldcrops to Reckitt & Coleman, and the new Jif-brand lemon juice was launched in 1956. All parties were delighted, Stanley Wagner with a substantial sum of money, for those days and a large profit from the six million lemons that had been sold, Reckitt's even more so because the negotiating team had permission to pay far more for the business than {{they were able to}} achieve. Lemon farmers in Sicily were also pleased, because the demand had increased for Sicilian lemon juice, which was largely a by-product of Sicilian lemon oil production. For many years, whilst producing lemon oil, Sicilians had found little use for the juice. Now there was a rapidly growing market for their near-waste product. In 1970, Jif continued to be prepared with lemon juice from Sicily. Later on, Unilever acquired the Jif brand in 1995 for the price of £250m, when it purchased Colman's of Norwich.|$|E
