5000|$|Individuals {{with the}} same score on SWB can differ in their {{evaluations}} of standards of living even if their objective life circumstances are alike. Accordingly, their self-perceived QOL may vary.

However, felt needs are not the only kind of needs that a person may have (Maslow, 1970). If a need is satisfied it may not be felt as intensely as an unsatisfied need of lesser importance in terms of overall happiness. Thus, the strength with which a need is felt at a certain point in time does not necessarily indicate that it makes a greater contribution to the overall SPQL than other needs, which are felt less intensely or unfelt at all at that point in time because they are satisfied. Hence, the strength of individual preferences and needs was evaluated not only through questions such as “how important is fulfillment of this need to <b>your</b> <b>overall</b> happiness?” but also with questions such as “if this need were unfulfilled, how would it affect <b>your</b> <b>overall</b> happiness?” ...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePatient-reported {{outcomes}} (PROs) {{reflect the}} patient’s perspective {{and are used}} in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) routine clinical practice. Patient global assessment (PGA) {{is one of the}} most widely used PROs in RA practice and research and is included in several composite scores such as the 28 -joint Disease Activity Score (DAS 28). PGA is often assessed by a single question with a 0 – 10 or 0 – 100 response. The content can vary and relates either to global health (e. g., how is <b>your</b> health <b>overall)</b> or to disease activity (e. g., how active is your arthritis). The wordings used as anchors, i. e., for the score of 0, 10, or 100 according to the scale used, and the timing (i. e., this day or this week) also vary. The different possible ways of measuring PGA translate into variations in its interpretation and reporting and may impact on measures of disease activity and consequently achievement of treat-to-target goals. Furthermore, although PGA is associated with objective measures of disease activity, it is also associated with other aspects of health, such as psychological distress or comorbidities, which leads to situations of discordance between objective RA assessments and PGA. Focusing on the role of PGA, its use and interpretation in RA, this review explores its validity and correlations with other disease measures and its overall value for research and routine clinical practice...|$|R
