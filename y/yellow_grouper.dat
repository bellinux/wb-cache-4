50|$|The {{banded grouper}} or <b>yellow</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus awoara) is {{a species of}} fish in the family Serranidae. It is found in China, Disputed Territory, Hong Kong, North Korea, South Korea, Macau, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Its natural {{habitats}} are open seas, shallow seas, subtidal aquatic beds, and coral reefs and feeds on shrimp and other fish. It is threatened by habitat loss, pollution, high demand for food and overfishing. It is protected by Cape D'Aguilar Marine Reserve and no-take artificial reefs in Hong Kong but these conservation measures are not enough to support the species.This fish has sharp spines protruding from its back.|$|E
40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} <b>yellow</b> <b>grouper</b> {{industry}} has experienced relatively severe bacterial disease problems in China. The proliferation of pathogens in fish can be suppressed by commensal microbiota. In this background, we used nested polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and sequence analysis to investigate microbiota in the skin, gills and intestines, including adherent bacteria and non-adherent bacteria in <b>yellow</b> <b>grouper</b> fed with natural diet and complete feed. A total of 21 bacterial species were identified using phylogenetic analysis. The gamma-Proteobacteria group (81. 0 %, 17 species) dominated the bacterial communities in <b>yellow</b> <b>grouper</b> completely. Others belonged to Firmicutes (9. 5 %, two species), Actinobacteria (4. 75 %, one species) and Verrucomicrobia (4. 75 %, one species). The higher similarities (above 91 %) of the DGGE band patterns in skin, gill and intestinal-non-adherent bacteria between {{two groups of}} fish indicated that existed more stable microbial communities existed in these specifically ecological niches in <b>yellow</b> <b>grouper.</b> However, considerable differences existed between two intestinal-adherent bacteria (IAB) samples; that is, compared with natural diet fed <b>yellow</b> <b>grouper,</b> higher bacterial apparent species richness and possibly less abundance existed in IAB in fish fed with complete diets, probably indicating that the community structures in IAB were affected easily and significantly by diet...|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to composing music for {{large and small}} ensembles, Boehringer performs often as a soloist. Notable in much of Boehringer's live performance is dark humor as expressed through costumes, theatrical devices, and bizarre textural program notes and descriptions of his work, such as [...] "feedback driven yodel triggers presented simultaneously with carnastic arrays". As one of his alter-egos, Core of the Coalman, Boehringer has shared concerts {{with some of the}} most diverse experimental bands and artists including Gowns, Rubber O Cement, Deerhoof, Ikue Mori, Luciano Chessa, Badgerlore, Ramon Sender, Tralphaz, Sixes, the Breezy Days Band, Xome, Jessica Rylan, 0th, Bulbs, and Joshua Churchill to name a few. In addition, he collaborates directly with many well known members of the American and international experimental music communities. His roster of collaborators includes members of D <b>Yellow</b> Swans, <b>Grouper,</b> Marfa and Ne-Af, XBXRX, 16 Bitch Pile Up, Liz Allbee, 7 Year Rabbit Cycle, Miba, Above the Tree, and the Grey Daturas, and with artists as diverse as Tuesday Faust, Paul Baker, Bonnie Banks, and Che Chen.|$|R
25|$|The Formigas Bank is {{essentially}} a submarine volcano, inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species, coral and sponges. The cone is delimited approximately by the islets of the northwest and the Dollabarats reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are wrasse (Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, ornate wrasse), damselfish, sergeant fish (<b>yellow</b> and black), <b>grouper,</b> Mediterranean parrotfish, and the emblematic Atlantic goliath grouper, Serranidae and barred hogfish. Alongside these are pelagic predators that also reside in the bank (African threadfish, longbill spearfish) and migratory species that travel between destinations (like the manta ray and whale shark).|$|R
50|$|Jefre Cantu-Ledesma is a multi-instrumentalist, {{member of}} several bands {{and co-founder of}} the Root Strata record label based out of San Francisco, California. Cantu-Ledesma got his start in the band Tarentel. He {{was one of the}} {{founding}} members and is still a primary figure in the band's line-up. In addition, Cantu-Ledesma is, and has been, involved in a slew of other musical projects. His label, Root Strata, is highly regarded by the drone/ambient music community and has an extensive catalog that includes artists such as Tarentel, <b>Grouper,</b> <b>Yellow</b> Swans, Charalambides, Keith Fullerton Whitman, Oneohtrix Point Never, Barn Owl, Starving Weirdos, Gregg Kowalsky, and more.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a time-series {{analysis of the}} prices of three species of cultured groupers, namely the red grouper (Epinephelus akaara), green grouper (Epinephelus coioides) and <b>yellow</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus awoara) in Hong Kong. An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was employed to evaluate monthly raw price data for the period January 1988 to July 1992. Empirical results suggest that while the ARIMA model predicts surprisingly well for red and green groupers, the price series of the <b>yellow</b> <b>grouper</b> was found to exhibit the property of random walk in its first differences. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A single {{specimen}} of the reef-associated grouper, Epinephelus flavocaeruleus (Fig. 1) was landed at Keelakarai on 19 - 09 - 2006. It {{was caught in}} a trap kept at a depth of 8 m near Appa island in Gulf of Mannar. The species belonging to the family Serranidae, named as Blue and <b>Yellow</b> <b>grouper</b> and locally known as Manjel Kaleva in Tamil. Epinephelus flavocaeruleus was reported to grow upto a length of 90 cm and attain a weight of 15 kg. It is believed to feed on a variety of fishes, crabs, shrimps, spiny lobsters, squids and small octopu...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytogenetics}} of <b>yellow</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus awoara was studied {{using multiple}} cytogenetic markers [Giemsa staining, C-banding, Ag-NORs and fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) ]. Giemsa staining results showed that the karyotypic formula of E. awoara was 2 n = 48 a, FN (fundamental number) = 48. Faint C-bandings were only detected at the centromeric regions of chromosome pair number 24, being almost indiscernible on the other chromosome pairs. After Ag-NOR staining, one pair of nucleolar organizer regions (NOR) was observed in the subcentromeric region of pair number 24. FISH results showed that 5 S rDNA was located at a pair of medium-sized chromosomes, while 18 S rDNA appeared at the same location in the subcentromeric region of pair number 24 where Ag-NORs were detected. The telomeric sequence (TTAGGG) n detected by FISH was located at both ends of each chromosome. The results suggested that E. awoara has retained general karyotypic structure stability during the evolutionary diversification process.

5000|$|Limited {{information}} is available indicating significant toxicological effects of TPhP. Although it was initially expected to have an overall low impact, {{a growing body of}} evidence suggests that the effects may not be so harmless. Triphenyl phosphate exhibits low acute toxicity by dermal or oral contact. However, an increasing number of studies have linked exposure to TPhP with reproductive and developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, metabolic disruption, endocrine effects, and genotoxicity. TPhP has also been found to induce significant estrogenic activity. One study found that concentrations above the lowest observable effect level have been observed in a variety of other studies in coral <b>grouper,</b> <b>yellow</b> striped goat fish, and freshwater perch. This indicates that TPhP may be present in the environment at high enough concentrations to have harmful ecological effects. The European Chemicals agency considers TPhP to be [...] "very toxic" [...] to aquatic life, with potentially long-lasting effects.|$|R
40|$|Growth, faecal production, {{nitrogenous}} excretion {{and energy}} budget of juvenile <b>yellow</b> <b>grouper</b> (initial body weight 5. 5 g or so) at various ration levels (starvation, 0. 5 %, 1 % and 2 % of initial body weight per day, and satiation) were investigated in this study. Faecal production (f, mg g(- 1) d(- 1)) and nitrogenous excretion (u, mg g(- 1) d(- 1)) increased markedly with increased ration level (RL, % per day), described as f- 0. 483 RL+ 0. 112 for faecal production and u= 0. 218 RL+ 0. 219 for nitrogenous excretion, respectively. Feed absorption efficiency (FAE, %) increased as ration increased with ranges of 91. 4 - 94. 0 %, 95. 6 - 97. 3 % and 96. 5 - 97. 6 % for FAE(d), FAE(p) and FAE(c), respectively, {{but all of}} the variations were small. Relationships between specific growth rate in wet weight (SGR(w), % per day), dry weight (SGR(d), % per day), protein (SGR(p), % per day), energy (SGR(e), % per day) and ration level (RL, % per day) were linear and described as simple equations SGR(w) = 0. 738 RL- 0. 764, SGR(d) = 0. 871 RL- 0. 928, SGR(p) = 0. 904 RL- 0. 966 and SGR(c) = 1. 03 8 RL- 1. 060. Feed conversion efficiency in wet weight (FCEw %), dry weight (FCEd, %), protein (FCEp, %) and energy (FCE,, %) all increased as ration increased and maximized at ad libitum ration level. Energy budgets of juvenile Epinephelits awoara at satiation ration level was: 100 C= 2 F+ 4 U+ 75 R+ 19 G or 100 A= 80 R+ 20 G, where C is food energy, A is assimilated energy, F is faeces energy, U is excretion energy, R is metabolism energy and G is growth energy.
