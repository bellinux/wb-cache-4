500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "All About That Bass" [...] became {{a subject of}} {{controversy}} among several music critics who felt that the song did not promote a positive body image as Trainor intended. The singer was accused of anti-feminism and shaming thin women in the song, namely in the lyrics [...] "bringing booty back / Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that," [...] and [...] "Yeah my mama she told me don't worry about <b>your</b> <b>size</b> / She says, 'Boys like a little more booty to hold at night.'" [...] The former lyric was however developed by Kadish and not Trainor. In a publication by The Daily Telegraph, Olivia O'Niell analyzed, [...] "If the song's 908,000 likes on YouTube and Meghan's 90,000 followers on Twitter are anything to go by, {{it would seem that}} the message most people are taking away from the hit is a positive one". However, O'Niell went on to highlight that the lyrics [...] "have outraged some listeners, with YouTube comments criticizing Trainor for her 'thinly veiled hypocrisy'".|$|E
500|$|Maulbetsch landed {{his first}} big recruit before leaving Ann Arbor. [...] While playing at Michigan, Maulbetsch became friends with Doug Roby, a {{football}} player at the Michigan Military Academy, {{and one of the}} state's top recruits. [...] Roby followed Maulbetsch to Phillips and later [...] {{went on to become a}} member of the International Olympic Committee in the 1950s and 1960s and president of the United States Olympic Committee from 1965 to 1968. [...] Maulbetsch's next find was future Pro Football Hall of Famer Steve Owen, who later spent 23 years with the New York Giants. [...] Maulbetsch saw Owen watching football practice from under a tree and told him: [...] "A fellow <b>your</b> <b>size</b> ought to be out for the squad." [...] Owen showed up the next day and, when Maulbetsch used him to illustrate blocking fundamentals, Owen threw a block into Maulbetsch that threw him five yards through the air. [...] Maulbetsch was satisfied, and Owen had a spot on the team. [...] Because Phillips was not part of a conference, it was not subject to any eligibility limitations, an advantage Maulbetsch was accused of exploiting. [...] A third key player recruited by Maulbetsch was a Native American halfback named Levi, and dubbed [...] "Big Chief" [...] by Phillips fans.|$|E
