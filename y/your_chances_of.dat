25|$|Doctors {{have known}} of strong links between fish and healthy hearts {{ever since they}} noticed that {{fish-eating}} Inuit populations in the Arctic had low levels of heart disease. One study has suggested that adding one portion of fish a week to your diet can cut <b>your</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> suffering a heart attack by half. Fish is thought to protect the heart because eating less saturated fat and more omega-3 can help to lower the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood – two fats that, in excess, {{increase the risk of}} heart disease. Omega-3 fats also have natural built-in anti-oxidants, which are thought to stop the thickening and damaging of artery walls. Regularly eating fish oils is also thought {{to reduce the risk of}} arrhythmia – irregular electrical activity in the heart which increases the risk of sudden heart attacks.|$|E
