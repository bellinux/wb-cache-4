25|$|Where {{the floods}} are less {{frequent}} the hardwoods themselves are absent, {{giving way to}} open country. The country is thus a prairie and, sometimes, this prairie finishes by transforming into bog. The vegetation of the prairies is characterized by calamagrostides blanchâtres, by purple moor grass, bogbean, <b>yellow</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> swamp cinquefoil, lesser spearwort, common marsh-bedstraw, kingcup, purple loosestrife and violettes, the last being an endangered species in the country. In the bogs, vegetation is poor, with mainly bog myrtle, bog-rosemary, common cottongrass and species of Carex. The soil is often covered in peat mosses and other mosses.|$|E
25|$|In {{the zones}} most subject to inundations, {{conifers}} are more rare, {{since they do}} not like in general the wetter zones. In these forests, one can find broadleaf trees such as the aspen, very common in the Lower Dalälven, but rare {{in the rest of the}} country. These forests also have English oaks and small-leaved lindens and the wetter forests are mostly made up of alders, birch trees and willows. The richness of these forests and in particular their undergrowth depends above all on the nature of the soil. The poorer soils grow blueberries, bog bilberries, wild rosemary and cloudberry, whereas the richer soils are home in particular to Lily of the valley, woodland strawberries, purple small-reed and <b>yellow</b> <b>loosestrife.</b>|$|E

There Walter showed her where a brook bubbled {{clear from the}} fountain-head; by its brink, blue veronicas grew, and tall <b>yellow</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> and tasselled purple heads of great English eupatory. Bending down to the stream he picked a little bunch of forget-me-nots, {{and handed them to}} her. Dolly pretended unconsciously to pull the dainty blossoms to pieces, as she sat on the clay bank hard by and talked with him. [...] "Is that how you treat my poor flowers?"

Two species are present which are rare in Somerset: Flat-sedge (Blysmus compressus) and Slender Spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis).

50|$|The site is of {{interest}} for its diverse flora, in large part down to the varied habitats present within the small area. English Nature's SSSI citation sheet states that 114 species have been found at the site. Two species are present which are rare in Somerset: flatsedge (Blysmus compressus) and slender spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis). Flatsedge was discovered here in 1946 by Humphry Bowen. This species occurs at no other site in Somerset. Slender spike-rush was discovered in 1972 by Florence Gravestock, and is only found at one other site in Somerset, West Sedgemoor. Both species were still present in 2004. Other marshland plants found here include purple <b>loosestrife,</b> <b>yellow</b> flag (Iris pseudacorus), hard rush (Juncus inflexus), soft rush (Juncus effusus), flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus), devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), three species of horsetail Equisetum spp. and seven sedges Carex spp.|$|R

50|$|Although Karner blue {{butterflies}} {{are characteristic}} of oak savannas (Quercus spp.) and pine barrens (Pinus spp.) habitats, they also occur in frequently disturbed areas such as rights-of-way, old fields, and road margins. In east-central New York, Karner blue butterflies occurred in 3 rights-of-way habitat types: wild lily-of-the-valley-starflower (Maianthemum canadensis-Trientalis borealis), sweetfern-whorled <b>yellow</b> <b>loosestrife</b> (Comptonia peregrina-Lysimachia quadrifolia), and blackberry-sheep sorrel (Rubus spp. Rumex acetosella). An index of Karner blue population size was highest in the wild lily-of-the-valley-starflower type. In this habitat, mosses (Bryophyta, 6.9%), wild lily-of-the-valley (4.4%), grasses (Poaceae, 4.4%), and starflower (2.1%) had the highest cover. Coverage in the sweetfern-whorled <b>yellow</b> <b>loosestrife</b> type was dominated by grasses (40.9%), sweetfern (12.1%), mosses (9.4%), and whorled <b>yellow</b> <b>loosestrife</b> (5.2%). In the blackberry-sheep sorrel type, the dominants included grasses (22.7%), northern dewberry (Rubus flagellaris, 5.0%), other blackberries (4.8%), and sheep sorrel (4.3%).|$|E
