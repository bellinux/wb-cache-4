25|$|Currently {{there is}} a small niche market for hemp pulp, for example as {{cigarette}} paper. Hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp. In 1994 there was no significant production <b>of</b> 100% <b>true</b> <b>hemp</b> paper. World hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume. The total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons. This can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp, mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the Western world, and because hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (mostly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried hemp stem—the bark, called bast—contains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production. All this accounts for a high raw material cost. Hemp pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide, a process today also commonly used for wood pulp.|$|R
5000|$|Manila {{paper was}} {{originally}} {{made out of}} old Manila hemp ropes which were extensively used on ships, having replaced <b>true</b> <b>hemp.</b> It was made from Manila hemp (also called abacá) or Musa textilis which is grown in The Philippines and hence the association with Manila, the capital of that country. Abaca is an exceptionally strong fibre, nowadays used for special papers like teabag tissue. It is also very expensive, priced several times higher than woodpulp, hence the change to that fibre for what is still called Manilla—usually with two [...] "ll"s. More recently new woodpulp has often been replaced with a high proportion <b>of</b> recycled fibre. <b>True</b> manila <b>hemp</b> folders {{would have been much}} tougher and long lasting than modern folders.|$|R

5000|$|The inner fibers {{are used}} in the making of hats, {{including}} the [...] "Manila hats," [...] hammocks, matting, cordage, ropes, coarse twines, and types of canvas.

Abacá cloth is found in museum collections around the world, like the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Textile Museum of Canada.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In Bangladesh, jute mills are {{producing}} conventional yarns heavier than 275 tex. These {{are used as}} hessian, sacking, carpet backing cloth etc. For diversified uses of jute it is most essential to produce medium count <b>yarn</b> <b>of</b> 241 to 275 tex. In this regard, slip draft spinning machine has been studied. This machine is capable to produce <b>yarn</b> <b>of</b> 241 to 280 tex at flyer speed of 2900 rpm to 4850 rpm. But there is a relation between flyer speed and <b>yarn</b> breakages <b>of</b> the machine. In addition spinning efficiency of the machine also depends on the yarn breakages. Through a series of experiment, a relation has been established between flyer speed and <b>yarn</b> breakages <b>of</b> the experimental machine for production <b>of</b> jute <b>yarn...</b>|$|R

Turmeric, a characteristic of Indian production, was used for the pink core yarn in both Persian and Indian velvets.|$|R
