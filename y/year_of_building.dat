5000|$|Khan-i-Jahan Junaan Telangani and Feroz Shah Tughlaq were {{intensely}} committed towards building architectural monuments. Together, {{they planned}} and built several tombs and mosques. Telangani in particular, {{was credited with}} building seven mosques of unique designs.

There are no specific inscriptions on the Mosque on its construction date, though the name of the builder is inscribed on the eastern gate of the Mosque as 'Khan-e-Jahan Junaan Shah'.

40|$|Now {{more than}} ever, the social {{demands on the}} University require huge amounts of {{creativity}} {{to respond to the}} socio-economic context of today’s society. Creativity is an ability that requires teamwork as a framework for discussion of the particular ideas of its members, and a scenario for the development of necessary attitudes of tolerance. The experience described was developed with the help received by the University of Seville, within the Call for Teaching Innovation and Improvement Projects of the University’s First Teaching Plan during the 2010 - 2011 academic year, in a subject corresponding to the second term of the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>Building</b> Engineering. The experience was designed to develop a very short video with subject-related content to motivate the development of creativity among the students, and which would allow them to understand their own strengths and weaknesses in this area. It was also designed to achieve certain transverse competences included within the learning objectives of the subject, such as the ability to communicate through word and image {{in the context of a}} project in which teamwork is promoted. Given that such competences are always difficult to assess, the experience also sought to explore different approaches through peer assessment (using rubrics designed specifically for this case) and assessments involving agents external to the educational process. The results obtained show that, from the context of teaching technical subjects, it is possible to develop creativity together with the specific knowledge of the subject, and this experience is proposed as a new model for its teaching.

40|$|Abstract Background According to the Norwegian {{animal welfare}} regulations, {{it has been}} {{forbidden}} to build new tie-stall barns {{since the end of}} 2004. Previous studies have shown that cow performance and health differ between housing systems. The interaction between housing system and herd size with respect to performance and disease incidence has not been evaluated. Methods Cow performance and health in 620 herds housed in free-stall barns were compared with in 192 herds housed in tie-stall barns based on a mail survey and data from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording and Cattle Health Systems. The housing systems herds were comparable with respect to herd size (15 - 55 cows). Associations between performance/disease incidence and housing system, herd size and <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> the cow barn were tested in general linear models, and values for fixed herd size of 20 and 50 cows were calculated. On the individual cow level mixed models were run to test the effect of among others housing system and herd size on test-day milk yield, and to evaluate lactation curves in different parities. All cows were of the Norwegian Red Breed. Results Average milk production per cow-year was 134 kg lower in free-stall herd than in tie-stall herds, but in the range 27 - 45 cows {{there was no significant difference}} in yields between the herd categories. In herds with less than 27 cows there were increasingly lower yields in free-stalls, particularly in first parity, whereas the yields were increasingly higher in free-stalls with more than 45 cows. In free-stalls fertility was better, calving interval shorter, and the incidence rate of teat injuries, ketosis, indigestions, anoestrus and cystic ovaries was lower than in tie-stalls. All of these factors were more favourable in estimated 50 -cow herds as compared to 20 -cow herds. In the larger herd category, bulk milk somatic cell counts were higher, and the incidence rate of mastitis (all cases) and all diseases was lower. Conclusion This study has shown that there is an interaction between housing system and herd size, and that performance and health is not universally better in small free-stalls than in tie-stalls. </p...|$|E
