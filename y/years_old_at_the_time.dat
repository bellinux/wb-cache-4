5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of his accession. That {{he ruled}} for 30 years {{should not be}} taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 years old {{at the beginning of his}} reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E

5|$|Guerrero Maya Jr. is {{the only}} wrestler to have two {{documented}} title reigns during the CMLL-era, as he previously held the titles with Delta. No team has held the championship more than once after it was brought back in 2000, but records indicate that team of Kung Fu and Kato Kung Lee held the championship {{on at least two}} separate occasions, possibly more. The current champions are also the shortest reigning champions of the modern age, , second to only to Namajague and Okumura's reign of 245 days, but will surpass that if they remain champions until August 28, 2017. Los Bombardieros reign is the longest of the modern age, 1,708 days although there were extended periods of time where the championship went undefended. Black Terry, who was 64 <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of his title victory, is the oldest person to win the Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship. The Panther was seventeen or eighteen <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> he won the championship, making him the youngest champion of at least the CMLL-era and possibly {{in the history of the}} championship. In 2005, after both Stone brothers left CMLL to work for AAA, the championship was finally declared vacant.|$|E
