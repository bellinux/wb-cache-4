2500|$|Returning to the stage, Connolly {{embarked}} on his Big Wee Tour of Britain, performing 69 dates in 84 days. While backstage in Brighton, he met Stephenson {{for a second}} time. He confided in {{her that he was}} unhappy and that his current marriage was over. Back at his hotel, where they began an affair, he reportedly drank thirty brandies. [...] "What I saw of him– particularly in that dressing room– was {{that he was about to}} die," [...] Stephenson said. [...] "He was very suicidal. He was throwing everything away, desperately trying to feel no pain at all. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> get a sense from some people when they are very self-destructive that there is something they are trying to bury? They've got something they are trying to forget, or they are trying to drown their sorrows? He was hurting in a very deep way. I thought, 'If I leave this man, he's going to die.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Performed by the Four Freshmen, [...] "Their Hearts Were Full of Spring" [...] (1961) was a {{particular}} favorite of the Beach Boys. Brian explained: [...] "My mom turned me on to them. She {{turned on the radio}} and goes, 'Hear that song? This is called 'Day By Day' by the Four Freshmen.' And I listened and I went 'Oh, I love it, Mommy! I love it!' ... We went in [...] and she said you can take records into these little booths and play them to see if you wanted to buy them. ... <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> sit in a sauna bath and the sweat will come out? That's what that whole experience in that room started to be. I purged all kinds of bullshit and picked up the Freshmen. It was magic. Total magic." [...] By deconstructing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Lambert notes, [...] "If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song." [...] Wilson continued: [...] "I learned them bar by bar. I'd go to my hi-fi set and I'd play a little bit. Then I'd stop and try to figure it out, back and forth, back and forth, until I figured the whole song out." ...|$|E

6000|$|It held again her companion, who next, however, with {{a single}} movement, {{throwing}} herself on her neck, overflowed. [...] "Oh, if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> help me!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Let {{your speech}} always be with grace, {{seasoned}} with salt, that <b>you</b> may <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> ought to answer each one.|$|R
6000|$|... "My poor wife!" [...] he said, [...] "my dear wife. If it {{were not}} for you--I think I could kill myself to-night. Don't cry, my dear. Don't, don't cry. <b>You</b> do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> comfort me. <b>You</b> do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> help me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In every vaunt you make,' she said, 'I have my triumph I {{single out}} in you the meanest man I know, the {{parasite}} and {{tool of the}} proud tyrant, that his wound may go the deeper, and may rankle more. Boast, and revenge me on him! <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> came here to-night; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> stand cowering there; you see yourself in colours quite as despicable, if not as odious, as those in which I see you. Boast then, and revenge me on yourself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He won't tell me. But he {{has found}} it out. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> stand in his opinion--I leave you to imagine {{what he thinks of}} Clara's conduct in coming here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps. But {{then that}} was three months ago," [...] {{returned}} the lady, smiling, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> have reformed since, and grown ever so much more steady and respectable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You look tired," [...] said Rosamond, kindly; [...] "put {{your feet}} upon the front seat--nobody will look. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much <b>you</b> cleared?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shouldn't {{have gone}} in {{for this kind of}} thing if I hadn't thought I was sure. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much <b>you</b> owe me, don't you?' ...|$|R
500|$|That night Kennedy {{returned}} to Washington D.C.. He {{walked in on}} his family having dinner at Hickory Hill, highly agitated and, {{in the words of}} his daughter Kathleen, [...] "ashen faced." [...] He announced to his children, [...] "In Mississippi a whole family lives in a shack the size of this room. The children are covered with sores and their tummies stick out because they have no food. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> lucky <b>you</b> are? Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> lucky <b>you</b> are? Do something for your country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] she declared, with {{a little}} breath of relief. [...] "That was it, of course. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> looked when you first heard his name--when {{he came into the}} room?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see," [...] he said, pleadingly, [...] "you {{seemed so}} bent on our {{traveling}} the proud path of honest labor and honorable poverty, that I was terrified--that is, I was afraid--of--of--well, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> talked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For heaven's sake, be careful, Laura!" [...] cried Robert. [...] "It had not {{struck me}} before, but really {{it does look}} rather like it. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> stand. Raffles Haw {{is not a man}} to play with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> wrong <b>you</b> are. Say <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> cruel you've been to me," [...] she pleaded. But {{under her}} female {{pleading}} and appeal {{he felt the}} iron of her threat.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] said Clara, {{in a tone}} {{of voice}} {{approaching}} to a scream--"in the name of God, what is it? <b>You</b> <b>know</b> not <b>how</b> <b>you</b> terrify me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a splendid}} {{creature}} you are!" [...] said Mrs. Byron, holding {{him a little}} way from her, the better to admire him. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> handsome <b>you</b> are, you wretch?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't!"--with {{which he}} became quite sharp; [...] "for <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> know it--which I've not a notion of. It's just what I think," [...] he continued, facing me again, [...] "you ought to tell me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I {{have used}} her vilely, at least I have dealt openly by her,' said Lucilla. 'She has always seen {{the worst of}} me on the surface. Can you bear to talk of her when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> are {{treating}} her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, to be sure," [...] said he. [...] "But I expect I {{should like}} her. By the way, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> {{used to talk}} to me about coming and living somewhere near you? How would you like me to take one of your rooms now? I might cheer you up." ...|$|E
6000|$|Stay my charmer, can {{you leave}} me? [...] Cruel, cruel to deceive me; [...] Well <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much <b>you</b> grieve me; [...] Cruel charmer, can you go! [...] Cruel charmer, can you go! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come here, Rosa!" [...] Lady Dedlock beckons her, {{with even}} an {{appearance}} of interest. [...] "Why, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> pretty <b>you</b> are, child?" [...] she says, touching her shoulder with her two forefingers.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{do not say}} so, because I do not know. I put it to you. I ask you {{to think}} of it. I want <b>you</b> to consider. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> well <b>you</b> are doing here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now listen," [...] Mr. Fentolin went on. [...] "I want {{to remind}} you of certain things, Meekins. We are among friends here--no secrecy, you understand, or {{anything}} of that sort. You need not be afraid! <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> came to me? You remember that little affair of Anna Jayes in Hartlepool?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes!" [...] Mrs. Ewbert exulted disconsolately, and {{she left}} him to his book. She {{returned}} to say: [...] "If you must take anything to make you sleepy, I've left some warm milk {{on the back of}} the stove. Promise me you won't take any sulphonal! <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel the next day!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You frighten me, Master Tomkins," [...] said Phoebe, [...] "though I am {{sure you}} {{do not mean to}} do so. I wonder how you dare speak words so like the good words in the Bible, when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> laughed at your own master, {{and all the rest of}} them--when you helped to play the hobgoblins at the Lodge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will go first, sahib, {{and will}} let <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> far <b>you</b> {{will have to}} drop; for the wall looks, to me, higher than {{it was at the}} point where I {{intended}} to descend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> frightful <b>you</b> have {{everything}} about you, Olive," [...] said Clara Kingsbury, {{one day after}} the Eastlake movement began, as she took a comprehensive survey of the Halleck drawing-room through her pince-nez.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not this week, my son--not till next," [...] said Mr. Marble, jocularly. [...] "Sunday is the day. We {{run from}} Sunday to Sunday--the better day, the better deed, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>How</b> did <b>you</b> leave father and mother?" ...|$|R
60|$|In a nutshell, {{what had}} {{occurred}} was this: <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> aquaplane. A motor-boat nips on ahead, trailing a rope. You {{stand on a}} board, holding the rope, and the boat tows you along. And {{every now and then}} you lose your grip on the rope and plunge into the sea and have to swim to your board again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{that your}} dear-loved Scotia {{puts it in}} your power to return to [...] the {{situation}} of your forefathers, will you follow these will-o'-wisp [...] meteors of fancy and whim, till they bring you once more to the brink [...] of ruin? I grant that the utmost ground you can occupy is but half a [...] step from the veriest poverty; but still it is half a step from it. [...] If all that I can urge be ineffectual, let her who seldom calls to [...] you in vain, let the call of pride prevail with you. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> [...] feel at the iron gripe of ruthless oppression: <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> bear [...] the galling sneer of contumelious greatness. I hold you out the [...] conveniences, the comforts of life, independence and character, on [...] the one hand; I tender you servility, dependence, and wretchedness on [...] the other. I will not insult your understanding by bidding you make [...] a choice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Once for all, Jem,' said Fitzjocelyn, 'do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> {{are using}} my father? No; Isabel Conway {{may be the}} {{happiness}} or the disappointment of my life--I cannot tell. I am sure my father is mistaken, and I believe he may be convinced; but I am bound not to fly {{in the face of}} his direct commands, and, till we can come to an understanding, I must do the best I can, and trust to--' ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{could not}} tell, {{but at last}} he said: [...] "I'll tell you what! You must keep me up to it. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much <b>you</b> enjoy making me do my duty, {{and this will be}} such a pleasure!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] assented his wife, smiling. [...] "It {{was only}} {{yesterday}} that <b>you</b> declared <b>you</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> {{were going to}} get through with the sowing. I suppose you'll want to take a few things along with you?" ...|$|R
