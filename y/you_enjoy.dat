In the modern day it {{is at the heart of}} the Lynn of Lorn National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland. The views from Barr Mòr, the island's highest point, are superlative. Although only of modest size, from there [...] "the skyscape is vast and made so not by its emptiness, but by the throng of high and pointed hills lifting out of the glittering seas and islands. Nowhere else on the Highland coast can <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> a view of the mountainous mainland to equal this one." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Andy Meisler, {{in his book}} I Want to Believe: The Official Guide to the X-Files Volume 3, called the episode [...] "one of the best non-mythological episodes of the fourth season" [...] due to its [...] "seamless integration of character development, social commentary and the supernatural." [...] Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek named [...] "Kaddish" [...] the best stand-alone episode of season four and called its conceit [...] "absolutely real and utterly tragic" [...] despite being [...] "highly fantastical". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club rated the episode [...] "B+", claiming that, while it was [...] "the sort of episode that works best if <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> it for its style and presentation without getting too {{caught up in the}} script", it felt [...] "appropriate". Handlen did, however, criticize the episode's characterization of Scully, noting that her scientific counter-arguments were [...] "becoming less about applying common sense to madness, and more just arguing for arguing's sake." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Matt Selman. It {{contains}} several references to different foods and famous chefs, and is largely devoted to the foodie culture, which Selman {{has said that he}} [...] "always thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> eating, but as something that you are so passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it." [...] Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, the stars and creators of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, guest starred in the episode as two foodies and performed a hip hop song that makes fun of foodies. Chefs and media personalities [...] Anthony Bourdain, Gordon Ramsay, and Mario Batali also guest starred in the episode, but as themselves in a dream sequence. Although [...] "The Food Wife" [...] has received generally positive reviews from television critics, particularly for the hip hop song, it has also attracted criticism from certain food critics.|$|E
500|$|In {{the text}} {{accompanying}} the first recording of Sonatas and Interludes, Cage specifically {{stated that the}} use of preparations is not a criticism of the instrument, but a simple practical measure. Cage started composing for prepared piano in 1940, when he wrote a piece called Bacchanale for a dance by Syvilla Fort, and by 1946 had already composed a large number of works for the instrument. However, in Sonatas and Interludes the preparation is very complex, more so than in any of the earlier pieces. Forty-five notes are prepared, mostly using screws and various types of bolts, but also with fifteen pieces of rubber, four pieces of plastic, several nuts and one eraser. It takes about two or three hours to prepare a piano for performance. Despite the detailed instructions, any preparation is bound to be different from any other, and Cage himself suggested that there is no strict plan to adhere to: [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> playing the Sonatas and Interludes then do it so that it seems right to you".|$|E
500|$|Manhunt {{is easily}} the most violent game ever made. It will likely be {{dismissed}} by many as a disgusting murder simulator with no reason to exist. But Manhunt also is the Clockwork Orange of video games, holding your eyes open so as to not miss a single splatter – asking you, is this really what <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> watching? Had Manhunt been poorly made, using the snuff film angle as a cheap gimmick, the game would have been shameful and exploitative. What elevates it to a grotesque, chilling work of art is both presentation and game play. Manhunt is solid as a game; it's engaging to use stealth as you creep {{through the streets of}} this wicked city, using your smarts to avoid death, while dishing out much of your own. It's Ubisoft's Splinter Cell meets the cult Faces of Death videos [...] If Manhunt succeeds at retail, it will say more about America's fascination with violence than any political discourse or social debate. That makes Manhunt the most important video game of the last five years.|$|E

500|$|Producer {{and drummer}} Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson issued {{an essay in}} 1999 that {{discussed}} the album's creation and analyzed its songs. He described the project as a [...] "vicarious fantasy", a [...] "new direction of soul for 2000", and [...] "the litmus test that will reveal the most for your personality". He addressed the inspiration behind Voodoo, saying [...] "It was a love for the dead state of black music, a love to show our idols how much they taught us [...] I hope <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> it. Just have an open mind to new shit. Just give us that." [...] Questlove discussed his expectations of a reaction from music listeners to the concept, saying in an interview for Entertainment Weekly upon the album's release, [...] "We knew this album would be a hard pill to swallow.

500|$|... "The Food Wife" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman. The writing process began around September 2010. According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world that I always thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> eating, but as something that you are so passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it. 'I'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork-neck soup restaurant,' and you can kind of claim that as yours. The blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element that I always thought was inherently funny. And when I write Simpsons episodes, I try to start with a world I think is funny, and think, 'What's a good story we can tell in that world, using the characters that we have?'" ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu {{said that the}} film works as it melds an interesting screen line with racy action. She {{also noted that the}} story resembled Shankar's Indian (1996) a lot while also bearing semblance to his Gentleman (1993). She remarked that the story and screenplay deserved to be lauded for its [...] "ingenious sparks in narration" [...] but problems arose with respect to its plausibility. She then declared, [...] " [...] some of the best camera shots, stunts and locations on a mind-boggling scale have been showcased. If <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> magnificence in cinema you will like this Anniyan." [...] Krishnakumar wrote for Rediff.com that learning from the debacle of Boys, the director went back to his strength by taking a social theme, spicing it up and serving the perfect commercial fare. He added that in trying to explain multiple personality disorder in the simplest of terms, the director has only succeeded to a certain extent as a majority of viewers who are not that well informed might not even comprehend what is being said. Labelling the film as a [...] "must see", a reviewer at Sify acclaimed that the film holds the viewers riveted with its racy narration, a relevant message backed with technical wizardry, never-seen before colourful song picturisation and particularly the performance of Vikram. Yet, the reviewer criticised that the film was too lengthy and the story too thin on logic.|$|E

This would be his first European concert in five years. Eminem wore black shorts and a hoodie. He commented on the weather, saying, [...] "I know it's muddy and sloppy and shit but this is fun", and also thanked the crowd for supporting him.

500|$|Filming for {{the music}} video began on September 20, 2012, with shots of Jepsen on set of the music video {{surfacing}} online the same day. She was pictured {{wearing a pair of}} leather pants along with a red-black corset and a silver chain hanging from her waist. The singer said she is aiming to show a more mature side with the music video. On October 8, 2012, a 24-second teaser was uploaded to YouTube featuring Jepsen performing the track at a party, falling for a guy in a grey beanie and then jumping into a swimming pool with him for a kiss. Two weeks later, the singer tweeted, [...] "the music video for This Kiss is coming soooo soon! Until then here is a little preview. Hope <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> it! Mwah x," [...] followed by the link of the teaser. A lyric video, which [...] "channels the familiar opening credits of the classic show Saved By The Bell" [...] as noted by Carl Williot of Idolator, was released on October 18, 2012. The music video premiered on October 26, 2012, at the Fun Size film premiere, and was released online on October 28, 2012. Directed by Justin Francis, the video starts with Jepsen and her fellow friends driving a Fiat 500. After they come out of the car, they follow to a '80s inspired warehouse, where Jepsen starts flirting with a guy (actor Kurt Collins). The guy is immediately attracted to her, and, as the video comes to a close, they dive in a pool and kiss.|$|E
