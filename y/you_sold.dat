5|$|The {{recording}} finished as the forty-fourth {{album of}} the Billboard 200 of 1995 and finished at number 123 on the Billboard 200 albums of 1996. Two years after Selena's murder, Dreaming of You and Siempre Selena (1996) occupied {{the third and fourth}} slots respectively on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. Dreaming of <b>You</b> <b>sold</b> 420,500 copies between 1997 and 1999, and sold 190,000 units in 1997 alone. The biopic Selena (1997) contributed to a 65% increase of sales for Dreaming of You for that year. Dreaming of <b>You</b> <b>sold</b> half a million copies in Texas. Some Texas retailers criticized sale figures for the state because the album had sold poorly at their music stores. By December 1995, Dreaming of You had sold two million copies in the U.S. and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipments of two million copies. Within ten months of its release, the album was nearing triple-platinum status; it was eventually certified 35×platinum (Latin field) by the RIAA, denoting shipment of 3.5 million units. It remains the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the U.S. with five million copies sold worldwide as of January 2015. A percentage of the proceeds from the album's sales was donated to the Selena Scholarship Fund.|$|E
5|$|Dreaming of <b>You</b> <b>sold</b> 175,000 copies on {{its first}} day of release in the U.S.a then-record for a female vocalist. The {{recording}} also had the highest release-day sales of any Spanish-language album to debut on Billboards Top Latin Albums chart. According to Behar, the sales figures Nielsen SoundScan provided did not include sales in small shops specializing in Latin music, where Dreaming of You scored well. The album's sales helped Selena to become the third solo artist to debut a posthumous album at {{number one on the}} U.S. Billboard 200 chart, behind Janis Joplin and Jim Croce. It became the first and only Spanish-language and Tejano recording to debut at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, and the first EMI Latin release to do so.|$|E
5|$|The World Ends with You {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} has been commercially successful. Game Informer named the game its Handheld Game of the Month award for May 2008. IGN gave The World Ends with You its Editors' Choice Award, and named it the DS Game of the Month for April. In Japan, the game premiered as the second-best selling DS title {{during the week of}} July 27, 2007. Nearly 193,000 units were sold in Japan by the end of 2007. The World Ends with <b>You</b> <b>sold</b> 43,000 copies during April 2008 in North America. The first shipment of the game sold out mid-May and a second shipment was made in mid-June 2008.

25|$|Schwarzenbach became emo's first idol, as {{listeners}} {{related to}} the singer even more than to his songs. Jawbreaker's 1994 album, 24 Hour Revenge Therapy, was popular with fans and is a touchstone of mid-1990s emo. Although the band signed with Geffen Records and toured with Nirvana and Green Day, their 1995 album Dear <b>You</b> <b>sold</b> poorly; they broke up soon afterwards, with Schwarzenbach forming Jets to Brazil. Jawbreaker influenced later successful emo and pop-punk bands.|$|E

500|$|I Want You was {{released}} March 16, 1976 in the United States on the Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records.

The single topped the Billboard Soul Singles chart, quickly becoming Marvin Gaye's eleventh number-one hit on that chart, while peaking at number fifteen on the Billboard Pop Singles chart.|$|E

Hill indicated this was to remedy a situation where British publishers [...] "regarded West Africa only {{as a place where}} <b>you</b> <b>sold</b> books." [...] Achebe was chosen to be General Editor of the African Writers Series, which became a significant force in bringing postcolonial literature from Africa {{to the rest of the}} world, and he continued in that role until 1972.|$|E

The song was published as early as 1891. The song was a popular camp song in the 1920s, sung with corresponding movements (like touching your chest when you sing [...] "chest", and touching your head when you sing [...] "nut"). Glenn Miller recorded the song in 1939.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Gerhard von Rad of Heidelberg University in the mid-20th-century {{argued that}} the Joseph {{narrative}} {{is closely related to}} earlier Egyptian wisdom writings.

2500|$|Eight Arms to Hold You, {{which was}} {{released}} February 11, 1997 on Geffen Records, {{proved to be}} a difficult and dividing album. Some fans of American Thighs were disappointed by the polished, hard-rock and distinctively Bob Rock production, in comparison to the laid back, indie buzz-bin vibe of American Thighs. The new album garnered mixed reviews from music critics as well. Band members have since admitted that this album was difficult for the band, and the recording process was extremely tense. However, Eight Arms to Hold <b>You</b> <b>sold</b> well due {{to the success of the}} first single, [...] "Volcano Girls", written by Gordon. It was a catchy, power-pop tantrum that matched [...] "Seether"'s success, peaking at #8 on the Modern Rock charts. The album, however, didn't have longevity, and despite peaking higher (Billboard Top 200 at 55) than American Thighs, sales dropped off drastically when the second single, [...] "Shutterbug", failed to chart, despite a high budget video and Saturday Night Live performance, as well as other promotion. Three more singles were sent to radio ("The Morning Sad", [...] "Straight" [...] and [...] "Benjamin") but none of them did well enough to warrant a video. However, the Gordon-penned [...] "'Benjamin" [...] was released internationally as the third and last commercial single from the album despite having no video and no promotion. [...] "Benjamin" [...] also failed to chart.|$|E
