60|$|The {{first thought}} {{that struck me}} on reading your last was to {{mortgage}} a poem to Murray, but on more consideration, I {{made up my mind}} not to do so; my reputation is very low; he would not have negotiated my bill of intellect, or given me a very small sum. I should have bound myself down for some time. 'Tis best to meet present misfortunes; not for a momentary good to sacrifice great benefits which one's own untrammell'd and free industry may bring one in the end. In all this do never think of me as in any way unhappy: I shall not be so. I have a great pleasure in thinking of my responsibility to you, and shall do myself the greatest luxury if I can succeed in any way so as to be of assistance to you. We shall look back upon these times, even before our eyes are at all dim--I am convinced of it. But be careful of those Americans. I could almost advise you to come, whenever you have the sum of £500, to England. Those Americans will, I am afraid, still fleece you. If ever you think of such a thing, you must bear in mind the very different state of society here,--the immense difficulties of the times, the great sum required per annum to maintain yourself in any decency. In fact the whole is with Providence. I know not how to advise you but by advising you to advise with yourself. In your next tell me at large <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> America--what chance there is of succeeding there, for it appears to me you have as yet been somehow deceived. I cannot help thinking Mr. Audubon has deceived you. I shall not like the sight of him. I shall endeavour to avoid seeing him. You see how puzzled I am. I have no meridian to fix you to, being the slave of what is to happen. I think I may bid you finally remain in good hopes, and not tease yourself with my changes and variations of mind. If I say nothing decisive in any one particular part of my letter, you may glean the truth from the whole pretty correctly. You may wonder why I had not put your affairs with Abbey in train on receiving your letter before last, to which there will reach you a short answer dated from Shanklin. I did write and speak to Abbey, but to no purpose. Your last, with the enclosed note, has appealed home to him. He will not see the necessity of a thing till he is hit in the mouth.

Despite {{billions of dollars}} invested in prevention, America's drug problem is alive and well. Face it, we have lost the war on drugs. Supply reduction approaches (law enforcement) are effective, but demand reduction (prevention) is hopeless.

2500|$|An adult may be {{expected}} to cope with the death of a parent in a less emotional way; however, the loss can still invoke extremely powerful emotions. This is especially true when the death occurs at an important or difficult period of life, such as when becoming a parent, at graduation, or at other times of emotional stress. It is important to recognize the effects that the loss of a parent can cause, and to address these effects. For an adult, the willingness to be open to grief is often diminished. A failure to accept and deal with loss will only result in further pain and suffering. “Mourning is the open expression of <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> and feelings <b>about</b> the death.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the ability model of emotional intelligence and includes a discussion about how and why the concept became useful in both educational and workplace settings. We review the four underlying emotional abilities comprising emotional intelligence and the assessment tools that that have been developed to measure the construct. A primary goal is to provide a review of the research describing the correlates of emotional intelligence. We describe what is known about how emotionally intelligent people function both intra- and interpersonally and in both academic and workplace settings. The facts point in one direction: The job offer you have in hand is perfect – great salary, ideal location, and tremendous growth opportunities. Yet, there is something that makes you feel uneasy about resigning from your current position and moving on. What will you do?

Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher has been taken off the shelf in one school district for what they called [...] "satanic content"—the presence of the dragon, the chicken livers, the silver gleam, and the use of black and red colors here and there in the book. It went back on the shelf after a protracted discussion and once I got involved in the issue. But I can't address magic across the spectrum because different people have different feelings about it.

6000|$|DEAR MR. MALLESON,--I {{thank you}} for your letter, which I {{received}} this morning. Second thoughts are not always the best. <b>Your</b> own first <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the motto which I prefixed to my notes was right; <b>your</b> second <b>thought</b> was wrong. It {{never occurred to me that}} anyone could possibly suppose that that motto was by me intended to be applied to myself, inasmuch as in these notes there is no [...] "wound" [...] inflicted on Mr. Ruskin, or even any [...] "rebuke." [...] On the contrary, I assume that he has evidence in support of his charges, although he has not produced it. The [...] "rebuke" [...] to which I alluded was Mr. Ruskin's rebuke. He is the [...] "friend" [...] whose wounds are faithful, and whose smitings are a kindness. For I have not the least doubt of his good-will towards the clergy, or of his earnest desire to see them all performing their sacred duties with zeal and knowledge. And it was as my acknowledgment of this that I prefixed the motto. With you I firmly believe that the standard which he takes is [...] "lofty and Christian," [...] and that it is one towards which we ought all of us to aim. The object of my notes was to show that the laity of England have, in the authorized teaching of the Church, a sufficient safeguard against any erroneous teaching which they may possibly hear from the pulpit or in the private ministrations of the clergy, and also a supplement to any defective teaching.|$|R

It is perhaps the most subjective way to share <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> with other people and the world. Makes you think about values, the real, the transcendence. In my case, poetry is a tool to relax, suggests tranquillity, and means another world, where I have a choice to distinguish real and unreal.
