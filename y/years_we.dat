5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 <b>years.</b> <b>We</b> now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the majority}} were completed by Jan, from an overall design by Hubert, who probably oversaw the construction {{of most of the}} frames. A number of difficulties present themselves, not least that there is no surviving work confidently attributed to Hubert, and it is thus impossible to detect his style. Instead, art historians have resorted to comparing individual passages to known works by Jan, looking for stylistic differences that might indicate the work of another hand. Advances in Dendrochronology have for example established that parts of the wing panels were felled around 1421. Allowing a seasoning time of at least 10 <b>years,</b> <b>we</b> must assume a completion date well after Hubert's death in 1426, thus ruling out his hand from large portions of the wings.|$|E

And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E

On 16 October 2008, in a speech at a United Nations gathering on World Food Day, former US president Bill Clinton criticized the bipartisan coalition in Congress that blocked efforts to make some aid donations in cash rather than in food. Referring in part to policies that had pressured African governments to reduce subsidies for fertilizer and other agricultural inputs, Clinton also said:We need the World Bank, the IMF, all the big foundations, and all the governments to admit that, for 30 <b>years,</b> <b>we</b> all blew it, including me when I was President.
