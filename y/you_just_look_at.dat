25|$|The Croydon area {{by itself}} is {{considered}} a fairly safe Labor area. The table to the right shows that when <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the polling booths in the suburb of Croydon, Labor has consistently returned around 60% of the two-party preferred vote even when the first preference votes have fluctuated. The Greens vote, while not as large as {{in other parts of}} the inner-west has been steadily increasing in recent years.|$|E
500|$|In July 2012, Pusha T told MTV {{that while}} he was putting {{together}} his solo album, he was heavily influenced by Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino's 1997 film The Devil's Advocate. [...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', but when you get tuned into the record, you realize that you get both sides of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Criticism of Irwin's career {{following}} his death came from Dan Mathews, vice-president {{of the animal}} rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comparing Irwin to a [...] "cheap reality TV star", Mathews accused him of [...] "antagonising frightened wild animals ... a very dangerous message to send to children", contrasted his methods with the behaviour of [...] "a responsible conservationist like Jacques Cousteau", {{and said it was}} [...] "no shock at all that Steve Irwin should die provoking a dangerous animal." [...] The son of Jacques Cousteau, Jean-Michel Cousteau—also a producer of wildlife documentaries—took issue with Irwin's [...] "very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" [...] and suggested instead that [...] "You don't touch nature, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it." [...] Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., on the other hand, called Irwin [...] "a remarkable individual"; describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, [...] "I think why Steve was so excited about it that we were looking at these animals that people think of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha!" [...] cried Mrs. Wragge, cheerfully; [...] "we'll {{have that}} Cashmere Robe to-morrow. Come here! I want to whisper {{something}} to <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me--I'm {{going to sleep}} crooked, and the captain's not here to bawl at me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's Gilbert Blythe {{sitting right}} across the aisle from <b>you,</b> Anne. <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him {{and see if you}} don't think he's handsome." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if it's these towns we've been {{passing that}} the farmers run to for relief from their bleakness----Can't <b>you</b> understand? <b>Just</b> <b>LOOK</b> <b>at</b> them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{because you}} don't use your eyes," [...] {{retorted}} Harry. [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> yonder rock ahead of us, {{and tell me}} what you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Smoke of life an' snakes of purgatory! Will <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that! Wood an' water an' grass an' a side-hill! A pocket-hunter's delight an' a cayuse's paradise! Cool {{green for}} tired eyes! Pink pills for pale people ain't in it. A secret pasture for prospectors and a resting-place for tired burros, by damn!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can I be so changed? Look at me. Or is it I who am mistaken?--Are you not, sir, Henry Roberts, {{forwarding}} merchant, of Wheeling, Pennsylvania? Pray, now, {{if you use}} {{the advertisement}} of business cards, and happen to have one with <b>you,</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, and see whether you are not the man I take you for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Peg Bowen doesn't need {{to catch}} {{you to do}} things to you," [...] said Peter ominously. [...] "She can put ill-luck on <b>you</b> <b>just</b> by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> you--and she will if you offend her." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Elma {{answered}} with bated breath, in almost inarticulate tones, [...] "Don't you see? Don't <b>you</b> see, mother? <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the judge! It's himself! It's Sir Gilbert!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, noble tars," [...] {{said the}} auctioneer, [...] "you may well stare at it; {{you will not}} find another jacket like this {{on either side of}} Cape Horn, I assure <b>you.</b> Why, <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it! How much, now? Give me a bid--but don't be rash; be prudent, be prudent, men; {{remember}} your Purser's accounts, and don't be betrayed into extravagant bids." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those are {{the kind}} of folks I {{practise}} among, good share of the time. Nels Erdstrom, fine clean young Svenska. He'll have a corking farm in ten years, but now----I operated his wife on a kitchen table, with my driver giving the anesthetic. Look at that scared baby! Needs some woman with hands like yours. Waiting for <b>you!</b> <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that baby's eyes, look how he's begging----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, of course. Here {{we are in}} a {{state where}} no licence is required, a {{minister}} in the house, and you all dressed in the most beautiful wedding silk imaginable. You must see, if <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it calmly, how much better it will be than going up to Mrs. Kemble's and thereby publishing your difference with Louisa to all the village. I'll give you fifteen minutes {{to get used to the}} idea and then I'll call Jim down." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{produced}} {{a letter from}} his pocket. 'Don't you bar chaps who show you their letters?' he said. 'This was written by an aunt of mine. I don't want to inflict the whole lot on <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> line four. You see what she says: [...] "A boy is coming to Mr Leicester's House this term, whom I particularly wish you to befriend. He {{is the son of}} a great friend of a friend of mine, and is a nice, bright little fellow, very jolly and full of spirits."' ...|$|E
2500|$|He was a {{guest on}} The Howard Stern Show on April 10, 2008; {{when he was asked}} if he would direct Ghostbusters III and cast Howard, he said [...] "Do you know how many times I get asked if I want to do Ghostbusters III? Looking at my career so far, I mean, if <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> my two films, I would make the most boring Ghostbusters movie. It would just be people talking about ghosts, there wouldn't be any ghost-busting in it." [...] Stern, a friend of Ivan Reitman, also {{revealed}} that he had seen Jason's early short films and was impressed enough to offer him the opportunity to direct an episode of Son of the Beach (a TV series he produced, a goofy parody of Baywatch), which Jason declined, citing that he was busy obtaining financing for Thank You for Smoking at the time.|$|R
5000|$|... "(It says) were (Nine is) {{not serious}} about news and current affairs. If {{you want your}} serious stuff go to the ABC ... Sunday {{is part of the}} Nine brand ... so <b>you</b> cant <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the bottom line ... Of course you have to make money, but how do you put a price on quality? ... I think, from a {{business}} point of view, its dopey, really dopey." ...|$|R
5000|$|London {{worked closely}} with St. Louis Rams {{defensive}} end Chris Long while he played for the Virginia Cavaliers. In an interview with The Washington Post, Long would later say of London, [...] "when you get a coach who matches your intensity and emotion, <b>you</b> can <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that person and know that at some level that coach {{is going to be}} with you through the thick and the thin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By gad, sir, I {{sometimes}} dream, now, {{that the}} Doctor's walking into me," [...] Foker continued (and Pen {{smiled as he}} thought that he himself had likewise fearful dreams of this nature). [...] "When I think of the diet there, by gad, sir, I wonder how I stood it. Mangy mutton, brutal beef; pudding on Thursdays and Sundays, and that fit to poison <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> my leader--did you ever see a prettier animal? Drove over from Baymouth. Came the nine mile in two-and-forty minutes. Not bad going, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did you {{slip away}} by stealth like this?" [...] said d'Urberville, with upbraiding breathlessness; [...] "on a Sunday morning, too, {{when people were}} all in bed! I only {{discovered}} it by accident, and I have been driving like the deuce to overtake <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the mare. Why go off like this? You know that nobody wished to hinder your going. And how unnecessary {{it has been for}} you to toil along on foot, and encumber yourself with this heavy load! I have followed like a madman, simply to drive you the rest of the distance, if you won't come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|Another {{thing that}} troubled Polly was her clothes, for, {{though no one}} said anything, she knew they were very plain; and now and then she wished that her blue and mouse colored merinos were rather more trimmed, her sashes had bigger bows, and her little ruffles more lace on them. She sighed for a locket, and, {{for the first time}} in her life, thought seriously of turning up her pretty curls and putting on a [...] "wad." [...] She kept these discontents to herself, however, after she had written to ask her mother if she might have her best dress altered like Fanny's, and {{received}} this reply: [...] "No, dear; the dress is proper and becoming as it is, and the old fashion of simplicity the best for all of us. I don't want my Polly to be loved for her clothes, but for herself; so wear the plain frocks mother took such pleasure in making for you, and let the panniers go. The least of us have some influence in this big world; and perhaps my little girl can do some good by showing others that a contented heart and a happy face are better ornaments than any Paris can give her. You want a locket, deary; so I send one that my mother gave me years ago. You will find father's face on one side, mine on the other; and when things trouble <b>you,</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your talisman, and I think the sunshine will come back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is trying}} to come between you and me, Elsa," [...] said Andor, {{who was trying to}} keep his violent rage in check. [...] "She tried to come between you and Béla, and chose an ugly method to get at what she wanted. She hates you [...] . . . why I don't know, but she does hate you, and she always tries to do you harm. Don't listen to her, I tell <b>you.</b> Why! <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her now! [...] . . . the girl is half mad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She works a {{great deal}} worse than little Blanche," [...] said Miss Winter, [...] "and though {{it may not be}} the fashion to say so in these days, I {{consider}} good needlework far more important than accomplishments. Well, then, Margaret, I should wish <b>you</b> only <b>just</b> to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her writing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Christoffer about Lars Von Trier: [...] "I {{think there}} are ten or twenty guys like him, who <b>you</b> <b>just</b> have to <b>look</b> <b>at.</b> He is one of those. I find his {{position}} as a very confrontational and controversial man kind of funny. To me he’s not controversial figure, he’s just a very interesting film maker".|$|R
50|$|The Three Sisters story {{claims that}} the sisters are three women who were turned to stone. One can {{see that as a}} false myth but, as a myth created by the invading colonial culture, it reveals {{underlying}} truths about petrifying the Aboriginal sisters and turning them into things <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Concerning {{controversial}} {{comments by}} former President of Harvard, Lawrence Summers, about mental {{differences between men}} and women, Mansfield said that it is [...] "probably true" [...] that women [...] "innately have less capacity than men at the highest level of science...It's common sense if <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> who the top scientists are".|$|E

2500|$|Kirwan {{shouldered}} {{much of the}} songwriting responsibility {{during this}} troubled and uncertain period for the band, through the changes in both the line-up and in musical style. The pressure showed in his health and he suffered problems with alcoholism; stories abound of Kirwan not eating for several days at a time, subsisting largely on beer. [...] He gradually became estranged from the other band members, and things {{came to a head}} during the autumn of 1972. Before a concert on that year's US tour, Kirwan and Welch rowed over tuning and Kirwan flew into a rage, banging his head and fists against the wall, then smashing his Gibson Les Paul guitar and refused to go onstage. Instead he watched {{while the rest of the}} band struggled through without him, and offered unwelcome criticism afterwards. Kirwan was sacked by Fleetwood, who had hitherto been the only other member still speaking to him. Fleetwood later said: [...] "It was a torment for him, really, to be up there, and it reduced him to someone who <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> and thought 'My God'. It was more a thing of, although he was asked to leave, the way I was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it was, I hoped, it was almost putting him out of his agony." [...] He later commented, [...] "I don't think he's ever forgiven me really." ...|$|R
2500|$|Special Operations Forces also {{assisted}} in this effort. The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment operated AH-6 helicopters {{from a large}} barge anchored at sea. A second platform was manned by Special Forces from Fort Bragg, piloting OH-58Ds. [...] "These things looked extremely sinister. They were all black and bristling with antennas and had a huge round sight module about two feet in diameter stuck on a mast above the rotor blades. ... The impression <b>you</b> got, <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{one of these things}} on the ground, was of a giant insect staring at you before you die", a Special Forces officer is quoted as saying.|$|R
5|$|She {{suffered}} from bulimia very badly. That's not, like, a revelation – <b>you</b> knew <b>just</b> by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her… She {{would have died}} eventually, {{the way she was}} going, but what really killed her was the bulimia… I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger.|$|R
50|$|In spring 2008 {{there was}} a {{retrospective}} of Koelewijn work at the De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art in Tilburg, entitled Loco Motion. The installation shown are linked to time without mercy and books, as carriers of knowledge, are uses as energy. The exhibition already starts at the square {{in front of the}} museum, where the artist confronts the audience with a mobile cinema but without the famous white cloth. Under music of Ennio Morricone <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a square and lined sac.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was just}} {{a lot of fun to}} work with the {{different}} people and make everyone comfortable. One of the times I couldn’t find the studio and I didn’t have GPS in my car, so I was trying to find it on my own. All kinds of stuff like that happened, but we got it done! At first you might go [...] "Oh, wow," [...] because you aren’t sure you can sing the song they picked, and then <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> each other and say, [...] "Oh, yeah." [...] You just have to cowboy up and make it right.|$|E
5000|$|... "Impatient" [...] is a pop ballad that {{explores the}} theme of {{difficult}} relationships, where one feels emotionally neglected but sticks around because they still have very strong feelings towards their partner. Abreu sings 'you say you listen but you never do' and 'you make me sad when I'm happy'. However, rather than be deluded, she is {{fully aware of the}} negativity the relationship is causing, but is unable to break away due to her love for her partner: 'still I go weak when <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me'. The song ends with Abreu providing a clear ultimatum: 'let me love...or let me be free'.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking with Bearded Gentlemen Music, Cope {{stated that}} the album cover was done by Sean Beaundry. Explaining the imagery of the scarab beetle, Cope stated [...] "I thought that it fit pretty well with this album, <b>you</b> know, <b>just</b> kinda <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it as scarabs {{basically}} being dung beetles that make things out of shit." [...] continuing, [...] "We kinda had a huge pile and we’re making an album out of it. There’s other symbolism like that on there as well." ...|$|R
40|$|This item {{includes}} {{a segment of}} an an instructor interview in a Writing Intensive course in Management at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The interview was conducted in 2013 and in this clip the interviewee is describing the class demographics. Brief excerpt from interview: Hawaii ʻis so unique, {{one of my students}} last semester was collecting data... in her Caucasian sample was the description of one of the participants as ʻhardcore localʻ...

[...] "To a woman you can love an' that loves <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> take a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Saxon there with the ukulele in her lap.
