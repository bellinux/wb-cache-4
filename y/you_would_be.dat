5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency. The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with {{a brief description of}} the products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase in which they would have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to lose, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E

25|$|In living {{specimens}} of N. sp. {{the base of}} the leaf is petiolate in the lower 4-5 cm with the leaf edges curled upwards. When pressed they are flattened and the leaf is narrowly lanceolate as in Danser's drawing of N. mollis. The leaf-sheathing on pressed plants of N. sp. is also flattened and looks decurrent instead. Without reference to a living plant <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> none the wiser. Could this be the same with Danser's N. mollis specimen? The degree of supposed leaf decurrence and the bracts on the pedicels can be explained by natural variation within the range of this species. There are enough high mountains between those that contain N. sp. (G. Lumarku, G. Murud, Meligan Range) in the northwest and N. mollis (G. Kemul) in the southeast to provide a link between the two.|$|E
25|$|The first Pro Spectacular was {{launched}} in Reno, Nevada on January 4, 1985. While a critical success, the racing was exciting with the ABA put on its usual show of efficiency and the pros generally liked the concept (although the track itself was too tight and ungroomed for their taste) and more than enough pros participated to make it interesting (the ABA dropped its vaunted Direct Transfer System and ran the qualifying motos three times just like the National Bicycle League). In an effort to enhance the awards, $10,000 purses for each race was offered. The winner of the Pro Spectacular series would win a Pontiac Trans Am, just like {{the winner of the}} ABA No. 1 pro plate for the year. The spectator attendance, which was the key, were lackluster. Despite the relatively low admission fee at $5.00, which was about the same as the racer's sign up fee at a local race and the heavy promotion the venues were, if not empty was well below seating capacity. At the first event held at the Lawlor Events Center of the University of Nevada in Reno, Nevada, only about 2,000 spectators were on hand in a facility that could seat 10,000. Many in the crowd were probably there for the standard National that was to be held the next day (those who signed up to race in the National the next day got a discount on the spectator's fee in the Pro Spectacular). Perhaps it was a losing situation from the start. Not enough people knew about the existence of BMX to care and bicycle racing of any type hasn't been big in the United States since the 1920s indoor track racing fad. In Europe by comparison capacity crowds fill venues and racers are front page news in Europe, even previously unknown BMX racers. The same was true for South America. As a comparison the 1983 International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) sanctioned World Championship held in Slagharen, the Netherlands drew an incredible (by US standards) 15 to 20,000 paying spectators and was televised live in Europe. In the US <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> lucky to get a mention in sports section of an American newspaper for any form of cycling outside of yearly reporting of the Tour de France, never mind a BMX race. It seems ironic that BMX was invented in the United States in light of the lackluster attitude of the public at large toward cycling. However, {{when you look at the}} fact that BMX wasn't so much derived from cycling but from kids imitating motocross racing then it is much more understandable why BMX was invented here. Still, it was cycling even if it was aping Motocross. In that light, despite the expensive 68 30 second TV advertisements shown on then popular programs like Magnum, P.I., Dynasty and Good Morning America, it was a steep uphill battle to win over the public. The light attendance most likely did not justify the reputed $4000 in television advertising the ABA invested. The most successful of the Spectaculars in terms of non racer attendance was the fifth round held in Phoenix, Arizona on February 8. Albeit a far cry from the 15 to 20,000 that came to see the IBMXF World Championship in the Netherlands, it did draw 2,600 paying spectators despite Phoenix's first snow fall in seven years. However, considering the cost of renting the arena with the deliberate lack of amateur involvement and hence their entrance fees it was a financial burden the ABA could ill afford. By the time of Land of Lincoln Pro Spectacular on April 28, the last in the series, they had dropped the TV advertisement campaign, as a result only a few dozen of spectators were on hand for the event at the Coliseum State Fair Grounds in Springfield, Illinois. To help defray the cost, the ABA started to run a few selected Amateur open classes to collect entry fees to offset at least partially the losses.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} both films outside of October, usually the month when studios {{released}} their quality horror films {{to capitalize on}} Halloween's approach, has actually led studios to rethink that approach and release horror films at other times of year.

500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For {{how is it that}} you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E

500|$|Rangel {{suggested}} that Andrew Cuomo's primary {{run in the}} 2010 gubernatorial election against incumbent David Paterson, {{who was the first}} African-American governor of New York, would undo years of work that Cuomo spent rebuilding his standing in the state Democratic Party after his bruising 2002 gubernatorial primary contest against Carl McCall, at the time the highest-ranking African-American and first major party candidate for governor in the state. Rangel had been a staunch supporter of McCall against Cuomo in 2002, even going as far as saying that he would not necessarily endorse Cuomo had he emerged as the Democratic nominee for governor. For the upcoming 2010 gubernatorial race, Rangel {{suggested that}} for the white Cuomo to challenge the African-American incumbent would not be [...] "the moral decision". [...] Rangel also said, [...] "There might be an inclination for racial polarization in a primary in the state of New York. Since we have most African-Americans registered as Democrats, and since <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> making an appeal for Democrats, it would be devastating in my opinion." [...] Paterson fared poorly in polls due to several scandals and later abandoned his campaign re-election. [...] By this point, Rangel's continuing difficulties, together with the death a few months prior of Percy Sutton and the failure of Paterson (Basil Paterson's son), marked the end of the era of Harlem's [...] "Gang of Four".|$|E
500|$|In 2007 the duo fronted the UK {{version of}} Apple Inc.'s [...] "Get a Mac" [...] adverts, with Mitchell playing PC. The adverts {{received}} much criticism. Writing in The Guardian, Charlie Brooker {{claimed that the}} use of Mitchell and Webb in the adverts was a curious choice. He compared the characters of PC and Mac in the adverts to those of Mark and Jeremy in Peep Show, stating that [...] "when you see the ads, you think, 'PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers.'" [...] The British Sitcom Guide also criticised the pair for [...] "selling their souls". One journalist called the adverts [...] "worse than not funny", and accused Mitchell and Webb of [...] "an act of grave betrayal" [...] for taking corporate work. In an interview with The Telegraph, Robert Webb responded to the duo's critics, stating that [...] "when someone asks, 'Do you want to do some funny ads for not many days in the year and be paid more than <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> for an entire series of Peep Show?' the answer, obviously, is, 'Yeah, that's fine.'" [...] In the same interview, Mitchell also said: [...] "I don't see what is morally inconsistent with a comedian doing an advert. It's all right to sell computers, isn't it? Unless you think that capitalism is evil– which I don't. It's not like we're helping to flog a baby-killing machine." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Sacrifice", {{the first}} song of the album, {{contains}} [...] "rumbling guitars" [...] and a string section according to IGNs Ed Thompson. The main theme of the song is recovery from an abusive relationship, which also inspired all of the songs on Fallen. Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian and Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said the song was written for Evanescence's former guitarist Ben Moody. [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] is a rock song that starts as a piano ballad before quickly becoming an alternative metal song that uses elements of nu metal, symphonic rock and pop music. Lee said she wrote the song for her ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan of South African alternative metal band Seether. Described as a [...] "chick anthem", the song's protagonist explains the reasons {{the relationship between the}} pair will not work through the lyrics [...] "Don't cry to me…If you loved me, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> here with me /...How could I have burned paradise? How could I…you were never mine". [...] "Weight of the World" [...] is a mixture of pop and metal, according to Stornoway Gazette. Inspired by the pressures of fame, it contains [...] "Eastern motifs" [...] and [...] "distorted vocals" [...] in the opening lines [...] "Feels like {{the weight of the world}} / Like God in heaven gave me a turn / Don't cling to me, I swear I can't fix you" [...] and in the chorus, [...] "If you love me, then let go of me / I won't be held down by who I used to be".|$|E
