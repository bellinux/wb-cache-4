5|$|Both Wessex's sudden rise {{to power}} in the late 820s, and the {{subsequent}} failure to retain this dominant position, have been examined by historians looking for underlying causes. One plausible explanation for the events of these <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Wessex's fortunes were to some degree dependent on Carolingian support. The Franks supported Eardwulf when he recovered the throne of Northumbria in 808, so it is plausible that they also supported Ecgberht's accession in 802. At Easter 839, not long before Ecgberht's death, he was in touch with Louis the Pious, king of the Franks, to arrange safe passage to Rome. Hence a continuing relationship with the Franks seems {{to be part of}} southern English politics {{during the first half of}} the ninth century.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of traffic police in some local departments, all police officers carry small firearms and batons. A criticism that has emerged in recent <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> police officers generally do not carry any nonlethal weapons aside from batons such as tasers or pepper spray, limiting their options when dealing with violent criminals. Police in Taiwan have sometimes been known to fire warning shots or at the legs of fleeing suspects, though this practice has reportedly decreased in recent years.|$|E
25|$|The next {{crisis was}} {{followed}} by the Berlin Wall construction on 13 August 1961, which had split the Berlin into east and west. The U2 was split into two sections, and for the north-south lines, trains were not allowed to stop for passengers and become Geisterbahnhöfe ("ghost stations"), patrolled by armed East-German border guards. Only at Friedrichstraße, a designated border crossing point, were passengers allowed to disembark. A further consequence over the <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most of the Berlin S-Bahn passengers boycotted the Deutsche Reichsbahn, and transferred to the U-Bahn with numerous expansion.|$|E

500|$|A popular {{image of}} Boone which emerged in later <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the backwoodsman who had little {{affinity}} for [...] "civilized" [...] society, {{moving away from}} places like Boonesborough when they became [...] "too crowded". In reality, however, Boone was a leading citizen of Kentucky at this time. When Kentucky was divided into three Virginia counties in November 1780, Boone was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Fayette County militia. In April 1781, he was elected as a representative to the Virginia General Assembly, which was held in Richmond. In 1782, he was elected sheriff of Fayette County.|$|E
500|$|Another {{proposed}} {{explanation for}} the events of these <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Wessex's fortunes were to some degree dependent on Carolingian support. The Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed {{at some time in}} the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious, {{the first of a series}} of internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. [...] These distractions may have reduced Louis's ability to support Egbert. [...] In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.|$|E

2500|$|An {{increasing}} trend, {{especially in}} recent <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> cable networks {{have become more}} opinion-driven during the daytime. [...] Fewer stories are covered but are done so with greater depth and opinion. [...] Panellists representing both sides of an issue appear during most newscasts to discuss them, especially on issues of a political nature. [...] Cable news networks also increasingly utilise newspaper reporters, particularly those affiliated with the New York Times and Washington Post to provide more details and offer their insights on top political stories.|$|E
2500|$|The TMAS {{scale was}} {{frequently}} {{used in the}} past, however, its use has declined over the years due to problems with the validity of this self-report measure. [...] Participants use their own judgement when answering questions, which causes internal and construct validity issues, which makes the interpretation of results difficult. Another possible reason this scale has declined in its use over the <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> researchers seemed to only get results of anxiety from participants under threat conditions and not under non-threat conditions, which again questioned the scale's validity.|$|E

2500|$|A {{folklore}} {{that has}} been passed down throughout the <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the Purple LSD lab.

[...] The product of their project, was dubbed [...] "Lloyd-grade" [...] LSD, to denote its extraordinary purity. The rumor goes {{that it was one of}} the largest sources of LSD at the time. [...] Nearly the entire senior class was expelled when the FBI invaded the house (only three seniors are mentioned in the yearbook from 1970), though folklore also holds that the perpetrators escaped capture, leaving only a teasing banner for the invaders reading [...] "Welcome, FBI!".|$|E
2500|$|The {{consideration}} that the Jubilee was identical with the seventh Sabbatical year solves the various practical problems, as also addressed by these authors. If the Jubilee were separate from, {{and following the}} seventh Sabbatical year, {{then there would be}} two fallow years in succession. Lefebvre points out, however, that there is no support in Scripture for two voluntary fallow years in succession, even though some have misinterpreted [...] as if this refers to a Jubilee year following a Sabbatical year, which is not the sense of the passage. Lefebvre shows that this cannot be the case because planting is mentioned for the eighth year; it is the year after a Sabbath, a year in which planting and harvesting resume. Another practical problem that would occur if the Jubilee cycle were 50 <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> after the first cycle, the Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles would be out of phase unless the seventh Sabbatical cycle was stretched to eight years. But Scripture gives no instructions for making such an adjustment. Instead, it is assumed that the two cycles will always be in phase so that the shofar can be sounded in the seventh year of the seventh Sabbatical cycle.|$|E

6000|$|The {{fundamental}} proposition {{which runs}} through the writings, which thus extend over a. of twenty <b>years,</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the common a priori doctrines and methods of reasoning about political and social questions are essentially vicious; and that argumentation on this basis leads, with equal logical force, to two contradictory and extremely mischievous systems, the one that of Anarchaic Individualism, the other that of despotic or Regimental Socialism. Whether I am right or wrong, I am at least consistent in opposing both {{to the best of}} my ability. Mr. Booth's system appears to me, and, as I have shown, is regarded by Socialists themselves, to be mere autocratic Socialism, masked by its theological exterior. That the [...] "fantastic" [...] religious skin will wear away, and the Socialistic reality it covers will show its real nature, is the expressed hope of one candid Socialist, and may be fairly conceived to be the unexpressed belief of the despotic leader of the new Trades Union, who has shown his zeal, if not his discretion, in championing Mr. Booth's projects.

60|$|Several {{families}} of the Highlands of Scotland anciently laid claim to the distinction of an attendant spirit who performed {{the office of the}} Irish banshie. Amongst them, however, the functions of this attendant genius, whose form and appearance differed in different cases, were not limited to announcing the dissolution of those whose days were numbered. The Highlanders contrived to exact from them other points of service, sometimes as warding off dangers of battle; at others, as guarding and protecting the infant heir through the dangers of childhood; and sometimes as condescending to interfere even in the sports of the chieftain, and point out the fittest move to be made at chess, or the best card to be played at any other game. Among those spirits who have deigned to vouch their existence by appearance of late <b>years,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of an ancestor of the family of MacLean of Lochbuy. Before the death of any of his race the phantom-chief gallops along the sea-beach near to the castle, announcing the event by cries and lamentations. The spectre is said to have rode his rounds and uttered his death-cries within these few years, in consequence of which the family and clan, though much shocked, were in no way surprised to hear by next accounts that their gallant chief was dead at Lisbon, where he served under Lord Wellington.|$|E
6000|$|... "One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} discoveries of recent <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the new catacomb in Rome, which lies some distance to the east of the well-known vaults of St. Calixtus. The finding of this important burial-place, which is exceeding rich in most interesting early Christian remains, is due to the energy and sagacity of Dr. Julius Burger, the young German specialist, who is rapidly taking the first place as an authority upon ancient Rome. Although the first to publish his discovery, it appears that a less fortunate adventurer had anticipated Dr. Burger. Some months ago Mr. Kennedy, the well-known English student, disappeared suddenly from his rooms in the Corso, and it was conjectured that his association with a recent scandal had driven him to leave Rome. It appears now that he had in reality fallen a victim to that fervid love of archaeology which had raised him to a distinguished place among living scholars. His body was discovered {{in the heart of the}} new catacomb, and it was evident from the condition of his feet and boots that he had tramped for days through the tortuous corridors which make these subterranean tombs so dangerous to explorers. The deceased gentleman had, with inexplicable rashness, made his way into this labyrinth without, as far as can be discovered, taking with him either candles or matches, so that his sad fate was the natural result of his own temerity. What makes the matter more painful is that Dr. Julius Burger was an intimate friend of the deceased. His joy at the extraordinary find which he has been so fortunate as to make has been greatly marred by the terrible fate of his comrade and fellow-worker." ...|$|E
