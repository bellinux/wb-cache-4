500|$|Lawson {{has stated}} that she {{believes}} cooking is [...] "a metaphor for life", {{in the sense that}} [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>cook,</b> you need structure [...] but just as importantly {{you need to be able}} to loosen up and go with the flow [...] you must not strive for perfection but, rather, acknowledge your mistakes and work out how you can rectify them". She has described cooking as [...] "a way of strengthening oneself", in the sense that [...] "being able to sustain oneself is the skill of the survivor".|$|E
500|$|The Nigella Bites series, {{which was}} filmed {{in her home}} in west London, was later {{broadcast}} on American television channels E! and Style Network. Lawson said of the US release, [...] "In the UK, my viewers {{have responded to the}} fact I'm trying to reduce, not add to, their burden and I'm looking forward to making that connection with Style viewers across the US". Overall, Lawson was well received in the United States. Those who did criticise her often suggested she was too flirtatious; a commentator from The New York Times said, [...] "Lawson's sexy roundness mixed with her speed-demon technique makes cooking dinner with Nigella look like a prelude to an orgy". The book of Nigella Bites became the second bestselling cook book of Christmas 2002 in America. The series was followed by Forever Summer with Nigella in 2002 on Channel 4, the concept being, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>cook</b> to make you still feel as though you're on holiday". Fellow food writer Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall condemned the conceit as [...] "cynical and reckless" [...] and referred to the book as Fuck Seasonality.|$|E
2500|$|Trained in {{her early}} years by her sister Susan, who {{ultimately}} became Women's World Champion, Judit Polgár was a prodigy from an early age. At age 5, she defeated a family friend without looking at the board. After the game, the friend joked: [...] "You are good at chess, but I'm a good cook." [...] Judit replied: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>cook</b> without looking at the stove?" [...] However, according to Susan, Judit was not the sister with the most talent, explaining: [...] "Judit was a slow starter, but very hard-working." [...] Polgár described herself at that age as [...] "obsessive" [...] about chess. She first defeated an International Master, Dolfi Drimer, at age 10, and a grandmaster, Lev Gutman, at age 11.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the months}} and years after Kraft's {{purchase}} of the Patriots, relations between Kraft and Parcells were increasingly strained. This was primarily due to a struggle over Parcells' authority over football operations. [...] Kraft wanted Parcells to yield some of his authority over personnel moves to a separate general manager. Parcells had effectively been the Patriots' general manager as well since his arrival, and {{was not interested in}} yielding authority that he had been granted over personnel when he was hired. [...] He famously complained that [...] "if they're gonna let <b>you</b> <b>cook</b> the dinner, they at least ought to let you shop for some of the groceries." [...] The conflict climaxed {{in the days leading up}} to the Super Bowl, with rampant rumors that Parcells would leave the Patriots after the season to take the vacant head coaching job with the New York Jets. Despite these distractions, the Patriots played the Packers close for much of the game, and actually took the lead briefly in the 2nd quarter. However, two long Brett Favre touchdown passes and a Super Bowl record 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by MVP Desmond Howard sealed New England's fate, with the Packers winning their 12th title, and third of the Super Bowl era, 35–21.|$|E
