[...] Especially at the beginning of our relationship, that long-distance thing was very frustrating. I also think it's easier for people to say things from a distance; it's safer." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Superpower" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Frank Ocean, Boots and Pharrell Williams with the latter also {{handling}} its production. The vocals in the track were produced by Beyoncé while additional production was finished by producer Boots. It was recorded in three studios: Jungle City Studios, Oven Studios and Mirrorbal Studios. Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, Beyoncé's former bandmates from the group Destiny's Child provided background vocals along with Stefan Skarbek and Boots. The audio mixing of [...] "Superpower" [...] was completed by Tony Maserati at Mirrorbal Studios and Clockworks Studios and the track was eventually mastered by Tom Coyne and Aya Merrill at Sterling Sound. Beyoncé explained on her iTunes Radio channel that she considered [...] "Superpower" [...] to be a [...] "powerful" [...] song with strong vocals; she went on saying, [...] "he lyrics that Frank Ocean wrote... it's like he thought of one thing and the thought just keeps going and going...

500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is what a person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>with</b> is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "{{somebody}} who {{taught me how to}} fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust in somebody who can give you faith and the belief that you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the affirmation of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency". Adams explained further; [...] "It's a sort of new love affair with an old story, devouring our celebrities and leaving them when we are done." ...|$|E

He was further accused of making the American coalition {{in the war on}} terrorism worthless and asked if he was ready for the consequences of his refusal, reminding him that George W. Bush had said: [...] "Either <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>with</b> us, or <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>with</b> the terrorists."

2500|$|Some argued Merezhkovsky's stance was {{inconsistent}} {{with his own}} ideas of some five years ago. After all, the Vekhi authors were trying to revitalize his own failed project of bringing the intellectual and the religious elites into collaboration. But the times have changed for Merezhkovsky and – following this (some argued, unacceptably scornful) anti-Vekhi tirade, his social status, too. Shied by both former allies and the conservatives, he was hated by the Church: Saratov bishop Dolganov even demanded his excommunication after the book Sick Russia [...] was published in 1910. For the Social Democrats, conversely, Merezhkovsky, not a [...] "decadent pariah" [...] any-more, suddenly turned a [...] "well-established Russian novelist" [...] and the [...] "pride of the European literature."

It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another [...] "major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day." [...] Final Fantasy II, is considered [...] "the first true Final Fantasy game", introducing an [...] "emotional story line, morally ambiguous characters, tragic events," [...] and a story to be [...] "emotionally experienced rather than concluded from gameplay and conversations." [...] It also replaced traditional levels and experience points with an activity-based progression system, where [...] "the more you use a skill, the better <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>with</b> it," [...] a mechanic that later appeared in SaGa, Grandia, Final Fantasy XIV, and The Elder Scrolls. Final Fantasy II also featured open-ended exploration, and had a dialogue system where keywords or phrases can be memorized and mentioned during conversations with NPCs, the theme of an evil empire against a small band of rebels (similar to Star Wars), and the iconic chocobo, a fictional creature inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.

[...] Schoolboy Q further commented on the album as he {{compared}} it to past releases including 2012's Habits & Contradictions and his independent debut, Setbacks.

[...] In addition to losing the need to compromise, Schoolboy Q hinted Oxymoron may boast a [...] "more comfortable Q." [...] While speaking exclusively with HipHopDX earlier in the year, the rapper shared a few words of advice for his fellow emcees as he touched on his increased comparability with music: [...] "I feel like all rappers, the more comfortable you are, the better your raps are gon' be.

[...] In September 2013, Schoolboy Q discussed how gang history would be included in his album: [...] "I've never said this in an interview," [...] Schoolboy Q {{said in an interview with}} Life+Times: [...] "This album is about me taking care of my daughter and Crip history from 1969 to present." ...|$|E
