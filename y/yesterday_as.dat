5|$|<b>Yesterday,</b> <b>as</b> my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E
500|$|Rock critic Robert Christgau, {{writing for}} Rolling Stone {{magazine}} in 2007, called Younger Than Yesterday [...] "the Byrds' first mature album, {{a blend of}} space-flight twang and electric hoedown infused with the imminent glow of 1967 yet underlined with crackling realism." [...] Critic John Nork gave the album a glowing review on the Analogue Planet website, calling it [...] "a scrumptious smorgasbord of eclectic musical styles and groundbreaking innovation", before concluding that [...] "in every sense, Younger Than Yesterday is an utterly brilliant album, arguably the Byrds' best."

500|$|As {{financial}} losses mounted, the B finally ceded the New YorkWashington {{market to}} the Pennsylvania Railroad altogether, discontinuing all passenger service north of Baltimore on Saturday, April 26, 1958, and bringing the venerable Royal Blue to an end. As the engineer {{was about to}} ease the locomotive's throttle open for the Royal Blue's final departure from Washington Union Station at 3:45p.m., the event was covered in a trainside remote broadcast by Edward R. Murrow on a CBS network See It Now television special. The train's 7:49p.m. arrival at Jersey City Terminal was met by news reporters from The New York Times, the New York Post, Life magazine and The Saturday Evening Post, on hand to cover the legendary Royal Blues demise. In an editorial the next day, the Baltimore Sun lamented {{the end of the}} Royal Blue, saying it [...] "may {{have been one of the}} most famous named trains in history". [...] The New York Times, in a [...] article accompanied by a photograph of train engineer Michael Goodnight bidding farewell to a 7-year old passenger, said [...] "It was a sad and simple story <b>yesterday</b> <b>as</b> the nation's oldest railroad discontinued its crack Royal Blue and its five other passenger trains...end sixty-eight years of continuous through service, operated in a gentlemanly fashion...a kind of ante-bellum, gracious way of life...and the reputation for very special service." ...|$|E
