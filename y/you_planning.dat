5000|$|The College Art Association {{holds an}} {{international}} conference in February every year. Special events and speakers are planned for the two conferences spanning CAA's centennial year in New York in 2011 and in Los Angeles in 2012. Approximately four to six thousand members attend, depending on the location, which alternates among major cities in various regions of the United States. The convention is {{the largest and most}} important of the year for makers and interpreters of visual art and visual culture; major university and many smaller college art and art-history departments interview candidates for teaching positions at the convention, although hiring occurs all year long. In addition to such job-placement activities, several hundred programs including presentations of papers and panel discussions on diverse topics (special sessions, forums, exhibitions, media presentations, governance meetings) and social events such as receptions and dinners hosted by academic art and art history departments and allied or affiliated organizations, as well as massive book exhibits located in one of the main hotel or convention center exhibition areas, fill the convention's four days from early morning through late evening.

However, although Wang was initially able to defeat Tian's subordinate Yang Sheng (楊晟), he was subsequently repelled by Man Cun (滿存), {{and was unable to}} advance. He thus became fearful that Zhu would punish him for his failures. Further, the eunuch Yang Fugong, who had succeeded Tian by this point (as Tian had fled to Chengdu to be under the protection of his brother Chen Jingxuan the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu)), issued a declaration that anyone who killed Zhu would be given Jingnan Circuit. Wang therefore decided to turn against Zhu. Around the new year 887, he returned to Chang'an without first receiving permission from Zhu. Zhu, in anger, summoned him, stating, [...] "You returned without permission. Are <b>you</b> <b>planning</b> to commit treason?" [...] Wang responded, [...] "I am not committing treason. I am trying to capture the treasonous Zhu Mei!" [...] He seized Zhu and executed him. Pei Che and Zheng Changtu escorted Li Yun and fled to Hezhong, hoping that Wang Chongrong would protect them, but Wang Chongrong instead executed Li Yun and arrested Pei and Zheng. Both Zhu's and Li Yun's heads were delivered to Xingyuan and presented to Emperor Xizong.|$|E
