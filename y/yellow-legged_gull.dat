25|$|The {{scientific}} and natural interest of this tiny group of islands {{lies in its}} marine biodiversity, its unique flora and many avian species that breed annually on its rock cliffs or use them on their stopover on normal migratory patterns. About 3% of the 9000 species of birds are marine species, the remaining are migratory species. The abundance of birds on the islands, at one time, made the islands an attractive hunting area for peoples of the region. At {{the end of the}} 19th century the German naturalist Ernst Schmitz noted that 20–22,000 Cory's shearwaters were hunted in September or October in the islands; the hunts continued until 1967. Madeiran expeditions to the islands were responsible for the killing of juvenile birds for food, while their down was used to stuff pillows and comforters. Presently the islands are home or stopover for: Cory's shearwaters (approximately 14,000), white-faced storm-petrel (12,000), Bulwer's petrel (500), North Atlantic little shearwater (500), Madeiran storm-petrel (1000), <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gull,</b> the roseate tern and Berthelot's pipit; which are subjects of annual scientific expeditions. Many of theses species are vulnerable to local predators, primarily from populations of brown rat and predatory bird species, like the <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gull,</b> which will consume both eggs and chicks (the white-faced storm-petrel and Bulwer's petrel are primarily susceptible). These islands also have many endemic fauna species, including local snails and the unique gecko Tarentola boettgeri bischoffi.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the plants}} that exist at Fajã dos Cubres the {{predominant}} species include, the sharp-pointed rush (Juncus acutus), along the lagoon, Queen Anne's lace (Daucus carota) and the Azorean spurge (Euphorbia azorica). The presence of estuary grasses (Ruppia maritima) within the lagoon is of great importance, since they were exceptional within the Azores (and only at this site). The fajã {{has a variety of}} typical marine flora and fauna, and its lagoon has become a natural refuge for diverse marine and migratory birds. Nesting birds include the Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus cachinnans atlantis) and the common tern (Sterna hirundo). In addition, annually, farmers bring cattle down to the fajã to graze. Although prohibited now, at one time fishing occurred in the lagoon, mostly mullet and anchovies, using netting techniques.|$|E

500|$|Adults {{and young}} are {{vulnerable}} to predation at the breeding colonies, their only defence being to spit oil. Petrels cannot breed on islands where rats have been introduced, and feral cats frequently kill these birds on Foula in the Shetland Islands. The American mink, a non-native species in Europe, is a strong swimmer, and can colonise islands up to [...] from the mainland. Natural predators of petrels and other seabirds include skuas and large gulls. The <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gull</b> is a particular problem in the Mediterranean, and great skuas were estimated to kill 7,500 petrels a year on St Kilda, an unsustainable number. Some great black-backed gulls on the Atlantic islands specialise in taking seabird chicks at night, and peregrine falcons hunt adults at sea. Localised predators include Eleonora's falcon on the Columbretes Islands and the nocturnal barn owl on the Balearics; a few owls can wipe out a colony. The little owl is also a predator of both adults and young where it occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Skopelos has {{a variety}} of fauna - {{including}} about 60 species of wild birds-native and migratory. There are several birds of prey, most common being the Eleonora's falcon (Falco Eleonorae), the European scops owl (Otus Scops) and the common buzzard (Buteo buteo). Also to be seen are kestrels, eagles, and vultures, and very obvious throughout the island is the hooded crow (Corvus cornix). Occasionally [...] grey herons and kingfishers and, more commonly, the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), the herring gull (Larus argentatus) and the <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus michahellis) are seen along the coast. Severe winter weather can temporarily introduce rarely seen mainland birds. In March 2007 the Municipal Authorities cleaned a wetland habitat near the town beach at the outlet to the sea of Skopelos' only permanently flowing stream. The area had been home to frogs and the birds that fed on them.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{coastal and}} some wetland areas, various water birds {{can come to}} {{contribute}} {{a large portion of}} both prey numbers and prey biomass. This may include more than 50 species of shorebird (from quite small sandpipers to the largest species of gull), more than 30 species of waterfowl, at least 10 species each of herons, 8 species of rails and any grebes or cormorants that are available.

Despite access to large seabird breeding colonies, almost all large bird species hunted in Norway, including large forest grouse in more inland areas, were apparently fully-grown adults and most water birds were caught while resting on open coastal waters. Eagle-owls in northwestern Poland, an area heavily dotted with lakes, relied on birds for about 64% of the diet, more than half of which were water birds. The main prey species there was the Eurasian coot, at nearly 15% of the prey numbers. [...] In Primorsky Krai in Russia, 53.2% of the food for the eagle-owls were made up of birds, predominantly water birds with the primary prey species being the [...] crested auklet (Aethia cristatella [...] ) (26.9%). In the Russian Far East, similarly, birds occupy up to 57.6% of the diet, a lion’s share of which are water birds. In this study, the grey red-backed vole and reed vole (Microtus fortis) were the most numerous identified individual species but in some years the extremely large Japanese cormorant (Phalacrocorax capillatus), at , were more numerous as prey than either vole. Water birds were found to be even more important in the diet in Korea, as in wetland habitat, with birds in general comprising 68.9% by number and 85.3% by biomass there, but in adjacent upland areas birds were slightly secondary to mammals, which made up 38.7% by number and 64.7% by biomass, led by the brown rat. [...] In Korea, the mallard and the similar spot-billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha) made up 38.1% of the biomass.

50|$|<b>Yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls</b> usually {{breed in}} colonies. Eggs, usually three, are laid from mid March to early May and are defended vigorously by this large gull.

40|$|The >Incubatory Reserves Constancy> {{hypothesis}} {{asserts that}} incubation {{could be a}} departure from breeding stress that allows for the maintenance or recovery of body reserves after laying effort (females) or territory defense (males) in those species with bi-parental incubation such as gulls.

Female gulls showed an increase in uric acid and cholesterol levels, whereas males showed only an increase in uric acid values throughout this period. Moreover, females increased while males maintained their body masses. These results could reflect a recovery process after the laying effort supporting the Incubatory Reserves Constancy hypothesis in females. Uric acid and urea levels are positively correlated to body condition in <b>Yellow-legged</b> <b>Gulls,</b> which could be the result of a change in diet composition. This disagrees with recent findings on body composition in incubating gulls and could be related to variations in food availability among populations or years, and could reflect flexibility in the investment devoted by each sex.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{pollution}} caused by severe anthropogenic {{pressure in the}} Mediterranean Sea, an important biodiversity hotspot, requires continuous research efforts. Sources of highly toxic chemicals such as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are misunderstood in representative Mediterranean species, which limits our capability to establish proper conservation strategies. In the present study, eggs of Audouin's and <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus audouinii and L. michahellis) were used to investigate the trophic sources, as measured by δ 13 C, δ 15 N, and δ 34 S, of legacy POPs, in particular, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) and non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (no-PCBs), as well as recently-regulated POPs, e. g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Special {{attention was paid to}} the usefulness of rarely-explored δ 34 S ratios in explaining POP exposure in wildlife, and δ 34 S was the isotopic ratio that best explained POP variations among gulls in most cases, thus demonstrating its usefulness for understanding POP exposure in wildlife. Significant relationships between stable isotope signatures and POP concentrations revealed increasing levels of no-PCBs and low halogenated PCDD/Fs and PBDEs in Mediterranean gulls as the consumption of marine resources increases. In contrast, highly chlorinated and brominated congeners appeared to preferentially accumulate in gulls feeding primarily on refuse from dump sites and terrestrial food webs. The use of suitable dietary tracers in the study of POPs in <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls</b> revealed the importance of dump sites as a source of POPs in Mediterranean seabirds, which has not previously been reported. In contrast, the preferential accumulation through marine food webs of low chlorinated PCCD/Fs and no-PCBs, which show the highest toxic equivalents factors (TEFs), led to a significantly greater toxicological concern in Audouin's as compared to <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls.</b> Audouin's gull exposure to POPs appears primarily related to the pelagic food webs commonly exploited by fisheries, highlighting the need for further research given the potential impact on human consumption...|$|R

40|$|Male {{and female}} {{offspring}} can {{differ in their}} susceptibility to pre-natal (e. g. egg quality) and post-natal (e. g. sib–sib competition) conditions, and parents can therefore increase their individual fitness by adjusting these maternal effects according to offspring sex. In birds, egg mass and laying/hatching order are the main determinants of offspring viability, but these effects can act differently on each sex. In a previous study, relatively large last-laid (c-) eggs of <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus michahellis) {{were more likely to}} carry a female embryo. This suggests compensatory allocation of maternal resources to daughters from c-eggs, which suffer reduced viability. In the present study, we supplemented <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls</b> with food during the laying period to experimentally test whether their nutritional conditions were responsible for the observed covariation between c-egg sex and mass. As predicted, food supplementation enhanced female c-eggs' mass more than that of male c-eggs. Thus, this experiment indicates that mothers strategically allocated their resources to c-eggs, possibly in order to compensate for the larger susceptibility of daughters to hatching (and laying) order. The results also suggested that mothers decided on resource allocation depending on the sex of already ovulated c-eggs, rather than ovulating ova of either sex depending on food availability...|$|R
50|$|The <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus michahellis), {{sometimes}} referred to as western <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gull</b> (to distinguish it from eastern populations of yellow-legged large white-headed gulls), is a large gull of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, which has only recently achieved wide recognition as a distinct species. It was formerly treated as a subspecies of either the Caspian gull L. cachinnans, or more broadly as a subspecies of the herring gull L. argentatus.The genus name is from Latin Larus which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird, and the species name honours the German zoologist Karl Michahelles.|$|E

40|$|Interactions between yellow-legged Larus cachinnans and Audouin´s Larus audouinii gulls and {{fisheries}} operating around the Chafarinas Islands, located 4. 5 km off the Moroccan Mediterranean coast, are reviewed. At the Chafarinas archipelago two distinct types of fisheries operate: trawlers and purse seines. Gulls {{take advantage of}} both fisheries. They scavenge trawler discards and congregate around shoals of fish attracted to the surface by the purse-seine lamps. When both trawlers and purse-seine boats are in operation, the diet of both gull species is similar, with epipelagic fish accounting for over 60 % of the biomass, partially collected {{in association with the}} purse-seine fishery. When only trawlers operated <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls,</b> but not Audouin´s gulls, augmented their diet mainly with human waste from refuse dumps, suggesting that competition for food between the two species is mainly limited to the periods when resources made available by fishery activities are abundant. Likewise, when only trawlers operated, there was an increase in the predation pressure on eggs and chicks of Audouin´s gulls. In particular, during the week of celebrations for the holy lamb festival when neither fishery operated, egg losses of Audouin´s gull increased dramatically, suggesting that severe food shortage caused by the cessation of fishing can result in an increased predation pressure by <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls,</b> affecting Audouin´s gull productivity. These results suggest a novel socio-ecological link between gulls, fisheries and local feasts...|$|R
40|$|European {{starlings}} (Sturnus vulgaris) {{are responsible}} for high rates of egg predation {{at one of the}} main colonies of the endangered roseate tern (Sterna dougallii) in the Azores archipelago. Control taste aversion has been effective in controlling raven predation in a colony of California least tern (Sterna antillarum browni), but there is little quantitative information about its efficacy on other species of predators taking eggs. We conducted a control taste aversion experiment on <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus michahellis) and European starlings eating eggs of terns in a mixed colony of common (Sterna hirundo) and roseate terns in the Azores. We treated quail (Coturnix coturnix) eggs with methiocarb and deployed them in artificial nests in the tern colony. On the first experiment, conducted before the terns laid eggs, predation rates on quail eggs by <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls</b> showed significant and rapid decrease after deployment of treated eggs. During the second experiment, after the terns had started laying, results were mixed. Although predation rates by European starlings on treated quail eggs decreased, predation rates on tern eggs did not. We conclude that control taste aversion using methiocarb-treated eggs is likely to reduce depredation by gulls but not starlings because of the need to pre-train the birds and the tendency of starlings to be attracted by the movement of adults, not the presence of nests. 2006 Springer-Verla...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. —Ringing of <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls</b> Larus michahellis michahellis begun inAlgeria in 2009, {{the first}} scheme {{of its kind}} in North Africa. Ringing of chicks was {{initiated}} at Skikda and extended a year later to four other colonies located along theAlgerian coast. Preliminary analysis of observations of ringed <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls</b> from Algerian colonies indicates that juveniles dispersed in a north-westerly direction to the Balearic Sea and the Bay of Biscay, and westwards to the Alborán Sea and the IberianAtlantic coast from Cádiz Bay to Galicia. Preliminary results suggested two distinct routes: gulls from the eastern Algerian colonies moved N/NW to eastern Spain and overland to the Bay of Biscay, a pattern of dispersal previously reported for birds from Spanish and French western Mediterranean colonies. Juveniles from western colonies seemed to move N/NW to theAlborán Sea and Cádiz Bay. In Spain, to where most dispersal occurred, the data suggests thatAlgerian gulls summered at coastal areas before returning to North Africa in late autumn and winter.

A NDM- 1 -producing Salmonella Corvallis was reported in 2013 in a wild raptor. Further research was needed to understand the role of wild birds in the transmission of bacteria resistant to carbapenems. Our aim was to investigate the presence of carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli in gulls from southern France. In 2012, we collected 158 cloacal swabs samples from two <b>gull</b> species: <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus michahellis) that live in close contact with humans and slender-billed gulls (Chroicocephalus genei) that feed at sea. We molecularly compared the carbapenem-resistant bacteria we isolated through culture on selective media with the carbapenem-susceptible strains sampled from both gull species and from stool samples of humans hospitalized in the study area. The genes coding for carbapenemases were tested by multiplex PCR. We isolated 22 carbapenem-resistant E. coli strains from <b>yellow-legged</b> <b>gulls</b> while none were isolated from slender-billed gulls. All carbapenem-resistant isolates were positive for bla(VIM- 1) gene. VIM- 1 -producing E. coli were closely related to carbapenem-susceptible strains isolated from the two gull species but also to human strains. Our results are alarming enough to make it urgently necessary to determine the contamination source of the bacteria we identified. More generally, our work highlights the need to develop more bridges between studies focusing on wildlife and humans in order to improve our knowledge of resistant bacteria transmission routes...|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{differential}} amplitude of climatic oscillations, species living at northern latitudes {{are subject to}} more frequent and more severe range oscillations than species at southern latitudes. As a consequence, northern populations should, on average, be phylogenetically younger and possess less phylogeographical structure than closely related taxa further south. To test these predictions, we studied the mitochondrial-genetic population structure of NW Palearctic Lesser Black-backed Gulls (Larus fuscus group [= LBBG], five taxa) breeding at temperate to boreal latitudes from Iceland to the Taimyr Peninsula.
