60|$|MARGARET. Shut up, Daddy. (She waggles her head, {{and down}} comes her hair.) Daddy, I know what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> of. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> what a handful {{she is going}} to be.|$|E
60|$|LADY MOGTON [Contemptuously.] <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> of him, {{and not of}} the cause.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What had <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> of? In {{these days}} of faith-cures, and hypnotism, and telepathy, and subliminalities--why, the simple old world grows very confusing. But rarely, very rarely novel. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking,</b> <b>you</b> say; do you remember, perhaps, just the drift?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No. And <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not <b>thinking</b> of yourself, either, I suppose,” I said.

60|$|MARGARET (surveying {{him from}} another angle). Now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> about--about my {{being in love}} some day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Absurd, Blanche! <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> of runaway matches, {{and making}} Scotland {{responsible}} for the difficulties of people who daren't own the truth!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honest?" [...] echoed Rose, sadly, [...] "honest?--ah, Louis! I know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> disparagingly of Charles's convictions, {{when you}} speak so of his mother's." ...|$|E
60|$|MITCHENER. May I {{ask what}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking,</b> Mrs. Farrell? This {{suspense}} is awful.|$|R
30|$|In {{the space}} below please {{tell us what}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> about when <b>you</b> zoned out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> of me, anyhow. I am glad of it. Do you know, {{it seems}} to me, somehow, that if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to stop <b>thinking</b> of me I shouldn't be {{in the world at}} all!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are looking}} at me, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> of something," [...] she said, with her strange breathless rapidity of utterance. [...] "What is it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... ‘And I don’t believe <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> of {{anything}} in the world,’ said I—which put a period to his respectable conversion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly {{the sort}} of love <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> of comes afterwards;--when the {{interests}} of two people are the same. Frank was very well as a lover." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of a new}} house,” {{said the}} lawyer, “here is the card of a new architect, of whom they tell me great things.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very serious,--but it is {{no trouble}} {{of the kind of}} which <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking.</b> But it is serious enough to take up every thought." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I don't believe <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> of {{anything}} in the world," [...] said I--which put a period to his respectable conversion.|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered, [...] "I do not {{remember}} those days. They {{do not belong to}} me. It is some other woman <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so. And it {{is because}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> of all this, that I feel it right to tell you. Papa, I shall never be married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{contradict}} me," [...] she interrupted {{in a full}} steady voice. [...] "That's what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> of {{half the}} day, and dreaming about all the night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How could I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking?</b> Heaven knows I didn't dream {{of such a}} thing! Though I remember, now, your saying"-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Aha!" [...] he said, [...] "I {{begin to}} understand. It {{is a matter}} of {{business}} this. So <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> of taking this restaurant, eh?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What can <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> of, Gwen?" [...] said Mrs. Davilow, {{relieved}} in {{the midst}} of her wonderment by signs of alacrity and better humor.|$|R
