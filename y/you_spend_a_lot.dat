5000|$|Another {{specialized}} application {{space of}} agent-assisted automation goes under numerous headings including outbound prospecting, cold calling, solicitation, fund-raising, etc. Turnover is high among agents {{engaged in this}} kind of work because the task is tedious and emotionally difficult. It is tedious because you spend the bulk of your day, not talking to qualified leads, but in getting wrong numbers and answering machines. As good and as ubiquitous as predictive dialing technology has become, it still makes a lot of mistakes because the phone number inputs are outdated. It is emotionally difficult work because, beyond the tedium, <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time hearing the word “No!”, getting hung-up on, and cussed at. The pre-recorded audio allows you to dispense with wrong numbers and answering machines while you move onto the next call. Agents can easily handle two or three overlapping calls, an immediate productivity hit. Additionally, agents using the technology don’t seem to take the gruff treatment as personally. They report that it feels as if the customer is saying “no” to the software, not to them. Finally, contribution amounts and conversion rates can be improved by adding some intelligence into the scripts, for example by raising and lowering the initial contribution amount based on the wealth of the area you are calling into or using pre-recorded audio with different accents, Southern when calling in the South, for example. Another benefit of the technology is that it enables the work to be done by lower cost agents in offshore locations.|$|E

40|$|Regardless {{of who you}} are or {{what you}} do, chances are <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time racing the clock, {{worrying}} about getting everything done, and feeling out of control. A recent Gallup poll found that 40 percent of Americans feel stressed every day and another 39 percent are sometimes stressed. Most people don’t have a good handle on their stress. They focus on the unpleasant, and usually unexpected things that happen daily. That’s not just stress, it’s life. There is a major difference between stressors—those things that happen every day that have the potential for driving us crazy, or making us angry, frustrated, and hurt—and stress, the way we choose to respond to these stressors. You make a choice about how situations will affect the rest of your day. Why not make humor choices and practice them every day? Humor Makes Life Easier Humor can be a powerful and effective mechanism for coping with stress, especially when combined with other means of stress reduction. The real power of humor and laughter shows up when you learn to use it under stress. It keeps things in perspective, helps dispel negative emotions, and puts you in a frame of mind that can help you better cope with the situation. Combining stress management techniques with a humorous outlook on life won’t make you stress-proof, but it can make the bad things easier to endure. If you’re willing to laugh at the little disasters in life, you’ll find that other areas of your life will also become easier. Laughter, especially when you laugh at yourself, does many important things: • It empowers you. When you laugh at your setbacks, you no longer feel sorry for yourself. You feel uplifted and encouraged. • It helps you communicate more effectively. • It makes you more likeable. • It helps you cope. “Nothing erases unpleasant thoughts more effectively than concentration on pleasant ones. ” (Hans Selye, stress researcher) • It provides perspective by removing you from your problems. Everyone makes mistakes, and we need to remember that, “I may not be totally perfect, but parts of me are excellent. ” (Ashleigh Brilliant) • People tend to be less threatened by you...|$|E

40|$|Upland rice Cue: In upland {{areas of}} The Gambia, rice farmers {{traditionally}} plant their crop by broadcasting, or scattering the seed onto the fields. However, although being a quick method of planting, broadcasting creates problems once the crop has grown, {{as it is}} difficult to weed the randomly spaced plants except by hand pulling. Hence upland rice farmers in The Gambia are now being encouraged to plant their rice in rows, using where possible, animal drawn implements. These can save considerable time, and are more affordable for smallholder farmers than chemical means of weed control, as Mr. Abdulie Bojang, Head of The Gambia?s Agricultural Communication Unit recently explained to Ismaila Senghore. Ismaila began the interview by asking what basic rules should be emphasised when discussing control of weeds. IN:		?One, we emphasise timeliness ? OUT:		?do the operation on time [...] ? DUR?N		 3 ? 46 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr. Bojang of The Gambia?s Agricultural Communication Unit encouraging upland rice farmers to take advantage of animal traction in weeding their crop. Transcript Bojang	One, we emphasise timeliness. If you don?t weed on time you will find it difficult to control your weeds and you may find that <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time using whether even mechanical or even manual labour to control those weeds. So one important thing is timing of operations. Once you start your planting early, the likelihood is that you may weed early and once you weed early, the thing is you have given the crop the chance to grow vigorously {{and to be able to}} resist any attack either by weeds or by other pests that may come into the field. Senghore	Now when it comes to specific recommendations what kind of weed control would you recommend for rice production in the Gambia? Bojang	For rice production in the Gambia there are two specific control methods that we do recommend. One is the use of ox-drawn equipment to control weeds in the rice crop because quite a number of farmers, most of them do have this equipment. And if they plant the rice in rows particularly in the uplands they will be able to use that equipment to weed between the rows. This is very easy in the sense that, one, it saves the farmer the time that he spends uprooting weeds from his field; two, it is also easy for the farmer to apply fertiliser and then incorporate the fertiliser into the soil for efficient use by the crop. Thirdly it also helps the farmer to actually be able to control other pests in the field which is very very essential. Because if you not plant your crop in rows it will be very difficult to keep that field weed free. And we all know that other insect pests are harboured by weeds and if there are so many weeds in your field the likelihood is that the crop would also be highly susceptible to pest attack. Senghore	Now apart from hand picking the weeds in the field and using hoes and animal traction, are there other methods of weed control in rice crops? Bojang	Yes another method of weed control in rice crop is the use of herbicide which could either be pre-emergence or post emergence herbicide. This technology has been widely used in the lowlands. The upland farmers are also trying to apply the technology whereby it will save them time, energy and also, to have time for other activities in other crops that they grow in the wet season. And actually the only disadvantage or the only bottleneck in herbicide application is the cost of herbicide. It is very expensive for most farmers to buy and then apply on their field. But it?s a technology which, when adopted, can save the farmer at least 40 days without weeding his field. Senghore	In other words if you had to give advice to rice producers in other parts of the Third World maybe even similar conditions to The Gambia, you will tell them to go for the methods that they can afford? Bojang	Yes this is very important. This is why we actually advise them to go for these animal drawn equipment because even if you don?t have the equipment yourself either your next door neighbour or maybe one of your relatives may have which can be hired or borrowed and then you can do the operation on time. End of track. Mr. Bojang, Head of The Gambia?s Agricultural Communication Unit, encourages upland rice farmers to take advantage of animal traction, as a cost effective way of controlling weeds and carrying out other field operations...|$|E
500|$|In the {{behind the}} scenes video {{published}} by HBO following the airing of the fifth and sixth episodes, Benioff described Bran's visions {{at the beginning of}} the episode as being something that was put together very precisely and purposefully, noting [...] "Even though some of those images flash by in just a fraction of a second each of them was very carefully chosen. And the Mad King was probably the most dramatic of those because we've been hearing about the Mad King from the very beginning of the show, but he's never appeared on screen before.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, the Mad King is described as having long, unkempt hair and beard, with nine inch long fingernails. The show's version portrayed his look in a more tidy fashion, with David Rintoul playing the role of the Mad King.|$|R

40|$|This article explores ways {{in which}} the {{connectivity}} that enables the knowledge economy also constrains it. Knowledge economies prosper through inventing processes that save energy, time, and money. But the conception of the ideas that translate into these processes is time intensive. The paradox of invention is that <b>you</b> need to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time in order to save even more time. Creative thinking is a solitary activity that requires focus over time and insulation from distraction. However, the continual distractions and demands of a highly connected world can mean that we are both victims and perpetrators of the theft of time. Research shows that the typical information worker today is interrupted on average every eleven minutes. In contemporary organizations requests for information and demands for reporting escalate remorselessly, leaving little time for inventiveness. In the rich world time has become by far the scarcest factor of production, due in part to improved connectivity.

It is very common today to hear about a security firm or group discovering a new flaw in some application, or better yet detect a new virus or exploit in it's infancy and help take actions to squash it before it gets out of hand. While it is not realistic to believe that all malicious code and actions can and will be corrected immediately as they come out, but there are actions that everyone on the Internet can take to help make the Internet a safer place to surf. The content of this paper will explain how to configure a few different firewall systems for your home computer, then take the output of those firewalls and actually show how someone can easily analyze and understand the generated log files, and finally how to get involved with a couple of organizations of the Internet community by participating in Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems.

5000|$|The Suda {{gives an}} account of Eusebia's {{apparent}} conflict with Leontius, bishop of Tripolis, Lydia on the latter's entry. [...] "Once when a council was held, and Eusebia the wife of Constantius was puffed up by a swelling of self-esteem and treated with reverence by the bishops, he alone stayed at home treating her with indifference. But she feeling overheated in her passions and inflamed in her sentiment, sent to him, begging and flattering him with promises, saying, “I will build a very great church for <b>you</b> and will <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money on it, {{if you come to}} me.” But he replied, “If you wish to accomplish any of this, O empress, know that you will not benefit me more than your own soul. But if you wish me to come to you, so that the respect due to bishops may be preserved, let me come to you, but do you descend at once from your lofty throne and meet me and offer your head to my hands, asking for my blessing. And then let me sit down, but do you stand respectfully, and sit only when I bid you, when I give the signal. If you accept this, I would come to you; but in any other way, you cannot give so much nor be capable of such great deeds that we, neglecting the honor due to the bishops, would do violence to the divine order of priesthood.” When this message was reported to her, she swelled up in her soul, not considering it endurable to accept such words from Leontios. Swelling with great anger and filled with emotion and making many threats from a woman’s passionate and shallow disposition and describing situation to her husband, she urged him to vengeance. But he instead praised the independence of Leontios' judgment and rebuked his wife for her anger and sent her away to the women’s quarters." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{scenario}} {{highlights the}} mismatch of expectations that can arise in a mentoring {{relationship between a}} graduate student and a research adviser. The adviser wants a solely professional relationship, but the student seeks a more personal relationship. Their inconsistent desires lead to inconsistent expectations about how long they should meet and what they should discuss, and subsequently to misunderstandings about the preliminary results. Some {{of the problems in}} this scenario could have been avoided had the adviser and student negotiated mutual expectations and responsibilities when they first began working together. In general, a professor and student should agree on expectations, such as how frequently they would meet, and how quickly the professor would review the student’s draft manuscripts. They should update these expectations periodically. As the student matures from apprentice to colleague, the student should take increasing responsibility for the direction of the research, and the professor should shift from providing technical advice to guiding the student in professional networking and in career preparation. A professor should recognize that different students need different amounts and kinds of guidance at different years of their studies. 	The ideal mentoring relationship is both personal and professional: a mentor is more than an adviser but less than a friend. Besides providing technical and professional advice, a mentor should instruct the student in the norms in the discipline, such as how colleagues should interact with each other, and in the standards of research practice, such as how research data should be managed. A mentor should advocate for the student by recommending the student for fellowships and awards, by introducing the student to researchers at other institutions, and by helping the student find professional employment, including postdoctoral and faculty positions. As in any close interpersonal relationship, conflicts in the mentoring relationship are inevitable. A professor and student may disagree over the inclusion of co-authors on a paper, or over the interpretation of experimental results. Students can feel inhibited from honestly expressing serious disagreements because professors hold great power over their advancement. Rarely can a single professor provide all of the advice that a graduate student needs to develop professionally. The student should therefore find multiple senior mentors. In addition, the student can benefit from the diversity of perspectives of multiple mentors. This role-play scenario illustrates a common situation in which each person starts with only partial information: the professor does not know that the preliminary results were actually only anticipated results, and the student does not know that the professor is annoyed by the student’s lack of focus on technical work. To ensure that each person receives complete information, the professor and student must communicate openly: the student should convey the bad news about the results clearly, and the professor should criticize the student’s behavior constructively. But the situation is risky because each person will be disappointed by the other’s information. To communicate in a risky situation (Patterson et al., 2002), each person should first state the facts and his or her own interpretation of the facts, then invite the other’s interpretation. Each person should use tentative language. Each should listen carefully to the other, asking questions for clarification. The professor might say, “I notice that <b>you</b> are <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time organizing social events. (States facts.) I am concerned that you do not seem committed to the research project and developing independence. (Shares personal tentative interpretation.) How do you see the situation?
