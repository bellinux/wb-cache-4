5|$|The {{trivalent}} dysprosium ion (Dy3+) {{has been}} studied due its downshifting luminescence properties. Dy-doped <b>yttrium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnet</b> (YAG:Dy) excited in the ultraviolet region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region.

5|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the green}} part of the spectrum are widely available {{to the general public}} {{in a wide range of}} output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared laser diode at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped <b>yttrium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnet</b> (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm ("green"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501nm to 543nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium–neon laser (543nm), the Argon-ion laser (514nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521nm and 531nm), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control.|$|E
25|$|<b>Yttrium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnet</b> (YAG), Y3Al2(AlO4)3, is {{used for}} {{synthetic}} gemstones. Due to its fairly high refractive index, YAG {{was used as a}} diamond simulant in the 1970s until the methods of producing the more advanced simulant cubic zirconia in commercial quantities were developed. When doped with neodymium (Nd3+), these YAl-garnets may be used as the lasing medium in lasers.|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{techniques}} and suitable apparatus for producing single crystals of rare earth and yttrium gallium and iron garnets, {{according to the}} flux technique of Nielsen, are described. A similar method {{has been shown to}} be successful in producing single crystals of rare earth and <b>yttrium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnets,</b> and an improved melt composition has been discovered. A number of crystals of yttrium and lutecium gallium and <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnets</b> doped with various concentrations of other rare earth and paramagnetic ions have been prepared for resonance and spectroscopic work. In addition, the pure rare earth gallium garnets from gadolinium to ytterbium inclusive, as well as neodymium, and the <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnets</b> from gadolinium to ytterbium inclusive have been obtained as single crystals. Methods for producing polycrystalline garnet samples are reviewed, and a satisfactory and convenient way of preparing pure and doped polycrystalline <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnet</b> samples developed. In particular, a number of small samples of dysprosium <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnet</b> (DAG) doped with various impurities was made. Large polycrystalline blocks of yttrium, neodymium, erbium and ytterbium gallium. and yttrium, dysprosium, terbium holmium and erbium <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnets</b> were prepared for specific heat samples, but the conditions necessary for sintering to a highly compact form were not discovered in every case. Samples of praseodymium gallium garnet and dysprosium aluminate (DyAlO 3) were prepared in a similar way. The possibility of using the Verneuil flame fusion technique for preparing single crystals of dysprosium <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnet</b> is discussed, and various attempts described. The paramagnetic susceptibilities of all the pure rare earth garnets mentioned, and of some of the dilute samples, were measured in the liquid hydrogen and helium temperature ranges, and the experimental method is discussed in some detail. The results are considered with respect to the paramagnetic resonance measurements made on the 'doped' crystals, and with respect to the effects of crystal field splittings upon the rare earth ions. A historical survey of the experiments performed upon DAG is given, together with the theories and motives inspiring them. The effects of impurities on the susceptibility of DAG, and the anomalous a. e. and d. c. susceptibility effects observed in DAG samples in different physical states are described and discussed, and tentatively regarded as 'super-paramagnetism'. The susceptibility of a sphere of single crystal DAG was very carefully measured, and shown to undergo an antiferromagnetic transition at 2. 49 Â°K. Using crystallographic data on the garnets, end resonance results on Dy in <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnets,</b> the sublattice ordering below the transition is deduced. Specific heat measurements on DAG are reported, and the results after correction confirm the sublattice ordering and transition temperature deduced from the susceptibility measurements. The magnetic moment of an oriented spherical single crystal of DAG has been measured as a function of strength end angle of applied magnetic field, end these results are shown to accord with the deduced sublattice ordering arrangement. Depending upon the direction of the applied field, one, two or three of the antiferromagnetic sublattices are forced to become ferromagnetic in a sufficiently high field below the transition temperature. The observed magnetisations are compared with expected values deduced from crystallographic and resonance work. A method for working single crystals of garnet into a sphere is described, together with an orientation procedure using x-ray back reflection photographs, and the anisotropy of the magnetisation with angle. The magnetic properties of various oxygen-europium phases have been investigated at liquid nitrogen, hydrogen and helium temperatures. The reported ferromagnetism of EuO has been confirmed, but the published Curie temperature, extrapolated from magnetic moment measurements. has been corrected from 77 to 69 Â°K by direct observation. A phase previously thought to be Eu 16 O 21, or Eu 3 O 4 has been tentatively identified as Eu 2 SiO 4, and shown to undergo a ferromagnetic transition between 4. 2 and 14 Â°K, conclusions very recently vindicated by magnetic moment and other measurements on Eu 2 SiO 4. The compound Eu 3 O 4 has a magnetic transition between 4. 2 and 14 Â°K but the susceptibility measurements do not show unambiguously whether this is to ferro- or antiferromagnetism. The magnetic properties at higher temperatures are very unusual, and are probably to be explained by the presence of 1 % of EuO as impurity in the sample. Eu 2 O 3, in accordance with expectation seems to be almost diamagnetic. DyAlO 3 has been shown to undergo an antiferromagnetic ordering transition at 3. 4 Â°K while Dy 2 O 3 remains paramagnetic to the lowest temperatures measured. The susceptibilities of GdI 3 and TbF 4 have been measured at liquid helium and hydrogen temperatures, and their chemical purities deduced from the results. The susceptibilities of GdOF, DyOF, NdOF and ErOF are reported, and the expected general similarities of their behaviour with the corresponding garnets discussed. GdOF and DyOF both appear to undergo antiferromagnetic ordering, though the results for GdOF are not unambiguous. The susceptibilities parallel with, and perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis of lanthanum nickel and lanthanum manganese nitrates have been carefully measured. </p...|$|R

25|$|HMFGs were {{initially}} slated for optical fiber applications, because the intrinsic losses of a mid-IR fiber could in principle {{be lower than}} those of silica fibers, which are transparent only up to about 2 μm. However, such low losses were never realized in practice, and the fragility and high cost of fluoride fibers made them less than ideal as primary candidates. Later, the utility of fluoride fibers for various other applications was discovered. These include mid-IR spectroscopy, fiber optic sensors, thermometry, and imaging. Also, fluoride fibers can be used for guided lightwave transmission in media such as YAG (<b>yttrium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnet)</b> lasers at 2.9 μm, as required for medical applications (e.g. ophthalmology and dentistry).|$|E
25|$|Laser vitreolysis is a {{possible}} treatment option {{for the removal of}} vitreous strands and opacities (floaters). In this procedure an ophthalmic laser (usually a <b>yttrium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnet</b> (YAG) laser) applies a series of nanosecond pulses of low-energy laser light to evaporate the vitreous opacities and to sever the vitreous strands. During this process, the laser energy evaporates the collagen and hyaluronin molecules to form a gas. (It {{is important to note that}} the laser energy applied during vitreolysis treatment does not simply break the floater into smaller pieces. Instead, the laser energy converts the floater material to a gas, which is then absorbed into the eye.)

25|$|Although {{a number}} of {{artificial}} garnets were successfully grown, only two became important as diamond simulants. The first was <b>yttrium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>garnet</b> (YAG; Y3Al5O12) in the late 1960s. It was (and still is) produced by the Czochralski, or crystal-pulling, process, which involves growth from the melt.
