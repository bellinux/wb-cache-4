In the next century, the Karankawa Indians arrived, and were present when Europeans came ashore.|$|E

5|$|During the Paleozoic era, {{the western}} part of what would become North America was near the equator and on a passive margin. The Cambrian Explosion of life took place over about 15million years {{in this part of the}} world. Climate was warm and invertebrates, such as the trilobites, were abundant. An ocean started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550million <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>As</b> its {{shoreline}} moved east, the ocean began to concurrently deposit the three formations of the Tonto Group.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, {{the canyon}} likely {{originated}} millions of <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> {{the result of}} San Diego Creek cutting through the San Joaquin Hills. Uplift diverted that stream to its present course, leaving Laguna Canyon as a wind gap.

A majority of the canyon is located within the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park; small portions are part of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park and the cities of Irvine, Laguna Beach, Laguna Woods and Aliso Viejo.|$|E
5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started {{to dry up}} about 10,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E

5|$|Paleontology lies on {{the border}} between biology and geology, but differs from {{archaeology}} in that it excludes the study of anatomically modern humans. It now uses techniques drawn {{from a wide range of}} sciences, including biochemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life, almost all the way back to when Earth became capable of supporting life, about 3.8 billion <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>As</b> knowledge has increased, paleontology has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental history, such as ancient climates.|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{was formed}} {{approximately}} 4.5billion <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>As</b> it cooled and a crust and oceans formed, its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by hydrogen to one composed mostly of methane and ammonia. Over the next billion years, the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into {{a mixture of}} carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor. These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth's surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat. There were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of reducing and oxidizing gasses that {{set the stage for}} primitive ecosystems to evolve and, in turn, the atmosphere also evolved.|$|E
5|$|The Willamette River basin {{was created}} {{primarily}} by plate tectonics and volcanism and was altered by erosion and sedimentation, including some related to enormous glacial floods as recent as 13,000years ago. The initial trough-like configuration was created about 35million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> a forearc basin while the Pacific Plate subducted beneath the North American Plate. Marine deposits {{on top of}} older volcanics underlie the valley, which was initially part of the continental shelf, rather than a separate inland sea. About 20 to 16million years ago, uplift formed the Coast Range and separated the basin from the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

Puerto Rico's transformation from a dry savanna environment to its present moist, forested state led to mass extinctions, especially of the vertebrate fauna. Around this time, the Puerto Rican Bank—a single landmass comprising the archipelago of Puerto Rico (except for Mona, Monito and Desecheo) and the Virgin Islands (except for St. Croix)—became separated. The Puerto Rican Bank has never been connected to its closest eastern bank, St. Maarten.|$|E

5|$|Ireland's {{geologic}} history covers {{everything from}} volcanism and tropical seas {{to the last}} glacial period. Ireland was formed in two distinct parts and slowly joined together, uniting about 440 million <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>As</b> a result of tectonics {{and the effect of}} ice, the sea level has risen and fallen. In every area of the country the rocks which formed {{can be seen as a}} result. Finally, the impact of the glaciers shaped the landscape seen today. This variation in the two areas along with the differences between volcanic areas and shallow seas gives Ireland a range of soils as well. There are wide bogs and free-draining brown earths. The mountains are granite, sandstone, limestone with karst areas, and basalt formations.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaurs diverged {{from their}} archosaur {{ancestors}} {{during the middle}} to late Triassic period, roughly 20million years after the Permian–Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth. Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists think that Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators. The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators. Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>as</b> evidenced by remains of the genus Nyasasaurus from that period, though known fossils of these animals are too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives.|$|E
5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E
