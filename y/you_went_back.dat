6000|$|... “He was yours in life then, even if for a {{while he}} ceased to be. If you forgave him <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to him. Those whom we’ve once loved—” ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Milray {{did not say}} {{anything}} to this. She asked, [...] "And if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> what would you do there? Labor in the fields, as poor little Belsky advised?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> on {{your old}} salary," [...] the general persisted pitilessly, [...] "you {{would be very}} {{fortunate}} if you brought your earnings up to twenty-five hundred a year." ...|$|E
60|$|AMAH. You {{very angry}}, Daisy. You very angry before, but <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Lee Tai; he think perhaps <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> again.|$|R
60|$|OBST. What! more fools still? Be {{ruled by}} me, and go back; who knows whither such a brain-sick fellow will lead <b>you?</b> <b>Go</b> <b>back,</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> and be wise.|$|R
5000|$|However long <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> for, <b>you</b> {{must live}} through that time again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom {{came home}} {{promoted}} {{and got his}} West African appointment; Carnally {{could have had a}} commission; and <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to prison. Though of course they deserved it, didn't it strike you that the rewards were not very fairly shared out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} very fortunate," [...] {{continued}} the general, unmoved by the young fellow's pain, and unperturbed {{by the fact that}} he had himself lived upon his wife's means as long as she lived, and then upon his daughter's, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Stoller--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] said Mrs. Almayer, violently. [...] "No, {{he sleeps}} now the sleep of gin; and if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> he might awake and see you. No, he shall never see you. When the terrible old man took {{you away from}} me when you were little, you remember--" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{into the}} black hole and give the past version of {{yourself}} (2) the portable white hole.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anne," [...] he said firmly, [...] "if I <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> Sometimes I {{think that}} I shall never regret {{anything}} that has happened if--" ...|$|R
60|$|CHLOE. You haven't {{finished}} dinner, have <b>you?</b> <b>Go</b> <b>back,</b> and I'll <b>go</b> to bed quite soon. Charlie, don't stop loving me.|$|R
6000|$|... "How are you, Hugh?" [...] he said, {{the warmth}} of his {{greeting}} tempered by just the note of condolence suitable to my black clothes. [...] "I'm glad you came. I wanted to see you before <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Cambridge. I must introduce you to Judge Bering, of our State Supreme Court. Judge, this is Mr. Paret's boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Breckenridge quietly, [...] "it is just this. You {{have done}} {{a good deal for}} me already, and I almost dare to fancy I could be a credit to you if you would do a little more, while it would carry {{conviction}} to my most doubting relatives if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the old country with me. They would only have to see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I've {{had enough}} of you,' he snarled, bristling up his quills as if he counted on {{sticking}} some of them into me. 'After the way <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> on me in that scrape Bobby Coon got me into, I'm through with the whole Rabbit family, from this out. Just {{keep your eye on}} me, and you'll see that I'll even up that business before I'm many days older.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to them; <b>you</b> must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to {{the world}} you belong to; and you'd better not carry any queer habits back with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twenty years ago'--well, that's {{beginning}} at the beginning; suppose <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the Creation!" [...] said the clerk, not without satire.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> I think I'll <b>go</b> <b>back</b> myself," [...] said Tom. [...] "Anyway, {{this tour}} {{seems to have}} come to a standstill, with so much rain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{the very}} point I was coming to," [...] he rejoined. [...] "It is a {{question}} with me whether the experiment which I propose {{as a means of}} vindicating your innocence, may not also be made a means of recovering the lost Diamond as well. When you left Miss Verinder's sitting-room, with the jewel in your hand, <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> in all probability to your own room----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> {{into the}} house to look for us when all was over," [...] said Mrs. Randolph, fixing her black, beady, {{magnetic}} eyes on Rose, [...] "and that stupid yokel Zake brought you out again. He needn't have clutched your arm so closely, my dear,--I must speak to the major about his excessive familiarity--but I suppose I shall be told that that is American freedom. I call it 'a liberty.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't suppose, really, that you're aware what a devil's {{argument}} that is," [...] said Westover. [...] "You got Lynde drunk, and then <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to his sister, and {{allowed her to}} treat you {{as if you were}} a gentleman, and didn't deserve to be thrown out of the house." [...] This at last was something like what Westover had imagined he would say to Jeff, and he looked to see it have the imagined effect upon him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps. But <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the fire," [...] and Slavin <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> {{but with}} a {{look on his face}} that rivaled the black clouds in the heavens outside.|$|R
6000|$|HARRY. Here's {{a dollar}} for <b>you,</b> amah. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to missy {{and tell her}} it's all right and will she come chop-chop. Sabe? ...|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly Neale had a happy thought. [...] "Red, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Slingerland's {{and help}} {{take care of}} Allie. I'd feel she was safer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well! Since I can't {{start for}} Cuba without money, I must find an {{occupation}} at Las Palmas, and I have a plan. You see, I know some Spanish and something about running a gambling joint. The {{people here are}} sports, {{and one or two}} are willing to put up the money to start a club that ought to attract the English tourists. If I found the thing didn't pay before <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> I could quit and get after you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} seriously of what {{you said to me}} on Wednesday, before <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to town. I entirely agree with you that Miss Garth is more shaken by all she has gone through for our sakes than she is herself willing to admit; and that it is my duty, for the future, to spare her all the anxiety that I can on the subject of my sister and myself. This is very little to do for our dearest friend, for our second mother. Such as it is, I will do it with all my heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, now, {{pretend you}} don't know, will you?" [...] said Olly, evading the kiss which Jack always had ready for childhood. [...] "If I was her, I wouldn't have {{anything}} to say to you after that!" [...] she added, with that ostentatious chivalry of the sex towards each other, in the presence of their common enemy. [...] "Why, she saw you from the window when you first came this morning, when <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> again and shaved off your moustache; she knew you. And you don't know her! It's mean, ain't it?--they'll grow again, won't they?"--Miss Olly referred to the mustachios and not the affections! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And when do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> there?" [...] he asked, {{somewhat}} anxiously. [...] "I suppose your father's leave {{is for a}} week or two only." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Jerry. Now <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to work. You'll {{never lose}} {{anything}} by sticking to us, I promise you that. Keep {{your eyes and}} ears open." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you, Blakeney--how will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to {{that awful}} Paris?" [...] he said, {{when he had}} made his choice and was once more back beside Percy.|$|R
6000|$|I hope I was {{accurate}} {{in the history}} of the hop which I gave Mrs. March; I am sure I was full. I think my account may be justly described as having a creative truthfulness, if no other merit. I had really no wish to conceal anything except the fact that I had not, in my utter helplessness, even tried to get Miss Gage any other partners. But in the larger interest of the present situation, Mrs. March seemed to have lost the sense of my dereliction in this respect. She merely asked, [...] "And it was after <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the parlour, just before you came home, that you wrote those names on her card?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better stop here," [...] {{the earl}} said. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> and they {{heard you were}} promoted, likely enough some of them might toss you {{overboard}} on a dark night. We will set the tailors at once to work to rig you up an undress uniform. You can get a full dress made at Lisbon. Not {{that you will be}} wanting to wear that much, for we have come out for rough work; still, when we ride triumphantly into any town we have taken, it is as well to make a good impression upon the Spanish donnas. And, say what they will, fine feathers {{go a long way toward}} making fine birds. Do you write a good hand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're as a {{preface to}} what is to come," [...] said Robert Lefroy, with an impudent leer upon his face. [...] "The questions, no doubt, are disagreeable enough. She ain't your wife no more than she's mine. You've no {{business}} with her; and that you knew when you took her away from St. Louis. You may, or you mayn't, have been fooled by some one down in Texas when <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and married her in all that hurry. But you knew {{what you were doing}} well enough when you took her away. You won't dare to tell me that you hadn't seen Ferdinand when you two mizzled off from the College?" [...] Then he paused, waiting again for a reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{your old}} tricks again," [...] groaned the hired man. [...] "Now, I reckon {{the house will}} be turned upside down till <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to college." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to {{the hotel}} in the afternoon, I'll come along," [...] he said. [...] "Perhaps I ought to see Stannard about our hunting trip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{was here}} last night; and I {{expect to see}} her again to-day before she returns to Monksmoor with her father. Do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with them?" ...|$|R
