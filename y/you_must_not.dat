He reminded the six men and three women that they were not politicians and it was not their job to protect the image of the country. You have been told that this will have an international ramification and will affect the image of Mauritius… this is not your role, Fekna said. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> allow yourself to be influenced by this, you are not politicians, you have to base yourself on what has happened.|$|E

[...] "Meanwhile, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> forget you have a completely black topped road here, one that is equal to the best roads in some of the other provinces and the United States," [...] Taylor said. [...] Nevertheless, the Chamber was still concerned about the condition of the road, particularly in the Crowsnest Pass region where mountainous terrain and steep grades were making upgrades difficult. [...] There was also concern about the diversion of traffic from Highway3 to the Trans-Canada Highway, which would {{have a negative effect on}} the economies of southern Alberta municipalities.|$|E

500|$|After {{the early}} {{release of the}} lyrics, it had {{garnered}} criticism from some Asian and Hispanic communities, including Latino groups MECha and Chicanos Unidos Arizona, claiming that the usage of the terms [...] "chola" [...] and [...] "orient" [...] was offensive and derogatory. In response to the lyrics, Robert Paul Reyes of Newsblaze.com stated that while he agreed with its pro-gay stance, he questioned {{the use of the}} term [...] "chola", asking, [...] "Are Latinos supposed to be grateful that a white superstar, born of privilege, included a racist shout out to our community? Not all Latino ladies are 'cholas' in the barrio, some of them are teachers, writers, engineers and nurses and doctors." [...] Radio stations in Malaysia chose to censor the part of the lyrics dealing with the acceptance of the LGBT community, due to censorship in the country of content that may be deemed offensive. In response, Gaga urged her Malaysian fans, who wanted the uncensored version to be played, to take action by stating: [...] "It is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard.

500|$|The fictional {{character}} Stingaree {{proved to}} be a prototype of a character Hornung used in a series of six short stories published in 1898 in Cassell's Magazine, A. J. Raffles. The character was modelled on George Cecil Ives, a Cambridge-educated criminologist and talented cricketer who, like Raffles, was a resident of the Albany, a gentlemen's only residence in Mayfair. The first tale of the series [...] "In the Chains of Crime" [...] was published in June that year, titled [...] "The Ides of March". The stories were collected into one volume—with two additional tales—under the name The Amateur Cracksman, which was published the following year. Hornung used a narrative form similar to Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, with Raffles and his partner-in-crime (and former school fag) Bunny Manders being the criminal counterparts to Holmes and Dr. Watson—although Rowland writes that Raffles and Manders [...] "were also fictionalized versions of Wilde and Bosie" [...] (Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas).—and he dedicated the stories to his brother-in-law: [...] "To A.C.D. This form of flattery". Doyle had warned against writing the stories, and reflected in his memoirs that [...] "there are few finer examples of short-story writing in our language than these, though I confess I think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion. I told him so before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> make the criminal the hero". The book was a popular and financial success, although some critics also echoed Doyle's fears. The reviewer in The Spectator wrote that [...] "stern moralists" [...] would consider the book's premise [...] "as a new, ingenious, artistic, but most reprehensible application of the crude principles involved in the old-fashioned hero-worship of Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin". The book ends with Manders imprisoned and Raffles apparently dead, something that left The Spectator reviewer [...] "expressing [...] satisfaction that this audaciously entertaining volume is not issued in a cheap form. It is emphatically a feat of virtuosity rather than a tribute to virtue." ...|$|E

It seems this diet was primarily based on meat, for Galen (ca. 180 AD) accused athletes of his day of [...] "always gorging themselved on flesh and blood". Pausanias also refers to a [...] "meat diet".|$|E
2500|$|The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman is a {{first person}} frame narrative. Desiderio recounts the events of his past with several {{instances}} of second person. [...] "...it was I who killed her. But <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> expect a love story or a murder story. expect a tale of picaresque adventure or even of heroic adventure..." [...] (14). Carter ornamentally depicts many of Desiderio's events and defamiliarises the reader throughout the novel. In {{the introduction of the}} novel, Desiderio essentially gives away the ending and the climax. This formal choice repeats throughout the novel as Carter constantly references the outcome of actions and events that have not occurred in the text.|$|E

Meanwhile, Bartlett had published more than 200 poems in literary reviews and anthologies, and felt encouraged to bring out a collection of her poetry. She sent the manuscript of the new work to Moore, who wrote: [...] "You have here what is indeed a conspectus of experience, and I thank you for the book. It seems an anomaly that it is not in 'hard covers,' in shops where all might buy. This must be corrected.

De Gaulle retorted that the French people thought he was a reincarnation of Joan of Arc, to which Churchill replied that the English had had to burn the last one. Clementine Churchill, who admired de Gaulle, once cautioned him, [...] "General, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> hate your friends more than you hate your enemies."
