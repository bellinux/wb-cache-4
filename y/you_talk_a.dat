40|$|Proefskrif (PhD) [...] PU vir CHO, 1992 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project was to clarify the precise {{meaning of the term}} "stress" and to formulate criteria for diagnosing stress in Standard six pupils; to identify various stress factors prevalent among Standard six pupils by means of a questionnaire on stress; to determine the influence of stress on the achievement of a group of Standard six pupils; and academic to provide guidelines for combating stress which will promote the optimization of the academic achievement of pupils. The method of research entailed an empirical which 1054 Standard six pupils from five investigation in Afrikaans medium secondary schools were involved. In order to determine the incidence of stress in these pupils and to obtain biographical data and information on stress, each of these pupils had to complete a questionnaire. In addition to biographical data and information on stress, the academic achievement and IQ of each individual pupil were also required. The average academic achievement for the first examination written by Standard six pupils in a new school environment and the IQ scores available at the schools were taken into consideration in this research project. No additional IQ tests were conducted. The questionnaire was completed by the pupils themselves. Their academic achievement and IQ scores were recorded on a class list by their tutor teachers. In order to ensure anonymity and confidentiality, every questionnaire on stress was linked to the appropriate pupil in respect of the marks he/she obtained and his/her IQ score by means of a numerical system (cf. par. 5. 4. 2). Based on the biographical data gathered, it was concluded that the following pupils were more prone to stress: Girls Pupils who had changed schools three or more times Pupils who had older brothers and/or sisters Children from broken homes. From the questionnaire on stress it appeared that the following ten items showed the highest negative correlation with academic achievement: How often do you feel helpless? Is your schoolwork important to you? Are you afraid of the unknown? Are you shy? How often {{do you feel that you}} are a demanding person? Do you easily become tense about an issue? How often do you feel cheerful and playful? Do you find it easy to talk to others and do <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> lot? Do you often do something with the purpose of annoying or irritating somebody? How often are you restless or overactive? It can, however, never be taken for granted that a child who is not performing well academically is suffering from stress. Many factors within and outside the school situation can be the cause of poor academic achievement. Some of the items mentioned may have a negative influence on a child's academic achievement. These items may be used in a test with the purpose of identifying stress in a child. It is significant that the three items which showed the highest negative correlation with academic achievement, also showed the highest negative correlation with the IQ score. These items are a feeling of helplessness, the child's attitude towards school work and his fear of the unknown. Doctora...|$|E
