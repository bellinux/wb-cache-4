5000|$|On September 2008, US District Judge Jimm Larry Hendren sentenced Mitchell Johnson to {{four years}} in prison on the weapon and drug charges.

[...] On October 7, 2008, Johnson pleaded guilty to a felony theft charge and misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Johnson admitted that he stole a debit card left by a disabled man at the Bentonville gas station where he worked and subsequently used it to purchase a meal at a local Burger King. He also admitted that {{at the time he was}} arrested, he was in possession of marijuana. On November 14, 2008, Johnson, now 24 years old, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for the theft charge and misdemeanor possession charges. Although Johnson could have faced up to 30 years, the sentence of 12 years was chosen because Johnson technically had no criminal record from the Jonesboro shooting.|$|E
50|$|Around 1977 Nick wrote a {{pamphlet}} titled Revolution or Reform: Twin cul de sacs? (If <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> copy republish.) As a student I read it closely. In it he prophesied {{the failure of}} both, which has come to pass {{in the sense that}} a 'flexible workforce', meaning insecure, is now the norm with 'employment' now returned to terms similar to the 19th Century and 'revolution' inconceivable. The complete closure of the mass media to any discussion of alternative social arrangements to capitalism, in a way unimaginable in the 1970s up until the late 1980s, is proof of his perspicacity.What is even more interesting is the way the mass media production outlets have become even more stratified {{than they were in the}} post war period in the sense that it is now almost impossible for any children of manual, or lower white collar, parents to get any employment or career in the media. This now extends to pop music, comedy and the theatre all routes that offered some form of escape from poverty to working class kids. All colonised by public school alumni. This was not predicted by Nick but the structures that produce this outcome were.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} titled {{as a joke}} about {{attempts}} to rationalize a state of spirituality. The opening song [...] "Bodhisattva" [...] is about how buying and selling can lead to redemption. Its title refers to the Bodhisattva, those who have achieved spiritual perfection but who remain in the material world to help others. The song's protagonist asks them to take him {{by the hand and}} show him the [...] "shine of your Japan / the sparkle of your China." [...] Attracted by the lure of Eastern religion and material goods, he then pledges to sell his [...] "house in town" [...] in order to move and affiliate himself with the Eastern world. Fagen summarized the song's message as [...] "Lure of East. Hubris of hippies. Quick fix". [...] "Razor Boy" [...] is a bitter, ironic pop song with lyrics that subtly criticize complacency and materialism. According to Ivan Kreilkamp of Spin, [...] "Steely Dan speaks to us from that 'cold and windy day' when the trappings of hipness and sexiness fall away to reveal a lonely figure waiting for a fix. 'Will <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> song to sing when the razor boy comes and takes your fancy things away?' Fagen asks a generation stupefied by nostalgia and self-involvement".|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} in The New York Times, Stephen Holden called the film [...] "visually ravishing" [...] and added, [...] "it is so {{gorgeous}} that its beauty distracts from the anguish it reveals ... Every shot ... has the polish of a richly hued, impeccably composed illustration ... When individual children, some in tears, {{tell their stories}} while gazing directly into the camera, the shots seem posed and their remarks possibly rehearsed. The production notes explain that the children felt more comfortable telling their stories directly to the camera than to <b>an</b> interviewer, but <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> uneasy sense of being manipulated ... Having voiced these qualms, {{let me say that}} War/Dance, in spite of its slickness, is an honorable, sometimes inspiring exploration of the primal healing power of music and dance in an African tribal culture ... The film draws out the suspense as best it can until the inevitable African-style American Idol moment. If that finale is genuinely exhilarating, <b>you</b> are <b>still</b> uncomfortably aware that this ecstatic conclusion doesn't mean the end of the strife or the refugees' troubles. It is a blip of light on a dark canvas." ...|$|R

5000|$|Japan, {{late on the}} scene, {{only had}} under its control, Taiwan, a few islands in the Pacific, and Korea. In 1931, the Japanese army {{launched}} an attack on Manchuria. At the League of Nations in Geneva the Japanese actions were condemned. Japan left the League accusing the Western powers of hypocrisy. In Japan, in face of growing economic depression {{and a sense of}} the West's double standards, the call was to expand even further and conquer more territory within Asia. By 1937 the Japanese army was five times what it had been around 1900. Many in the military thought that in an army that had grown so much, to maintain discipline, it was necessary to make the training of recruits more brutal. If the soldiers made the smallest mistake they were beaten, with fists or bamboo sticks. Recruits were instructed also to hit each other. And the Japanese military did not just want to mould their own soldiers but the general population too. Japanese who adopted western values were ridiculed, women who rejected a tradition of subservience were attacked. Many ordinary Japanese, as well as politicians and businesspeople, now supported the drive toward a bigger empire on the Asian mainland, and the minority who openly opposed military expansion risked assassination. Seven prominent Japanese, including two Prime Ministers, were murdered by army officers during the 1930s. Seeking to create a giant colony the Imperial army moved in 1937 into eastern China. The Chinese were not worthy of the land according to the dominant ideology; they were called bugs, animals, below-human. Yoshio Tsuchiya, (Japanese Secret Military Police):" [...] The Chinese were inferior - didn't belong to the human race. That was the way we looked at it." [...] In December 1937 the Japanese Army reached the then capital of China, Nanking. (Film taken by John Magee is shown). Men were set on fire, women beaten, bayoneted, raped. After Nanking atrocities followed in the Chinese countryside - the Chinese used for bayonet practice. Yoshio Tsuchiya (imprisoned 1950-56 for war crimes): [...] " [...] The first time <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> conscience and feel bad, but if you are honoured and given merit and praised, that will be the driving power for the second time - after the second time I didn't feel anything." [...] A soldier is asked why he felt no guilt or shame raping and killing women. He replies : [...] " [...] Because I was fighting for the emperor. He was a god; {{in the name of the}} emperor we could do whatever we wanted against the Chinese." [...] Meanwhile the god-emperor of Japan spent most of his time secluded behind the walls of his palace. Even today opinion is divided among historians as to the extent the emperor knew of the barbaric crimes his soldiers were committing in China. [...] " [...] What is certain is that no evidence has surfaced that he ever attempted to hold his soldiers to account for their vicious conduct in China" [...] Rees's film concludes.|$|E
