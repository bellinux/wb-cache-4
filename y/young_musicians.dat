5|$|In 1976 Tippett {{was awarded}} the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society. The {{following}} few years saw journeys to Java and Bali—where he was much attracted by the sounds of gamelan ensembles—and to Australia, where he conducted a performance of his Fourth Symphony in Adelaide. In 1979, with funds available {{from the sale of}} some of his original manuscripts to the British Library, Tippett inaugurated the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation, which provided financial support to <b>young</b> <b>musicians</b> and music education initiatives.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the initial impact {{of rock and}} roll on {{mainstream}} American culture waned as major record companies took a controlling influence and sought to market more conventionally acceptable recordings. Electric musical instruments (particularly guitars) and amplification were becoming more affordable, allowing <b>young</b> <b>musicians</b> to form small groups to perform in front of local audiences of their peers; and in some areas there was a breakdown, especially among radio audiences, of traditional black and white markets, with more white teenagers listening to and purchasing R records.|$|E

5|$|Listeners {{unfamiliar}} with contemporary Christian music (CCM) often assume that Loder sings hymn-style music. Her career {{is unusual in}} that it began in CCM; most <b>young</b> <b>musicians</b> choose music genres such as country and pop, which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music; many of her songs are about God, but {{they may also be}} interpreted as being about other subjects.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{was among}} the most {{influential}} jazz musicians of his lifetime. Grove Music Online describes his legacy as at least fourfold: as a pioneer of hard bop; as a user of what became the archetypal quintet instrumentation of tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, bass, and drums; as a developer of <b>young</b> <b>musicians</b> who went on to become important players and bandleaders; and for his skill as a composer and arranger.|$|E
5|$|The lyricism in Delius's early {{compositions}} {{reflected the}} music {{he had heard}} in America and the influences of European composers such as Edvard Grieg and Richard Wagner. As his skills matured, he developed a style uniquely his own, characterised by his individual orchestration and his uses of chromatic harmony. Delius's music has been only intermittently popular, and often subject to critical attacks. The Delius Society, formed in 1962 by his more dedicated followers, continues to promote knowledge of the composer's life and works, and sponsors the annual Delius Prize competition for <b>young</b> <b>musicians.</b>|$|E

5|$|He {{received}} the scholarship of countess Erna Hamilton in 1993. In 1994, as an organ soloist, {{he won the}} Danish qualification rounds and national final of the Eurovision <b>Young</b> <b>Musicians</b> competition. He was one of eight winners of the 24 national competitions that year to be selected for the European final, held at the Philharmonic Concert Hall in Warsaw, Poland on 14 June 1994. He performed Francis Poulenc's Organ Concerto, but was not placed in the top 3. The Polish organizers originally planned the qualifying round to be held elsewhere, but moved it to the Philharmonic Hall (which contains a pipe organ) to accommodate Magle's participation.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Beecham was {{approached}} by the rising young conductor Malcolm Sargent with a proposal {{to set up a}} permanent, salaried orchestra with a subsidy guaranteed by Sargent's patrons, the Courtauld family. Originally Sargent and Beecham had in mind a reorganised version of the LSO, but the orchestra baulked at weeding out and replacing underperforming players. In 1932 Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch. The London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), as it was named, consisted of 106 players including a few <b>young</b> <b>musicians</b> straight from music college, many established players from provincial orchestras, and 17 of the LSO's leading members.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, enthusiasts for Delius's music who {{had gone}} to Bradford for the centenary festival formed the Delius Society; Fenby became its first president. With around 400 members, the Society is {{independent}} from the Trust, but works closely with it. Its general objectives are the furtherance of knowledge of Delius's life and works, and the encouragement of performances and recordings. In 2004, as a stimulus for <b>young</b> <b>musicians</b> to study and perform Delius's music, the Society established an annual Delius Prize competition, with a prize of £1,000 to the winner. In June 1984, at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, the Delius Trust sponsored a commemorative production of A Village Romeo and Juliet by Opera North, to mark the 50th anniversary of Delius's death.|$|E

5|$|Since 1986, Wigan {{has hosted}} an {{international}} jazz festival. Wigan remains a centre {{of popular music}} for young people, {{with a number of}} alternative pubs/clubs in the town centre. The town also had a music collective which existed to promote the scene and help out local musicians and bands. They host bi-weekly gigs at The Tudor (closed 2014) and also host various other activities such as recording sessions and gig advice for <b>young</b> <b>musicians.</b> Throughout the early 1990s The Den was a popular venue for bands with acts such as Green Day heading over to play.|$|E
5|$|The National Repertory Orchestra (NRO) is an American summer symphony {{orchestra}} and academy that offers full fellowships to train <b>young</b> <b>musicians</b> for professional careers in music through performances, master classes and workshops. Based in Breckenridge, Colorado since 1993, its members, who {{range in age}} from 18 to 29, are selected from auditions held each year throughout the United States. NRO presents an eight-week series including two orchestral programs per week conducted by its Music Director Carl Topilow (conductor and director of the orchestral program at the Cleveland Institute of Music) as well as guest conductors. The orchestra was founded in 1960 by cellist and conductor Walter Charles. The orchestra was formerly known as the Blue Jeans Symphony based in Estes Park, Colorado, and later as the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra based in Evergreen, Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Davis was 47 {{years old}} when he was asked to play Carnegie Hall in 1974, which {{followed}} four years of relentless touring. He had played the venue numerous times before and recorded a live album there in 1961. By 1974, Davis had been dealing with depression, cocaine and sex addictions, and several health problems, including osteoarthritis, bursitis, and sickle-cell anemia. He had also lost respect with both critics and his contemporaries because of his musical explorations into more rock- and funk-oriented sounds. Influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Davis wanted to avoid individual songs and instead record extended movements that developed into a different composition. He played his trumpet sparsely and became less of the focal point for his band, whom he allowed more freedom to improvise and with whom he rarely rehearsed, so that the <b>young</b> <b>musicians</b> he enlisted would be tested to learn and play together onstage.|$|E

5|$|Deep Purple's {{members were}} {{experienced}} musicians with different musical backgrounds: Lord had trained in classical music and {{had played in}} jazz and blues rock ensembles, Blackmore and Simper came from session work in pop rock, Paice and Evans from beat bands. However, no one was an accomplished songwriter. The only one with experience in musical composition was Lord, who treated the arrangements and wrote {{the bulk of the}} music for the first album, with some guitar riffs added by Blackmore. The album shows the potential of the band but does not focus on a distinct sound. Clearly identifiable on the album are the musical styles which were developing in the UK in that period and that influenced the <b>young</b> <b>musicians</b> in Deep Purple, a mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock, pop rock and hard rock, the latter mostly evident in Blackmore's guitar parts.|$|E
5|$|Music is {{important}} to the locals of Cortina, with a guitar found in most houses, and <b>young</b> <b>musicians</b> are often found walking the streets. Every year, from the end of July to early August, Cortina hosts the Dino Ciani Festival and Academy. It is held in honour of the celebrated Italian pianist Dino Ciani (1941–1974) who died when he was only 32. The festival attracts young pianists from around the world who are able to benefit from classes with some of the world's leading performers. The Festival of the Bands is another annual musical event featuring brass bands from Italy and beyond during the last week of August. Cortina's own band, parading in traditional costumes, is a central attraction dating back to 1861. Cortina d'Ampezzo hosted the 1953 Miss Italia contest, won by Marcella Mariani. Traditionally, on the eves of the festivals of Ascension, Pentecost, Trinity and St Philip and St James, the youth of the town would climb the hills at sunset and light fires.|$|E
5|$|The NRO is a {{non-profit}} organization supported by private and corporate sponsorships as well as grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. Each year the orchestra's 88 members, who all attend on fellowships, are chosen from auditions by approximately 900 <b>young</b> <b>musicians</b> {{between the ages of}} 18 and 29 who must have completed at least one year of college, university, or conservatory. The program lasts eight weeks during which the members learn and perform an entire season's orchestral repertoire. The orchestra gives two full orchestral concerts a week at the Riverwalk Center in Breckenridge and performs at events and concerts in various other towns in Colorado. The NRO musicians also attend masterclasses with visiting musicians, participate in the orchestra's education and community outreach programs, and take career development classes which include mock auditions, contract negotiations, finance for musicians, and training in music therapy.|$|E
