50|$|The Walla Walla Sweet Onion {{is another}} crop {{with a rich}} tradition. Over a century ago on the Island of Corsica, off {{the west coast of}} Italy, a French soldier named Peter Pieri found an Italian sweet onion seed and brought it to the Walla Walla Valley. Impressed by the new onion's winter hardiness, Pieri, and the Italian {{immigrant}} farmers who comprised much of Walla Walla's gardening industry, harvested the seed. The sweet onion developed over several generations through the process of selecting onions from each year's crop, targeting sweetness, size and round shape. The Walla Walla Sweet Onion is designated under federal law as a protected agricultural crop. In 2007 the Walla Walla Sweet Onion became Washington's official state vegetable.Walla Walla Sweet Onions get their sweetness from low sulfur content, which is half that of an ordinary <b>yellow</b> <b>onion.</b> Walla Walla Sweets are 90 percent water.|$|E

40|$|The onion (Allium cepa L.) {{is widely}} planted {{worldwide}} {{as a valuable}} vegetable crop. The scales of an onion bulb are a modified type of leaf. The one-layer-cell epidermis of onion scales is commonly used as a model experimental material in botany and molecular biology. The lower epidermis (LE) and upper epidermis (UE) of onion scales display obvious differences in microscopic structure, cell differentiation and pigment synthesis; however, associated proteomic differences are unclear. LE and UE can be easily sampled as single-layer-cell tissues for comparative proteomic analysis. In this study, a proteomic approach based on 2 -DE and mass spectrometry (MS) was applied to compare LE and UE of fleshy scales from <b>yellow</b> and red <b>onions.</b> We identified 47 differential abundant protein spots (representing 31 unique proteins) between LE and UE in red and <b>yellow</b> <b>onions.</b> These proteins are mainly involved in pigment synthesis, stress response, and cell division. Particularly, the differentially accumulated chalcone-flavanone isomerase and flavone O-methyltransferase 1 -like in LE may result in {{the differences in the}} onion scale color between red and <b>yellow</b> <b>onions.</b> Moreover, stress-related proteins abundantly accumulated in both LE and UE. In addition, the differential accumulation of UDP-arabinopyranose mutase 1 -like protein and β- 1, 3 -glucanase in the LE {{may be related to the}} different cell sizes between LE and UE of the two types of onion. The data derived from this study provides new insight into the differences in differentiation and developmental processes between onion epidermises.

50|$|Plant {{communities}} in the park are of high conservation value due to the occurrence of geographically significant species endemic to the island and not protected by reserves or parks elsewhere in Tasmania. Much of the park's vegetation comprises dry sclerophyll communities such as eucalypt woodland as well as heathland and coastal communities. There are also small patches of wet eucalypt forest and temperate rainforest. Common coastal plants include she-oaks and casuarinas (Allocasuarina), which have a high tolerance to salt spray and wind. The national park contains several rare, endemic orchid species including the endangered chestnut leek orchid (Prasophyllum castaneum) and the pretty leek orchid (Prasophyllum pulchellum), {{both of which are}} of high ecological significance due to their rare occurrence. These species generally occur in heathland communities which are greatly diverse and are of high conservation significance. The pretty leek orchid thrives in damp heathland and is so rare that the largest of the five known populations consists of fifty individuals. Several other heath species are classified as rare and vulnerable including the juniper wattle (Acacia ulicifolia), variable smoke bush (Conospermum hookeri), and the <b>yellow</b> <b>onion</b> orchid (Microtis atrata).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of the two heavy metals (Pb and Cd), in different concentrations, on the seeds germination and roots growing of Allium cepa of the two varieties (<b>yellow</b> <b>onion</b> and red onion), was studied. Sterilized Petri boxes were used; the germination substratum was cotton wool; the seeds were disinfected and wetted in appropriate solutions. For every working variant, 50 seeds of <b>yellow</b> <b>onion</b> and red onion were put in every Petri box. The following variants were used: V 1 – control, distilled water; V 2 – 0. 1 %Pb acetate; V 3 – 0. 4 %Pb acetate; V 4 – 0. 1 %Cd sulphate; and V 5 – 0. 4 %Cd sulfate. In {{order to determine the}} germinative energy, the counting was performed after 5 days and for the germinative faculty after 11 days. The obtained results proved that the germinative energy and the germinative faculty were much more reduced for the red onion than for the <b>yellow</b> <b>onion.</b> As about lead, the best tolerance is that of the yellow onion; and for cadmium, the best tolerance is that of the red onion. The presence of heavy metals in the germination environment determines a reduced growing pace for the roots. By comparison, we may state that the most toxic is lead; for concentrations of 0. 4 % the roots of the <b>yellow</b> <b>onion</b> appeared only in the 18 th culture day...|$|E

40|$|Background: Human {{intestinal}} {{tissue samples}} are barely accessible to study potential {{health benefits of}} nutritional compounds. Numbers of animals used in animal trials, however, need to be minimalized. Therefore, {{in this study we}} explored the applicability of an in vitro model, namely human intestinal Caco- 2 cells, to study the effect of food compounds on (intestinal) health. In vitro digested yellow (YOd) and white onion extracts (WOd) were used as model food compounds and transcriptomics was applied to obtain more insight into their mode of actions in the intestinal cells. Methods: Caco- 2 cells were incubated with in vitro digested onion extracts for 6 hours, total RNA was extracted and Affymterix Human Gene 1. 1 ST arrays were used to analyze the gene expression profiles. To identify onion-induced gene expression profiles in Caco- 2 cells, digested <b>yellow</b> <b>onion</b> and white onion samples were compared to a digest control samples. Results: We found that <b>yellow</b> <b>onion</b> (n= 5586, p< 0. 05) had a more pronounced effect on gene expression than white onion (n= 3688, p< 0. 05). However, a substantial number of genes (n= 3281, p< 0. 05) were affected by both onion variants in the same direction. Pathway analyses revealed that mainly processes related to oxidative stress, and especially the Keap 1 -Nrf 2 pathway, were affected by onions. Our data fit with previous in vivo studies showing that the beneficial effects of onions are mostly linked to their antioxidant properties. Conclusion: our data indicate that the in vitro Caco- 2 intestinal model can be used to determine modes of action of nutritional compounds and can thereby reduce the number of animals used in conventional nutritional intervention studies...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} two Romanian industrial regions- Copşa Mică and Zlatna, {{to assess}} the current situation of soil pollution and bioaccumulation of Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn in different vegetable species and possible risks to consumers. Both total and mobile forms of the metals were determined in soil samples, and metal content in the edible parts of root vegetable samples was also assessed. The concentrations of Pb and Zn in soil were higher in Copşa Mică than in Zlatna (566 mg/kg vs 271 mg/kg for Pb and 1143 mg/kg vs 368 mg/kg for Zn) ·The metal mobility in soil from Copsa Mica decreases in the order Zn>Cu>Cd>Pb (1. 88 mg/kg, 0. 40 mg/kg, 0. 22 mg/kg, 0. 16 mg/kg, respectively), while in Zlatna, the order was Cu>Zn>Pb>Cd (0. 88 mg/kg, 0. 29 mg/kg, 0. 04 mg/kg, 0. 01 mg/kg, respectively), apparently depending on metal and soil conditions. In Copsa Mica, the amount of Pb and Cd in vegetable samples exceeded the maximum permissible limits in carrots (median concentration 0. 32 mg/kg for Pb and Cd) and in <b>yellow</b> <b>onions</b> (median concentration 0. 24 mg/kg for Cd). In Zlatna region, the content of Cd exceeded the maximum limits in <b>yellow</b> <b>onions</b> (median concentration 0. 11 mg/kg). The amount of Pb was higher than the maximum acceptable level in carrots from the Zlatna region (median concentration 0. 12 mg/kg). Cu and Zn levels were within the normal range in all vegetable samples. In the Zlatna region, the transfer factors for Pb and Cd were higher in carrots (median values of 9. 9 for Pb and 21. 0 for Cd) compared to carrots harvested in Copsa Mica (median values of 4. 0 for Pb and 2. 0 for Cd). Daily intake rates of metals through local vegetable consumption exceeded the limit values established by the European Food Safety Authority for Pb (1. 2 to 2. 4 times) and Cd (5. 5 to 9. 1 times) in both regions, with potential adverse health effects for the local population.

40|$|Flavonoids are polyphenolic {{substances}} {{that are common}} in many {{fruits and vegetables and}} may have positive protective effects against e. g. cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer. These effects have mainly been attributed to their antioxidative properties. One of the most common flavonoids in food plants is quercetin, of which <b>yellow</b> <b>onion</b> (Allium cepa L.) is one of our main dietary sources. The effects of cultivars, nitrogen fertiliser level, lifting time, curing, cultivation system and storage conditions on the quercetin content in <b>yellow</b> <b>onion</b> are investigated in this thesis. Analyses were performed using reversed-phase HPLC after extraction of raw onion samples in ethanol. The main determinant of quercetin level was found to be the amount of global solar radiation during the end of the bulbing phase in August. Annual variations in quercetin content were higher than any treatment effect within each year. Cultivar differences in quercetin levels were significant but inconsistent. Early lifting, when 50 % of the onions had fallen leaves, resulted in onions with better keeping quality and equal quercetin content compared with onions with later lifting times. Minimised split application of nitrogen fertilisers reduced the risk of mineral nutrient leaching without lowering the yield or quercetin content. Field curing generally resulted in significant increases in quercetin content compared with levels at lifting. The role of onion size for quercetin content was inconsistent but of minor importance. Quercetin levels were stable during cold storage at constant temperature. No {{significant differences were found between}} inorganically fertilised and organically fertilised onions of the same cultivar or between directly sown and transplanted onions. Quercetin content and soil water content within the field were not correlated...|$|E
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} quercetin was {{extracted from}} <b>yellow</b> <b>onion</b> waste and converted to its aglycone form {{by a combination}} of subcritical water extraction and enzymatic hydrolysis. The hydrolytic step was catalysed by a double residue (N 221 S, P 342 L) mutant of the thermostable beta-glucosidase (TnBgl 1 A), isolated from the thermophile Thermotoga neapolitana and cloned and produced in E. coli. The activity of wt TnBgl 1 A was shown to be dependent on the position of the glucosylation on the quercetin backbone, favouring hydrolysis of quercetin- 4 '-glucoside over quercetin- 3 -glucoside. The mutated variant of the enzyme harboured a mutation in the + 2 sub-site (N 221 S) and showed increased catalytic efficiency in quercetin- 3 -glucoside hydrolysis and also to a certain extent hydrolysis of quercetin- 4 '-glucoside. The mutated enzyme was used directly in <b>yellow</b> <b>onion</b> extracts, prepared by subcritical water extraction, resulting in complete hydrolysis of the glucosylated flavonoids quercetin- 3, 4 '-diglucoside, quercetin- 4 '-glucoside, quercetin- 3 -glucoside, isorhamnetin- 4 '-glucoside and isorhamnetin- 3, 4 '-diglucoside. To complete hydrolysis within five minutes, 3 mg of TnBgl 1 A_N 221 S was used per gramme of onion (dry weight). A life cycle assessment was done to compare the environmental impact of the new method with a conventional solid-liquid extraction-and-hydrolysis method utilising aqueous methanol and hydrochloric acid. Comparison of the methods showed that the new method is preferable regarding primary energy consumption and global warming potential. Another advantage of this method is that handling of toxic chemicals (methanol and HCl) is avoided. This shows that combined subcritical water extraction/enzyme hydrolysis is both a fast and sustainable method to obtain quercetin from onion waste...|$|E

40|$|Red wine is {{a source}} of polyphenolic antioxidants, of which flavonols such as {{quercetin}} are representatives. Red wine might therefore prevent LDL oxidation and atherosclerosis. However, data on the bioavailability of flavonols from wine are lacking. Therefore, we compared the bioavailability of flavonols, especially quercetin, from red wine with that from the major dietary sources, <b>yellow</b> <b>onions</b> and black tea. Twelve healthy men consumed 750 mL red wine, 50 g fried onions or 375 mL of black tea, each for 4 d in random order. These supplements provided similar amounts of quercetin (14 - 16 mg). There was a washout period of 3 d between each period of supplementation. The plasma quercetin concentration after the consumption of wine was lower than that after onions (P < 0. 05) and not different from that after tea. Urinary excretion of quercetin after wine did not differ from that after onions and was higher than that after tea (P < 0. 05). We conclude that flavonols from red wine are absorbed. However, because one glass of red wine provides fewer available flavonols than one portion of onions or one glass of tea, red wine appears to be a poorer source of flavonols than these other two sources...|$|R

The agricultural plots were originally divided into 5 acre [...] "market garden" [...] family farms, and produce was taken to local markets. In the 1920s the main crops reflected eastern and western European tastes - <b>yellow</b> <b>onions,</b> potatoes, carrots, head lettuce, radish, etc. From the 1950s to the 1980s, Italian greens started to be grown, for example dandelion, escarole, and endive. Demand for Asian greens, such as bok choy, began in the 1990s. With the opening of Highway 400 in the 1950s, farmers quickly gained access to the Ontario Food Terminal in Toronto, vastly expanding their market. Yonge Street and the CN rail (Toronto - Barrie) are situated to the northeast. When the federal government relaxed food import rules in the 1990s and grocery stores consolidated to form large chains across Canada, small family farms growing diverse crops were, for the most part, no longer financially feasible, but a few small family farms still survive. Corporate farms that had bought land in the 1950s sold their plots and a few family farms consolidated, growing mostly onions and carrots for grocery stores, export and food processing companies. Recently the Greenbelt family farmers market introduced by the Ontario government has helped some small family farms.|$|R
