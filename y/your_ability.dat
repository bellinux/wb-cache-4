500|$|In 1991, Dylan {{received}} a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from American actor Jack Nicholson. The event {{coincided with the}} start of the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein, and Dylan performed [...] "Masters of War". Dylan then made a short speech, saying [...] "My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> to mend your own ways.'" [...] This sentiment was subsequently revealed to be a quote from 19th-century German Jewish intellectual, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{experienced}} discrimination {{throughout her}} climbing career {{and in an}} interview with John Stieger in Climbing, she pointed out that despite her success and prowess at climbing, this was a problem for her. She pointed to sexist remarks from male climbers who believed particular routes were impossible for female climbers and the fact that [...] "there's a lot less importance and prestige placed on women in climbing, no matter what <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> is". Hill has also commented extensively about how American culture encourages women to be passive and to forego developing muscles, which makes it harder for them to excel at climbing. She lamented this trend and was happy that her family and friends had allowed her to be the [...] "tomboy" [...] she wanted to be. Hill has explained that when competing she is not competing against men or women but with people's expectations of what women can do.|$|E
5000|$|The player {{encounters}} special rooms such as shops, crypts, and vaults. Other spatial {{elements in}} the game are traps and swamps. As your experience grows, so do <b>your</b> <b>abilities,</b> score {{and the need for}} food.|$|R

500|$|Stevens' {{teams are}} built around solid {{basketball}} fundamentals and good team work, rather than individual basketball skill. His teams {{are known for}} their defense, forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes. The secret to basketball – and life – is [...] "just to do the job to the best of <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> and don't worry about anything else," [...] Stevens says. [...] "Win the next game. Win the next possession. That's our focus. It's boring. It's also the way championships are won", he says. In short, Stevens is a strong believer in [...] "The Butler Way" [...] – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team. [...] "I tell the players 'the Butler Way' isn't easy to define," [...] Stevens says, [...] "but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball, play with great energy and defend." ...|$|E
500|$|The quest {{gameplay}} was less-well received, with Sliva {{saying it}} made him [...] "feel like [...] was stuck in the opening hours of an MMO", while Juba called the tasks [...] "dull". Parkin stated that the quests [...] "can seem trivial under {{the eye of the}} apocalyptic clock". VanOrd commented that while many quests were [...] "absorbing on their own", he admired their ability to get the player out into the world. Destructoid's Dale North felt that the time limit made the quests [...] "a waste of the precious time left". The time limit itself received mixed reviews. Sliva said the time limit gave the game [...] "a sense of urgency... that I really enjoy.", while VanOrd said the limit worked against the player and [...] "collides with almost every other aspect of the game." [...] Juba enjoyed planning out his days, but on the other had felt that the time limit prevented exploration, and that it [...] "severely [...] <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> to fully dive into some of the systems." [...] Elliot said the limit overly pressured him, and became unpleasant when coupled with the time penalty for fleeing battle. The Famitsu reviewers said that the time limit was not an overly stressful factor.|$|E

2500|$|Sensation is the fiction-writing mode for portraying a character's {{perception}} of the senses. [...] According to Ron Rozelle, [...] "...the success of your story or novel will depend on many things, but the most crucial is <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> to bring your reader into it. [...] And that reader will be most completely in when you deliver the actual sensations of the many things that comprise your story" [...] As stated by [...] Jessica Page Morrell, [...] "You breathe life into fiction by translating the senses onto the page, producing stories rooted {{in the physical world}} ... that creates a tapestry, a galaxy of interwoven sensory ingredients." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{researchers}} believe the hippocampus is only involved in episodic memory and spatial cognition. This then {{raises the question}} where semantic memory may be located. Some believe semantic memory lives in temporal neocortex. Others believe that semantic knowledge is widely distributed across all brain areas. To illustrate this latter view, consider your knowledge of dogs. Researchers holding the 'distributed semantic knowledge' view believe that your knowledge of the sound a dog makes exists in your auditory cortex, whilst <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> to recognize and imagine the visual features of a dog resides in your visual cortex. Recent evidence supports {{the idea that the}} temporal pole bilaterally is the convergence zone for unimodal semantic representations into a multimodal representation. [...] These regions are particularly vulnerable to damage in semantic dementia, which is characterised by a global semantic deficit.|$|E
2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but {{you may have a}} little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it to the best of <b>your</b> <b>ability,</b> with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, {{you have to realize that}} there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E

2500|$|Two more {{incidents}} {{occurred in}} April 2012. The first involved Ellerbe's demotion of Battalion Chief Richard Sterne {{to the rank}} of captain on April 8. Two firefighters and a lieutenant in a station in Northeast D.C. had accepted a case of beer from a grateful local resident. Ellerbe requested the men be suspended. Sterne discovered that the men had rejected the gift, but the resident left it behind anyway. When Sterne reprimanded the two firefighters rather than suspended them, Ellerbe issued the demotion and cited the disciplinary hearing as the reason. [...] "Your failure to hold the members accountable for their receipt of the beer in violation of the Rules of Conduct brings into question <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> to exercise proper judgment in the performance of your assigned duties," [...] he wrote. Sterne filed an appeal with the D.C. Office of Employee Appeals. The second incident involved the transfer of Battalion Chief Kevin Sloan. Sloan ruled that the lieutenant in the case was not guilty, as he was not present when the gift was delivered. Ellerbe subsequently transferred Sloan from active duty to a desk job in April 2012, although he gave no reason for the transfer. Sloan called the action retaliatory and said Ellerbe engaged in [...] "workplace bullying". Sloan, too, filed an appeal.|$|E
2500|$|As captain, he {{suffered}} a lack of support from Geoffrey Boycott, who had hoped to be appointed captain instead, and these tensions contributed to the downfall of Denness as a skipper. [...] Boycott played in the first 6 Tests with Denness as captain, including the five matches in the 1–1 drawn series in the West Indies and the first Test of a 3–0 whitewash against India, during which Denness scored his first two Test centuries, but then Boycott then refused to play under Denness and remained out of the Test team until 1977. [...] After a 0–0 drawn three-match series against Pakistan at home in 1974, his boycott left England exposed in several matches against the fast bowling of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson in the Ashes series in Australia in 1974-5. [...] Denness dropped himself from the England team for the 4th Test at Sydney after scoring only 65 runs in 6 innings (6, 26, 2, 20, 8, 2) {{in the first three}} Tests, although he was selected again for the 5th Test in Adelaide after his replacement John Edrich was injured, and achieving his highest Test score of 188 at Melbourne in the 6th Test to win by an innings. [...] The victory was little consolation, as Australia had already won four of the six matches in the series. [...] Once while in Australia, Denness received an envelope that had been sent with the address [...] "Mike Denness, cricketer". The letter inside read, [...] "Should this reach you, the post office clearly thinks more of <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> than I do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edward Thorndike (1874–1949) {{supported}} the scientific movement in education. He based teaching practices on empirical evidence and measurement. Thorndike developed {{the theory of}} instrumental conditioning or the law of effect. [...] The law of effect states that associations are strengthened when it is followed by something pleasing and associations are weakened when followed by something not pleasing. He also found that learning is done {{a little at a}} time or in increments, learning is an automatic process and all the principles of learning apply to all mammals. Thorndike's research with Robert Woodworth on the theory of transfer found that learning one subject will only influence <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> to learn another subject if the subjects are similar. This discovery led to less emphasis on learning the classics because they found that studying the classics does not contribute to overall general intelligence. Thorndike was one of the first to say that individual differences in cognitive tasks were due to how many stimulus response patterns a person had rather than a general intellectual ability. [...] He contributed word dictionaries that were scientifically based to determine the words and definitions used. The dictionaries were the first to take into consideration the users maturity level. [...] He also integrated pictures and easier pronunciation guide into each of the definitions. Thorndike contributed arithmetic books based on learning theory. He made all the problems more realistic and relevant to what was being studied, not just to improve the general intelligence. He developed tests that were standardized to measure performance in school related subjects. His biggest contribution to testing was the CAVD intelligence test which used a multidimensional approach to intelligence and the first to use a ratio scale. His later work was on programmed instruction, mastery learning and computer-based learning: ...|$|E
