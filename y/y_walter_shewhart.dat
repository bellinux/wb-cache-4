5000|$|<b>Walter</b> A. <b>Shewhart</b> {{originally}} {{used the}} term chance cause. The term common cause was coined by Harry Alpert in 1947.

50|$|In 1924, Bell Labs {{physicist}} <b>Walter</b> A. <b>Shewhart</b> {{proposed the}} control chart {{as a method}} to determine when a process {{was in a state}} of statistical control.

2500|$|In his book, The New Economics for Industry, Government, and Education, Deming {{championed the}} work of <b>Walter</b> <b>Shewhart,</b> {{including}} statistical process control, operational definitions, and what Deming called the [...] "Shewhart Cycle" [...] which had evolved into PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act). This {{was in response to}} the growing popularity of PDCA, which Deming viewed as tampering with the meaning of Shewhart's original work. Deming {{is best known for his}} work in Japan after WWII, particularly his work with the leaders of Japanese industry. That work began in August 1950 at the Hakone Convention Center in Tokyo when Deming delivered a speech on what he called [...] "Statistical Product Quality Administration". Many in Japan credit Deming as one of the inspirations for what has become known as the Japanese post-war economic miracle of 1950 to 1960, when Japan rose from the ashes of war on the road to becoming the second largest economy in the world through processes partially influenced by the ideas Deming taught: ...|$|R
30|$|The {{elementary}} algorithms use {{simple and}} intuitive concepts. They have many industrial applications, in particular, {{in the quality}} control field. One can cite the Shewart control charts algorithm that was first introduced by <b>Walter</b> <b>Shewhart</b> [16] in 1924. This technique has found many applications in {{improving the quality of}} manufacturing processes [17]. A more efficient method, called ‘the geometric moving average control charts’ algorithm, was proposed later by Roberts in 1965 [18]. This algorithm is also known as the ‘exponentially weighted moving average’ (EWMA) algorithm. Its key idea is to give different weights to the values of the observed process, to detect the change point: the recent values must be given more importance. Another solution presented in the ‘finite moving average’ (FMA) is to ignore very old observations by using a finite set of weights. The filtered derivative algorithm is another elementary algorithm introduced by Basseville and Gasnier [19] in 1981, based on the gradient techniques. It is widely used in the context of image edge detection.|$|R
40|$|The PDCA cycle had {{its origin}} with Dr. W. Edwards Deming’s lecture in Japan in 1950. Where {{did he get}} these ideas and how have these ideas evolved since those lectures? This {{presentation}} will move from the 1600 ’s with Galileo and the philosophy of science through {{the evolution of the}} scientific method and the science of improvement. <b>Walter</b> <b>Shewhart</b> in 1939 applied the scientific method with his cycle: specification-production-inspection. W. Edwards Deming in 1950 modified the Shewhart cycle: design of the product, make it, put it on the market, test it through market research, then redesign the product. ” The Japanese interpretation of the “Deming wheel ” in Dr. Deming’s lectures of 1950 and 1951 lead to the plan-do-check-action or PDCA cycle. This cycle was integral to the Japanese QC, TQC, and QC circle activities. Deming introduced his Shewhart cycle for learning and improvement in the USA in 1986. Dr. Deming introduced a more abbreviated PDSA cycle i...|$|R

50|$|Bell Labs Quality Assurance Department {{gave the}} world and the United States such statisticians as <b>Walter</b> A. <b>Shewhart,</b> W. Edwards Deming, Harold F. Dodge, George D.

50|$|During the 1950s, he collaborated {{widely and}} in 1954-1955 was visiting {{professor}} at the Indian Statistical Institute, where he worked with C. R. Rao, Ronald Fisher and <b>Walter</b> A. <b>Shewhart.</b> While working at the SQC Unit of ISI, he {{was introduced to the}} orthogonal arrays invented by C. R. Rao - a topic which was to be instrumental in enabling him to develop the foundation blocks of what is now known as Taguchi methods.|$|R
50|$|However, Taguchi {{realised}} that in much industrial production, {{there is}} a need to produce an outcome on target, for example, to machine a hole to a specified diameter, or to manufacture a cell to produce a given voltage. He also realised, as had <b>Walter</b> A. <b>Shewhart</b> and others before him, that excessive variation lay at the root of poor manufactured quality and that reacting to individual items inside and outside specification was counterproductive.|$|R
50|$|<b>Walter</b> A. <b>Shewhart</b> made a {{major step}} in the {{evolution}} towards quality management by creating a method for quality control for production, using statistical methods, first proposed in 1924.

40|$|A {{business}} process is generally {{defined as a}} network of activities that uses resources to transform inputs into outputs with an overall goal of satisfying customer requirements. Companies are being driven to design new {{business process}}es and to improve existing ones by increasing competition in a global environment. And {{the importance of a}} process focus creates a need for structured approaches to manage business processes. Business process management (BPM) {{can be viewed as a}} collection of concepts, techniques, and technologies to analyze, define, model, implement, and control processes. The interest in analyzing and improving processes has a long history that can be traced back to the early efforts in the 1900 s of industrial engineers such as Frederick Taylor and <b>Walter</b> <b>Shewhart.</b> More recently, a series of methodological developments in total quality management, business process reengineering (BPR), lean management, Six Sigma, and workflow management has contributed significantly to the evolution of BPM. While initial applications were concentrated in the manufacturing sector, BPM has since spread to distribution, retail, and service industries, facilitated by technological advances in web services.

40|$|In {{his book}} 'Out of the Crisis' the late Dr Edwards Deming {{asserted}} that 'if anyone adjusts a stable process {{to try to}} compensate for a result that is undesirable, or for a result that is extra good, the output will be worse than if {{he had left the}} process alone'. His famous funnel experiments supported this assertion. The development of the control chart by Dr <b>Walter</b> <b>Shewhart</b> stemmed from an approach made to him by the management of a Western Electric Company plant because of their awareness that adjustments made to processes often made matters worse. However, many industrial processes are such that the mean values of product quality characteristics shift and drift over time so that, instead of sequences of independent observations to which Deming's assertion applies, process owners are faced with autocorrelated data. The truth of Dr Deming's assertion is demonstrated, both theoretically and via computer simulation. The use of the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for process monitoring is demonstrated and, for situations where process data exhibit autocorrelation, its use for feedback adjustment is discussed and demonstrated. Finally, successful applications of process improvements using EWMA-based control algorithms is discussed. ...|$|R
