In 2009, tariffs were raised for electricity immediately consumed rather than supplied to the grid with increasing returns if more than 30% of overall production is consumed on-site. This is to incentivise demand-side management and help develop solutions to the intermittency of solar power.Tariff duration is usually 20 calendar years plus the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation.</b> Systems receive the tariff in effect {{at the time of}} installation for the entire period.|$|E

50|$|Grid {{operators}} are legally obliged to pay producers of solar electricity a fixed remuneration (feed-in tariff or FIT) for solar generated electricity {{fed into the}} grid, {{depending on the size}} and type of the system, as well as the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation.</b> The tariffs vary to account for the different costs of rooftop or ground-mounted systems in accordance with the size of the system and system cost reductions over time. Since the EEG guarantees the FIT payments for a duration of 20 years, it provides sustained planning security for investors in PV systems. Grid parity for large installation and small roof-top systems was already reached in 2011 and 2012, respectively.|$|E

In the United States, an academic analysis of eight cycle tracks found that they had increased bike traffic on the street by 75 percent within one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation.</b> Rider surveys indicated that 10 percent of riders after installation would have chosen a different mode for that trip without the cycle track, and 25 percent said they were biking more in general since the installation of the cycle track.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the solar}} power industry, a feed-in tariff {{is the most}} {{effective}} means of developing solar power. It is the same as a power purchase agreement, but is at a much higher rate. As the industry matures, it is reduced and becomes the same as a power purchase agreement. A feed-in tariff allows investors a guaranteed return on investment - a requirement for development. A primary difference between a tax credit and a feed-in tariff is that the cost is borne the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> with a tax credit, and is spread out over many years with a feed-in tariff. In both cases the incentive cost is distributed over all consumers. This means that the initial cost is very low for a feed-in tariff and very high for a tax credit. In both cases the learning curve reduces the cost of installation, but is not a large contribution to growth, as grid parity is still always reached.|$|E

This is why, in this context, the recent interest in using biomass as an energy source is increasing, mainly as biofuels - fuels originating from energy crops. The essay here presented is therefore central in this subject area, contributing to the study of an energy crop with high potential in our country, the Miscanthus x giganteus. The main goals of this dissertation include a propagation study of the species, the analysis of the crops growth in Portugal in the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> through a field experiment, {{and the development of a}} growth and crop productivity model in the year of crop installation. With regard to vegetative propagation Miscanthus x giganteus showed the best results when rhizomes with four internodes were used (larger fragments).

However, in spite of the current practice, there are conflicting reports regarding the relationship between dose of dialysis or patient outcome, and machine maintenance. In order to evaluate the impact of hemodialysis machine maintenance on dialysis adequacy Kt/V and session performance, data were processed on 134 patients on 3 -times-per-week dialysis regimens by dividing the patients into four groups and also dividing the hemodialysis machines into four groups according to their <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation.</b> The equilibrated dialysis dose eq Kt/V, urea reduction ratio (URR) and the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) were calculated in each group to show the effect hemodialysis machine efficiency on the overall session performance. The average working time per machine per month was 270 hours. The cumulative number of hours according to the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> was: 26, 122 hours for machines installed in 1998; 21, 596 hours for machines installed in 1999, 8362 hours for those installed in 2003 and 2486 hours for those installed in 2005. The mean time between failures (MTBF) was 1. 8, 2. 1, 4. 2 and 6 months between failures for machines installed in 1999, 1998, 2003 and 2005, respectively. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the dialysis dose eq Kt/V and URR were increased as the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) increases with regular maintenance procedures.

30|$|A {{study of}} the {{calibration}} of WDN using online data of flow and pressure is presented herein. The methodology uses pressure observations at few nodes for calibration. In the present study, the values {{of most of the}} input parameters were obtained accurately and only the pipe roughness coefficients were adjusted. The most critical input parameter is observed to be the valve opening. During calibration, all the valves were checked for their current status and settings. Hourly, observations of pressure values in the network were used to adjust pipe roughness coefficient values by grouping them based on material and <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation.</b> This resulted in a more general calibration. Throttled valves were modeled based on percentage opening by classifying them into different groups. A close match between the modeled and observed pressure values were obtained for the case study for the whole day observations with different demands. The entire process of data collection and calibration is described. The methodology can be repeated for any network.|$|E

40|$|Home based {{interventions}} are advocated {{in rural areas}} against a variety of diseases. The combination of different interventions might have synergistic effects in terms of health improvement and cost effectiveness. However, {{it is crucial to}} ensure cultural acceptance.

In two rural Peruvian communities we evaluated the performance and acceptance of cooking devices, household water treatments (HWT) and home–hygiene interventions, with qualitative and quantitative methods. New ventilated stove designs reduced wood consumption by 16 %. The majority of participants selected solar water disinfection as HWT in a blind tasting.

40|$|Balancing {{the energy}} demand in {{isolated}} microgrids {{is a critical}} issue especially {{in the presence of}} intermittent energy sources. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) can be installed in such circumstances to supply the demand and support the reserve requirements of the isolated microgrid. However, due to the high installation costs of BESS, {{there is a need for}} proper mechanisms to select such systems and size them optimally. Furthermore, since BESS are often installed to serve multiple applications, these should be properly modeled to coordinate their different functionalities. In this thesis, a multi-year operational planning model is developed to determine the BESS optimal power rating and energy capacity along with the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> taking into account its coordinated operation. The model includes unit commitment formulation with renewable energy and BESS operational constraints. The optimal planning decisions are obtained for different BESS technologies under several scenarios of ownerships. The uncertain patterns of solar and wind resources and system demand are considered and several microgrid operational scenarios are created. A stochastic optimization model is developed to determine the optimal BESS size and installation year including the different states of the uncertain microgrid variables. The stochastic optimization model is solved using a decomposition based two-stage iterative approach to cope with the large computational burden of such problems. 4 month...|$|E
40|$|Since 2005, French farmers must set up sown grass strips along {{rivers in}} order to {{decrease}} pesticide levels and soil erosion. Farmers have thus parcelled out their fields, set aside 3 % of their farm size and managed grass without herbicide. Consequently, this environmental policy may cause farmers’ fears due to economic losses and weed infestations of their field margins. Here, we studied farmers’ perception of sown grass strips. First, we interviewed 29 farmers in two French regions. Second, we evaluated the economic loss of gross margin when replacing crop by grass. Third, we evaluated the weed risk using flora surveys in sown grass strips. Our results showed that two thirds of interviewed farmers thought that sown grass strips affected their farm revenue and represented a weed risk. Concerning economy, we found that farmers loose from 358 to 853 €/ha the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> and from 126 to 641 €/ha next years. This economic loss is mainly due {{to the loss of}} crop production, with a minor impact of grass management cost. At the farm level, 3 % of sown grass strips decreased the farm revenue by 7 %. Concerning the weed risk, the farmers’ perception was linked with the presence of some competitive perennial weeds, e. g. Cirsium arvense, and wind-dispersing weeds, e. g. Asteraceae. Sown grass strips with high weed species richness of 26 species on average, or with dominance of non-sown species (16. 7 % of sown grass strips) did not affect the farmers’ perception.
