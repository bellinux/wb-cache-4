5|$|Yosemite National Park has {{documented}} more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following {{the migration of}} early Euro-American settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause {{an increase in the}} fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as <b>yellow</b> <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis), are able to produce a long tap root that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.|$|E

Poison oak and stinging nettles are found along the Sonoma Creek and can be a threat to hikers. Shrubs of the chaparral include manzanita, chamise, California lilac, coyote bush, toyon, and winebush. Sugarloaf experiences a colorful spring with a wide array of wildflowers California poppies, cream cups, lupines, penstemons, buttercups, peas, shooting stars, trilliums, Indian warriors and mariposa lily.

5000|$|Most {{species of}} Synchytrium infect wild plants and rarely affect human affairs. However, there are exceptions. The most {{well-known}} species is Synchytrium endobioticum, a parasite of Solanaceae; {{it is the}} causal agent of black wart in potatoes. Synchytrium anemones can cause harm to anemone and thalictrum flowers. Synchytrium aureum infects many agricultural and horticultural plants. Synchytrium vaccinii creates galls on cranberry, azalea, chamaedaphne, gaultheira, and ledum. Synchytrium fragariae infects strawberry plants. Synchytrium trichosanthidis parasitizes an Indian curcubit, and S. sesamicola is responsible for losses in Indian crops of sesame (Sesamum indicum). [...] Synchytrium psophocarpi {{is one of the}} major diseases affecting winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus), which is important high protein crop. Synchytrium pogostemonis is the casual agent of budok (which translates as wart in a local Indonesian language), a disease of Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin). Synchytrium solstitiale parasitizes the <b>yellow</b> <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis), an important weed in the United States. For this reason, S. solstitiale is being considered as a biological control of the <b>yellow</b> <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> in the United States. Another species being considered for biological control use is Synchytrium minutum, which occasionally parasitizes kudzu. However, S. minutum parasitizes cultivated kudzu patches more often wild patches and has also been reported from agricultural crops.|$|E
5000|$|Star thistle is a {{valuable}} source of pollen, thus nectar for pollinators. <b>Yellow</b> <b>star</b> <b>thistle,</b> a noted pest plant, is a major nectar source for many central valley and foothill butterflies.

50|$|The Pearson-Arastradero Preserve {{is unusual}} in its {{intensive}} ecological restoration program where Acterra, a Palo Alto-based environmental group, acts as a steward for the preserve and engages community volunteers in programs that combine habitat restoration with environmental education and accommodate {{a wide range of}} volunteers from high schools to local corporations. Their projects focus primarily on removing <b>yellow</b> <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis), Medusahead grass (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), poison hemlock (Conium maculatum), Italian thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus), wild mustard and teasel and replacing these invasives with native species. In 2006, Acterra conducted a large-scale creek daylighting project and continues to work on creek stabilization, sediment harvesting and planting riparian species. Reforestation projects focus on native oaks, including planting and caging young native oaks, and removal of high fire-danger eucalyptus. To encourage and support a greater diversity of fauna, Acterra volunteers install nesting boxes, bird perches, raptor poles, bat houses, bee blocks and brush piles. The Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society maintains and places bird houses and co-leads bird hikes with Acterra. Currently Acterra is conducting a preserve-wide weed and biodiversity hotspot map to guide future management strategies. There is an installation of native flora at the preserve's interpretive center.|$|E

30|$|Many {{non-native}} invasive {{plants are}} adapted to fire. Plant invasions into wildland ecosystem present a particularly vexing problem for fire managers. Fire often exacerbates plant invasions {{that can lead}} to changes in fire regimes. Examples include the invasion of cheat grass (Bromus tectorum) in the Great Basin, melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia) in the Everglades, spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) in the Rocky Mountains, and <b>yellow</b> <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis) in California. On the other hand, fire can also be an important tool for managing plant invasions. Managers of wildland fire use programs should consider the potential interactions of invasive plants with fuels, fire behavior, and fire regimes to ensure that their fire management goals and objectives can be met in the presence of these non-native plants. At the very least, land managers should monitor for invasive plants following fires and take mitigating measures as appropriate.|$|E
40|$|Conservation {{easements}} are {{an increasingly}} popular strategy for conserving biological diversity on private land. Long-term vegetation monitoring on conservation easements can provide critical information on persistence {{of biological diversity}} and abundance of invasive species. We sampled understory plant composition on five of The Nature Conservancy’s conservation easements in the Mt. Lassen foothills of Northern California. We established 73 plots of 10 -meter radius, measured species composition with the point-intercept method, and compiled a full species list for each plot in 2005 and 2006. We found {{significant differences in the}} relative cover of native and non-native annual grasses and annual forbs among easement properties. Relative cover of native plants was significantly higher in herbaceous plots (50 percent) than in plots with blue oak (Quercus douglasii) canopy (21 percent). We found medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae) in 64 percent of plots and <b>yellow</b> <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis) in 9 percent of plots. Overlap of species composition between years was correlated with difference in date sampled each year but not correlated with confidence in plot relocation. Our analysis of community diversity and relative abundance provides a baseline for future change. Finally, we make recommendations for the design of future monitoring efforts on conservation easements...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{indigenous}} and exotic plants found in North American affect {{the nervous system}} of animals, some being associated with considerable economic losses to the livestock industry. Arguably the most important group of plants affecting the nervous system are those belonging to the genera Astragalus and Oxytropis, collectively known as locoweeds. These plants, found in vast areas of western North America and {{in many parts of}} the world, have long been recognized as a problem to livestock [1, 2]. There are numerous other plants affecting the nervous system such as <b>yellow</b> <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis) and Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens) that will be discussed in the second section of this chapter. These and a variety of other plants are significant not only because they are poisonous and cause neurological disease in animals, but they also aggressively displace indigenous plants and reduce the value of natural ranges for grazing. Others like white snakeroot (Eupatorium rugosum) have historical and contemporary significance because of their effects on the nervous system. For example, deaths of early settlers in eastern North America who drank the milk from cows with " milk sickness", a fatal disease characterized by severe muscle tremors, is attributed to the toxin in white snakeroot. Once the neurotoxic effects of the white snakeroo...|$|E
