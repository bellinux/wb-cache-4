5|$|In {{systems like}} the London Underground, {{stations}} are simply closed off {{when they are}} overcrowded, such as the busy Oxford Circus tube station, which had to close more than 100 times in a year.

5|$|During {{most of his}} {{own life}} {{conservationism}} wasn't <b>yet</b> <b>on</b> the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.|$|E

5|$|There was off-field intrigue in Australian cricket {{during the}} antipodean winter of 1935.

The Board of Control wanted Bradman to lead the team, <b>yet,</b> <b>on</b> 8 August, the board announced Bradman's withdrawal from the team due to a lack of fitness. Surprisingly, in the light of this announcement, Bradman led the South Australian team in a full programme of matches that season.|$|E
5|$|Halvdan Koht {{was born}} on 7 August 1873 in Tromsø, {{one of the larger}} cities in Northern Norway. He was the second of four {{children}} born to Paul Steenstrup Koht (1844–1892), an educator and politician, and Betty Giæver (1845–1936), a part-time teacher with a penchant for singing, languages and drawing. Betty's antecedents were mixed: she was maternally descended from Northern Germany, <b>yet</b> <b>on</b> her father's side she was of Norwegian origin—a distinguished forebear on that side was her great-grandfather, the civil servant Jens Holmboe from Tromsø. Through the offspring of his maternal grand-uncle, Halvdan Koht was a third cousin of the parliamentarian Ola Krogseng Giæver. In Paul Koht's lineage, Kjeld Stub was a distant ancestor. The name Koht stems from German immigrants to Norway in the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being a U.S. citizen, Lin is by descent through his parents a national of Taiwan; Lin would qualify for a Taiwan passport although there is no record of him having done so. Lin has been invited to play for the Chinese Taipei men's national basketball team in FIBA competitions. On July 28, 2010 while in Taipei to play in Yao Ming's charity game, Lin said he had not made a decision <b>yet</b> <b>on</b> whether he would represent Chinese Taipei (the name used by Taiwan in international sporting competitions). In June 2011, the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (CTBA) included Lin in its preliminary squad of 24 players for the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship. The next month, however, the CTBA announced that Lin would not be included on their roster due to a knee injury.|$|E
5|$|Murphy won {{his first}} {{professional}} tournament at the 2000 Benson & Hedges Championship, defeating Mark Davis 6–1 in the semi-final, and Stuart Bingham 9–7 in the final, recovering from 2–5 down. Although he was not <b>yet</b> <b>on</b> the first-level main tour, this victory brought qualification for the Masters—a prestigious non-ranking invitation tournament with places {{for members of the}} top 16, the winner of the qualifying tournament, and a limited number of wildcards. In the 2001 tournament, he showed promise in his first televised match, defeating world number 15, Marco Fu, and building a 4–1 lead over seven-time world champion Hendry, before losing the match. He made his first maximum break in the 2001 Benson & Hedges Championship.|$|E
5|$|Patrolling by the Australians {{continued}} {{in order to}} prevent the Chinese from harassing their forward positions. Small clashes occurred on the nights of 15/16, 21/22, 22/23 and 23/24 July, suggesting that the Chinese were preparing for a major attack. Aerial reconnaissance subsequently detected a build up of Chinese forces and supplies west of the Samichon River. In response the Australians and US Marines stepped up their defensive preparations, {{while at the same time}} rumours from the peace talks started to spread of a ceasefire. Regardless, Chinese harassing artillery and mortar fire intensified, causing a constant stream of casualties among the Australians. Intense Chinese shelling struck Hill 121 and The Hook on the night of 19/20 July, with more than 300 rounds wounding four members of C Company, 2 RAR and further damaging the defences. That night the US Marines were driven off the Berlin and East Berlin features on the left flank, further exposing The Hook, which became a salient. <b>Yet</b> <b>on</b> 21 July an expected Chinese assault in the US 5th Marine Regiment sector failed to occur, while sightings of Chinese troops across the US 1st Marine Division front declined as the fighting entered a lull.|$|E

5|$|There are no {{official}} guidelines <b>yet</b> <b>on</b> {{the use of}} disease-modifying oral treatments due to their recent development. While some believe that they will probably reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend. It has been recommended {{that at the moment}} oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate. They could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed JC virus antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML. Dimethyl fumarate is potentially {{one of the most interesting}} oral drugs due to the long term data from use in psoriasis which points towards a very good safety profile.|$|E
5|$|With the {{accession}} of ElizabethI in November 1558, Robert Dudley {{came into}} great favour and was made Master of the Horse. Ambrose Dudley received {{the post of}} Master of the Ordnance, though he pressed his influential brother to delay the appointment somewhat, {{so that he could}} not be held accountable for his predecessor's embezzlement of funds. When their attainder had been lifted in 1558, the Dudley brothers had renounced any rights to their father's possessions or titles. <b>Yet</b> <b>on</b> 25 and 26December 1561 Ambrose Dudley was created Baron Lisle and Earl of Warwick, and the next year received {{a large portion of the}} lands confiscated from the Duke of Northumberland. Warwick Castlewhich the Queen visited on her 1572 summer progressbecame his seat, while the neighbouring Kenilworth Castle became that of Robert Dudley. Like their father, Ambrose and Robert Dudley adopted the bear and ragged staff, the heraldic device of the medieval Earls of Warwick.|$|E
