500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Terrapins were coached by former Florida State head coach Tom Nugent. While with the Seminoles, Nugent {{had wanted to}} recruit a black player, but felt the racial climate there was unsuitable. He said that [...] "the head of the Ku Klux Klan lived in Tallahassee. You'd come to <b>your</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> there'd be a notice on it announcing a Klan meeting that night." [...] When he took over at Maryland in 1959, Nugent saw his opportunity. He {{instructed}} the Terrapins' quarterbacks coach Lee Corso to find a black player who was academically and athletically suited to come to College Park. Corso had been impressed by Roger Staubach's preferred receiver, Darryl Hill, during a freshman match between Maryland and Navy, and had also heard a rumor that he was considering leaving the Naval Academy. In 1962, Corso convinced Hill to transfer to Maryland, a school that had just 32 African-Americans in its 35,000 student body, and become the first black player in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Once there, Hill quickly befriended the team's only Jew, linebacker Jerry Fishman.|$|E
