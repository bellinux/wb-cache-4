40|$|Asymmetric campaigns {{since the}} end of the Cold War have tended to have a brief war-fighting phase {{followed}} by a “cultural ” phase in which victory is achieved by winning the “hearts and minds ” of diverse ethnic and national groups that may side with us or with extremists.

It lies in whether it sends the right message to the right people, and makes it credible to them.
