"Legendary Axe II has {{the same}} magic as the first version, but with snazzier graphics. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> power-ups here so you {{can stay in the}} hunt longer, {{enhancing}} the game's arcade feel There's also a better variety of enemies.

Hooper sought a second subtlety while filming the first consultation room scene between the two men, having placed the camera 18inches from Colin Firth's face: [...] "I wanted the nervousness of the first day to percolate into his performances." ...|$|E
500|$|Heavy {{criticism}} was {{directed toward the}} script, dialogue, and cutscene length. McShea felt that the unskippable cutscenes and [...] "the overabundance of story in Other M were a negative deviation from Metroid tradition". Kollar states that they [...] "often run as long as 15 minutes, exhausting players with repetition of obvious plot points and overwrought dialogue as mature and interesting as a teenager’s diary". Justin Haywald of 1UP.com complained that as the game progresses [...] "instead of getting more {{of the things that}} work , <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> of the things you don't care about [...] ". Donlan notes that the plot is considered as [...] "the future's dumbest soap opera". Wolinsky echoes the misgivings about Samus' immaturity, petulant behavior, and misguided loyalty. Tae K. Kim of GamePro writes that while the story and Samus' monologues did not compel them, [...] "it helped contextualize her entire existence" [...] which developed the character to [...] "an actual human being who's using the vastness of space to try and put some distance between herself and the past". Contrarily, Haywald found the portrayal [...] "lifeless and boring" [...] and [...] "nonsensical". G4tv's Abbie Heppe was critical on Samus's portrayal; she wrote that Samus [...] "cannot possibly wield the amount of power she possesses unless directed to by a man", and found that her anxiety attack cannot be reconciled with her previous portrayals. In Zero Punctuation, Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw derided the game's story as a [...] "bloated, cancerous mass [...] turning [...] into a shrieking mimsy in a submissive relationship with a bellend in a fancy cap." [...] Croshaw also states that the gameplay is [...] "infinitely stronger [...] in that it's merely bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1916 {{the young}} {{engineer}} Louis Waldman was approached {{at a meeting}} of his Socialist Party branch and was drafted into becoming a candidate of the party for the New York State Assembly. Although he protested that between his engineering job and his evening studies of law he had no time for campaigning, the party official approaching him smiled and replied, [...] "Campaigning? Who said anything about campaigning? We just want someone to run for office. If <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> than seven hundred votes we'll be lucky. The real campaigns this year will be for Meyer London and Morris Hillquit." [...] And thus was born a Socialist Party politician. Waldman did actually campaign, however, mounting the platform to give public speeches, at which he gradually improved. Waldman performed well in the 1916 election, tripling the Socialist tally while losing to his Democratic opponent by a few hundred votes.|$|E
2500|$|Four demos for {{the album}} were {{recorded}} on August 13, 1990; [...] "Enter Sandman", [...] "The Unforgiven", [...] "Nothing Else Matters" [...] and [...] "Wherever I May Roam." [...] The lead single [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] {{was the first}} song to be written and the last to receive lyrics. On October 4, 1990, a demo of [...] "Sad but True" [...] was recorded. In October 1990, Metallica began recording at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, to record the album, and also at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia for about a week. On June 2, 1991, a demo of [...] "Holier Than Thou" [...] was recorded. Hetfield stated about the recording: [...] "What we really wanted was a live feel. In the past, Lars and I constructed the rhythm parts without Kirk and Jason. This time I wanted to try playing as a band unit in the studio. It lightens things up and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> of a vibe." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on the back of your neck and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{changes have}} been made in the {{prosecution}} and legal representation of indigent defendants since the Gideon decision. The decision created and then expanded the need for public defenders which had previously been rare. For example, immediately following the decision, Florida required public defenders in all of the state's circuit courts. The need for more public defenders also led to a need to ensure that they were properly trained in criminal defense in order to allow defendants to receive as fair a trial as possible. Several states and counties followed suit. [...] Washington D.C., for instance, has created a training program for their public defenders, who must receive rigorous training before they are allowed to represent defendants, and must continue their training in order to remain current in criminal law, procedure, and practices. In 2010, a public defender's office in the South Bronx, The Bronx Defenders, created the Center for Holistic Defense, which has helped other public defender offices, from Montana to Massachusetts, developed a model of public defense called holistic defense or holistic advocacy. In it, criminal defense attorneys work on interdisciplinary teams, alongside civil attorneys, social workers, and legal advocates to help clients with not only direct but also collateral aspects of their criminal cases. More recently the American Bar Association and the National Legal Aid and Defender Association have set minimum training requirements, caseload levels, and experience requirements for defenders. There is often controversy whether case loads set upon public defenders give them enough time to sufficiently defend their clients. [...] Some criticize the mindset in which public defense lawyers encourage their clients to simply plead guilty. Some defenders say this is intended to lessen their own work load, while others would say it is intended to obtain a lighter sentence by negotiating a plea bargain as compared with going to trial and perhaps having a harsher sentence imposed. [...] Tanya Greene, an ACLU lawyer, has said that is why 90 to 95 percent of defendants do plead guilty: [...] "You've got so many cases, limited resources, and there's no relief. You go to work, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> cases. You have to triage." ...|$|E
