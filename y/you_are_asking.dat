For the performance Brown wore {{a black and white}} suit, and was accompanied by a group of robotic dancers dressed in all-white suits adorned with LED lighting for a futuristic Tron-like affect. Prior to the performance some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. Brown was sentenced to five years of probation, ordered to complete more than 1,400 hours of community service and was given a restraining order which required him to stay away from Rihanna. Professional dancer Cheryl Burke told Extra, [...] "As a victim of domestic violence, I don't agree with him coming on the show, but it's out of my control", while host Tom Bergeron told the On Air with Ryan Seacrest radio show that, [...] "I did tell the producers it may be to their advantage to not have me interview him, because my natural tendency would be to say something.

For the performance, Brown wore a tomato red tuxedo and a black shirt and bow tie. The performance started off with a young boy doing break dancing moves and announcing, 'Here is Chris Brown'.

[...] Furthermore, the same organizations donated $1.34 million to the Ohio Republican Party, $1.29 million of which was forwarded directly to Blackwell's campaign fund. Several of the firms which have been awarded contracts from Blackwell's office have also been hired on to his gubernatorial campaign. The investigators argue that the suggestion of quid pro quo based on the actions of contributors raise an issue of a serious conflict of interest. Petro has responded by demanding that a law which bans political contributors from being awarded state contracts. Blackwell has stated that no illegal activity took place.
