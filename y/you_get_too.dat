But if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> close, it can torch you and kill you. But if you just get close enough, it's warm and it's soothing, it's mesmerising and it's peaceful. It can give you everything or destroy you, depending on how smart you are." [...] The cover sleeve was shot by Joshua Jordan.|$|E
500|$|Asked in an {{interview}} if he ever worried about going broke, Keating responded, [...] "All the time, every day. I come into the office with this hollow feeling in my stomach lots of time.... You get trapped almost. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> many responsibilities. It's a bellyfull to carry. It's risky. Dangerous. There's the possibility of failure with it every day and every night. But in a way, it's a challenge. It's invigorating. There isn't any point in not being a player – you're here.... It's not only the money. It's the disgrace, yourself, your manhood. I'm not sure I'd have a big problem with that. On the other hand I'm not sure I wouldn't." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the White House lunch meeting, Leach agreed to abandon the idea that the double eagle design be used for the small gold pieces, and to {{cooperate}} with Bigelow and Pratt in the making of the new coins. [...] Leach even undertook to reimburse Pratt's fee of $300 to Bigelow from government funds. [...] The President wanted to see Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle from the ten-dollar piece adapted in a recessed surface for the smaller pieces, and, if it did not constitute a change of design, used on the ten-dollar piece as well (a project that did not go beyond the talking stage). [...] Bigelow wrote to Pratt on May 1 after conferring with Leach, stating that the Mint Director would likely not object if Pratt were to improve Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle, but [...] "I would not, if I were <b>you,</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> far from the original, as the President likes it. [...] Perhaps you can make him like it better." ...|$|E

500|$|War for Cybertron was {{announced}} December 16, 2009, {{and was released}} in North America on June 22, 2010 with the PAL region release following on June 25, 2010. It is powered by Unreal Engine 3. [...] Physics for the game are handled using the Havok physics library. A demo was released on June 10, 2010 which allowed for players to play various multiplayer matches using two of the game's character classes. [...] Developer High Moon Studios designed the friendly AI so that as a player progresses through the story any accompanying characters will help the player, but still require the player to advance through the game. [...] "The buddies don't advance the story for you. [...] They {{get to the point}} to kinda show you where to go, but then they'll take up defensive positions and wait for you to progress the story" [...] said Game Director Matt Tieger. [...] "They're not finishing objectives for you, but they like to stay near you, they'll heal you if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> wounded, they're pretty smart." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It is instinct... We premeditate at times, {{but most}} {{of those things are}} instinct. When a fast bowler runs in to me, my {{breathing}} is controlled. So you keep a still head, slow down your breathing. Sometimes I actually hold my breath, so I can be as still and well-balanced as possible. If <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> excited, you overreact more, and with the adrenalin, you lose focus quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers {{were mixed}} on {{the opinion of}} the game's visuals. [...] Game Revolution called the {{graphics}} [...] "a vast improvement over the grainy, somewhat choppy visuals of Jet Moto and Jet Moto 2." [...] IGN also praised the Jet Moto 3s visuals, citing a vastly improved framerate and draw distance than Jet Moto and Jet Moto 2. [...] GameSpot, however felt the graphical details were poor, citing that the game's environments were [...] "nice and pretty unless <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> close." [...] The CGI cutscenes were also panned by GameSpot, calling it [...] "frightful" [...] and stating [...] "none of the characters look even fractionally human." ...|$|E

[...] "I begin {{to believe that we}} must wait till a new party rises out of the needs of people, just as the old Free-soil Party rose to free the slaves. Don't deceive {{yourself}} about your party in this State. It is after the offices, just the same as the party you have left. They juggle with the tariffs and the license question, because it helps them. They will drop any question and any man when they {{think they are going to}} lose by retaining him. They will drop you if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> radical. I warn you!" [...] she said, looking up at him and smiling with a touch of bitterness in her smile; [...] "I am dangerous.

6000|$|... "But you do talk well," [...] she insisted. [...] "Just {{think how}} you have {{improved}} {{in the short time}} I have known you. Mr. Butler is a noted public speaker. He is always asked by the State Committee to go out on stump during campaign. Yet you talked just as well as he the other night at dinner. Only he was more controlled. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> excited; but you will get over that with practice. Why, you would make a good public speaker. You can go far--if you want to. You are masterly. You can lead men, I am sure, {{and there is no reason}} why you should not succeed at anything you set your hand to, just as you have succeeded with grammar. You would make a good lawyer. You should shine in politics. There is nothing to prevent you from making as great a success as Mr. Butler has made. And minus the dyspepsia," [...] she added with a smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is perhaps}} the most ingenious thing of all," [...] Jesson replied. [...] "You know that Russia is now {{practically}} a tranquil country, but there are certain bands of the extreme Bolshevistic faction who never gave in to authority and who practically exist in the little-known places by means of marauding expeditions. The mountains about Kroten are supposed to have been infested by these nomadic companies. Whether the outrages set down to them are really committed or not, I don't suppose any one knows, but my point of view is that the presence of these people is absolutely encouraged by the Government, to give them an excuse for the most extraordinary precautions in issuing passports or allowing any one from the outside world to pass into the city. If you get in, I understand you are waited upon by the police within half an hour and have to tell them the story of your past life and your future intentions. After that you are allowed to go about on parole. If <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> inquisitive, you are discovered {{to be in touch with}} the robber bands, and--well--that's an end of you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Claypool {{described}} the duo as [...] "my fuck-off vacation band." [...] He also stated: [...] "I'm getting {{a chance to}} bullshit with the audience.
