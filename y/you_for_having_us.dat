5000|$|Carrington's {{radio show}} on BBC Radio 2 {{entitled}} All Time Greats began on 4 October 1981. It was broadcast {{for two hours}} every Sunday from 1pm. Although initially pre-recorded and broadcast from a BBC studio, his first live broadcast {{from his home in}} Perthshire was on 31 August 1997, this was the day that Diana, Princess of Wales, died and Carrington agreed that it would be inappropriate to use the pre-recorded show on that day. In 2004 it was moved to an hourly slot on a Tuesday evening, and a few years later to a Friday night. The show was called 'The Music Goes Round' with a usual weekly theme of music, an occasional special 50s night and musical nights. He introduced every show with the greeting [...] "Evening all, from home in Perthshire" [...] and then always ended his show with [...] "Bye just now!" [...] and [...] "...of course, thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>us</b> [...] "us" [...] emphasised at your place" [...] not forgetting a reference to his cat, [...] "Golden Paws" [...] Sam. Carrington used his personal collection of some 80,000 CDs, LPs and 78s. When he retired in 2016 the show was still attracting more than 800,000 listeners.|$|E

"Monsieur," [...] {{the one who}} {{had first}} spoken said, now in his native tongue, [...] "we are indebted to <b>you,</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made <b>us</b> laugh, and heaven knows we have had little enough to laugh at today. But how came you here? Your cavalry have taken the upper road. We were drawn up to make a last charge, when we heard them turn off that way; and were, I can tell you, glad enough to get off without more fighting. We have had enough of it for one day." ...|$|R

I wanted to be alone with you for a while today but it’s {{probably}} a good thing I wasn’t. {{there were a couple of}} things I was going to say—nothing important but it’s undoubtedly for the best that we weren’t alone today. What a bunch of moods we went through last night. Just about every one in the books—or don’t they have a book of moods? Gee, honey, you’re so wonderful and patient—I love you so. The more I think about March, the further it seems away. Gee, honey, will it ever get here. Everyone else says it will be here before I know it. I wish I could believe that. Time sure flies when I’m with you but golly, darling, when you’re not around, every minute drags. I love you so, honey. Judson, I know that I’ve never been in love with anyone before. There could never be anyone else for me either, darling. You’ve spoiled me for every other male. There isn’t a man living who could compare to you. I love you so, darling. I only wish that I could show you how much I love you. That’s one thing I’ll never be able to do. I love you so, my darling. Honestly, you’re so sweet and thoughtful. How can anyone be as wonderful as you. Judson, I do hate to be away from you even for a few minutes. These next two months will be murder, darling, I don’t know what I’ll ever do without you for two whole months. Darling, I’m in a rut. I can’t think of anything but you 2 ̆ 6 being near you. That’s the only thing I care to think about, too. Hon, this can’t go on much longer. Golly, I love you so. Weekends go so fast now. This one just flew so awfully fast. Darling, I meant to thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>us</b> up to the Air Show. It was wonderful. Gee, those planes were beautiful. I can understand how you love them so much 2 ̆ 6 I wish I could fly with you. It was a wonderful show 2 ̆ 6 you’re wonderful, too. What a one track mind I have, darling. How do you like this short little letter, my darling? I just go on 2 ̆ 6 on writing to you. You’re so marvelous 2 ̆ 6 I love you. Honey, it just doesn’t seem possible. Really, I was so sure that I never could love you any more than I did before but—well, it’s the same old story. I love you so much more, my darling. It just doesn’t seem possible, honey, that I could love anyone this much. Well, my darling, please write often. I love you so. Oh, tell Steve I’ll try to write him tomorrow. I don’t have anything to tell him, though because I’m in such a fog that I wouldn’t hear anything anyone said to me. What did you do after you left us tonight. Golly, I hated to leave you today, honey. Well, hon, I’ve got to get to sleep. It’s about 7 : 30 and I’ll probably get there about none. I love you. All my love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] {{returned}} Mark, with something of scorn in his tone, [...] "that we <b>have</b> no choice, <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>us</b> at your mercy--we cannot refuse. I suppose {{you are the}} brigand chief, and are guarding us for some sinister purpose of your own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Captain Walsham," [...] {{the commandant}} said. [...] "I am greatly indebted to <b>you,</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> brought <b>us</b> certain news {{of what is}} coming. I will write off at once, and ask for reinforcements. This is a serious expedition, and the colonies {{will have to make}} a great effort, and a speedy one, {{if they are going to}} save the fort, for, from what we hear of Montcalm, he is not likely to let the grass grow under his feet. I shall report the {{services}} you have rendered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy you {{are right}} in that respect," [...] Teddy said gravely, as he {{overhauled}} the stores to procure the food, [...] "and he can't be blamed, <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> put <b>us</b> in a very bad position without even the poor excuse of having tried to benefit the party." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1942, {{when the}} first news about the Holocaust reached the Zionist Jewish {{community}} in British Mandate Palestine, Alterman wrote a poem, which {{can be described as}} a sarcastic paraphrase on the Jewish prayer, [...] "Praised are You ... who <b>has</b> chosen <b>us</b> out of all the nations". In this poem Alterman says, [...] "At our children's cry, shadowed by scaffolds, we heard not the world's furor. <b>For</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> chosen <b>us</b> out of all nations, you loved <b>us</b> and favoured. <b>For</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> chosen <b>us</b> of all nations, of Norwegians, Czechs and Britons. As they march toward scaffolds, Jewish children of reason, they know their blood shan't be reckoned among the rest, they just call to the mother 'turn away your face'." [...] In 1943, Alterman wrote the maqama [...] "The Swedish Tongue", in which he praised Sweden's willingness to welcome Jewish refugees from Denmark.|$|R

5000|$|Well, {{that was}} the last film on Carlton Cinema. It's been almost four-and-a-half years since we first went to air and during that time, we've shown over 4,000 films. We hope you've enjoyed {{watching}} them as much as we've enjoyed showing them. So, from our director of programmes George McKee, myself Fiona Goldman, and all the team here at Carlton Cinema, it's been a great pleasure and thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> been with <b>us.</b> Now, {{all we have to do}} is pick up the popcorn and turn off the lights.|$|R

6000|$|Now when Tristram {{came back}} to the castle of the King of Ireland once more, he thought to enter privily in by the postern-gate as he had gone out. But lo! instead of that he found a great party waiting for him before the castle and these gave him loud acclaim, crying, [...] "Welcome, Sir Tramtris! Welcome, Sir Tramtris!" [...] And King Angus came forward and took the hand of Sir Tristram, and he also said: [...] "Welcome, Sir Tramtris, <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> brought <b>us</b> great honor this day!" ...|$|R

Thank you and goodnight. The song [...] "Promise" [...] plays directly after this, which is then followed by the Tapestry of Nations parade sound track. As the music plays, the continents are laser-projected onto Spaceship Earth, making it appear as a spinning globe.|$|R
40|$|I {{know that}} members of this {{sub-committee}} are deeply committed to ensuring that reform of strategic communication organizational structures and policies remains a top priority for the executive branch. I have to confess that in my former role as a Defense Department official with responsibility {{for a range of}} SC and IO issues, I was not always wholly grateful <b>for</b> your interest: <b>you</b> and your colleagues on the House Appropriations Committee put the Department through the ringer with quite a lot of different reporting requirements. As a citizen, however, I am deeply grateful to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> kept <b>us</b> on our toes— and occasionally held our feet to the fire. This is a vital area, and we can’t afford either to ignore it or rest on our laurels. I would like to begin today by looking briefly at the emergence of the concept of “strategic communication” within the US government, and talk about some drawbacks to the term itself. I’d then like to highlight some of the lessons we can draw from the decade since 9 / 11, and I will close by offering some thoughts on the future...|$|R

"My dear Paul," [...] she said, [...] "I cannot thank <b>you</b> enough <b>for</b> <b>having</b> given <b>us</b> the {{opportunity}} of meeting these most delightful Americans, and I really must tell you this--I had meant {{to keep it a}} secret, but from you I cannot; I knew all the time that the name of Bundercombe was familiar to me, and suddenly it came over me like a flash! Directly I asked Mr. Bundercombe in what part of America his home was, of course it was all clear to me. What a small world it is! Do you know," [...] she concluded impressively, [...] "that it was just these two people, Mr. Bundercombe and his daughter, who were so amazingly kind to Reggie when he was out in the States on his way to Dicky's ranch!" ...|$|R
50|$|Rida {{was born}} in Kirkuk. As a child he would spontaneously break into song in the classroom, {{and he was so}} good that the teacher {{actually}} stopped to listen, even beginning the day by asking, “Rida, what do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> today?” Rida shone in school plays and concerts, and began writing his own songs by the age of ten. His parents encouraged him, buying him instruments, in particular an oud, the principle instrument of Arabic composers. Rida adored classical Iraqi singers Nathem Al Ghazali and Mohammed Al Kubanji. Such elevated, beautiful music afforded the young man refuge from the chaos and oppression of the early Hussein years. At a time when singers were being pressured to sing for the regime, or not at all, Rida kept a low profile, singing, composing and practicing at home.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Macallister fixed {{upon him}} {{the eye of}} the flirt who knows her man. She was of the dark-eyed English type; her eyes were very large and full, and her smooth black hair was drawn flatly backward, and {{fastened}} in a knot just under her dashing fur cap. She wore a fur sack, and she was equipped against the cold as exquisitely as her Southern sisters defend themselves from the summer. Bits of warm color, in ribbon and scarf, flashed out here and there; when she flung open her sack, she showed herself much more lavishly buttoned and bugled and bangled than the Americans. She sat clown on the movable bench which Bartley had vacated, and crossed her feet, very small and saucy, even in their arctics, on a stick of fire-wood, and cast up her neat profile, and rapidly made eyes at every part of the interior. [...] "Why, it's delicious, you know. I never saw anything so comfortable. I want {{to spend the rest of}} me life here, you know." [...] She spoke very far down in her throat, and with a rising inflection in each sentence. [...] "I'm going to have a quarrel with <b>you,</b> Mr. Willett, <b>for</b> not telling me what a delightful surprise <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> here. Oh, but I'd no idea of it, I assure you!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But it is so, Daddy. Of course it's so, and {{you know}} it. If I'm away they'll just pity <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> a bad daughter. And quite right too. I am a bad daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{beginning}} to be thin enough at the top. I am so glad to come to you, and so much obliged to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> me! How well I remember the old room!" ...|$|R
