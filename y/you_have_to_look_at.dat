Among the pieces believed to draw inspiration from [...] "Cog" [...] are a 2003 piece for breakfast cereal Sugar Puffs, Nearness for the Oslo School of Architecture and Design, a 30-second animated advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup, an advertisement for BBC Radio Merseyside football coverage, and the 2007 Tipping Point, advertising Guinness stout. When asked about the similarities between [...] "Cog" [...] and [...] "Tipping Point", Paul Brazier, executive creative director at the advertising agency behind Tipping Point, replied: [...] "I knew the ad was similar in places, but as an executive creative director, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> things like that and make a decision. The fact the TV ad was only part of a huge internet campaign meant that I thought it wasn’t that near [...] "Cog"." ...|$|E
500|$|Within {{hours of}} its launch A Journey became the fastest-selling {{autobiography}} {{of all time}} at bookseller Waterstones, where it sold more copies in one day than Peter Mandelson's [...] had done in its first three weeks earlier that year. It debuted {{at the top of}} Amazon.co.uk's British best-seller list. Within a week, Nielsen BookScan said that 92,000 copies of A Journey had been sold in the United Kingdom, the best opening week for an autobiography since the company began keeping figures in 1998. The New York Times reported that in the United States, an initial print run of 50,000 copies had been extended by another 25,000, with the book set to debut at Number 3 on The New York Times hardcover best-seller list. Andrew Lake, Waterstones' political buyer, said, [...] "Nothing can compare to the level of interest shown in this book. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> hugely successful fiction authors such as Dan Brown or JK Rowling to find books that have sold more quickly on their first day. Mandelson may remain the prince but Blair has reclaimed his title as king, certainly in terms of book sales.|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2015 {{interview}} with PopMatters journalist J.C.

It’s about discovery.

2500|$|Chibnall was {{inspired}} by ITV's hit show Downton Abbey to cast only top actors. [...] "I said, 'We have to have cast as good as Downton. ...That was absolutely my shameless aim, to go, 'Okay, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> our poster and feel that's going to give Downton a run for its money.' [...] " [...] Executive producers Chibnall and Featherstone and producer Richard Stokes held extensive discussions with the casting directors, who then generated lists of potential actors to whom the producers might wish to offer roles or ask to audition. The casting directors also read all the finished scripts, met with location scouts to see photographs of the anticipated location shoots, and had long discussions with various production department heads to gather {{as much information as}} possible so they could choose the right performers to audition. A key rule for the casting team was [...] "no wankers allowed", as Featherstone put it. The production team refused to consider egotistical, obnoxious, vain, temperamental, or arrogant actors for roles, as they felt it made it difficult for both cast and crew to do their best work.|$|E

60|$|We all see, then, {{that the}} problem {{presents}} extraordinary difficulty. How are you going {{in a case like}} the United Provinces, for example, to secure that adequate and substantial representation, which it is the interest and the desire of the Government for its own sake to secure. No fair-minded Moslem would deny in Eastern Bengal, any more than a fair-minded non-Moslem would deny it in the United Provinces, that there is no easy solution. You see, gentlemen, I do not despair of finding a fair-minded man in a controversy of this kind. From information that reaches me I do not at all despair of meeting fair-minded critics of both communities, in spite of the sharp antagonism that exists on many matters between them. But, whatever may be the case with Mahomedans and Hindus, there is one body of men who are bound to keep a fair mind, and that is the Government. The Government are bound, whatever you may do among yourselves, strictly, and I will even say sternly, to insist on overcoming all obstacles in a spirit of absolute equity. Now, what is the object of the Government? It is that the Legislative Councils should represent truly and effectively, with a reasonable approach to the balance of real social forces, the wishes and needs of the communities themselves. That is the object of the Government, and in face of a great problem of that kind, algebra, arithmetic, geometry, logic--none of these things will do your business for you. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it widely and away from those sciences, excellent in their place, but not of much service when you are solving awkward political riddles. I think if you allow some method of leaving to a local authority the power of adding to the number of representatives from the Mahomedan community, or the Hindu community, as the case may be, that might be a possible and prudent way of getting through this embarrassment. Let us all be clear of one thing, namely--and I thought of this when I heard one or two observations that fell from Mr. Ameer Ali--that no general proposition can be wisely based on the possession by either community, either of superior civil qualities or superior personal claims. If you begin to introduce that element, you perceive the perils to that peace and mutual goodwill which we hope to emerge by-and-by, though it may take longer than some think. I repeat that I see no harm {{from the point of view}} of a practical working compromise, in the principle that population, or numerical strength, should be the main factor in determining how many representatives should sit for this or the other community; but modifying influences may be both wisely and equitably taken into account in allotting the numbers of such representatives.|$|E
