500|$|Danish Muslim {{politician}} Naser Khader said, [...] "Muslims {{are no more}} {{discriminated against}} in Denmark than they are elsewhere in Europe... Generally, Danes give you a fair shake. They accept Muslims if you declare that you are loyal to this society, to democracy. If you say that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> of them, they will accept you. If you have reservations, they will worry." [...] His concern has centred {{on the power of}} [...] "Islamism" [...] or fundamentalist political Islam in Denmark's Muslim community which he has tried to fight, especially {{in the wake of the}} controversy by forming an association of democratic, moderate Muslims.|$|E

500|$|The jury {{returned}} guilty verdicts for {{all eight}} defendants. Before being sentenced, Neebe {{told the court}} that Schaack's officers were among the city's worst gangs, ransacking houses and stealing money and watches. Schaack laughed and Neebe retorted, [...] "You need not laugh about it, Captain Schaack. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> of them. You are an anarchist, as you understand it. You are all anarchists, in this sense of the word, I must say." [...] Judge Gary sentenced seven of the defendants to death by hanging and Neebe to 15 years in prison. The sentencing provoked outrage from labor and workers' movements and their supporters, resulting in protests around the world, and elevating the defendants {{to the status of}} martyrs, especially abroad. Portrayals of the anarchists as bloodthirsty foreign fanatics in the press along with the 1889 publication of Captain Schaack's sensational account, Anarchy and Anarchism, on the other hand, inspired widespread public fear and revulsion against the strikers and general anti-immigrant feeling, polarizing public opinion.|$|E
500|$|As captain, Johnson {{was noted}} for his public {{relations}} skills and his gift for public speaking. [...] He was optimistic by nature, with {{a belief in}} [...] "guts and determination". [...] However, he was seen as insensitive at times; Bill Johnston took offence when Johnson attempted to rouse him during a practise session: [...] "Just cos <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> of the old blokes in the side doesn't mean you don't have to bloody well put in you know." [...] At times his optimism could appear artless and naive. Ian Craighis successor as Australian captainwas critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: [...] "I don't think [...] was ever realistic about the situation. [...] I supposed he felt obliged to make rallying speeches, but the team {{knew what was going}} on." [...] Pat Crawford felt [...] "Johnson couldn't get anything out of the players, whereas the guys would have busted a gut for [...] ". [...] He was seen by some of his team mates as [...] "dictatorial" [...] with [...] Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead-in match before 1956 Test series in England.|$|E
500|$|Saint-Saëns {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878. In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday. On 28 July he {{disappeared}} from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say {{that he would not be}} returning. They never saw each other again. Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five. Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman. Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women. After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle. Marie told him, [...] "For us <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here." ...|$|E

500|$|Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch who {{praised the}} iPhone 5S {{as the best}} {{smartphone}} available said [...] "looks may not {{be different from the}} iPhone 5, but the internal components have a dramatic impact on day-to-day activities normal for a smartphone user," [...] and went into detail explaining the impact of the improved camera and specifications on the phone. Etherington suggested that the 64-bit A7 processor will not reach its full potential until developers create applications supporting it. Myriam Joire of Engadget found that the iPhone 5S could benefit significantly from the A7 if developers created applications optimized for the 64-bit processor. Anand Lal Shimpi of AnandTech praised the phone's A7 processor, describing it as [...] "seriously impressive", and stated that it was the most [...] "futureproof of any iPhone ever launched. As much as it pains me to use the word futureproof, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> of those people who likes to hold onto their device for a while - the iPhone 5S is as good a starting point as any." [...] Scott Lowe of IGN also speaking highly of its 64-bit processor, [...] "which has a substantial lead in processing power over the HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4, accounting for a graphics boost of up to 32% and 38% in CPU benchmarks." [...] The debut of Apple's 64-bit A7 processor took rival Android smartphone makers by surprise, particularly Qualcomm whose own 64-bit system-on-chip was not released until 2015.|$|E
500|$|Jervis {{could also}} be {{exceptionally}} kind when {{he felt that the}} situation warranted it. On one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers told him and St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. [...] "Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?" [...] The man told him what had happened and St Vincent replied [...] "Roger Odell <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> of the best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life I never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!" [...] The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor [...] "but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir".|$|E

He knows, he knows." [...] The rapid progress made by Cole in his debut season for Arsenal [...] "surprised" [...] Wenger and prompted {{him to make the}} defender his first pick. Sylvinho, the player displaced, commented that Wenger's belief in Cole helped him to develop {{as a player}}: [...] "He spoke to [...] and said: 'After Silvinho you can play left-back. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> of the best left-backs at the club and one day {{will be one of the}} best in the world.'" [...] Cole's link-up play with winger Robert Pirès and main striker Thierry Henry in a 4–4–2 formation effectively made him [...] "a wing-back or winger playing in a back four" [...] because Arsenal's game emphasised attacking football.|$|E
