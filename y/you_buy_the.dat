25|$|The {{popularity}} of the term fractional ownership has caused extensive rebranding in other industries where similar concepts, such as real estate timeshares, were already well established. The main distinction between timeshare and fractional ownership is that with a timeshare <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> right to use a property, but with fractional ownership, you are buying real estate. You get a deeded piece of real estate, just not for the entire parcel.|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review and awarded it three stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's balance {{of humor and}} horror, noting [...] "Although 'Leonard Betts' is not a comedy, the three writers take such pleasure in the story that <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> situation. There's a lot of situational (and scary) humor in the script." [...] Furthermore, she noted that the ending revelation that Scully has cancer and the following conversation between Mulder and Scully was [...] "one of the season's best scenes." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the [...] "amiable quality to the story which makes its finale moments all the more of {{a kick in the}} teeth." [...] Shearman and Pearson noted that [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was the first episode [...] "to come along [...] which feels light and frothy, and it deliberately makes the unkindest cut of all." ...|$|E
500|$|Phil Gallo of Variety called Veronica Mars [...] "the smartest teen-oriented drama since Freaks and Geeks". He enjoyed Bell's acting, {{describing}} her [...] "as charismatic {{as she is}} tough and intelligent, giving a multilayered perf that touches on simple 17-year-old insecurity and convincingly incorporates deeper issues concerning family, love and disappointment." [...] Gallo discussed the pilot's reliance on flashbacks and voiceover, and felt that neither {{got in the way}} of the storytelling or felt too obvious. He praised Thomas' writing of the [...] "fine script" [...] and Piznarski's directing. Robert Bianco of USA Today felt that Veronica Mars was more akin to Buffy Summers than Nancy Drew, with [...] "sharp wits, steely nerves and a wicked sense of humor". Bianco praised Bell's portrayal of the character, saying [...] "whether <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> idea of teen crime-solvers or not, there's no questioning Bell's credentials as a TV star." [...] Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that the pilot was [...] "showing signs of being network television's next Buffy", emanating from a tough, emotionally battered heroine. McFarland found the acting to be fantastic, and said that Bell and Colantoni [...] "create a wonderful father-daughter dynamic". Samantha Bonar of the Los Angeles Times thought that the writing was clever, and praised Bell ability to channel charisma, smarts and frustration.|$|E

60|$|It is {{nonsense}} {{to talk of}} France as the seat of all civility. Did not those French heathen have a Salique law? Three of the most bewitching creatures,--immortal flowers {{of the line of}} Valois--were excluded from the French throne by that infamous provision.

Here is cause for universal war. See how vilely nations, as well as men, assume and wear unchallenged the choicest titles, however without merit. The Americans, and not the French, are the world's models of chivalry. Our Salique Law provides that universal homage shall be paid all beautiful women. No man's most solid rights shall weigh against her airiest whims.
