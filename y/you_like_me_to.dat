2500|$|And so, girls, when fucking time comes… not {{the faintest}} whiff of it anywhere, right? From the time those Milesians betrayed us, we can’t even find our eight-fingered leather dildos. At least they’d {{serve as a}} sort of flesh-replacement for our poor cunts… [...] So, then! Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> find some {{mechanism}} by which we could end this war? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I won't,' said Logan. 'Horrid bad habit. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{send out}} for smelling-salts? Be a man, Merton! Pull {{yourself}} together!' ...|$|E
6000|$|So the jackal {{came up to}} the panther, {{and asked}} politely, 'Panther, would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> look after your {{children}} while you are out hunting?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have, and yet.... But I don't accuse you, dearest. Yes, {{you have}} given me pleasure. One truly {{pleasant}} time was when we stood together in the summer-house {{on the evening of}} the garden-party, and <b>you</b> said <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> love you.' ...|$|R
500|$|How {{is it that}} <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> leave so many goods behind? ...|$|R
6000|$|For which Amerigo's answer again {{took him}} a moment. [...] "Ah, the dear old boy! <b>You</b> would <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> propose him something--?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> lead gently {{up to what}} I want to say, {{gradually}} preparing you for {{the reception}} of the news, or shall I--?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You really aren't {{responsible}} in the least," [...] Jessie declared. [...] "Still, I {{can understand the}} idea troubling you. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> help you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know if I do," [...] Jim rejoined. [...] "Sometimes I'm too savage; I'm rather savage now. But don't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be polite?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{tears came}} into her eyes, and she said with indignant resentment: [...] "Patrick didn't know I was here when he brought him in; I'm sure I should have been glad to go, when you began raging at him, papa, if I could. It wasn't very {{pleasant}} to hear you. I won't come any more, if you don't want <b>me</b> <b>to.</b> I thought <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be here. <b>You</b> said you did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so, uncle? Why, it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{know all about}} you, {{just the same as}} if we had always been together, and I am sure I always told you all about myself, even when I was bad at school and got into scrapes, because you said {{particularly}} that <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> everything, {{and did not want to}} know only the good side of me." ...|$|R
5000|$|The lyrics [...] "Ill {{make love}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> / And Ill hold you tight, baby, all" [...] are sung {{by a group}} of {{penguins}} in the animated film Happy Feet (2006).|$|R
6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{help you}} tonight?" [...] she asked brightly. [...] "I thought I would {{ask if there}} was {{anything}} you wanted me to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{teach you}} a story? But you must {{remember}} it, you know, {{and be able to}} tell it right to somebody else afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{are many}} {{difficulties}} which you cannot understand, which prevent me. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{shut the door}} which God has opened to so many dark lands?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> indeed <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{be always}} with you? <b>To</b> <b>me</b> {{it would be}} a {{happiness}} unspeakable; and to you, what would it be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to go}} home," [...] said Joan. [...] "I {{feel that}} I can’t breathe in this dreary place. <b>You</b> wouldn’t <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> die, would you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} Fairy to Beauty, [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> send {{for all your}} {{brothers}} and sisters to dance at your wedding?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you like}} me," [...] he asked hesitatingly, [...] "supposing I get away early--would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{come in and}} say good night to you later on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I wish I had not {{to admit}} it, but I feel that Violet is right,” he said. “Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> drive over with you, my dear?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I 'll write to-night. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{tell the}} girls about Trix and Sydney?" [...] she {{asked as she}} rose, feeling that the council was over.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do so?' said Robert, in {{the quiet}} matter-of-course way of one to whom painful offices had become well-nigh natural.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you were}} fools in doing the thing, because you miscalculated and blundered, <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> think <b>you</b> are not murderers in intention. And besides--The rest?" ...|$|R
6000|$|BLOOM: (With a sour tenderish smile) A little frivol, shall we, {{if you are}} so inclined? Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> perhaps <b>to</b> embrace <b>you</b> {{just for}} a {{fraction}} of a second? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thought I might cheer you up," [...] said Luke, appearing. [...] "How would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play 'The Girl I Left Behind Me,' or {{something}} like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{tell you}} another story? It {{is about a}} little girl. Well, {{there was once a}} {{minister}} and his wife, and they hadn't no little girls, but just little boys, and God was sorry for them, so He put a little girl in a cabbage in the garden, and when they found her they were glad. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell you who the little girl was? Well, it was me, and, ugh! I was awful cold in the cabbage. Do you like that story?" ...|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL, petting her, 'There, there, you foolish woman. Joy {{will come}} in the morning; I never was surer of anything. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take you home now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have here," [...] he continued, [...] "Lord Leslie's will, and {{instructions}} {{as to his}} burial. I presume <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take entire charge of all the arrangements?" ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. Surely {{you can say}} {{anything}} <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> without hesitation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I said, [...] "he {{was here}} a minute ago, and I saw him follow a gentleman away. I think I could find him {{for you if}} <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> try." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take a sip at {{the glass}} first?" [...] inquired Rosa, coming back {{carefully}} with a brimming glass, [...] "just {{to give it a}} flavour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{never saw}} me engaged before! That's {{the way all}} girls act--if they get the chance. Don't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be so?" [...] she asked, with quick anxiety.|$|E
6000|$|... "No matter. I am {{to blame}} for it when it did happen; and now you will never hear another word from me. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> swear it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> ask Verena {{to spend}} a month with me--it might {{be a way of}} {{attracting}} you to the house," [...] Adeline went on, in the tone of exuberant provocation.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{two were}} so close about him that I thought <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be the same," [...] returns that old bird with a {{secretly}} glistening eye. [...] "Besides, I wasn't proud of him." ...|$|R
