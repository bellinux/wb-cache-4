The response to Gonzales's testimony by those Senators serving on both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees was one of disbelief. Russ Feingold, {{who is a member}} of both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, said, [...] "I believe <b>your</b> <b>testimony</b> is misleading at best," [...] which Sheldon Whitehouse—also a member of both committees—concurred with, saying, [...] "I have exactly the same perception."

[...] Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said, [...] "I just don't trust you," [...] and urged Gonzales to carefully review {{his testimony}}. [...] The ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter, said to Gonzales, [...] "Your credibility has been breached to the point of being actionable." [...] Leahy and Specter's comments were interpreted as warnings that Gonzales might have been perjuring himself. [...] After the meeting, Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller said Gonzales was being [...] "untruthful." [...] Rockefeller's sentiments were echoed by Jane Harman, a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, who accused Gonzales of [...] "selectively declassifying information to defend his own conduct." ...|$|E

He called her autopsy [...] "shoddy," [...] {{saying it was}} a failure that Caylee's skull was not opened during her examination. [...] "You need to examine the whole body in an autopsy," [...] he said. Spitz stated {{that he was not}} allowed to attend Garavaglia's initial autopsy on Caylee's remains, and that, from his own follow-up autopsy, he was not comfortable ruling the child's death a homicide. He said he could not determine what Caylee Anthony's manner of death was, but said that there was no indication to him that she was murdered. Additionally, Spitz testified that he believed the duct tape found on Caylee's skull was placed there after the body decomposed, opining that if tape was placed on the skin, there should have been DNA left on it, and suggested that someone may have staged some of the crime scene photos. [...] "The person who took this picture, the person who prepared this, put the hair there," [...] stated Spitz. When asked by Ashton during cross-examination, [...] "So <b>your</b> <b>testimony</b> is the medical examiner's personnel took the hair that wasn't on the skull, placed it there?", Spitz answered, [...] "It wouldn't be the first time, sir.

5000|$|After World War II, {{censorship}} {{was often}} linked with patriotism. The McCarthy era and the Cold War had begun. [...] Communist and leftist literature was frequently challenged, as was literature on feminism, sex education, critiques of capitalism, and civil rights. In Alabama, a controversial new law required [...] "that every book used in college or public school…was {{to be labeled}} {{to indicate that the}} author was or was not an advocate of Communism…" [...] Pressure was applied to New Jersey libraries by the Sons of the American Revolution for similar labeling. The group also insisted on an application of sorts to gain access to Communist literature which they felt [...] "should not be freely available in libraries…" [...] This [...] "dark…very unfortunate chapter in American history" [...] included public, private, or often secret interrogations of American citizens. Led by Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy, it was a modern-day witch hunt of sorts in that an individual American's intellectual thought was suspect and invoking the Fifth Amendment right was often detrimental. This is verified with McCarthy's interrogation of one New York City teacher: According to the transcript, McCarthy asked an aide to transmit the testimony to the city's board of education. [...] "I assume with this testimony they will discharge this man," [...] McCarthy said. He turned to the teacher and added, [...] "I may say <b>your</b> wife's <b>testimony</b> is being transmitted to the board of education also. I assume she will be discharged too." [...] Moore explores the story in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, of Free Public librarian Ruth Brown, in his book Issues of Freedom in American Libraries (1964). Moore states, [...] "so many threats to the freedom to read occurred during the early 1950s." [...] Although Brown was not under suspicion for being a Communist, she had included magazines such as the New Republic, The Nation and Soviet Russia Today in the library collection. A group called the Citizens' Committee filed a complaint which was investigated by the city. The City Commission sided with the Citizens' Committee but was unable to impose consequences, especially since Brown had the support of the library board. The City Commission repealed an ordinance that then allowed them to [...] "assume control of the library." [...] They were able to overrule the library board and fire Brown. Moore declares that although this particular story is all but forgotten, [...] "her case did more…than any other in our time to shock librarians…into examining their beliefs in intellectual freedom." ...|$|R
6000|$|No one {{can find}} fault with {{democratic}} sentiment of this kind, nor with the generous commonplaces of the moralist, about virtue being the only claim to honour, and vice the only true source of shame and inferiority. But neither Diderot nor Voltaire ever allowed himself to flatter the crowd for qualities which the crowd can scarcely possess. The little article on Multitude seems merely inserted {{for the sake of}} buffeting unwarranted pretensions. [...] "Distrust the judgment of the multitude in all matters of reasoning and philosophy; there its voice is the voice of malice, folly, inhumanity, irrationality, and prejudice. Distrust it again in things that suppose much knowledge or a fine taste. The multitude is ignorant and dulled. Distrust it in morality; it is not capable of strong and generous actions; it rather wonders at such actions than approves them; heroism is almost madness in its eyes. Distrust it in the things of sentiment; is delicacy of sentiment so common a thing that you can accord it to the multitude? In what then is the multitude right? In everything, but only {{at the end of a}} very long time, because then it has become an echo, repeating the judgment of a small number of sensible men who shape the judgment of posterity for it beforehand. If you have on <b>your</b> side the <b>testimony</b> of <b>your</b> conscience, and against you that of the multitude, take comfort and be assured that time does justice." [...] It is far from being a universal gift among men of letters and others to unite this fastidious estimation of the incapacity of the crowd in the higher provinces of the intellectual judgment, with a fervid desire that the life of the crowd should be made worthy of self-respecting men.|$|R

60|$|And now, my lord, though I have endeavoured {{to answer}} your commands; yet I could not answer it to the world, nor to my conscience, if I gave not <b>your</b> lordship my <b>{{testimony}}</b> of being the best husband now living: I say my testimony only; for the praise of it is given you by yourself. They who despise the rules of virtue both in their practice and their morals, will think this a very trivial commendation. But I think it the peculiar happiness of the Countess of Abingdon to have been so truly loved by you while she was living, and so gratefully honoured after she was dead. Few there are who have either had, or could have, such a loss; and yet fewer who carried their love and constancy beyond the grave. The exteriors of mourning, a decent funeral, and black habits, are the usual stints of common husbands: and perhaps their wives deserve no better than to be mourned with hypocrisy, and forgot with ease. But you have distinguished yourself from ordinary lovers, by a real and lasting grief for the deceased; and by endeavouring to raise for her the most durable monument, which is that of verse. And so it would have proved, if the workman had been equal to the work, and your choice of the artificer as happy as your design. Yet, as Phidias, when {{he had made the}} statue of Minerva, could not forbear to engrave his own name, as author of the piece: so give me leave to hope, that, by subscribing mine to this poem, I may live by the goddess, and transmit my name to posterity by the memory of hers. It is no flattery to assure your lordship, that she is remembered, in the present age, by all who have had the honour of her conversation and acquaintance; and that I have never been in any company since the news of her death was first brought me, where they have not extolled her virtues, and even spoken the same things of her in prose, which I have done in verse.|$|R
6000|$|I am {{bound to}} tell you that I don't think your letter makes out any sort of case for the bad manners of [...] "Boon," [...] as far as your indulgence in them at the expense of your poor old H. J. is concerned--I say [...] "your" [...] simply because he has been yours, in the most liberal, continual, sacrificial, the most admiring and abounding {{critical}} way, ever since he began to know your writings: as to which you have had copious <b>testimony.</b> <b>Your</b> comparison of the book to a waste-basket strikes me as the reverse of felicitous, for what one throws into that receptacle is exactly what one doesn't commit to publicity and make the affirmation of one's estimate of one's contemporaries by. I should liken it much rather to the preservative portfolio or drawer in which what is withheld from the basket is savingly laid away. Nor do I feel it anywhere evident that my [...] "view of life and literature," [...] or what you impute to me as such, is carrying everything before it and becoming a public menace--so unaware do I seem, on the contrary, that my products constitute an example in any measurable degree followed or a cause in any degree successfully pleaded: I can't but think that if this were the case I should find it somewhat attested in their circulation--which, alas, I have reached a very advanced age in the entirely defeated hope of. But I have no view of life and literature, I maintain, other than that our form of the latter in especial is admirable exactly by its range and variety, its plasticity and liberality, its fairly living on the sincere and shifting experience of the individual practitioner. That is why I have always so admired your so free and strong application of it, the particular rich receptacle of intelligences and impressions emptied out with an energy of its own, that your genius constitutes; and that is in particular why, in my letter of two or three days since I pronounced it curious and interesting that you should find the case I constitute myself only ridiculous and vacuous to the extent of your having to proclaim your sense of it. The curiosity and the interest, however, in this latter connection are of course for my mind those of the break of perception (perception of the veracity of my variety) {{on the part of a}} talent so generally inquiring and apprehensive as yours. Of course for myself I live, live intensely and am fed by life, and my value, whatever it be, is in my own kind of expression of that. Therefore I am pulled up to wonder by the fact that for you my kind (my sort of sense of expression and sort of sense of life alike) doesn't exist; and that wonder is, I admit, a disconcerting comment on my idea of the various appreciability of our addiction to the novel and of all the personal and intellectual history, sympathy and curiosity, behind the given example of it. It is when that history and curiosity have been determined in the way most different from my own that I want to get at them--precisely for the extension of life, which is the novel's best gift. But that is another matter. Meanwhile I absolutely dissent from the claim that there are any differences whatever in the amenability to art of forms of literature aesthetically determined, and hold your distinction between a form that is (like) painting and a form that is (like) architecture for wholly null and void. There is no sense in which architecture is aesthetically [...] "for use" [...] that doesn't leave any other art whatever exactly as much so; and so far from that of literature being irrelevant to the literary report upon life, and to its being made as interesting as possible, I regard it as relevant in a degree that leaves everything else behind. It is art that makes life, makes interest, makes importance, for our consideration and application of these things, and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process. If I were Boon I should say that any pretence of such a substitute is helpless and hopeless humbug; but I wouldn't be Boon for the world, and am only yours faithfully, ...|$|R
