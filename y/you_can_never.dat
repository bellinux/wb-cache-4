You take it with you; it’s under your fingernails; it’s in the hair follicles; it’s {{in the way you}} smile; it’s in the ride of your hips, in the passage of your breasts; it’s all there, no matter where you go. You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.|$|E

So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E

His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: [...] "Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'"

500|$|Odyssey Number Five was Powderfinger's {{shortest}} album when recorded, {{running for}} approximately 45 minutes. The {{focus of the}} album was on restraint, with more simplistic lyrics than previously, and with a plain and simple message intended. Fanning said of his songwriting ethic: [...] "You try and make it something that’s got some substance, but also, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> do that {{at the cost of}} it having relevance to what you’re singing." [...] Powderfinger manager Paul Piticco commented that [...] "their ethos is to be pushing the limits of their songwriting ability".|$|E

It's like watching the sinking of the Titanic. The problem is that the iceberg is the guys who built the ship [...] the producers. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> trust producers.

2500|$|Wood {{struggled}} {{to be as}} efficient {{as possible in the}} often low-paying comics industry. Over time he created a series of layout techniques sketched on pieces of paper which he taped up near his drawing table. These [...] "visual notes," [...] collected on three pages, reminded Wood (and select assistants he showed the pages to) of various layouts and compositional techniques to keep his pages dynamic and interesting. (In the same vein, Wood also taped up another note to himself: [...] "Never draw anything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> copy, <b>never</b> copy anything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> trace, <b>never</b> trace anything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> cut out and paste up.") ...|$|R

500|$|James Berardinelli observed, [...] "Catch Me if <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>never</b> takes {{itself or}} its {{subjects}} too seriously, and contains more genuinely funny material than about 90% {{of the so-called}} 'comedies' found in multiplexes these days". In addition Berardinelli praised John Williams' film score, which he felt was [...] "more intimate and jazzy than his usual material, evoking (intentionally) Henry Mancini". Peter Travers was one of few who gave the film a negative review. Travers considered Catch Me if You Can to be [...] "bogged down over 140 minutes. A film that took off like a hare on speed ends like a winded tortoise." ...|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{made his}} directorial debut in 2003 {{with the film}} The Big Empty, {{starring}} actors Daryl Hannah and Jon Favreau, and became fascinated by the usage of the word [...] "fuck". In {{an interview with the}} Democrat and Chronicle, Anderson suggested he cursed a lot more than he used to after the film's production. He decided to research the film's topic due to the word's versatility and his interest in language as a writer. Early exposure by Anderson to public perception of the word [...] "fuck" [...] came from Class Clown by comedian George Carlin, which included his monologue [...] "Seven Words <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Never</b> Say on Television".|$|E
500|$|The film next {{features}} author Hunter S. Thompson in {{his final}} documented interview. Fuck later includes archival footage of comedians Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, {{and analysis of the}} word's use in popular culture, from MASH (1970) to Scarface (1983) and Clerks (1994). Carlin's 1972 monologue [...] "Seven Words <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Never</b> Say on Television" [...] is excerpted in the film. [...] Journalist Sam Donaldson comments on the versatility of [...] "fuck": [...] "It's one of those all-purpose words."

500|$|The {{gameplay}} generally received {{praise from}} reviewers, with some caveats. While IGN's Steve Butts [...] "loved" [...] the game's new units and operations, he complained of a predictability in the missions, {{asking for more}} surprises. GameSpot's Jason Ocampo agreed, noting that the [...] "campaigns feature familiar plot twists", while praising the [...] "new twists" [...] on the Age of Empires series-style gameplay.

Sahota stated that he {{was under the impression that}} Lohan chose to participate in the documentary [...] "as a result of working in an adult world since she was ten, she feels childhood is precious, and when you lose one <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> replace those years". He also stated that the people they met in rural India were not previously familiar with Lohan.|$|E
500|$|Side two {{begins with}} Florence Kaye and Bernie Baum's [...] "Power of My Love". The song has a blues-based sound, with Presley {{backed by a}} brass section, drums and {{electric}} guitar and organ. The lyrics include double entendres ("Crush it, kick it / <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> win / I know baby you can't lick it/ I'll make you give in)", with groans by backing female singers emphasizing sexuality. The second track, a cover of John Hartford's [...] "Gentle on My Mind" [...] follows. The string-laden arrangement was inspired by Glen Campbell's 1967 Grammy-winning version of the song. The next song, Eddy Arnold's 1962 hit [...] "After Loving You", is arranged in a 12/8 tempo rhythm-and-blues style. This is followed by Dallas Frazier's [...] "True Love Travels on a Gravel Road" [...] and Chuck Jackson's 1962 hit, [...] "Any Day Now".|$|E

500|$|Graphs {{in which}} {{vertices}} represent events occurring at a definite time, {{and where the}} edges are always point from the early time vertex to a late time vertex of the edge, are necessarily directed and acyclic. The lack of a cycle follows because the time associated with a vertex always increases as you follow any path in the graph so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> return to a vertex on a path. [...] This reflects our natural intuition that causality means events can only affect the future, they never affect the past, and thus we have no causal loops. An example {{of this type of}} directed acyclic graph are those encountered in the causal set approach to quantum gravity though in this case the graphs considered are transitively complete. The version history example, each version of the software is associated with a unique time, typically the time the version was saved, committed or released. For citation graphs, the documents are published at one time and can only refer to older documents.|$|E

He later commented, [...] "I felt like I was definitely robbed [...] I was the best new artist this year." [...] After the 2006 Grammy nominations were released, West said he would [...] "really have a problem" [...] if he did not win the Album of the Year, saying, [...] "I don't care what I do, I don't care how much I stunt – <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> take away from the amount of work I put into it.
