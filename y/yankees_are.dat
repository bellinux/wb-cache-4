5|$|The New York <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> a {{professional}} baseball team {{based in the}} Bronx, New York. They compete in the East Division of Major League Baseball's (MLB) American League (AL). The club began play in 1903 as the Highlanders, after owners Frank Farrell and William S. Devery had bought the defunct Baltimore Orioles and moved the team to New York City; in 1913, the team changed its nickname to the Yankees. From 1903 to 2017, the franchise has won more than 10,000 games and 27 World Series championships. The list below documents players and teams that hold particular club records.|$|E

5|$|The longest-tenured {{general manager}} in team history is Ed Barrow, {{who served in}} that role for 23 years. He was {{inducted}} in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953. The longest-tenured owner in team history is George Steinbrenner, who was the team's principal owner from 1973 {{until his death in}} 2010. The <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> currently overseen by Hal Steinbrenner, who owns the team in conjunction with his brother Hank Steinbrenner, and GM Brian Cashman.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for their 1998 season, the Yankees replaced general manager Bob Watson with Brian Cashman. The club made many player acquisitions, gaining {{the services of}} third baseman Scott Brosius, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, and starting pitcher Orlando Hernández. The Yankees won 28 of their first 37 games—a stretch that concluded with a perfect game pitched by Wells—and by August were 76–27. The 1998 <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> considered by some writers {{to be among the}} greatest teams in baseball history, having compiled a then-AL record of 114 regular-season wins against 48 losses. After playoff series wins over the Texas Rangers and Indians, New York defeated the San Diego Padres in four consecutive World Series games for their 24th Series title.|$|E
5|$|DiMaggio {{played his}} final MLB season in 1951, while highly touted outfielder Mickey Mantle made his debut for New York. Pitcher Allie Reynolds threw two no-hitters during 1951, as the Yankees claimed the AL pennant {{for the third}} {{straight}} year. They then won the 1951 World Series against the Giants, four games to two. When their 1952 team took the AL pennant, the Yankees had an opportunity to match the four straight World Series championships won by the team from 1936 to 1939. In another Yankees–Dodgers matchup, New York fell behind three games to two, but victories in games six and seven gave the Yankees the title. New York and Brooklyn were matched again in the 1953 World Series, and a Billy Martin base hit that decided the sixth and final game of the Series gave the Yankees another four games to two victory and a fifth title in a row. As of 2016, the 1949–1953 <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> the only MLB teams to win five straight World Series; no team since has won more than three in a row.|$|E

5|$|The New York <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> a Major League Baseball (MLB) {{franchise}} {{based in}} The Bronx, New York City, New York. They {{play in the}} American League East division. The {{first game of the}} new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Yankees have used 57 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 110seasons. Since the franchise's beginning in , the 58 starters have a combined Opening Day record of 57wins, 36losses, 1tie (57–36–1), and 17no decisions. No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game. Although in modern baseball, ties are rare due to extra innings, in 1910, New York's Opening Game against the Boston Red Sox was declared a tie due to darkness – at the time, Hilltop Park had lacked adequate lighting.|$|E
5|$|After the 1998 season, Wells {{was traded}} to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roger Clemens, who had just {{completed}} two consecutive Cy Young Award-winning seasons. In a regular season that included another perfect game by a Yankees pitcher, this one by David Cone, New York led the AL East with 98 wins and beat the Rangers in the ALDS. This led to an ALCS against the rival Red Sox. New York won the first two games en route to a 4–1 series win, and went on to sweep the Braves in the 1999 World Series. The postseason results gave the 1998–99 Yankees a 22–3 playoff record, and the team held a 12-game winning streak in World Series competition dating back to 1996. Although the 2000 Yankees had an 87–74 regular season record that was the worst among playoff qualifiers, the team won consecutive playoff series to claim the AL championship. New York's pennant placed them in the 2000 World Series against the cross-town Mets, the first Subway Series in 44 years. With a four games to one victory, the Yankees gained their third successive title. As of 2016, the 2000 <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> the most recent MLB team to repeat as World Series champions and the Yankees of 1998–2000 are the last team to win three consecutive World Series.|$|E

25|$|Like its predecessor, the new Yankee Stadium {{hosted the}} World Series {{in its very}} first season; in the 2009 World Series, the Yankees {{defeated}} the Philadelphia Phillies 4 games to 2. It also became the latest stadium to host a World Series-clinching victory by its home team in the venue's first season (after the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series at Busch Stadium in 2006), when, on November 4, 2009, the Yankees won their 27th World Series championship against the Phillies. The <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> the only team to inaugurate two stadiums with World Series wins and also appeared in the 1976 World Series following the refurbishment of the original Yankee Stadium, losing to the Big Red Machine in four straight.

500|$|Outfielder Johnny Damon said of Boone's home run: [...] "If we do {{advance to}} the World Series and win, it's a better story that we went through New York. We needed to get back here. This is {{where a lot of}} hearts were broken, and we're in a perfect seat to stop the hurting." [...] Damon told USA Today: [...] "If we are going to win the World Series, it's better to beat the Yankees to get there. Otherwise, {{everybody}} will say, 'Well, you didn't have to face the Yankees.' I think we have the best team, so I hope the best team wins. But the <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> no slouches.

500|$|The New York <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> a Major League Baseball (MLB) {{franchise}} {{based in}} The Bronx, New York. They {{play in the}} American League East division. Since the institution of Major League Baseball's Rule 4 Draft, the Yankees have selected 46 players in the first round. Officially known as the [...] "First-Year Player Draft", the Rule 4 Draft is Major League Baseball's primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams. The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick. In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.|$|E

500|$|The name of {{the team}} was at first left up to Brown, who {{rejected}} calls {{for it to be}} christened the Browns. McBride then held a contest to name the team in May 1945; [...] "Cleveland Panthers" [...] was the winning choice, but Brown rejected it because it was the name of an earlier failed football team. [...] "That old Panthers team failed", Brown said. [...] "I want no part of that name." [...] In August, McBride gave in to popular demand and christened the team the Browns, despite Paul Brown's objections. With the roster fixed and the team's name chosen, Brown set out to build a dynasty. [...] "I want to be what the New York <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> in baseball or Ben Hogan is in golf", he said.|$|E
500|$|The New York <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> a Major League Baseball {{franchise}} {{based in}} the New York City borough of The Bronx. Also known in their early years as the [...] "Baltimore Orioles" [...] (1901–02) and the [...] "New York Highlanders" [...] (1903–12), the Yankees have had ten pitchers throw eleven no-hitters in franchise history. A no-hitter is officially recognized by Major League Baseball only [...] "...when a pitcher (or pitchers) allows no hits during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings. In a no-hit game, a batter may reach base via a walk, an error, a hit by pitch, a passed ball or wild pitch on strike three, or catcher's interference". No-hitters of less than nine complete innings were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form. A no-hitter is rare enough that the San Diego Padres {{have never had a}} pitcher accomplish the feat. Three perfect games, a special subcategory of no-hitter, have been pitched in Yankees history. As defined by Major League Baseball, [...] "in a perfect game, no batter reaches any base {{during the course of the}} game." [...] This feat was achieved by Don Larsen in 1956, David Wells in 1998, and David Cone in 1999. Wells later claimed he was a [...] "little hung-over" [...] while throwing his perfect game.|$|E
500|$|In total, 29 {{players have}} reached the 50 home run club in MLB history and nine have done so more than once. [...] Of these, {{seventeen}} were right-handed batters, eleven were left-handed, and one was a switch hitter, meaning he could bat from {{either side of the}} plate. [...] Four of these players (including two active members of the 50 home run club) have played for only one major league team. [...] The New York <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> the only franchise to have five players reach the milestone while on their roster: Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Alex Rodriguez, and Aaron Judge. [...] Ten players are also members of the 500 home run club and two of them (Willie Mays and Rodriguez) are also members of the 3,000 hit club. [...] Ten players won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in the same year as their 50 home run season. [...] Mantle is the only player to have earned the Major League Triple Crown alongside achieving 50 home runs, leading both leagues in batting average, home runs and runs batted in (RBI). [...] Mantle and Maris—collectively known as the M Boys—are the only teammates to reach the 50 home run club in the same season, hitting a combined 115 home runs in 1961 and breaking the single-season record for home runs by a pair of teammates. Albert Belle is the only player to amass 50 or more doubles in addition to attaining 50 home runs. Prince Fielder, at 23 years and 139 days, was the youngest player to reach the milestone while Bonds, at age 37, was the oldest.|$|E
