500|$|Shortly {{before the}} game's release, IGN posted {{a review of}} the game, citing {{numerous}} bugs and crashes in the PlayStation 3 release. The game also contained a bug, causing the game to freeze and the screen to blur when friends signed out of and into the PlayStation Network. The IGN review was edited shortly thereafter, removing all references to the PS3 version's bugs, causing controversy in the PlayStation communities. Reviewing PlayStation 3 Game of the Year edition, Digital Chumps and Spawn Kill confirmed that most bugs remained, citing occasional freezes, several animation and scripting issues, along with other bugs, requiring a restart of the game. Even IGN retroactively cited bugs with the original release as well as the Game of the Year edition, calling it [...] "a fantastic game", but warned players to [...] "be aware that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with some crashes and bugs".|$|E
500|$|Director Tanuja Chandra, while filming Sangharsh in 1998, {{ascribed}} Zinta's screen {{appeal to}} {{her lack of}} acting pretense, commenting, [...] "She doesn't act, she's so real that you just can't look away from her". Reviewing Chori Chori Chupke Chupke for Hindustan Times, Vinayak Chakravorty noted that [...] "there is an admirable zest that Preity pumps into every role she does". Farhan Akhtar, who directed her in two movies, believes she is an actress who [...] "can mould herself—the way she speaks, works and her body language—and adapt herself to roles," [...] while Vidhu Vinod Chopra (director of Mission Kashmir) credits her {{with the ability to}} [...] "make the viewer believe even in the most convoluted situation." [...] In a review of Salaam Namaste, Australian film critic Jake Wilson observed, [...] "While Preity Zinta isn't the subtlest actress, she's quite a comedienne– for a Hollywood equivalent to her combination of beauty, high-strung emotion and facial gymnastics <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go back to Natalie Wood." [...] American critic Derek Elley considers her to be [...] "one of Bollywood's best pure actresses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scattered Rhymes (2008), O'Regan's first disc from Harmonia Mundi, was {{described}} as a stunning recording (BBC Radio 3 CD Review), exquisite and delicate (The Washington Post), a fascinating disc (The Daily Telegraph, London) and typically unfaultable (BBC Music Magazine).. After the June 2006 premiere of the eponymous work at the Spitalfields Festival, Geoff Brown, in The Times (London), described O’Regan’s gift for lyric flight [...] boundless. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> reach back to Vaughan Williams’s Serenade to Music, or even Tallis, to find another British vocal work so exultant.|$|E

2500|$|Conference {{attendance}} gets {{much attention}} on Gerbic's bi-weekly segments on the Skeptic Society's Skepticality podcast. She stresses {{how important it}} is for skeptics to attend, and if there aren't conferences nearby, then to create a conference, be it a SkeptiCamp or a Skeptics in the Pub event. She insists that conference attendance is the first step towards activism. [...] "What I do know is that the one-on-one contact recharges our batteries. People like Harriet A. Hall (Skepdoc), Lindsay Beyerstein (co-host of Point of Inquiry), and myself came from CSI’s Skeptic's Toolbox. We weren't primarily authors or lecturers, just people with a passion for the skeptical movement who decided it was our turn to step up. You can’t buy that fire, but sometimes <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kick the embers to keep us (and others) out there fighting what seems to be an insurmountable world of woo. Conferences are essential." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 3, 2009, {{an online}} column by Fox Sports {{baseball}} writer Ken Rosenthal reported of a mutiny in the Blue Jays' clubhouse against Gaston by his players and {{some members of}} his coaching staff. Rosenthal cited unnamed sources who claimed that the mutiny {{was a result of}} his impatience with the players after they started losing, partially reflected with players getting less playing time, his lack of communication, including his inability to properly communicate substitutions, and his negativity, especially {{when it came to the}} younger players who required more positive reinforcement. A day after the report, Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay was quoted as being one of the players who was surprised over his lack of playing time as well as wanting Gaston to improve his communication. [...] "More than anything, I want to try to figure out what to expect for next year. It kind of caught me off-guard a little bit when I wasn't playing. ... (Gaston) never really said a lot. As we were winning, he was kind of sitting on the back burner, watching us play good." [...] When asked about the report on the clubhouse mutiny, Gaston replied that he was surprised that such criticism existed. [...] "If you've got two or three or four guys in there that have a problem, then you don't have to win anything, do you? <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> certainly deal with those guys, but you don't have to win the clubhouse back. I don't think that you can ... rely (on a few) players to find out (if there's a problem). I think you need to talk to all of them. If it comes up to 50 percent, then, hey, maybe we've got a problem. I'd like to know what the problem is because I can't be any fairer than I've been." ...|$|E

60|$|SIR PETER. A {{very honest}} confession--truly--but pray madam was there {{no one else}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> tried <b>to</b> ensnare but me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] said Lady Holmhurst. [...] "And {{why did you}} {{not come}} in? <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> helped <b>to</b> protect Miss Smithers from the reporters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, needlessly. Why {{should you}} be {{separated}} from your brother so much, when <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> him <b>to</b> stay with you till he is well?' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{remained}} {{for a few}} minutes silent, and then put his head out towards her as he spoke. [...] "I was afraid that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell that you were engaged to marry Mr. Twentyman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps {{they said}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be examined, {{but only if}} he is apprehended, and I fully expect that {{he is out of}} reach, so that you need not frighten {{yourself}} about that, my dear.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Permit me {{to present}} to you the Marquis de Sogrange," [...] Peter begged. [...] "He is my oldest friend, Baroness. I think that {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say to me you might very well say before him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “If we hadn’t found <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> starved <b>to</b> death,” murmured Captain Sanders. “They {{ought to}} be punished heavily for this—and for robbing you!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And so you {{actually}} despatched my Lord to eat humble pie in my name. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> waited <b>to</b> see what I {{thought of the}} process.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> suggest. Don't {{you think}} it possible that somehow Mortimer might take it into his head to break the engagement himself?" ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{there were}} {{conflicting}} opinions. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> shoot him on sight, {{and you might}} have him invariably run from you. When the question was finally settled, Maruja {{was found to have}} become absorbed in conversation with some one else.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{a little}} girl with whose name, even, I was unacquainted," [...] Julien replied. [...] "I must admit that I {{scarcely}} took her request seriously. I could not conceive anything which <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say which could justify the intrusion of a perfect stranger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do not see}} the fun, Mr. Stanbury. I came here, at your request, to {{hear what}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> urge against the {{decision}} which I expressed to you in reference to my daughter. As it seems that you have nothing to urge, I will not take up your time further." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought," [...] he said, [...] "that {{possibly}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> wished <b>to</b> comfort me. I {{have been}} through a great strain. I have had a shock...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I can go, if {{you want}} to get rid of me," [...] said Mavering, with unresentful sadness. [...] "But I hoped <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> suggest, Boardy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} singular," [...] she said. [...] "We <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been {{in so many}} places besides this one. And <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> so many places besides this one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't blamin' you, Teenie; but I {{can tell}} you one thing sure: what ain't known can't be told. If Skip Jellison should 'low he was jest about goin' to thump the life out er you if you didn't repeat {{everything}} I said, why, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give up. So I don't think it's best for us to have any talk. Of course I'm sure you won't tell where I'm livin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. You {{had better}} tell Mr. Glover {{to run up}} the Spanish flag if any doubtful-looking craft is seen to be making for the entrance, and I should always keep a couple of signallers up on the cliff, so as {{to let you know}} {{beforehand}} what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> expect, and to see that there is nothing showing that could excite their suspicions, until it is too late for them to turn back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Over in America," [...] he observed, [...] "I {{heard all}} sorts of stories about you. The man Hobson, with whom I was sent to Halifax, and who dragged me off to Chicago, {{seemed to think that}} if he could once get his hand on your {{shoulder}} there were other charges which <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> answer. Brightman, that Liverpool man, had the same idea. I am mentioning this for your own sake, Sir Denis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there is}} trouble in a {{household}} on account of him, and I <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> let you know of it, because I believe <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> power <b>to</b> drive it away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did {{not mean}} that,' said Rose, weeping; 'I only wish you had left here, that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> turned <b>to</b> high and noble pursuits again; to pursuits well worthy of you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, this is {{the second}} volume, I see, else <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> liked <b>to</b> take it home with you. I put it in my pocket because I am {{studying}} a scene for a picture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The prince told me, {{half an hour}} since. He {{heard it}} from the Admiral. He told me he wished he was going with you, instead of with the army. He is always thirsting after adventure. He bade me bring you in to him, if you came. I said you would be sure to do so. It was useless my going out to look for you, as I could not tell what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do before starting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam, I insinuate nothing," [...] Sir Timothy {{interrupted}} sternly. [...] "I only {{desire to}} suggest this. You are {{a young lady}} whose manner of living, I gather, is {{to a certain extent}} precarious. It must have seemed to you a likelier source of profit to withhold any information <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give at the solicitation of a rich man, than to give it free gratis and for nothing to a detective. Now am I right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And do {{you mean}} to say, Sir Gervaise, that you, a knight of the Order, are willing to submit to the indignity of being treated as a slave? To keep up the {{disguise}} long enough to be taken into the confidence of the plotters, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stay there for some time; and if the prison officials believe you to be but an ordinary slave, you will be put to work either on the walls or in one of the galleys." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sorry}} {{not to find}} you at home this morning," [...] he continued. [...] "I brought my little racing car round for you to see. I thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> liked <b>to</b> try her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My pet! But still {{a pair of}} high-lows {{heavy with}} nails {{would not have been}} efficacious then. I should think I love him, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> said <b>to</b> yourself, but he is such an awkward fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you were}} young, very young, and your folly was condoned. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> begun life again, for {{to the world}} at least you were a man of honour. You had not deceived the world, {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> done <b>to</b> others." ...|$|R
