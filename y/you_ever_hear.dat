2500|$|... "Did {{you ever}} know of Indians hanging women as witches? [...] Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> of Indians burning their neighbors alive {{because they would}} not worship a God {{they did not believe}} in when priest and parson could not agree? [...] But you know the whites murdered Sitting Bull because he was holding {{religious}} ceremonies with the ghost dancers, the same religion that the white man’s priest had taught them to follow!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause of}} Ruskin's [...] "disgust" [...] {{has led to}} much speculation. Ruskin's biographer, Mary Lutyens, {{suggested}} that he rejected Effie because he was horrified {{by the sight of}} her pubic hair. Lutyens argued that Ruskin must have known the female form only through Greek statues and paintings of the nude lacking pubic hair and found the reality shocking. However, Peter Fuller in his book Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace writes, [...] "It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood." [...] Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also take the view that menstruation is the more likely explanation, though Batchelor also suggests that body-odour may have been the problem. Debate cannot currently resolve this issue; William Ewart Gladstone said to his daughter, Mary, [...] "should <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> anyone blame Millais or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin, remember that there is no fault; there was misfortune, even tragedy. All three were perfectly blameless.".|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{what right}} has he {{to treat me}} so? Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> before <b>hear</b> of such a thing? Why is he {{to be allowed to}} go back,--without punishment,--more than another?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did Mr. Catherick, or did any {{one else}} <b>you</b> knew, <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> that Sir Percival {{was a friend}} of Major Donthorne's, or ever see Sir Percival in the {{neighbourhood}} of Varneck Hall?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In Allen's opinion, she couldn't learn {{fast enough}} to make a first-rate movie, {{although}} she thought Marnie did have some good scenes in it. She took a lot of the responsibility for what is considered a very flawed movie, since Hitchcock loved her script so much so that he did not make as good a movie as he should have. Hitchcock would have made her a director but she told him no. Said Allen: [...] "It seems perfectly clear to me that any project takes a minimum of a year to direct. I like to get things on and over with. ... Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> the phrase, 'the lady proposes, the studio disposes'? I didn’t make it up. I would never propose myself as a director." [...] Under Hitchcock's mentoring, Allen developed the screenwriting talent she would use the rest of her career. Allen wrote that she never felt discriminated against. While being one of the rare female screenwriters in Hollywood in the 1960s, she said [...] "almost all of the men I worked with were supportive. If I was getting a bum rap somewhere, I didn’t know it." ...|$|E
60|$|PERCIVAL. Yes, {{when she}} is in pursuit of me. She runs faster and faster. I run slower and slower. And these woods of yours are full of magic. There was a confounded fern owl. Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> the churr of a fern owl? Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> it create a sudden silence by ceasing? Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> it call its mate by {{striking}} its wings together twice and whistling that single note that no nightingale can imitate? That is {{what happened in the}} woods when I was running away. So I turned; and the pursuer became the pursued.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> a more disgusting rigmarole?" [...] asked Mrs. Makely, as {{our little}} group halted indecisively about her.|$|E
5000|$|The film's {{score is}} {{considered}} by many as groundbreaking. The score by Miles Davis has been described by jazz critic Phil Johnson as, [...] "The loneliest trumpet sound <b>you</b> will <b>ever</b> <b>hear,</b> and the model for sad-core music <b>ever</b> since. <b>Hear</b> it and weep." ...|$|R
5000|$|Geneva's singer Andrew Montgomery {{is simply}} {{one of the}} best <b>you</b> will <b>ever</b> <b>hear.</b> Higher and higher he goes, more and more exalted he seems by the songs ... an amazing natural gift ... the vocal melodies are uncanny, different, almost devotional."4 ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Overall, the {{production}} creates a live feel. The studio is absent in that <b>you</b> only <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> four musicians, albeit in an ideally balanced setting: it is a document of {{things as they}} are rather than a fiction created in the studio or on stage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --He {{knew what}} money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but an Englishman too. Do {{you know what}} is the pride of the English? Do {{you know what is}} the proudest word <b>you</b> will <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> from an Englishman's mouth? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am. I want {{a little}} information--at least, there's another that does. Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> happen to <b>hear</b> of a Mr. Heigham?" ...|$|R
