40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} some chemical composition and microbiological load during storage period of plain set yoghurt samples present on local market in Khartoum State. Ninety- six commercial yoghurt samples, from different manufacturers produces plain set yoghurt from recombined milk powder (A, B), and fresh milk (C, D), were collected from 4 shops in Khartoum North during the period November 2008 - February 2009. Analysis of yoghurt samples, collected from different manufacturers revealed significant (P< 0. 01) differences in total solids (TS), solids not fat (SNF), fat, protein and ash contents and titratable acidity due to the variations of manufacturers and type of milk used. The titratable acidity showed no significant effect due to the type of milk used. Yoghurt samples obtained from different manufacturers and type of milk significantly (P< 0. 01) affected TS, SNF, protein contents, and titratable acidity during storage period, whereas fat and ash contents were not significantly affected by storage period. Microbiological analysis showed that total bacterial count, coliform count and <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>count</b> were significantly (P< 0. 05) affected by the manufacturers. On the other hand, coliform count and <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>count</b> were not significantly affected by the type of milk used. Total bacterial count, coliform count and <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>count</b> were significantly affected by storage period in all yoghurt samples. The study concluded that the plain set yoghurt made from recombined milk powder and fresh milk agrees with the Sudanese standards for yoghurt chemical composition. Moreover, all plain yoghurt samples revealed high contamination, and the storage period had a significant effect on both chemical and microbiological load. vii Hence, it is recommended that determining the maximum level of all harmful microorganisms associated with a product, provides a good hygienic conditions during processing.

Four crates of fresh table eggs were bought from the University of Agriculture, Makurdi farm and preliminary investigations of egg weights, Haugh unit, pH and yolk index were carried out before storage and found to be within standard. Thirty eggs were stored under ambient condition with and without application of oil respectively. The other group of thirty eggs was refrigerated. The initial weights were in the range of 60 – 69 g which reduced drastically. All other quality indices like the Haugh unit, the yolk index and pH declined drastically within the four weeks of the storage especially those that were stored under the ambient conditions. Those stored under refrigeration and those that were oiled and stored under ambient conditions (32 + 2 °C) maintained high quality standards in all the quality indices evaluated. The microbiological result also showed higher bacteria, <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>count</b> on those stored under ambient condition with the initial count of 5. 0 × 103 at first week and 2. 8 × 107 at the fourth week while the oiled and refrigerated eggs had values of 5. 0 × 103 at week zero and 7. 2 × 104 at week four of storage respectively. It is suggested that application of oil on eggs before storage can be practised to ensure retention of good quality eggs especially in the tropics and most developing nations of the world...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the data}} of the {{literature}} it can be stated that the sprouts fulfill {{the requirements of the}} modern nutritional sciencefor whole-food. Since the biological function of trace elements is outstanding, the objective of this work was to study theenrichment of molybdenum and selenium during germination of wheat- and pea sprouts (Triticum aestivum and Pisumsativum). The total element concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry(ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). During the microbiological analysis of the sprouts,the total plate count, the coliform bacteria count, furthermore the <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>count</b> have been determined by pourplate technique. Due to our experiments, we can draw the conclusion that on the one hand, it is advisable to treat sproutswith molybdenum and selenium, since sprouts are able to uptake these elements in high concentration and in this way theycan contribute to cover our daily molybdenum and selenium needs to a great extent. On the other hand, on the basis of themicrobiological analysis of the seeds, it has become apparent that the microbiological load of the seeds is already high and itincreases during germination. Therefore, reducing the microbiological infection of seeds is extremely important and the initialmicrobiological load should also be controlled. The work was supported by the TÁMOP- 4. 2. 2 /B- 10 / 1 - 2010 - 0024 and TÁMOP- 4. 2. 1. /B- 09 / 1 /KONV- 2010 - 0007 projects.

40|$|Several {{batches of}} approx. 200 kg olives from Frantoio and Moraiolo cultivars were {{processed}} in an oil mill at two dates of harvesting. Samples {{were collected in}} several steps of extraction process for sensory, chemical and microbial analyses. All extracted olive oil from the second olive harvesting date was affected by sensory defects and hence classified as being “non-extra virgin”. A distinction between {{extra virgin olive oil}} and nonextra virgin olive oil obtained from both harvesting dates was explained by the volatile compounds content of olive oil samples <b>and</b> by <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>counts</b> collected at different processing steps...|$|R
40|$|Herbal {{products}} {{are used by}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected individuals regardless of safety or efficacy concerns. In this study, we examined the microbiological quality of herbal preparations marketed to HIV-infected individuals. A convenience sample (N = 24) of herbal products was obtained from retailers in Nairobi, Kenya in 2007. Petrifilm plate count methods were used to estimate total aerobic bacteria (APC), coliform, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus <b>and</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>counts.</b> APC counts ranged from an estimated 1. 5 × 101 colony forming units (CFU) /g to 7. 1 × 108 CFU/g. Total and faecal coliform counts ranged from an estimated "less than" 10 CFU/g to 3 × 106 CFU/g. E. coli load ranged from "less than" 10 CFU/g to 5 × 101 CFU/g and S. aureus counts ranged from an estimated "less than" 10 CFU/g to 2. 5 × 103 CFU/g. <b>Yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>counts</b> ranged from an estimated "less than" 10 CFU/g to 9 × 104 CFU/g. An evaluation using the World Health Organization limits for medicinal herbs found a percentage of samples to contain microorganisms above allowable limits: 33 % (APC), 50 % (coliforms) <b>and</b> 33 % (<b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds).</b> A total of 67 % of samples contained S. aureus loads above the United States Pharmacopeia standard. We suggest that the introduction of quality-control measures and safe handling practices for the selling of medicinal herbs and botanicals in Kenya would be beneficial in reducing the potential health risks for immunocompromised consumers of these products...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} electron-beams {{were applied to}} disinfestate dates through using 5 {{different}} energy/doses and comparing disinfestation efficacy such as insect mortality and hatches with microwave, steaming and fumigation by phostoxin. The percentage of mortality was 100 % for all electron-beam treatments, also hatches were less (0 - 1) compared to microwave, steaming and fumigation. The treated dates' quality was assessed by measuring moisture content, water activity, color, total viable count (TVC), <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>count</b> (YMC) and antioxidant capacity. There {{was no difference in}} moisture content between control and other treated samples except for steaming and fumigation, whereas moisture increased to 14. 59 and 15. 07 g/ 100 g respectively. Alike to the changes pattern of the moisture content, the steam treatments as well as the fumigated samples reveal a slight increase in the water activity. Color lightness was lowest in the steaming sample (20. 36); conversely, it remains al most unchanged through other treatments. Electron beams (1. 5 MeV/ 1. 0 kGy and 1. 5 MeV/ 2. 0 kGy) had the lowest TVC (1. 65 and 1. 70 log cfus/g), and also YMC was low in samples treated by electron beams in comparison with other treatments. There {{were no significant differences in}} antioxidant capacity between all treatments, except for the sample treated by electron beams 1. 5 MeV/ 2. 0 kGy, antioxidant capacity was reduced to 232 mol/g. EPR free radicals generation (g-value) measurements through alanine dosimetry were 1 × 10 - 8 mol/J lower than the alanine (3 × 10 - 7 mol/J) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study focused}} on the {{processing}} of breadfruit and cassava co-fermented into gari analogue. The microbial load was determined and the microbes associated with the fermentation were identified. The shelf life of the co-fermented gari analogue samples was also determined. A portion of both mature cassava tubers and matured but unripe breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) was co-fermented (100 : 0, 0 : 100, 80 : 20, 70 : 30, and 60 : 40 Cassava: Breadfruit) to obtain gari analogue. The samples were evaluated for microbial loads (total viable, total <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>count</b> and total lactic acid bacteria counts). The products were subjected to sensory analyses using a 7 -point hedonic scale. Data obtained were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics. The results showed that six bacteria species were isolated from the fermenting mash, Corynebacterium manihot, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species. Also isolated were Saccharomyces cerevisae, Saccharomyces fragilis, Saccharomyces rouxii and Geotricum candidum. Two moulds, Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus stolonifer, were found associated with co-fermented meals of cassava and breadfruit. The sensory attributes of 100 % breadfruit gari and co-processed gari samples were significantly different (p> 0. 05) from the control; the co-processed gari samples were however rated higher than the 100 % breadfruit in terms of overall acceptability. All the gari samples retain their quality attributes during storage for six weeks, except for the gari sample with 100 % breadfruit, which deteriorated after three weeks. This study established that 20 % of breadfruit co-fermented with cassava yields a novel food product that compares favourably with 100 % cassava gari in terms of microbial and sensory characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Dragon fruit (Hylocereus undatus L.), {{which is}} rich in vitamin C, fiber and natural antioxidants, {{is one of the}} most popular {{commercial}} fruits available in sri lanka. However, dragon fruit is still an underutilized fruit in Sri Lanka as its high price and exotic taste don’t warrant consumption of the fruit by average Sri Lankan consumers. The present study investigated the possibility of developing a novel fruit-yoghurt incorporated with white dragon fruit and evaluated its eating quality parameters. An initial survey was conducted to find out the consumer preference for value-added dragon fruit products in Sri Lanka. Pasteurized dragon fruit juice enriched yoghurt (5 %, 7. 5 %, 10 % and 12. 5 % w/w) were prepared with the suitable concentrations of sugar and gelatin and sensory properties, pH, titratable acidity, total solid, fat, solid-non-fat (SNF) and microbiological properties of the product were determined. Sensory results were analyzed by Kruskal-wallis non-parametric one way ANOVA method using STATISTIX software (ver 2. 0) for windows. Survey results showed that 90 % of individuals were eagerly waiting for the new product from dragon fruit in the near future. Sugar (10 %), gelatin (0. 8 %) and dragon fruit juice (10 %; w/w) added yoghurt mix was selected as the best product considering its highest mean rank values recorded for sensory properties. The titratable acidity and pH of the developed product during the storage period ranged from 0. 8 to 1. 0 % and 4. 08 to 3. 9, respectively. <b>Yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>count</b> did not exceed the Sri Lanka Standards Institute (SLSI) recommended values during the 15 -day storage period. It can be concluded that dragon fruit can be successfull...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the microbiological quality (total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, Lactococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp., Coliform bacteria, Staphylococci-micrococci, Enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae, <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould)</b> <b>and</b> biochemical properties (dry matter, fat, salt, acidity, pH, water activity, nitrogen, WSN/TN, TCA-SN/TN and PTA-SN/TN) of Kes. Total of 64 Kes samples were randomly collected from Burdur province of Turkey. According to the results of chemical analysis, Kes is included in the moisture food groups (a w = 0. 90) and less mature cheeses. Kes proteolysis were found to be low-level. The microbiological quality of Kes is not satisfactory because the total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>counts</b> are high. Coagulase-positive staphylococci was detected in 12 of the 64 samples (25 %) and E. coli was detected in 2 of 64 (3. 1 %).

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} changes in the quality indices (levels of peroxides values, acid values, pH and colour) of cocoyam chips and microbiological safety (bacterial, <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>counts)</b> of cocoyam chips as influenced by temperature during storage period of fried cocoyam chips. Cocoyam tubers were processed into chips of 3 mm thickness; the slices were then fried at a frying temperature of 170 °C in a shallow pot for 7 minutes and was packaged in polyethylene bags and stored under room and refrigerator temperature. The results showed that there was significant difference (p≤ 0. 05) between quality indices, microbiological safety and storage temperature and packaging materials. From week 0 - 5, peroxide values of samples stored under refrigeration temperature {{were found to be}} low, ranged from 3. 39 - 11. 58 meq kg- 1, while the samples stored in the room temperature were found to be higher 3. 81 - 12. 87 meq kg- 1. Acid values were also found to be low in the samples stored in the refrigerator, ranged from 5. 79 - 16 3. 34 mg/g and the samples that were stored in the room temperature ranged from 9. 94 - 24. 05 mg/g. The samples stored under refrigeration temperature had low bacterial counts ranged from 5. 0 x 101 - 6. 2 x 101 cfu/ml while samples stored in the room temperature had higher bacterial counts, ranged from 9. 0 x 101 – 74 x 101 cfu/ml. <b>Yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> <b>counts</b> in samples stored under refrigeration temperature ranged from 4. 0 x 101 - 32 x 10 cfu/ml while the samples that were stored in room temperature had higher counts, ranged from 3. 0 x 10 – 38 x 10 cfu/ml. pH ranged between 6. 88 - 7. 02 for both samples during storage period.
