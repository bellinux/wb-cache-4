500|$|The east {{window of}} the choir is a broad, seven-light window dating from 1340–45. It depicts the Tree of Jesse (the {{genealogy}} of Christ) and demonstrates the use of silver staining, a new technique that allowed the artist to paint details on the glass in yellow, as well as black. The combination of yellow and green glass {{and the application of}} the bright <b>yellow</b> <b>stain</b> gives the window its popular name, the [...] "Golden Window". It is flanked by two windows each side in the clerestory, with large figures of saints, also dated to 1340–45. In 2010 a major conservation programme was undertaken on the Jesse Tree window.|$|E

5000|$|In 1875, he {{documented}} {{an account}} involving an autopsy of a jaundiced infant with intense <b>yellow</b> <b>staining</b> of the basal ganglia, hippocampus, the third ventricle, {{as well as}} parts of the cerebellum. However, it wouldn't be until the early 20th century that this condition would be further comprehended. In 1903, pathologist Christian Georg Schmorl (1861-1932) presented the results of 120 autopsies of jaundiced infants, with six of the cases having the staining phenomena described by Orth. Schmorl coined the term [...] "kernicterus" [...] (jaundice of the basal ganglia) for the <b>yellow</b> <b>staining</b> phenomenon.|$|R
60|$|Her {{hand went}} {{out over the}} {{revolver}} toward his hand, as {{she pointed to the}} tell-tale <b>yellow</b> <b>stain</b> on his fingers. At the same time her eyes measured the nearness of her own hand and of his to the weapon. She ached to grip it in one swift movement. She was sure she could do it, and yet she was not sure; {{and so it was that}} she refrained as she withdrew her hand.|$|E
60|$|I {{slipped into}} the room. Lying back on her pillows, she was {{breathing}} quickly with half-closed eyes. There was nothing to show that she had wanted me, or even knew that I was there. The wick of the candle, set by the bedside, had been snuffed too short, and gave but a faint light; both window and door stood open, still there was no draught, and the feeble little flame burned quite still, casting a faint <b>yellow</b> <b>stain</b> on the ceiling like the refection from a buttercup held beneath a chin. These ceilings are far too low! Across the wide, squat window the apple branches fell in black stripes which never stirred. It was {{too dark to see}} things clearly. At {{the foot of the bed}} was a chest, and there Mrs. Hopgood had sat down, moving her lips as if in speech. Mingled with the half-musty smell of age; there were other scents, of mignonette, apples, and some sweet-smelling soap. The floor had no carpet, and there was not one single dark object except the violin, hanging from a nail over the bed. A little, round clock ticked solemnly.|$|E

50|$|It {{should be}} noted that zinc {{naturally}} contains some trace amounts of arsenic, so a modest <b>yellow</b> <b>stain</b> appears almost in any case on the reagent paper. This limits the sensitivity of this test, as arsenic amounts in zinc vary from one supplier to another. That is why later Zn was replaced by sodium borohydride NaBH4; then, strong and corrosive hydrochloric acid was also replaced with sulfamic acid NH2SO3H.|$|E
50|$|The {{methods of}} {{preserving}} cadavers {{have changed over}} the last 200 years. At that time, cadavers had to be used immediately {{because there were no}} adequate methods to keep the body from quickly decaying. Preservation was needed in order to carry out classes and lessons about the human body. Glutaraldehyde was the first main chemical used for embalming and preserving the body although it leaves a <b>yellow</b> <b>stain</b> in the tissues, which can interfere with observation and research.|$|E

50|$|Mattresses absorb {{fluids and}} stains readily, notably from nightly {{sweating}} (which {{results in a}} <b>yellow</b> <b>stain),</b> seminal (or Cowper) stains which are darker, menstrual fluids which are dark red, and other bodily fluids in addition to accidental spills. These visibly stain the ticking, and seep through into lower layers. In addition to being unhygienic, hard to launder, and unsightly, such stains typically void a warranty. Thus a mattress protector is suggested to protect the mattress; this can be removed and cleaned separately, and replaced if damaged.|$|E
50|$|As a {{material}} stained glass is glass {{that has been}} coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture. The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. Painted details and <b>yellow</b> <b>stain</b> are often used to enhance the design. The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.|$|E
5000|$|Greensand is a {{calcareous}} sandstone containing {{an uneven}} {{distribution of the}} mineral glauconite, giving the sandstone a greenish tinge. On exposure to the air this oxidises into a <b>yellow</b> <b>stain.</b> Sevenoaks, Maidstone, Ashford, and Folkestone are built on the greensand. [...] Greensand comes in four layers: the Folkestone Beds 60-250 ft thick; The Sandgate Beds 5-120 ft thick; the Hythe beds 60-350 ft thick and Atherfield Clays 15-50 ft thick. [...] The soil of the greensand is quite varied, ranging from fertile to fairly sterile. On the fertile soils we see chestnut and stands of hazel and oak, while Scots Pine and Birch colonise the poorer soils.|$|E

50|$|When {{the print}} is {{completely}} dry {{and no more}} layers will be applied, a potassium metabisulfite clearing bath is used to remove excess dichromate trapped in the paper. This {{can be seen on}} the reverse of the paper as a <b>yellow</b> <b>stain</b> where pigment was applied on the verso. In a well-ventilated room mix 250g Potassium Metabisulphite in a tray of water and soak the print for 1-5 minutes. This bath may soften the image so care must be taken when washing away the metabisulphite in the next step. In a separate tray, gently run cool water for 10-20 minutes with the print face down to remove all metabisulphite solution. Hang to dry.|$|E
50|$|Quarries may be mould-cast into {{patterns}} such as fleur de lys and imprinted {{with black}} and <b>yellow</b> <b>stain.</b> Used extensively during the 19th century in England and Commonwealth countries, these quarries are often {{the product of a}} single studio, James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars. Another form of decorative quarry is the etched or engraved quarry, which is made of flashed glass, most often ruby red or royal blue over a transparent layer. It then has a design cut into it using either acid or a lathe, the character of the resultant design differing accordingly. Etched quarries of Venetian glass are often employed, sometimes in conjunction with panels of stained glass, particularly in Italy and Eastern Europe. Lathe-cut quarries with a simple star-burst pattern are very common in the late 19th century domestic architecture of many regions, both in leadlighting and in simpler wooden-framed glazing.|$|E
