2500|$|On February 24, 2017, CNN {{and other}} media {{organizations}} such as The New York Times were blocked from a White House press briefing. The network responded in a statement: [...] "Apparently {{this is how they}} retaliate when <b>you</b> <b>report</b> facts they don't like. We'll keep reporting regardless." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Sun Quan {{heard about}} this incident, he asked Lu Xun, [...] "Why didn't <b>you</b> <b>report</b> {{to me about the}} generals refusing to follow your orders?" [...] Lu Xun replied, [...] Sun Quan laughed and praised Lu Xun. Lu Xun was {{promoted}} to General Who Assists the State (輔國將軍), appointed as Governor (牧) of Jing Province, and had his marquis title changed to [...] "Marquis of Jiangling" [...] (江陵侯).|$|E
2500|$|These {{arguments}} were ruled invalid in Schiff v. Commissioner. Another argument made by Schiff on {{his web site}} is: [...] "On the [...] 1040 itself... <b>you</b> <b>report</b> 'zero' income regardless of how much you received in: wages, commissions, interest, alimony, capital gains or from operating a business. For tax purposes, 'income' only means corporate 'profit.' Therefore, no individual receives anything that is reportable as 'income'." [...] This argument has been rejected by the lower courts, {{as well as the}} United States courts of appeal. See Cameron v. Internal Revenue Serv.; Stoewer v. Commissioner;Reinhart v. United States;Fink v. Commissioner;Flathers v. Commissioner;Schroeder v. Commissioner;Sherwood v. Commissioner; and Ho v. Commissioner.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Rudolph. But Emerick! {{how when}} <b>you</b> <b>reported</b> to him [...] Sarolta's disappearance, {{and the flight}} [...] Of Bethlen with his guards? ...|$|R
60|$|KEARNEY. But I {{understood}} {{from our}} chahplain that <b>you</b> <b>reported</b> Captain Brassbound as {{in league with}} the Sheikh to deliver Sir Howard up to him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you remember,' said Merton, 'that {{when you}} came back from [...] "The Seven Hunters," [...] <b>you</b> <b>reported</b> that the {{fishermen}} had a silly story of seeing a dragon flying above the empty sea?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Kony {{would later}} {{explain the reasons}} for these actions: [...] "If you pick up an arrow against us {{and we ended up}} cutting off the hand you used, who is to blame? [...] <b>You</b> <b>report</b> us with your mouth, and we cut off your lips? [...] Who is to blame? [...] It is you! [...] The Bible says that if your hand, eye or mouth is at fault, it should be cut off." [...] While the {{government}} efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency. [...] However, this was tempered by the deep-seated antagonism towards the occupying government forces.|$|E
2500|$|By 618, with {{virtually}} entire empire engulfed in warfare from the rebellions against her husband's rule, Empress Xiao {{was with her}} husband at Jiangdu (江都), the capital of Yang Province. They were protected (as he believed) by the elite Xiaoguo Army (驍果). [...] However, by this point, even the Xiaoguo soldiers were plotting rebellion, as they missed their families in the north. [...] When a lady in waiting reported the plot to Empress Xiao, she told the lady in waiting, [...] "I will let <b>you</b> <b>report</b> it to the emperor." [...] Emperor Yang, not willing to hear any bad news, however, instead executed the lady in waiting. Later, when other ladies in waiting wanted {{to report on the}} plot, Empress Xiao advised them against it, reasoning that there was nothing left that could save the dynasty. Soon, a plot led by the general Yuwen Huaji came to fruition, and Emperor Yang, along with his sons Yang Jian and Yang Gao and grandson Yang Tan the Prince of Yan were killed. Empress Xiao and her ladies in waiting wrapped him in a mat and made caskets for both Emperor Yang and Yang Gao.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, May 10, in Atoka, Oklahoma, a {{man walked}} up to a woman's house and opened her screen door. He asked Mrs. Harmon {{if he could have}} some {{turpentine}}, food, and money. Mrs. Harmon told the man that she had very little turpentine and had no money or food. The man then grabbed Mrs. Harmon by the hair and dragged her out onto the porch. He told her that he might as well kill her since he had already killed three or four people and {{that he was going to}} rape her. He then heard a horse galloping towards them and told her, [...] "There comes a man on a horse. If <b>you</b> <b>report</b> this to officers I'll come back and kill you." [...] After the man ran off, the woman took her child with her to a neighbor's house further up the street and reported it to the police. Soon after her report, a widespread search for the man included 20 officers and 160 residents. She described the man as a 5'9-10 white man about 40 or 45 years old, about 150 to 155pounds, with dark hair, and was in bad need of a shave. He carried an open, five-inch bladed pocket knife and was wearing gloves, a faded and worn blue shirt with khakis, and had an old, dirty, dark-colored flopped hat.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the talk!" [...] cried Andy. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>reported</b> this, some of {{the fellows}} might put you down for a softy and a sneak. I'd rather watch my chance and give Martell {{as good as he}} sent." ...|$|R
5000|$|CNNNNs slogan was [...] "We <b>Report,</b> <b>You</b> Believe.", {{a parody}} of Fox News slogan [...] "We <b>Report,</b> <b>You</b> Decide." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, you'll {{have time}} enough for study there. And you'll have a native officer, Ali {{something}} or other, who speaks English, and can interpret for you. Well, good-bye--I'll tell the chief that <b>you</b> <b>reported</b> yourself. Get {{on to your}} post now {{as quickly as you}} can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Both of <b>you</b> <b>report</b> to {{me after}} school this afternoon," [...] said the {{instructor}} harshly; and then without another word he turned and tramped off into the Hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{give you}} up," [...] I retorted, shrugging my shoulders. [...] "Only {{one thing is}} clear, {{and that is that}} the devil doesn't want <b>you.</b> <b>Report</b> of your singing has gone before you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Plenty of ashes," [...] {{she told}} the steward. [...] "Remember. And if a sailor doesn't clean the coop each day, <b>you</b> <b>report</b> to me. And give them only clean food--no spoiled scraps, mind. How many eggs yesterday?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Oakes laughed again. [...] "It is {{very kind}} of Mrs. Pickett," [...] he said, [...] "but I prefer to trust to my own methods." [...] Oakes rose, his face purposeful. [...] "I'd better be {{starting}} at once," [...] he said. [...] "I'll send <b>you</b> <b>reports</b> from time to time." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he {{presently}} remarked, [...] "Mr. Cragg has {{but little}} {{money to buy}} dresses with. I do not imagine that a man so well educated as <b>you</b> <b>report</b> him to be would prefer {{to live in a}} hovel, if he could afford anything better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Sam; {{not at all}} right," [...] {{the colonel}} said, with difficulty. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>report</b> who has played the trick upon you, I shall speak to him very seriously; but, Sam, I should have thought that you were quite big {{enough to take the}} matter in your own hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{you read}} Franklin's pages {{be on the}} alert for {{material}} to support Mr. Matthews' statement, [...] "Franklin {{was the first of}} American humorists, and to this day he has not been surpassed in his own line."

60|$|With an {{intolerable}} pen and no ink, I {{am going}} to write a few lines to <b>you</b> to <b>report</b> progress.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's your first, is it not? Well, {{you have}} to be blooded some time. It will be a great start for you. As to the pistol, you'll find it waiting for you, or I'm mistaken. If <b>you</b> <b>report</b> yourselves on Monday, it will be time enough. You'll get a great welcome when you return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A good deal. Tackle the boy when {{he comes}} in, and have it out with him. Remember that it must mean {{expulsion}} if <b>you</b> <b>report</b> him to the headmaster. He would have no choice. Everybody who has ever broken {{out of his house}} here and been caught has been expelled. I should strongly advise you to deal with the thing yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, that's {{just what}} I thought; {{but at the}} same time, if <b>you</b> <b>report</b> that, {{although}} you were unable to grant me leave, you approved of my absence, it will make it much easier for me. Not that it makes any difference, sir, because I admit frankly that I should go in any case. It is probable that I may be reduced to the ranks; but I don't think that, under the circumstances, they will punish me any more severely than that." ...|$|E
6000|$|She grew {{instantly}} graver. [...] "They would despise {{me if they}} knew. I don't {{like being}} a mere toy of the public--a pleasure-giver and nothing else. Of course there are different ways of pleasing. That is why I couldn't do Alessandra. Tell me of your brother. I liked what you wrote of him. He is our direct opposite, isn't he? Does he talk as well as <b>you</b> <b>reported,</b> or were <b>you</b> polishing him a little?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... [Footnote 1: Mr. Coleridge was {{a decided}} Wolfian in the Homeric question; {{but he had}} never read a word of the famous Prolegomena, and knew nothing of Wolf's reasoning, but what I told him of it in conversation. Mr. C. {{informed}} me, that he adopted the conclusion contained in the text upon the first perusal of Vico's Scienza Nuova; [...] "not," [...] he said, [...] "that Vico has reasoned it out with such learning and accuracy as <b>you</b> <b>report</b> of Wolf, but Vico struck out all the leading hints, and I soon filled up the rest out of my own head."-- ED.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... (M44) He received, as was inevitable, {{plenty of}} letters from admirers regretting {{that he had not}} gone up higher. His answer was, of course, uniform. “It was,” he told them, “my own {{impartial}} and firm opinion that Lord Russell was the proper person to succeed Lord Palmerston. However flattered I may be, therefore, to hear of an opinion such as <b>you</b> <b>report</b> and express, I have felt it my duty to co-operate {{to the best of my}} power in such arrangements as might enable the government to be carried on by the present ministers, with Lord Russell at their head.” ...|$|E
6000|$|KING (30th March). [...] "Seventeen of them, you may depend; I am {{too well}} {{informed}} {{to be allowed}} to doubt in any way. What <b>you</b> <b>report</b> of the Reichsfolk and Saxons moving hither, thither; that seems to me a bit of game on their part. They will try to cut one post from you, then another, unless you assemble a corps and go in upon them. Till you decide for this resolution, you have nothing but chicanes and provocations to expect there. As to Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, I don't imagine that his Orders [from England] would permit him what you propose [for relief of yourself]: at any rate, you will have to write at least thrice to him,--that is to say, waste three weeks, before he will answer No or Yes. You yourself are in force enough for those fellows: but so long as you keep on the defensive alone, the enemy gains time, and things will always go a bad road." [...] Henri's patience is already out; this same day he is writing to the King.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I am in earnest. I {{have nothing}} against you as a man, but I have this against you as an officer--that you have not carried out that order, and if <b>you</b> do not <b>report</b> me I must <b>report</b> <b>you.</b> And I will.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; he will {{guarantee}} {{the lives of}} all the garrison, but he seemed to be afraid of what <b>you</b> might <b>report</b> to Nana Sahib." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Putnam wants <b>you</b> to <b>report</b> {{to him or}} to Mr. Strong at once," [...] went on the cadet outside, in a heavy, assumed voice.|$|R
