500|$|Shand: Will <b>you</b> <b>admit</b> {{one of two}} things: either {{your report}} to the Board or your {{statement}} that that was your state of mind, that you thought his conduct was so serious as {{to be left out}} of the team—one or other is a deliberate lie? ...|$|E
500|$|Captured, Pechersky soon {{contracted}} typhus, but {{survived the}} seven-month-long illness. In May 1942, he escaped along {{with four other}} prisoners of war, {{but they were all}} recaptured the same day. He was then sent to a penal camp at Borisov, Belarus, and from there to a prisoners of war (POW) camp located in the forest next to the city of Minsk. During a mandatory medical examination it was discovered that he was circumcised. Pechersky recalled a German medical officer asking him: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>admit</b> to being a Jew?" [...] He admitted it, since any denial would result in a whipping, and was thrown into a cellar called [...] "the Jewish grave" [...] along with other Jewish POWs (prisoners of war), where for 10 days he sat in complete darkness, being fed 100grams (3.5oz) of wheat and a cup of water every second day.|$|E

500|$|On December 14, 2012, {{academic}} and writer Judith Reisman stated {{in a piece}} for WorldNetDaily that in her view Wales had received revenue from a website which dealt in pornography. Relatively soon after the article was published, Wales wrote to WorldNetDaily to object to this characterization: [...] "This is absolutely and categoricallly [...] false. I have never made any 'fortune', as a pornography trafficker or otherwise, and I have never been a 'pornography trafficker' at all. ... I demand an immediate edit to that story to remove the lie about me." [...] WorldNetDaily editor Joseph Farah personally replied to Wales to explain that Wikipedia's coverage {{of the history of}} Bomis acknowledged at the time that: [...] "Bomis ran a website called Bomis Premium at premium.bomis.com until 2005, offering customers access to premium, X-rated pornographic content." [...] Wales sent an email to Farah stating Wikipedia: [...] "doesn't say anything remotely like me making a 'fortune' from 'pornography." [...] Wales inquired to Farah {{what he was going to}} do next about what Wales characterized as [...] "libel". Farah responded to Wales' reply with a subsequent email asking: [...] "Let me get this straight: <b>You</b> <b>admit</b> making money from pornography, but you feel defamed because you didn’t make enough for it to be considered a 'fortune'?" [...] Wales then repeated his original request to Farah and again asserted the original article was [...] "defamatory", writing in an email: [...] "This is a defamatory falsehood. I have never made any 'fortune' as a 'porngraphy [...] trafficker.' Fix it." ...|$|E

The Bible itself is the arsenal whence each innovator has drawn his deceptive arguments. It was with Biblical texts that Pelagius and Arius maintained their doctrines. Arius, for instance, found the negation of the eternity of the Word—an eternity which <b>you</b> <b>admit,</b> in this verse of the New Testament—Joseph knew not his wife till she had brought forth her first-born son; and he said, {{in the same way}} that you say, that this passage enchained him. When the fathers of the Council of Constance condemned this proposition of John Huss—The church of Jesus Christ is only the community of the elect, they condemned an error; for the church, like a good mother, embraces within her arms all who bear the name of Christian, all who are called to enjoy the celestial beatitude.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|The Minister replied: [...] "No, it isn't forbidden, but on {{the other}} hand it isn't a clearcut issue. Besides, <b>you</b> <b>admitted</b> to it. And the generals are aware of this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your logic's {{not very}} sound," [...] she resumed. [...] "For example, I began to ride when I {{was eight years}} old, and <b>you</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>you</b> began this morning. Why did you imagine you could ride along the channel when I could not? However, you have kept me {{for some time and}} I mustn't stop." ...|$|R

6000|$|For a {{few moments}} Margaret was quiet. Then {{she said in a}} steady voice: [...] "Your {{cheating}} the police would not persuade me; in fact, somehow I think they will find out you {{had nothing to do with}} the warden's getting shot. The obstacle's not there. You are young, Jimmy, and <b>you</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>you</b> were carried away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt. Still, {{one has to}} be reasonable. As <b>you</b> <b>admitted</b> to me--one has {{to square}} one's self with the world. You don't know. With people of that sort all sorts of things may happen. We don't want things to happen." ...|$|R
