500|$|According to the {{commentary}} by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia on the 2007 text by Vladimir Rotstein, a doctrinist of Snezhnevsky's school, there are sufficient patients with delusion of reformism in psychiatric inpatient facilities for involuntary treatment.

500|$|There is some {{evidence}} that Christianity made inroads into the Viking controlled Highlands and Islands before the official conversion {{at the end of the}} tenth century.

[...] Unsurprisingly, Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke, receiving their own bishop, Henry of Lund (also known as [...] "the Fat"), who was appointed sometime prior to 1035. The greatest source of Scottish influence after the appointment of the Scottish earls in the 13th century was probably through the church, although {{it is clear that}} Scots influence on the culture of Orkney and Shetland was fairly limited until the close of the 14th century or later. An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, fishermen and merchants that called themselves Communitas Orchadensis and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords, be they Norwegian or Scots. This independence of mind may have been fostered by the influence of Norwegian government which was essentially communal and federal by contrast with Scotland. It was not until the mid 16th century that the Norse institutions were replaced by Scottish systems following large-scale immigration from the south [...] and the islanders were probably bi-lingual until the 17th century.|$|E
500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the things that you want and I can give them to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> {{you have to do is}} give me your soul".|$|E

He claimed No.3 Squadron's 200th victim, a Bf109F, during the Battle of El Alamein on 28October. [...] Air Marshal Sir Peter Drummond, Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Middle East, sent him a signal reading [...] "Heartiest congratulations to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> ranks in the squadron on the achievement of your double century—not out". Around this time Gibbes also managed to fly Bf109F and G fighters captured from the Germans, and came away impressed. He was credited with another Bf109 on 17 November. On 21December, he landed his Kittyhawk in rugged terrain near Hun, Libya, to rescue a fellow pilot who had been forced down. Gibbes threw out his own parachute to make room in the cockpit for his passenger and lost part of his undercarriage taking off, necessitating a one-wheeled landing back at base. Recommended for the Victoria Cross for this action, he was instead awarded the Distinguished Service Order, which was promulgated on 15January 1943 and cited his [...] "outstanding qualities of leadership and enthusiasm". Gibbes himself crash landed behind enemy lines on 14January 1943, walking [...] in the desert before being {{picked up by a}} British Army patrol. He was awarded a bar to his DFC for this feat, and for his [...] "exceptional leadership, skill and courage, contributing in a large measure {{to the success of the}} squadron he commands".

500|$|While the {{official}} conversion of Scandinavian Scotland {{took place at}} the end of the tenth century, there is evidence that Christianity had already made inroads into the Viking controlled Highland and Islands.

The King summoned the local jarl Sigurd the Stout and said [...] "I order <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> your subjects to be baptised. If you refuse, I'll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel". The story may be apocryphal, but the islands became officially Christian, receiving their own bishop in the early eleventh century. The bishopric appears to have been under the authority of the Archbishops of York and of Hamburg-Bremen at different points before the twelfth century and from then until 1472 it was subordinate to the Archbishop of Nidaros (today's Trondheim). Elsewhere in Scandinavian Scotland the record is less clear. There was a Bishop of Iona until the late tenth century, followed by a gap of more than a century, possibly filled by the Bishops of Orkney, before the appointment of the first Bishop of Mann in 1079. One of the major effects of the conversion of the Vikings was to bring an end to plundering raids on Christian sites, which may have allowed them to recover some of their status as cultural and intellectual centres. It also probably curbed the excesses of Viking violence and led to a more settled society in northern Scotland.|$|E
