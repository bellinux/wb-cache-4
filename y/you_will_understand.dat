500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{revealed}} {{in a conference}} call interview that the episode was the [...] "culmination of {{a lot of things that}} [...] had been working on for quite a while". Though they loved all of their episodes, the two stated that [...] "Entrada" [...] was a particular favorite of theirs, with Pinker elaborating that [...] "if the only episode of Fringe you ever tune into watch is this one, sure, it’s going to take you five minutes to catch up, but you will feel what’s going on, and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>understand</b> the relationships... a great entry point".

2500|$|In {{the context}} of theistic belief, Stephen Roberts said [...] "I contend we are both atheists, I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you {{understand}} why you dismiss all the other possible gods, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>understand</b> why I dismiss yours." ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "historical induction" [...] {{argument}} {{concludes that}} since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. ancient Egyptian religion, ancient Greek religion) and their gods ultimately {{come to be}} regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts' popular quotation: I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>understand</b> why I dismiss yours.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crisis was}} {{continuing}} unabated, {{and in the}} evening of October 24, the Soviet news agency TASS broadcast a telegram from Khrushchev to Kennedy in which Khrushchev warned that the United States's [...] "outright piracy" [...] would lead to war. However, that was followed at 9:24pm by a telegram from Khrushchev to Kennedy, which was received at 10:52pm EDT. Khrushchev stated, [...] "if you weigh the present situation with a cool head without giving way to passion, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>understand</b> that the Soviet Union cannot afford not to decline the despotic demands of the USA" [...] and that the Soviet Union views the blockade as [...] "an act of aggression" [...] and their ships will be instructed to ignore it.|$|E
2500|$|Kojima {{also said}} about her clothing, [...] "Once {{you see how}} she fits into the story, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>understand</b> why she looks the way she does. Without any of this {{background}} I can certainly understand why there are concerns. I will say there’s a reason she looks the way she does and wears those clothes. And it’s all {{a part of the}} game, learning those reasons one by one." [...] Joosten herself was surprised with the controversy, but said [...] "When I got to see her design, I was shocked too. But everybody didn’t get to hear her story yet so I can understand people are angry about it or saying she is showing too much. But I am not bothered by it.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Gromyko grew up {{near the}} {{district}} town of Vetka {{where most of the}} inhabitants were devoted Old Believers in the Russian Orthodox Church. Gromyko's own village was also predominantly religious, but Gromyko started doubting the supernatural at a very early age. His first dialog on the subject was with his grandmother Marfa, who answered his inquiry about God with [...] "Wait until you get older. Then <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>understand</b> all this much better". According to Gromyko, [...] "Other adults said basically the same thing" [...] when talking about religion. Gromyko's neighbour at the time, Mikhail Sjeljutov, was a freethinker and introduced Gromyko to new non-religious ideas and told Gromyko that scientists were beginning to doubt the existence of God. From the age of nine, after the Bolshevik revolution, Gromyko started reading atheist propaganda in flyers and pamphlets. At the age of thirteen Gromyko {{became a member of the}} Komsomol and held anti-religious speeches in the village with his friends as well as promoting Communist values.|$|E
