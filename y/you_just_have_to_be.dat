500|$|Having {{experienced}} both {{avenues of}} recording {{on a major}} label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music. [...] He {{spends most of his}} time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. [...] "I'm my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions", he told West Central Tribune's Anne Polta. [...] As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said. [...] "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent." [...] "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said.

500|$|On January 31, 2010, Pink {{performed}} the song at the 52nd Grammy Awards {{in a similar}} fashion. She began the performance walking out in a white silk robe, {{standing in front of}} a backdrop of electric blue screens. She descenced into the aisle and took off the robe to reveal the bodysuit. After being lifted from the tank of water, Pink kept twirling and spreading water into all directions, before finally descending to the main stage. The audience greeted her with a standing ovation. The performance was deemed by various media outlets as the best of the ceremony. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday commented, [...] "With her stunning Grammy performance of 'Glitter in the Air,' Pink proved that you don’t have to be shocking or over-the-top to be the best or the most-talked-about. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> amazing." [...] It was also voted on a readers' poll in MTV.com as the best performance of the night. Staff reporter Kyle Anderson said [...] "It's easy to see why, as her acrobatic performance of 'Glitter in the Air' was not only visually gorgeous, but also technically impressive — she was able to keep singing even as she was spinning around in the air". Pink later explained she had almost fallen during the song, saying, [...] "When I do it on tour, I don't have lights above me. There were lights above me, so it almost went into a strobe thing, and I actually did get a little turned around. I thought... I was going to fall on my nude butt. But I worked it out." [...] In 2013, Brad Wete for Billboard ranked the performance as the best performance at the Grammy Awards from 2000 to 2012, commenting it [...] "graceful, show-stopping performance of aerial, acrobatic and vocal brilliance." ...|$|E

5000|$|Tyler {{began working}} with German {{producer}} Dieter Bohlen in 1991. She was reluctant to record Bohlen's songs at first, having been used to recording rock music. He was able to persuade Tyler, remarking, [...] "you've made your rock music for years, but maybe <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a bit more commercial." [...] Bohlen was inspired by Rod Stewart's success with [...] "Rhythm of My Heart", which was released in early 1991.

5000|$|Darren Shan starts narrating {{the story}} {{by saying he}} was always fascinated by spiders. When he was young, he used to bring spiders from the garden and let them loose in his house despite what his mom said about never {{bringing}} them in, and {{at the age of}} 9, he received the greatest gift of his life: a small tarantula. However, the joy of that gift was crushed when he, after watching a cartoon, killed the spider with a vacuum cleaner. He explains, [...] "life, unlike a cartoon, is naturally evil, doesn't care about happy endings, and is always out to kill you. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> careful."

5000|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, I disliked all of records intensely. I was most unhappy when they were released. I just often cried because I thought they were so poor, mostly because of my work, but a great deal, I suppose, because of the recording. ... I disliked the {{business}} intensely. I loathed it, and I'm ashamed to say I just did it for the money. I loved singing, you know, jamming with the musicians when it isn't important to do, but somehow or another I was terribly nervous when I sang. ... <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> such a ham and love performing, and I happen to be an introvert, and I just wasn't happy singing, and I wasn't happy with my work as I said.

50|$|The video shows Monrose in a flowery garden, Bahar Kızıl {{sitting on}} a swing while Senna Guemmour is {{standing}} in front of a cherry tree and Mandy Capristo is shown {{sitting on a}} bench. Scenes of two harassed women and one father whose son smudged his apartment with yellow paint are cut in. They seem to despair but then the garden in which Monrose are placed turns out to be a glass globe that encourages the three tormented. The music video plays with two heavy contrasted worlds: On the one hand the glass globe which shows a gaudy fairylike dreamland but on the other hand the grey, drab, depressing world where injustice and grief happens. However the video attempts to convey what the song's lyrics say: There are always ups and downs in life <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loyal to yourself and everything will become fine again.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, {{others may}} become {{independent}} label acts after having already experienced recording {{on a major}} label. Bradley Joseph asked to be let go from his major label deal with Narada/Virgin Records and subsequently became an independent artist. He says, [...] "As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled. [...] A lot of musicians don't learn the business. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, and what helps you make {{the most out of}} your talent. But some artists just {{want to be involved in}} the music and don't like the added problems or have the personality to work with both". Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their own needs and wants.|$|E

The song follows a strong pop style, in much similar fashion to her previous work with producer Max Martin.Pink describes the song as a [...] "celebration for people who feel left out from the popular crowd." [...] In an interview for MTV, Pink comments on the song: [...] "I don't know if it's going to be huge, but it is new. I did three new songs. It was good timing. I {{had been on the}} road for two years and I hadn't written anything and I wanted to write a song about underdogs. Instead of going and becoming a cover girl, I kind of just hit the road and pounded the pavement...and became a touring artist.

50|$|Delaware Pictures {{launched}} a marketing {{campaign for the}} film, titled “What Do U Fear?,” posing this central question to many an ordinary citizen, with many a forthcoming response.“Every {{one of us has}} a whole list of fears, and it was interesting how many people were actually happy and willing to talk about them,” Deak said.This responsiveness was encouraging to Deak and Pirotta, who see bravery not as an absence of fear but as an acknowledgment and confrontation of it. One of the main goals of the “Dreamkiller” campaign is to spread a feeling of normalcy, to reassure viewers that their fears do not place them in a minority.A potential partnership with UCLA’s Counseling Center fell through, but Pirotta and Deak pursued connections with other psychological services offices nationwide, as well as celebrities and well-known figures.“When you hear celebrities talking about their fears, you feel a little more normal,” Pirotta said.“There are no shortcuts in life - that’s one of the messages in the movie - sometimes <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong and get up every time you fall, and at the end the only way to defeat fear is to be brave,” Pirotta said.|$|E
