2500|$|Misao is a sixteen-year-old {{high school}} student. She {{has been plagued}} {{with the ability to}} see demons ever since birth. Because of her ability, she was never able to make any friends until she met Kyō. The monsters were {{harmless}} until her sixteenth birthday; on the day she turned sixteen, a monster possessing one of the schools idols attacks her. Before she was injured any further, Kyō came to save her and healed her wound by licking it. It is then that she discovers that he is a demon and that she is the [...] "bride of the prophecy" [...] for the head of the Tengu Clan; she was chosen to be the wife of the next head of the clan ten <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> was a child, Misao became attached to Kyo and they had made a promise that she would be his bride. However, she was supposed to marry Kyo's older brother, Sho, who was the heir to the clan. As a result, Kyo left Misao's side in order to surpass him and become the heir. At first, she was scared of Kyo for his stoic personality and demonic powers, but grows to trust and understand that he is willing to do anything to be with her. She later falls in love with Kyo and decides to fulfill her promise to him by becoming his wife, once she graduates high school. They begin a romantic and sexual relationship from then on. After Sho's death, Misao notices a change in her powers, which no one is able to touch her and her scent is overwhelming. It is discovered that this is because Misao is pregnant with a demon child. Despite being told the baby could kill her during childbirth, she refuses to abort it because she has grown to love her unborn child. Misao gives birth to a boy whom she named Sou. Instead of dying, a miracle happens when Misao wakes up, and even though it costs her most of her ability to walk, she is able to live happily with Kyo and Sou.|$|E

Genu recurvatum, {{as a consequence of}} PPS, is one such disability which can be treated through different measures. Case Presentation A 43 -year-old woman with a history of supracondylar extension osteotomy of the left femur at the age of 22 was admitted to our hospital for a flexion contracture of the left knee due to poliomyelitis. She was able to walk without assistance for 20 years after the osteotomy until one <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> started to experience progressive genu recurvatum. In the clinical and laboratory workup, she was diagnosed with PPS. Accordingly, we decided to perform supracondylar flexion osteotomy.

40|$|Introduction Takotsubo {{cardiomyopathy}} (TC), {{also known}} as stress cardiomyopathy, and broken heart syndrome is characterized by transient left ventricular (LV) apical akinesis with symptoms mimicking acute coronary syndrome. The first case was described by Sato et al. in Japan. 1 The Japanese word “takotsubo” translates to “octopus pot” describing {{the shape of the}} left ventricle during systole. TC can be triggered by a “broken heart” including death of a loved one, constant anxiety, surgery, or critical illness etc. Prevalence is around 2 % to 3 % with over 90 % in postmenopausal women aged between 58 and 75. Its pathogenesis remains unclear. Some postulated that excess catecholamine released during stress can induce an exaggerated sympathetic response precipitating severe, reversible LV dysfunction in patients without coronary disease. 2 Whether there is a genetic component is not well understood. There are a few reported cases of Takotsubo in family members, one case of two sisters and another mother-daughter pair. 3, 4 Recurrence of the syndrome in the same patient, although rare, can occur and suggests a genetic predisposition. 5 Majority of patients regain normal ventricular function within one to four weeks if they survive the acute episode. Hospital mortality rates range from 0 to 8 %. However, one major complication is the risk of intraventricular thrombus formation and systemic embolization. Data is lacking to guide anticoagulation for LV thrombus prevention in patients with stress cardiomyopathy. Case Presentation Mrs. S is a 62 year old woman with a prior history of TC with full recovery, hyperlipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease presented with chest pain radiating to her left shoulder. She was under significant financial stress during that week. Her pain was unrelieved with aspirin or sublingual nitroglycerin. In the emergency room, her electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevations in leads V 2 -V 6 (Figure 1) with Troponin T 1. 49 ng/mL. She was immediately started on heparin and nitroglycerin drips and rushed to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography did not reveal significant coronary disease but incidentally found elevated pulmonary wedge pressures. Upon transfer to the cardiac intensive unit, Mrs. S became hypotensive and norepinephrine was started. Her transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed moderately decreased LV systolic function with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 35 %, with segmental wall motion abnormalities, mid and distal akinesis of the LV and hyperkinesis of basal LV. There was a late-peaking LV outflow tract gradient of 77 mm Hg consistent with severe, dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. She had a prior episode of TC when her husband passed away three <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> She also has a twin sister who suffered from TC a <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> lost her job. Unlike Mrs. S, she did not fully recover and required long term heart failure management...|$|R
