While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage, and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer R. F. Foster observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the man <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> was happening in the world when he was twenty [...] "is manifestly true of W.B.Y." [...] Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the home rule movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent {{around the turn of the}} century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.|$|E

Parts of the film were shot with a Pixelvision camera, a primitive video toy that's used as a vampire's-eye-view, as if vampires, like flies, had faceted eyes.

5000|$|After {{the other}} four founders were drafted off into the Korean War, they left Emperado to start the first Kajukenbo school at the Palama Settlement Gym in 1950. Many of the {{students}} who trained there were poor, so at the Palama school students could train for $2.00 a month. The workouts that took place there are legendary for their brutality. Kajukenbo train strong to remain strong. Emperado has been quoted as saying that a workout was not over until there was blood on the floor. When a reporter went on to ask him about this {{he went on to say}} that [...] "you have to experience pain before you can give it. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> your technique can do.

Although the bacteriophage world does not have the advantage of a conserved gene, present in all members, there are many phage genes that do show nucleotide conservation even between phages which infect fairly divergent taxa. As more sequence data become available through both metagenomic approaches and the sequencing of complete bacteriophage genomes, PCR primers can be further refined and thus it should be an increasingly useful tool for bacteriophage biology...|$|E
30|$|The Kuwaiti {{society is}} {{characterized}} by high uncertainty avoidance, implying that in general members of the population are not in favour of taking risks, preferring situations with known and stable outcomes. However, our findings showed that the entrepreneurs in the sample contradicted the trend and exhibited low levels of uncertainty avoidance. Mostly, they are risk-takers who have invested their own money or took personal loans to finance their ventures. In most cases, they did not prepare business plans or gave much significance to the uncertainties and risks associated with their new ventures. It was clear {{that most of the}} participants showed a tendency towards a non-predictive control approach. One interviewee stated “In real life I have discovered that planning is only one way of doing things. You have to be organized, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you want, but plans can always change”, and added “doing a plan would {{take a lot of time}} and you do not have enough information to plan what you will do in the next five years.

The very fact that it is done so well, reproduced without effort is extraordinary. Yet, there have been to date no studies on this common sense activity. How do we do ‘being an audience’? This study draws on the approaches of Harvey Sacks (1992) who looked at the ordinary as something extraordinary. The act of doing ordinary things within the formal structures of living as an achievement. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is ordinary before you can do ordinariness. This study is about the very ‘ordinary’ act of being an audience. Exposing the formal structures involved that make the work of audiences a practicality. This will be done by the marriage of two theoretical perspectives, which focus on locally produced order. This lo-cally produced order found in Erving Goffman (1981) and Harvey Sacks (1992) will isolate the context of the audience relationship with the textual environment. This context is made available for study because of audience laughter. As the laughter in Seinfeld is recorded from a live audience the interaction is one that exists in real time. Laughter is an opportunity to study the relationship between the audience and the text, the critical features of this relationship - the context...|$|E
