500|$|Despite {{the losses}} in battles for gay rights {{across the country}} that year, he {{remained}} optimistic, saying [...] "Even if gays lose in these initiatives, people are still being educated. Because of Anita Bryant and Dade County, the entire country was educated about homosexuality {{to a greater extent than}} ever before. The first step is always hostility, and after that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> down and talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pets was Pets. Mongrels is Mongrels. If, as a viewer, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> {{down and}} say they are the same, then there is little point of making any new shows, if the {{slightest}} similarity (puppets and animals) can be suggested as idea stealing. I am surprised Basil Brush hasn't been on the blower, as he is a fox, and that must be a copy! Right? I worked on both, and {{know for a fact}} where they both come from. Two very different ideas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am not a}} {{child at}} all," [...] she {{interrupted}} warmly, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just <b>sit</b> down and write to your silly client and tell him so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} overtired all day," [...] said Allan, [...] "and this infernal {{adventure}} of ours has upset you. Take some more whisky, it's sure to do <b>you</b> good. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> by yourself, if I put you against the bulwark, so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|When he rose, {{damp and}} jumpy, and his throat dusty from cigarettes, she marveled, [...] "I don't see how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just <b>sit</b> {{down and make}} up things right out of your own head!" ...|$|R
500|$|Exline also {{belonged to}} an amateur {{softball}} league but the Coens changed it to bowling in the film, because [...] "it's a very social sport where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> around {{and drink and}} smoke while engaging in inane conversation". The Coens met filmmaker John Milius, {{when they were in}} Los Angeles making Barton Fink and incorporated his love of guns and the military into the character of Walter. John Milius introduced the Coen Brothers to one of his best friends, Jim Ganzer, who would have been another source of inferences to create Jeff Bridges' character. Also known as the Dude, Ganzer and his gang, typical Malibu surfers, served as inspiration as well for Milius's film The Big Wednesday.|$|E
500|$|Rewrites were {{commissioned}} once more, specifically to give Halle Berry more screen time. This {{was because of}} her recent popularity in Monster's Ball, earning her the Academy Award for Best Actress. A budget cut meant that the Sentinels and the Danger Room were dropped. Guy Hendrix Dyas and a production crew had already constructed the Danger Room set. In the words of Dyas, [...] "The control room [...] was a large propeller that actually rotated around the room so that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> up [...] and travel around the subject {{who is in the}} middle of the control room. The idea for the traveling is that if it's a mutant has some kind of mind control powers they can't connect." ...|$|E
500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{called it}} [...] "A first-rate action thriller, a vivid {{evocation}} of urban warfare in Iraq, a penetrating study of heroism and {{a showcase for}} austere technique, terse writing and a trio of brilliant performances." [...] The Toronto Star critic Peter Howell said, [...] "Just when you think the battle of Iraq war dramas has been fought and lost, along comes one that demands to be seen... If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> through The Hurt Locker without your heart nearly pounding through your chest, you must be made of granite." [...] Entertainment Weeklys film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film the rare [...] "A" [...] rating, calling it, [...] "an intense, action-driven war pic, a muscular, efficient standout that simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within {{as well as what}} it looks like on the ground. This ain't no war videogame." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This," [...] said Horton solemnly, [...] "is--all of them. It's {{the square}} thing. Is {{there any reason}} why a man shouldn't {{do what is right}} because it suits him? Anyway, it needn't worry <b>you,</b> because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just <b>sit</b> up and watch the circus begin." ...|$|R
500|$|While {{working on}} the album, Mars said: [...] "I'm never singing another ballad again," [...] but {{that came from the}} gut – it's the most honest, real thing I've ever sung," [...] he says. [...] "When there are no safe bets, that's when I feel my blood move." [...] He also shared how {{important}} the lyrics to this song are for him when he posted a photograph of Unorthodox Jukeboxs artwork via his Twitter account. [...] "Soon you guys will hear a song I wrote called When I Was Your Man. I've never been this nervous. Can't explain it," [...] he tweeted. Philip Lawrence explained the inspiration of the song: [...] "I think Bruno and I are both huge fans of older music, like Billy Joel and Elton John. We always loved those moments where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> at the piano and emote. Those intimate moments when an artist is so naked and vulnerable; you can’t help but be drawn to it. We always wanted to find a stripped down song like that, which is how that song came to be. The subject matter was real life; Bruno had experienced that, so we tried to say it in the best and catchiest way we could." ...|$|E
2500|$|Storyboard artists Simon Duric said [...] "The {{security}} on the film was a challenge. That script was locked in a safe. Most of the time on a film <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> at your desk {{with a copy of}} the script next to you. On this, you couldn’t. That’s fine but it was tricky in places. We had people flying drones over Pinewood studios trying to take photographs. It was nuts. If a prop was being moved we had to have them covered in a big black sheet. We were told in an email to be [...] of drones." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Benham and reflected, [...] "they do sing. I suppose {{singing is}} the last thing left to men. When there is nothing else <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>sit</b> about and sing. Miners who have been buried in mines will sing, people going down in ships." ...|$|R

5000|$|The songwriting is {{much more}} stuck to the classic {{boundaries}} of songwriting {{as far as a}} verse and chorus. Before we had no respect for songwriting and that was our style and we liked that.
