500|$|Chana {{attributed}} her eclectic touring {{schedule to}} {{her understanding of}} rock and roll, saying that she heard the genre of music defined as: [...] "You rock, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> van, and then you roll." [...] When asking about her intentions for the EP, she responded {{that she did not}} have an exact plan for its promotion and that she would rather [...] "let it work itself out". Chana expressed a desire to record more material for an album, which would include some songs from the EP. She said that she was interested in working with Thom Russo to expand her sound from that on the EP.|$|E
500|$|All of Ecstasys seven {{tracks were}} written and {{composed}} by Kevin Shields, with Colm Ó Cíosóig credited as the co-writer of three tracks—"The Things I Miss", [...] "Clair" [...] and [...] "(Please) Lose Yourself in Me". Regarding the lyrical {{content of the}} album {{in contrast to the}} music, Shields said that [...] "the songs may sound sweet, but the subject matter isn't necessarily very nice. A lot of it is relationship-based, but it's always vague, and never just boy-meets-girl. It could easily be boy-meets-boy, or girl-meets-girl. Then there's hate, and whimsical thoughts you get from nowhere". Ó Cíosóig remarked that [...] "it's more weird perversions of feeling <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relationship" [...] and referred to the lyrics as being marked by [...] "extremes, because we're entertained by extreme things". Shields noted that the lyrics were a progression from the band's earlier releases as [...] "the idea of composing a sweet pop song that sugar-coated some lyrical horror and sending it hurtling up the charts appealed to our sense of humour" [...] and considered the songwriting process for Ecstasy as [...] "fresh after having made pure noise earlier".|$|E
2500|$|Greenspan {{discusses}} in his book, {{among other}} things, his history {{in government and}} economics, capitalism and other economic systems, current issues in the global economy, and future issues that face the global economy. In the book Greenspan criticizes President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and the Republican-controlled Congress for abandoning the Republican Party's principles on spending and deficits. Greenspan's criticisms of President Bush include his refusal to veto spending bills, sending the country into increasingly deep deficits, and for [...] "putting political imperatives ahead of sound economic policies". Greenspan writes, [...] "They swapped principle for power. They ended up with neither. They deserved to lose [...] ". He praised Bill Clinton above all the other presidents for whom he'd worked for his [...] "consistent, disciplined focus on long-term economic growth". Although he respected {{what he saw as}} Richard Nixon's immense intelligence, Greenspan found him to be [...] "sadly paranoid, misanthropic and cynical". He said of Gerald Ford that he [...] "was as close to normal as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> president, but he was never elected". Regarding future U.S. economic policy, Greenspan recommends improving the U.S. primary and secondary education systems. He asserts this would narrow the inequality between the minority of high-income earners and most workers whose wages have not grown in proportion with globalization and the nation's GDP growth.|$|E

Then, miss, you'd be perfectly amazed at what you could see through that glass {{at the bottom of the}} box! Even in northern regions, where the water is heavy and murky, you can see a good way down; but all about the tropics, where the water is often so thin and clear that you can see the bottom in some places with nothing but your naked eyes, it is perfectly amazing what you can see with a water-glass! It doesn't seem a bit as if you were looking down into the sea; it is just like gazing about in the upper air. If it isn't too deep, things on the bottom--fishes swimming about, everything--is just as plain and distinct as if there wasn't any water under you and you were just looking down from the top of a house.|$|E

I went on by a through train that runs daily from Washington to the Yankee metropolis without change. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sleeping-car soon after dark in Philadelphia, and after ruminating an hour or two, have your bed made up if you like, draw the curtains, and go to sleep in it--fly on through Jersey to New York--hear in your half-slumbers a dull jolting and bumping sound or two--are unconsciously toted from Jersey City by a midnight steamer around the Battery and under the big bridge to the track of the New Haven road--resume your flight eastward, and early the next morning you wake up in Boston. All of which was my experience. I {{wanted to go to the}} Revere house. A tall unknown gentleman, (a fellow-passenger on his way to Newport he told me, I had just chatted a few moments before with him,) assisted me out through the depot crowd, procured a hack, put me in it with my traveling bag, saying smilingly and quietly, [...] "Now I want you to let this be my ride," [...] paid the driver, and before I could remonstrate bow'd himself off.|$|E

Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near

I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came

year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on

before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old

like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if

To play, the player selects a song {{from the list of}} all songs {{available}} and plays it.
