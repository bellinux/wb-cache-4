500|$|Before meeting Beyoncé, Rich Harrison had {{conceptualized}} {{the beat}} of the song. He had sampled the hook's instrumentation from the 1970 song [...] "Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So)," [...] which had originally been written and composed by Eugene Record, frontman of the Chicago-based vocal group The Chi-Lites. When Harrison first played the beat to his friends, they could not [...] "dig it," [...] and this made him realize that he had conceived something special, which people would appreciate better after hearing the whole record. Thus Harrison decided not to market the selection, and instead, he waited for the right artist to record it: [...] "I had it in the chamber, I had not really shopped it much, because sometimes <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> come out of the bag before it's right. People do not really get it and you will leave them with a foul taste in their mouth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jesus then {{describes}} Peter's {{future to}} him, and says [...] "someone else will dress you and lead you where <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go" [...] (John 21:18, NIV). The narrator interprets this as referring to Peter's martyrdom (John 21:19). According to a tradition {{found in the}} apocryphal Acts of Peter, Peter was crucified upside-down.|$|E
2500|$|During the outro to [...] "Rubber Ring" [...] by The Smiths, {{a sample}} from an EVP {{recording}} is repeated. The phrase [...] "You are sleeping, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> believe," [...] is a 'translation' of the 'spirit voices' from a 1970s flexitape. The original recording {{is from the}} 1971 record which accompanied Raudive's book 'Breakthrough', and which was re-issued as a flexi-disc in the 1980s free with The Unexplained magazine.|$|E

That's when I {{began to develop}} what you now see full-fledged in the 'wedge' strategy: 'Stick with the most important thing' —the mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> raise the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument {{in such a way}} that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, 'Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?' and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The storyline {{received}} positive {{attention from}} critics. Dianne Butler, {{writing for the}} Herald Sun, quipped [...] "the bride and groom give {{a bit of a}} shudder when Paul Robinson arrives at their door {{on the morning of the}} wedding, but I think that's most people's reaction any time Paul shows up. But it's a lovely day – yellow roses, Karl doesn't sing – apart from the robbery, and the screaming and the ambulances. Neighbours eh? Brilliant. Nobody's done a wedding like this in years." [...] Kate Lucey from Sugar called [...] "Neighbours: The Explosion" [...] one of the serial's [...] "biggest storylines of the year" [...] and included it in her feature on upcoming dramatic soap storylines. Lucey said [...] "With an upcoming fire in the Rovers Return for Coronation Street, an explosion in Neighbours and the newly announced plans for a pregnancy in EastEnders, we're not really sure where to look first." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy stated that the explosion was [...] "one of 2013's biggest storylines." [...] Of the explosion, a columnist from New! commented [...] "This is one episode <b>you</b> <b>DO</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> miss!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, in {{a message}} to his {{subjects}} the King conveyed, [...] "Do not worry about me, he will release me soon, without any need for payment- Tong Seal {{does not seem to}} be wealthy either." [...] When Pu Tong Seal found out about La King's attitude, he secretly collected all the wealth under his province such as silver, beads, bells, (zaam) a traditional musical instrument made of copper, other house utensils, and stored them in a large house to impress La King. One evening, Pu Tong Seal revealed his treasury to La King, and said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> meet my demand it is fine with me, I do not need your wealth, because I am already a very wealthy man- but in that case, you will never be released to see your kingdom and your family." [...] His determination to keep the Burman king alive but never to release him was very obvious in his stern voice. This sent a chill down La King's spine. La King then immediately sent another message to his Kingdom; this time, the King ordered them to fetch him at once with all the demanded ransom. The King also added in the message, [...] "Tong Seal isn't poor at all, as I first thought, he is actually a very wealthy man".|$|E
