500|$|Upon the Japanese release, {{the critic}} writing for The Japan Times reflected: [...] "If Lost in Translation is the film you'd make when {{all you know}} about Japan are the pampered press junkets at Shinjuku 5-star hotels, then Enter the Void is what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> if you never got beyond the Roppongi pub-crawl." [...] While the review was largely negative, the author was still {{impressed}} by the visual depiction of the Japanese capital: [...] "Visually, much {{of the film is}} stunning ... and the art design by Marc Caro (Delicatessen) takes Tokyo's love of neon gaudiness to a surreal extreme".|$|E
500|$|The {{co-operation}} between monarch and Parliament {{following the}} Gunpowder Plot was atypical. Instead, {{it was the}} previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides {{for the rest of}} the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity. On 7 July 1604, James had angrily prorogued Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies. [...] "I will not thank where I feel no thanks due", he had remarked in his closing speech. [...] "...I am not of such a stock as to praise fools... You see how many things you did not well... I wish <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come".|$|E
2500|$|In late November 1941, Welles was {{appointed}} as a goodwill ambassador to Latin America by Nelson Rockefeller, U.S. Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and a principal stockholder in RKO Radio Pictures. The {{mission of the}} OCIAA was cultural diplomacy, promoting hemispheric solidarity and countering the growing influence of the Axis powers in Latin America. John Hay Whitney, head of the agency's Motion Picture Division, {{was asked by the}} Brazilian government to produce a documentary of the annual Rio Carnival celebration taking place in early February 1942. In a telegram December 20, 1941, Whitney wrote Welles, [...] "Personally believe <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> great contribution to hemisphere solidarity with this project." ...|$|E

2500|$|My {{first meeting}} with Adm. James Holloway was some experience. I had asked to brief him on our plan for Jordan and was shown to his office. He was {{reclining}} on a sofa and remained that way throughout the session. When I would make a particular point, he would exclaim, 'Atta boy,' or 'That's it. Give'm hell' [...] a one-man cheering section, so to speak. It was quite the most incredible briefing I ever gave. I learned later that he suffered from some ailment at the time, which required him to take these rest sessions. He impressed me as a 'big picture' type, not too interested in details, but I left his office feeling that {{here was a man}} for whom <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> that extra effort and take that extra step." ...|$|E
