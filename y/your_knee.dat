Mariel Concepcion of Billboard dissected the song stating [...] "Nicki Minaj's highly-talked about [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] track hit the net over the weekend, and the Harajuku Barbie appears to be taking jabs at Lil' Kim." [...] In the first verse Minaj takes shots saying [...] "Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzing/So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been/Yeah I said it has-been/hang it up/flatscreen" [...] then again [...] "You out of work/I know it's tough/but enough is enough/" [...] Minaj then specifically takes jabs at Baltimore rapper Keys and Lil'Kim in the second verse rapping, [...] "Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on/ is it my fault that all of you bitches gone/" [...] and following this line this infered she was talking about Lil' Kim [...] "Nicki she just mad cause you took the spot/ word that bitch mad cause I took the spot/ Well bitch if you aint shitting then get off the pot/Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off ya top/. Minaj also subliminally took jabs at rapper Keys with [...] "I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's/ Raggedy Ann's/ Holes in <b>your</b> <b>knee</b> highs". Lil' Kim fired back at the song at a club-concert, stating [...] "I will erase this bitch’s social security number. First of all, I don’t even need a record right now and I’d kill that bitch with my old shit. My records ain’t just enter the charts, they made history. What the fuck is this bullshit, this shit come and go!" [...] Minaj later stated in an interview on The Wendy Williams Show that, [...] "They know what I'm talking about. See that's the thing when you put out records; you know only the 'guilty ones' feel like you're talking about them. So you know, if you have nothing to worry about, if you haven't came out saying stuff, if you never came out saying your ungrateful bullshit then you wouldn't worry about it." ...|$|E
