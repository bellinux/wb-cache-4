It received three from five {{stars in a}} review by RTÉ's Harry Guerin who said: [...] "you'll get what <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> for from their stomp and swing". Phil Udell's Hot Press review gave the album 4.5 out of five stars, saying it [...] "gives you that much sought after visceral thrill" [...] and that the duo [...] "wrote it, recorded it, fucked off. A classic".|$|E
500|$|Alexander Derek Dougan {{was born}} in Belfast on 20 January 1938, the son of Jackie and Josie Dougan. His father worked at Belfast docks. His grandfather, Sandy, had played at half-back for Linfield, and two of Sandy's {{brothers}} also played {{for some of the}} leading clubs in Belfast. As a child, Dougan would usually spend between four and eight hours a day playing football in the street. His family were poor, and later in life Dougan joked that [...] "on the street where I lived, if <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> your rent three weeks on the trot, the police used to come and see where you got the money from". As a teenager he spent 18 months working at a toy factory whilst playing amateur football for Cregagh Boys. He also trained with Linfield, but could not break into any of their junior teams. He instead joined Distillery in 1953. Manager Jimmy McIntosh handed him his first team debut on 5 February 1955, in a 0–0 Irish Cup first [...] round draw with Glentoran. Maurice Tadman, who succeeded McIntosh as the club's manager in the summer of 1955, preferred to use Dougan as a target man centre-forward, as Dougan's height made him adept at winning and flicking on headers in the opposition penalty area.|$|E
2500|$|Following England's 1991 Rugby World Cup semi-final {{victory over}} Scotland in a tryless Test, Campese led a media {{campaign}} designating England as a boring rugby team. Campese {{said that if}} he played for England, he would insist on playing the flyhalf position because it would be {{the only way he could}} touch the ball. Campese is quoted as saying, 'I wouldn't play for England even if <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> me' and 'Playing that sort of boring stuff is a good way to destroy the image of the game. They're all so scared of losing over here they won't try anything.' He further added that 'England would never beat us in the World Cup because they are a bunch of Toffs, and we are convicts.' ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{was first}} {{introduced}} to a run-down castle named Castello di Rocca Sinibalda [...] north of Rome in 1949 during a tour of Italy. Designed by Baldassare Peruzzi and built between 1530 and 1560 for Cardinal Alessandro Cesarini, in the 1950s she rented and later paid US$2,600 (about $ today) for the estate. It came with the Papal title of Principessa (Princess). She paid to electrify the castle and thus brought electricity to the neighboring village. She told a reporter that the castle had 320 rooms, [...] "at least that's what the villagers tell me." [...] (The deed listed 180 rooms.) Many of the rooms had [...] ceilings and the palace was virtually impossible to heat. [...] "I wouldn't live here if <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> me," [...] she told a reporter.|$|E
2500|$|Channel 4 {{questioned}} whether Goldsmith had under-reported the sums spent on signs, stickers and jackets {{used in his}} campaign, and claimed his campaign spending was much higher than other MPs they investigated. Goldsmith argued that this was because the expenditure was being spread across multiple campaigns [...] "The formula we used {{is exactly the same}} formula ... as used by MPs and candidates around the country. Every decision we took was approved by electoral experts at Conservative Central Office". It was debated whether signs that said [...] "Vote Zac Goldsmith" [...] and [...] "Vote Conservative" [...] could be charged to the election budget for a local election candidate when that other candidate was not mentioned on the sign. Goldsmith response was that it had been [...] "checked" [...] and that was [...] "standard practice" [...] across the country. The second question was about jackets with [...] "I back Zac" [...] stickers on the back. [...] "They cost £2,168 but you only said <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> (spent) £170". Goldsmith said the stickers cost £170 and the jackets were [...] "off the shelf" [...] and would be reused for other campaigns.|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his play}} Peace, Aristophanes {{imagined}} that the tragic poet Sophocles had turned into Simonides: [...] "He may be old and decayed, but these days, if <b>you</b> <b>paid</b> him enough, he'd go to sea in a sieve." [...] A scholiast, commenting on the passage, wrote: [...] "Simonides {{seems to have been}} the first to introduce money-grabbing into his songs and to write a song for pay" [...] and, as proof of it, quoted a passage from one of Pindar's odes ("For then the Muse was not yet fond of profit nor mercenary"), which he interpreted as covert criticism of Simonides. The same scholiast related a popular story that the poet kept two boxes, one empty and the other full - the empty one being where he kept favours, the full one being where he kept his money. According to Athenaeus, when Simonides was at Hieron's court in Syracuse, he used to sell most of the daily provisions that he received from the tyrant, justifying himself thus: [...] "So that all may see Hieron's magnificence and my moderation." [...] Aristotle reported that the wife of Hieron once asked Simonides whether it was better to be wealthy or wise, to which he apparently replied: [...] "Wealthy; for I see the wise spending their days at the doors of the wealthy." [...] According to an anecdote recorded on a papyrus, dating to around 250 BC, Hieron once asked the poet if everything grows old: [...] "Yes," [...] Simonides answered, [...] "all except money-making; and kind deeds age most quickly of all." [...] He once rejected a small fee to compose a victory ode for the winner of a mule race (it was not a prestigious event) but, according to Aristotle, changed his mind when the fee was increased, resulting in this magniloquent opening: [...] "Greetings, daughters of storm-footed horses!" [...] In a quote recorded by Plutarch, he once complained that old age had robbed him of every pleasure but making money. [...] All these amusing anecdotes might simply reflect {{the fact that he was}} the first poet to charge fees for his services—generosity is glimpsed in his payment for an inscription on a friend's epitaph, as recorded by Herodotus. Herodotus also mentions an earlier poet Arion, who had amassed a fortune on a visit to Italy and Sicily, so maybe Simonides wasn't the first professional poet, as claimed by the Greeks themselves.|$|E
