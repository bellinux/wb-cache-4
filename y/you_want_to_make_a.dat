He said [...] "Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it's a wonderful problem, because it doesn't look so easy." ...|$|E

The meeting led to her recording her first album. “One day, I was at my hairdresser, and Dave Robinson’s wife Rosemary leant over and said, ‘Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> record?’ I was having some of those Boy George kind of dreadlock things put in and I went, ‘Yeah I want to make a record.’ I would have tried anything.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, {{frontman}} Josh Homme {{was hospitalized}} for thirteen days, and subsequently bedridden for four months, following complications during a routine surgical procedure on his knee. Homme noted, [...] "I {{woke up and}} there was a doctor going, ‘Shit, we lost you.' I couldn’t get up for four months. When I did, I hadn’t got a clue what was going on." [...] During this time, Homme sank into a deep depression, noting [...] "I would never say, 'I'm probably not gonna make it out of here.' But back then, I would definitely think it." [...] The remaining members of Queens of the Stone Age— guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, drummer Joey Castillo, bassist Michael Shuman and guitarist and keyboardist Dean Fertita – encouraged Homme to return to the band to begin work on a sixth studio album. Homme noted, [...] "I had to ask them 'If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> record with me right now, in the state I’m in, come into the fog. It's the only chance you got.' It brought us much closer, because you never really know someone till everything goes wrong." ...|$|E
