2500|$|Graney and Moore {{continued}} to perform live around Australia and released material {{on their own}} Melbourne based label, Cockaigne. Initially with MGM, it was later distributed by Reverberation, a Sydney boutique label. Cockaigne's release was The Dave Graney Show's single, [...] "Drugs are Wasted on the Young" [...] in February 2000 ahead of the album, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye in April. It was co-produced by Graney, Moore and Adam Rhodes. Other singles were [...] "Out of the Loop" [...] (with Mahony video) and [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Heard</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Melbourne Mafia?". All with cover art by Mahony. Graney described the album as [...] "dark, brandy flavoured, disco". It was released in the UK and Europe on Cooking Vinyl. A tour of Europe, with a line-up of Graney, Moore and Perera, supporting Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds followed in 2001. Moore released her first solo album, The Third Woman, on Chapter Music in August.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh yes! very much! exactly!" [...] says he. [...] "Why, my dear fellow, {{you don't}} {{mean to say}} <b>you</b> haven't <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> little Opera-dancer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, Miss Layard, <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{wreck of}} the Trondhjem, and how those foreign sailors saw the light in my {{workshop}} and brought Mr. Fregelius to the Abbey." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ten {{minutes of}} palaeontology ensued; {{and she was}} leading {{the way back to}} the drawing-room, when he exclaimed, 'Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> match, Miss May?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Haven't <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sea serpents {{they have}} seen at Atlantic City?" [...] demanded Tom,-- [...] "four or five of them." [...] And he poked Sam, who sat beside him, in the ribs; and also winked at Spud, {{who was in the}} seat with William Philander.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{want to be}} seen {{talking to}} you at the hotel," [...] Turner explained. [...] "It mightn't have been safe for me if Mappin got to hear of it. But there's {{something}} you ought to know. The boys he sent after <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> strike you made when they came down here for grub, and are on the trail again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Peters nodded. [...] "I expect <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> black Napoleon {{who founded}} a negro {{state in the}} Antilles? Well, it's not {{impossible}} the Bat will make himself as powerful as the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes... yes. And I almost {{wish you}} had not come! It {{is a little too}} soon--that's all I mean. Still, let us make the best of it. <b>You</b> haven't <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> school, I suppose?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Have <b>You</b> <b>Heard</b> <b>The</b> One <b>About</b> <b>The</b> Gas Station Attendant? (Columbia, 1973) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a hint {{of mystery}} about the matter. I expect <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> collier tramp that was {{consigned}} to the French company at Arucas? Owing to some dispute, they wouldn't take the cargo and the shippers {{put it on the}} market. Fuller tried to buy some, but found that another party had got the lot. Well, Stuyvesant believes it was the German, Richter, who bought it up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> parrot?" [...] {{he asked}} at once. [...] "'Pon my soul I'm awfully sorry. The moment {{he saw the}} monkey I'd brought down as a {{surprise}} for you he squawked out 'Rats to you, sir!' and the blessed monkey made one spring at him, got him by the neck and whirled him round like a rattle. He was as dead as mutton by the time I'd got {{him out of the}} little beggar's paws. Always been such a friendly little beast, the monkey has, should never have thought he'd got it in him to see red like that. Can't tell you how sorry I feel about it, and now of course you'll hate the sight of the monkey." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was then}} taken into a parlour, {{so small that}} her first {{conviction}} was of its being only a passage-room to something better, and she {{stood for a moment}} expecting to be invited on; but when she saw there was no other door, and that there were signs of habitation before her, she called back her thoughts, reproved herself, and grieved lest they should have been suspected. Her mother, however, could not stay long enough to suspect anything. She was gone again to the street-door, to welcome William. [...] "Oh! my dear William, how glad I am to see you. But have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Thrush? She is gone out of harbour already; three days before we had any thought of it; and I do not know what I am to do about Sam's things, they will never be ready in time; for she may have her orders to-morrow, perhaps. It takes me quite unawares. And now you must be off for Spithead too. Campbell has been here, quite in a worry about you; and now what shall we do? I thought to have had such a comfortable evening with you, and here everything comes upon me at once." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Bartle, pausing, {{with one}} hand on his back. [...] "Then there's {{something}} in the wind--there's something in the wind. Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> anything <b>about</b> what <b>the</b> old squire means to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor I, Dave. I {{never did}} like that fellow, and I don't like his father, either. By the way, have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> {{anything}} more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> farm {{that belongs to}} Professor Potts?" ...|$|R
6000|$|May 3. Sunday. Fifteen {{or twenty}} Africanders who will end their voyage to-day and strike for their several homes from Delagoa Bay to-morrow, sat up singing on the afterdeck in the {{moonlight}} till 3 A.M. Good fun and wholesome. And the songs were clean songs, {{and some of them}} were hallowed by tender associations. Finally, in a pause, a man asked, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fellow that kept a diary crossing the Atlantic?" [...] It was a discord, a wet blanket. The men were not in the mood for humorous dirt. The songs had carried them to their homes, and in spirit they sat by those far hearthstones, and saw faces and heard voices other than those that were about them. And so this disposition to drag in an old indecent anecdote got no welcome; nobody answered. The poor man hadn't wit enough to see that he had blundered, but asked his question again. Again there was no response. It was embarrassing for him. In his confusion he chose the wrong course, did the wrong thing--began the anecdote. Began it in a deep and hostile stillness, where had been such life and stir and warm comradeship before. He delivered himself of the brief details of the diary's first day, and did it with some confidence and a fair degree of eagerness. It fell flat. There was an awkward pause. The two rows of men sat like statues. There was no movement, no sound. He had to go on; there was no other way, at least none that an animal of his calibre could think of. At the close of each day's diary, the same dismal silence followed. When at last he finished his tale and sprung the indelicate surprise which is wont to fetch a crash of laughter, not a ripple of sound resulted. It was as if the tale had been told to dead men. After what seemed a long, long time, somebody sighed, somebody else stirred in his seat; presently, the men dropped into a low murmur of confidential talk, each with his neighbor, and the incident was closed. There were indications that that man was fond of his anecdote; that it was his pet, his standby, his shot that never missed, his reputation-maker. But he will never tell it again. No doubt he will think of it sometimes, for that cannot well be helped; and then he will see a picture, and always the same picture--the double rank of dead men; the vacant deck stretching away in dimming perspective beyond them, the wide desert of smooth sea all abroad; the rim of the moon spying from behind a rag of black cloud; the remote top of the mizzenmast shearing a zigzag path through the fields of stars in the deeps of space; and this soft picture will remind him of the time that he sat in the midst of it and told his poor little tale and felt so lonesome when he got through.|$|E

5000|$|Afghanistanism, as you know, is the {{practice}} of referring always to some remote country, place, person or problem when {{there is something that}} ought {{to be taken care of}} near at home that is very acute. So you say to a professor at Caltech, [...] "What about smog?" [...] and he says, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> crisis in Afghanistan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We haven't <b>heard,</b> <b>you</b> know, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> slops yet. Do stop {{just one}} minute, dear papa. I wonder if it's like the {{beef-tea}} nurse makes {{for me when}} I'm ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what does}} your father think. He is always so fearless--I might say reckless--that I don't feel certain as to his real opinion. Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> him {{speaking}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> chance of that rascal Stalker following him up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A man {{who could}} speak so of his own mother, was not fit to stop {{in the same house}} with her," [...] he said; [...] "moreover, <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> his words <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pastor. I tell you, son, I am afraid of this Adrian." ...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} season's run, it had {{attracted}} critical praise as well as strong viewer numbers. Describing it as a [...] "Peak TV Treasure", Kimberly Roots of TVLine commented that [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> docu-series and quickly dismissed it as a pathetic cash-grab on Remini’s part (like I did at first), it’s worth a second look." [...] The Straits Times called it [...] "riveting television" [...] for telling the [...] "remarkable" [...] stories of its interviewees.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{hours were}} a nightmare. The building was suddenly {{full of people}} and dark-blue uniforms. Hustled out of the studio, we were locked into a small back office on another floor. Here we sat incommunicado while network employees were busily collecting, destroying, or locking up all scripts and records of the broadcast. Finally, the Press was let loose upon us, ravening for horror. How many deaths had we heard of? (Implying they knew of thousands.) What did we know of the fatal stampede in a Jersey hall? (Implying {{it was one of}} many.) What traffic deaths? (The ditches must be choked with corpses.) The suicides? (Haven't <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> one on Riverside Drive?) It is all quite vague in my memory and quite terrible.|$|E
5000|$|And {{inasmuch as}} the {{following}} conversation also has been recorded by Damis as having been held upon this occasion {{with regard to the}} mythological animals and fountains and men met with in India, I must not leave it out, for there is much to be gained by neither believing nor yet disbelieving everything. Accordingly Apollonius asked the question, whether there was there an animal called the man-eater (martichoras); and Iarchas replied: [...] "And what have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> make of this animal? For it is probable that there is some account given of its shape." [...] "There are," [...] replied Apollonius, [...] "tall stories current which I cannot believe; for they say that the creature has four feet, and that his head resembles that of a man, but that in size it is comparable to a lion; while the tail of this animal puts out hairs a cubit long and sharp as thorns, which it shoots like arrows at those who hunt it." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{she entered}} the room the man got up and {{indicated}} a chair. He asked a few questions, rather carelessly, and afterwards remarked: [...] "Miss Southern had already told me what I most wanted to know. <b>You</b> may have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> work in which I am engaged." ...|$|R
5000|$|When one of Cutolo's major enemies was arrested, Barra wrote {{directly}} to Cutolo: [...] "My dearest compare, <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> arrest of that big don. He peed {{in his pants}} because he thought that he got caught by {{the men of the}} Prince. Now tell me how these people think that they can survive, and anyway I am waiting to cross the paths of some of these conspirators, because I want to show them how much Alias is worth. Be calm, they will pay with their last drop of blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{we always}} {{thought you would}} go on and be {{something}} great, and do something great, like Bishop Selwyn, or like that Mr. Denison that Miss Ogilvie has a book about," [...] said Babie. [...] "But you will get well and do it {{when you are a}} man, Armie! Didn't you think <b>about</b> it when <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> all <b>about</b> <b>the</b> golden life in the sermon to-day? I thought, [...] "That's going to be Armie's life," [...] and I looked at you, but you were looking down. Were you thinking how it was all spoilt, Armie, poor dear Armie. For perhaps it isn't." ...|$|R

5000|$|The song's Boston and Charles River {{references}} are reportedly {{based on an}} experience of Cobb and his girlfriend with a mugger in Boston in the mid-1960s. In addition to the river, other local interest items in the song include the Boston University women's curfew [...] - [...] "Frustrated women ... {{have to be in}} by twelve o'clock" [...] - [...] and a passing mention of the Boston Strangler [...] - [...] "have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Strangler? (I'm the man I'm the man)." [...] Boston is also home to Simmons College, a women's college that, like many such institutions, had a curfew for students. Cambridge, on the opposite banks of the Charles River, was home to Radcliffe College, then the women's college counterpart to Harvard College. There is disagreement regarding the identity of the [...] "frustrated women". In a city with many colleges and universities, as well as a large Navy presence (historically), it could be purposefully unspecific.|$|E
5000|$|The 2002 {{production}} of Nativity featured a cast accompanied by three choirs and {{a company that}} totaled 125 performers. Several of the performers had appeared in Nativity in several previous year's productions, with Ebony Jo-Ann and Lillias White having contract clauses written into their agreements to perform elsewhere guaranteeing {{that they would be}} allowed to perform in Nativity. White, who performed the spiritual [...] "No Room" [...] said that [...] "This is something I absolutely have to do every year". BeBe Winans, who played Joseph, and Stephanie Mills as Mary did a duet of Joseph Joubert's [...] "Love Is a Miracle". The song [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Heard</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Baby" [...] was performed by an a cappella trio led by Freddie Jackson. Composer William L. Dawson's hymn [...] "Behold the Star" [...] was led by Priscilla Baskerville together with the Ebony Ecumenical Ensemble and the Broadway Inspirational Voices. Narration was provided by Denise Burse, Keith David and Phylicia Rashad. The closing number is [...] "Spread the Word", described as [...] "a rollicking gospel chorale" [...] that had [...] "the audience was on its feet and roaring as though a rock concert was ending" [...] serving as [...] "a fitting conclusion to this grandly spirited and wholly contemporary show, whose creators have persevered with a faith of their own".|$|E

How did you feel when <b>you</b> first <b>heard</b> the news, and how does thinking about this event make you feel now? As of this writing many Americans over the age of 15 most likely find these questions remarkably easy to answer. The fact that a singular event in history could be remembered so well, and by so many people, is relevant to at least two lines of research in the memory literature. First, the very fact that people can answer such questions so easily is relevant to research and theory on “flashbulb memories...|$|R
