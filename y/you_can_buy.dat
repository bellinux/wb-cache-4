500|$|The third {{generation}} MacBook Pro received positive {{reviews of the}} Retina Display, flash storage and power. It was criticized, however, for its high price and lack of an Ethernet port and optical drive. Roman Loyola of Macworld said that the Retina MacBook Pro was [...] "groundbreaking" [...] and made people [...] "rethink how they use technology". He praised the inclusion of USB 3.0 and the slimmer body. Dan Ackerman of CNET commented [...] "I've previously called the 15-inch MacBook Pro {{one of the most}} universally useful all-around laptops <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>buy.</b> This new version adds to that with HDMI, faster ports, and more portability. But it also subtracts from that with its exclusion of an optical drive and Ethernet port, plus its very high starting price. The Pro and Retina Pro are clearly two laptops designed for two different users, and with the exception of all-day commuters who need something closer to a MacBook Air or ultrabook, one of the two branches of the MacBook Pro family tree is still probably the most universally useful laptop you can buy." ...|$|E
