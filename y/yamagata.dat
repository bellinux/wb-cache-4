The Seiyūkai held the majority of seats in the House, but <b>Yamagata's</b> conservative allies had the greatest influence in the House of Peers, forcing Itō to seek imperial intervention. Tiring of political infighting, Itō resigned in 1901. Thereafter, the prime ministership alternated between <b>Yamagata's</b> protégé, Katsura Tarō and Saionji [...] The alternating of political power was {{an indication of the}} two sides' ability to cooperate and share power and helped foster the continued development of party politics.|$|R
