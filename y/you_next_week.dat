60|$|P.S.--I see the 'Examiner' [3] threatens some {{observations}} upon <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> What can {{you have}} done to share the wrath which has heretofore been principally expended upon the Prince?

Now it is with that Captain Dobble; last week it was somebody else--and it may be <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> if--ha! ha! ha!--you are disposed to enter the lists.

6000|$|July 10.—I {{knew too}} well {{the meaning of}} your non-appearance, and [...] because I knew it, was sorry for your indisposition {{as well as for}} [...] your absence. We had the De Greys, Granville, Sir C. Eastlake, [...] Fechter(136) and others, with the Comte de Paris, who is as simple [...] as ever, but greatly {{developed}} and come on. He talked much of [...] America. I hope we may come to-morrow, not later than by the 5.5 [...] train, to which I feel a kind of grateful attachment for the [...] advantage and pleasure it has so often procured me.

60|$|Wednesday I had a {{great idea}} of match-making, and {{proposed}} to Henry that Faale {{would make a good}} wife for him. I wish I had put this down when it was fresher in my mind, it was so interesting an interview. My gentleman would not tell if I were on or not. 'I do not know yet; I will tell <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> May I tell the sister of my father? No, better not, tell her when it is done.' - 'But will not your family be angry if you marry without asking them?' - 'My village? What does my village want? Mats!' I said I thought the girl would grow up to {{have a great deal of}} sense, and my gentleman flew out upon me; she had sense now, he said.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose that}} when {{predicting}} future behavior, consumers selectively (but unwittingly) test {{the hypothesis that}} they will behave ideally. This selective hypothesis testing perspective on unrealistic optimism suggests that estimates of future behavior should be similar to those made by individuals who assume that conditions will be ideal. Moreover, consumers who initially provide estimates assuming that conditions will be ideal should recognize {{that the world is}} not ideal and so should test a more realistic hypothesis. In line with these predictions, we find that ideal-world estimates (e. g., In an ideal world, how often will <b>you</b> exercise <b>next</b> <b>week?)</b> do not differ from standard estimates (e. g., How often will <b>you</b> exercise <b>next</b> <b>week?).</b> We also find that individuals who initially estimate their behavior in an ideal world subsequently make more realistic predictions.

60|$|The credit usually {{given by}} one {{tradesman}} to another, as particularly by the merchant to the wholesale-man, {{and by the}} wholesale-man to the retailer, is such, that, without tying the buyer up to a particular day of payment, they go on buying and selling, and the buyer pays money upon account, as his convenience admits, and as the seller is content to take it. This occasions the merchant, or the wholesale-man, to go about, as they call it, a-dunning among their dealers, and which is generally the work of every Saturday. When the merchant comes to his customer the wholesale-man, or warehouse-keeper, for money, he tells him, 'I have no money, Sir; I cannot pay you now; if you call next week, I will pay you.' Next week comes, and the merchant calls again; {{but it is the}} same thing, only the warehouseman adds, 'Well, I will pay <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> without fail.' When the week comes, he tells him he has met with great disappointments, and he knows not what to do, but desires his patience another week: and when the other week comes, perhaps he pays him, and so they go on.|$|E
5000|$|After Owens {{left the}} show, no closing song was used. Instead, Clark and the guest co-host for that week would just simply {{say a few}} closing remarks and then the entire cast shouted, [...] "See <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> on HEE HAW!" ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} each program, Cooper {{offered a}} teaser for the next show. These were usually unrehearsed, and often {{displayed}} Cooper's wry or morbid humor: [...] "My story for <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> is called 'A Night to Forget'. It's about a man who wished he could -- and couldn't." [...] Cooper's teaser was always followed by Chappell's sign-off: [...] "And so, until next week at this same time, I am quietly yours, Ernest Chappell." ...|$|E
6000|$|The other smiled. [...] "If an {{increase}} in salary," [...] he suggested, [...] "would influence you, I had intended {{to tell you that}} I would take care of <b>you</b> beginning <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> I thought of making it fifteen dollars," [...] and with that unanswerable argument for Jimmy's continued service the buyer sat back and folded his hands.|$|R

5000|$|As Sutton {{recalled}} his breaking into Marvel, editor-in-chief Stan Lee ...looked at {{the stuff that}} I had brought in, was stuff that I had done in the service for Stars and Stripes in Tokyo.

He just reached over and he pulled off this huge pile of blank paper. And he said, 'OK, do me a couple of Westerns and I'll see <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> Have fun.' I remember that very well. 'Have fun.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Bob Caudle is an American {{professional}} wrestling announcer {{most notable}} for {{his time with}} the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). He started working with Jim Crockett Promotions in the late 1950s for promoter Jim Crockett, Sr. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Caudle was the official voice of Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling and {{is known for his}} trademark greeting, [...] "Hello wrestling fans...", and his trademark sign-off line, [...] "That'll do it for this week. We'll see <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> and until then, so long for now." [...] He is known for constantly addressing the viewers as [...] "fans" [...] many times on each episode.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} week of live shows, his {{rendition}} of Michael Jackson's [...] "Black or White" [...] was praised by all four judges. For Country week, he sang a sitar-infused version of [...] "Ring of Fire". His Motown night acoustic version of The Miracles' [...] "The Tracks of My Tears" [...] drew praise from judges and a standing ovation from Smokey Robinson, the week's mentor. Advancing to the top 8, he sang the 2001 Michael Andrews and Gary Jules arrangement of [...] "Mad World". Because the show had exceeded its time slot, only Cowell gave a critique, which he did by giving Lambert a standing ovation, the only one he bestowed during his decade-long run as an American Idol judge. After Lambert sang [...] "If I Can't Have You", delivering what DioGuardi called his [...] "most memorable performance", Cowell described his vocals as [...] "immaculate." [...] For the top 3 show, he performed [...] "One" [...] before Cowell declared, [...] "If you are not in the final next week, it {{will be one of the}} biggest upsets"; and continued with [...] "Cryin'" [...] before Abdul affirmed, [...] "we'll be seeing <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> and many years after that".|$|E

5000|$|It {{is never}} {{explicitly}} revealed whether Sam wins or loses the election, {{but he is}} expected to lose in a landslide. President Bartlet goes to California to lend his support, taking with him Sam's friends on the senior staff, who believe campaign manager Scott Holcomb is wasting Sam's time by having him run a safe, timid campaign. In the midst of the visit, Sam learns that Bartlet is putting off announcing the Democratic budget plan Sam himself had helped design, so that Sam won't feel pressured to support it and further stigmatize himself during the election. Sam is appalled and decides to put things right. While introducing the President at a campaign event, he adds that the audience shouldn't [...] "let him off this stage" [...] until he has announced the budget plan. Backstage, Bartlet watches Scott Holcomb react with distress and asks why he is running Sam's campaign the way he is. Holcomb admits that he is anticipating Sam's loss and trying to smooth the way for a less divisive candidate the next time around, prompting Bartlet to (unofficially) fire him and get Toby to take over the campaign for the final weeks. Toby runs a thoroughly honest and liberal campaign, not until the very end of which does Sam realize, [...] "I'm going to lose". Toby confirms it, explaining, [...] "They're going to throw rocks at <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> and I wanted to be standing next to you when they did." [...] They hug, and this is the last scene in which Sam appears {{until the end of the}} final season.|$|E
