Club praised {{the choice of}} having Rivers guest star since {{she was able to}} [...] "employ her trademark humor within the world of The Simpsons without hijacking the plot or satire." [...] He also noted that while the Simpson family does not appear heavily, [...] "Krusty is such {{a large part of the}} supporting cast that he carries this episode well. While it may seem a little funny that Castellaneta, who voices Krusty, wrote such a large part for himself, it is also a testament to his empathy for Krusty that this episode both deepens our understanding of Krusty and actually allows him growth as a character in an organic fashion." [...] Ology's Josh Harrison similarly praised [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] for having [...] "some wonderful Krusty the Klown moments and some clutch guest star appearances". He also cited the visual gags in the episode as [...] "clever". Harrison concluded his review by writing that though the episode [...] "wasn't Simpsons gold, it was a great chance to focus on a secondary character and an opportunity for Joan Rivers to, um, be Joan Rivers.

40|$|To build a {{positive}} project team {{it is essential}} to make self-reflection and continuous learning a part of your organization's culture. Perhaps the single most efficient {{way to do this is}} by incorporating ongoing team retrospectives into your project. You can think of these retrospectives as the "flesh " of the iteration and milestone assessments that the Rational Unified Process, ® or RUP ® recommends. The RUP provides only a skeleton for these assessments, leaving teams to structure the activities on their own. RUP suggests that project team members gather after each iteration and milestone to reflect on their performance and process. A team retrospective approach gives structure to these sessions. The purpose is to provide progressive learning, sustenance, and improvement. A hallmark of agile teams, retrospectives allow all team members to iteratively test and develop not only solid software but also effective teamwork Do <b>Your</b> <b>Assessments</b> Need More Structure?

50|$|There is {{a strong}} focus on {{rendering}} aid with improvised means (for instance, using a branch and some rope to splint an injured extremity rather than using commercially available splinting devices). In wilderness settings {{it is unlikely that}} the specialized equipment found in an ambulance will be available, so the focus is on using only what is at hand in <b>your</b> <b>assessment</b> and care for a patient. There is also a greater focus on long-term care, since a WEMT may have to be with a patient for many hours, while most urban EMTs are with each patient for no more than an hour at the most.|$|E

Universities will have different approaches to the application of the principles of practice assessment in the NMC Standards, and interpretation of terminology may vary.

We know that indigenous Australians have lived on the Gold Coast for a very long time, possibly over 20 000 years. We take as given that James Cook was the first European to sail close to its beaches. He named various obvious landmarks. It was some years later that European explorers, such as John Oxley, and escaped convicts put their feet on the Gold Coast beaches...|$|R
