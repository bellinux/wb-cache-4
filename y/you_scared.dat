"Y'all Scared" [...] is a {{collaboration}} with {{three members of}} Goodie Mob and contains the chant [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>scared,</b> say you scared" [...] accompanied by prominent organ and guitar work. [...] "Nathaniel" [...] is an a cappella rap by the group's close friend {{who at the time}} was an inmate in a Georgia prison, and the song is a recording of an actual collect call during his time in jail. The track is an introduction to [...] "Liberation". The eight-minute-long [...] "Liberation" [...] combines a variety of musical styles, including gospel, jazz, blues, and world music.

The album closes with [...] "Chonkyfire", which features a fuzzy guitar riff and snippets from OutKast's speech at the 1995 Source Awards in which the group emphasized the Southern hip-hop scene as a legitimate subgenre.|$|E
