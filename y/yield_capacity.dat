50|$|Capacity {{design of}} {{structures}} is: to control failure {{in a building}} by pre-selecting localized ductile fuses (or weak links) to act as the primary location for energy dissipation when a building is subjected to extreme loading. The structure is designed such that all inelastic action (or damage) occurs at these critical locations (the fuses), which are designed to behave in a ductile and stable manner. Conversely, all other structural elements are protected against failure or collapse by limiting the load transfer to these elements to the <b>yield</b> <b>capacity</b> of the fuses. In SPSWs, the infill plates are meant {{to serve as the}} fuse elements. When damaged during an extreme loading event, they can be replaced at a reasonable cost and restore full integrity of the building.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{transport}} {{capacity of a}} randomly deployed wireless network under random (c, f) channel assignment was considered by us in [1]. We showed in [1] that {{when the number of}} available channels � is c = O(logn), and each f prnd node has a single interface assigned a random f subset of channels, the capacity is Ω(W cnlogn) and O(W nlogn), prnd and conjectured that capacity is Θ(W nlogn). We now present a lower bound construction that <b>yields</b> <b>capacity</b> prnd nlogn Ω(W) for all c = O(logn) and 2 ≤ f ≤ c. This establishes the capacity under random (c, f) assignment as prnd Θ(W nlogn).

40|$|Abstract—Contamination {{of coastal}} {{aquifers}} by seawater is either {{due to the}} excess amount of pumping above their safe <b>yield</b> <b>capacity</b> or due to local causes like overpumping near the shores (even without the excess amount of pumping at {{the scale of the}} whole aquifer) or both. This problem is faced frequently if these aquifers are mainly in use for irrigation. The amount of water that is utilised continuously within the aquifer is calculated through volumetric (3 -D) approaches of both the water balance and the salt balance equations where the space and time components are integrated. This inverse methodology is used for the determination of poorly known terms in time and space. The variation of contours showing the water table levels and concentrations of NaCl have been drawn for the last 20 years. The unknown component of the water balance equation, that is the extraction of water from the aquifer by the South, is calculated as 8. 5 MCM/year. Then the average amount of water that is pumped above the safe <b>yield</b> <b>capacity,</b> thus causing the depletion of the saturated volume of the aquifer, is estimated as 17. 4 MCM/year. The total amount of remaining freshwater available within the aquifer is found to be 1565 MCM; hence, the remaining lifetime of the aquifer is expected to be no more than 90 years. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
