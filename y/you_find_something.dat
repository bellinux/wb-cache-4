500|$|As {{the last}} song created for Revival, Gomez has called [...] "Me & the Rhythm" [...] a {{personal}} favorite from the record. When asked about collaborating with Gomez, Michaels commented: [...] "I think Selena {{is a lot}} like Justin and I, in the way that…when <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> that you feel connected to, and it's real and it's honest, you don't let it go. You see where it can lead you." [...] A snippet of the track was first teased along with the official artwork on September 26, 2015. Later, the song was fully released as the album's first and only promotional single, a week before album release, followed by the album's two singles, [...] "Good for You" [...] and [...] "Same Old Love".|$|E
2500|$|Naughty Dog {{said that}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception uses an [...] "evolved" [...] {{version of the}} same engine they used in [...] and [...] that has allowed the game to have better physics, visuals, and {{environmental}} effects. The game features new innovations in sand, fire, smoke, and water dynamics and effects, also it adds to the movement of the characters, more realistic textures and animations. According to Naughty Dog Uncharted 3 is graphically superior to Uncharted 2. [...] "We're at full speed, optimizing code specifically for the SPUs," [...] Naughty Dog co-president (and former technical director) Christophe Balestra told Edge. [...] "We were, at any given point, using 100% [...] We were using everything we possibly could. There is always room where <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> where you can do the processing in some different way to find more power. There are all of these different ways to squeeze more power out of the box," [...] Justin Richmond, game director, told VentureBeat.|$|E

2500|$|Jackie {{attended}} Hartfield {{primary school}} {{in the nearby town}} of Dumbarton, and moved to Dumbarton Academy at the age of 12. He experienced learning difficulties owing to undiagnosed dyslexia, and due to the condition not being understood or even widely known about at the time, he was regularly berated and humiliated by teachers and peers alike for being [...] "dumb" [...] and [...] "thick". Stewart was unable to continue his secondary education past the age of 16, and began working in his father's garage as an apprentice mechanic. He was not actually diagnosed with dyslexia until 1980, when his oldest son Mark was diagnosed with the condition. On learning that dyslexia can be genetically passed on, and seeing very similar symptoms with his son that he had experienced himself as a child, Stewart asked if he could be tested, and was diagnosed with the disorder, by which time he was 41 years old. He has said: [...] "When you've got dyslexia and <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> you're good at, you put more into it than anyone else; you can't think the way of the clever folk, so you're always thinking out of the box." ...|$|E
2500|$|Silvers {{said of the}} editors' philosophy, that [...] "there was no subject we couldn't deal with. And {{if there}} was no book , we would deal with it anyway. We tried hard to avoid books that were simply {{competent}} rehearsals of familiar subjects, and we hoped to find books that would establish something fresh, something original." [...] In particular, [...] "We felt you had to have a political analysis of the nature of power in America – who had it, who was affected". The editors also shared an [...] "intense admiration for wonderful writers". Well-known writers were willing to contribute articles for the initial issues of the Review without pay because it offered them a chance to write a new kind of book review. [...] As Mark Gevisser explained: [...] "The essays ... made the book review form not just a report on the book and a judgment of the book, but an essay in itself. And that, I think, startled everyone – that a book review could be exciting in that way, could be provocative in that way." [...] Early issues included articles by such writers as Hardwick, Lowell, Jason Epstein, Hannah Arendt, W. H. Auden, Saul Bellow, John Berryman, Truman Capote, Paul Goodman, Lillian Hellman, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Dwight Macdonald, Norman Mailer, Mary McCarthy, Norman Podhoretz, Philip Rahv, Adrienne Rich, [...] Susan Sontag, William Styron, Gore Vidal, Robert Penn Warren and Edmund Wilson. [...] The Review pointedly published interviews with European political dissidents, including Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov and Václav Havel. But, Silvers noted, it is a mystery whether [...] "reviews have a calculable political and social impact" [...] or will even gain attention: [...] "You mustn't think too much about influence – if <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> interesting yourself, that should be enough." ...|$|E

That was true, too. We entered a little fortalice with a cannon in it, in an embrasure which at that moment struck me as unnecessarily vast, even though it was partly closed by a frail packing-case lid.

60|$|MY DEAR FRIEND, - I sat a {{long while}} up among the olive yards to- day at a {{favourite}} corner, where one has a fair view down the valley {{and on to the}} blue floor of the sea. I had a Horace with me, and read a little; but Horace, when you try to read him fairly under the open heaven, sounds urban, and <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> of the escaped townsman in his descriptions of the country, just as somebody said that Morris's sea-pieces were all taken from the coast. I tried for long to hit upon some language that might catch ever so faintly the indefinable shifting colour of olive leaves; and, above all, the changes and little silverings that pass over them, like blushes over a face, when the wind tosses great branches to and fro; but the Muse was not favourable. A few birds scattered here and there at wide intervals {{on either side of the}} valley sang the little broken songs of late autumn and there was a great stir of insect life in the grass at my feet. The path up to this coign of vantage, where I think I shall make it a habit to ensconce myself a while of a morning, is for a little while common to the peasant and a little clear brooklet. It is pleasant, in the tempered grey daylight of the olive shadows, to see the people picking their way among the stones and the water and the brambles; the women especially, with the weights poised on their heads and walking all from the hips with a certain graceful deliberation.|$|E

By twelve {{manner of}} fruits, he doth also allude to the apostles, who are called twelve, and {{are those who}} have made {{provision}} for the house of God, according to the twelve-fold manner of the dispensation of God unto them, and of the twelve-fold manner of operation of that holy Spirit which wrought in every one of them severally as he pleased. Which twelve were before figured unto us by the twelve offices of king Solomon, the type of Christ, which twelve were to make provision for the house of the king, according to the season of the year, and each man his month in the year (1 Kings 4:7). Which very thing the Holy Ghost also doth here cast his eye upon, and that makes him bring in the words of 'every month,' saying, it yields its fruit 'every month.' For indeed, whatever you read of concerning this city, in this description of John, <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> or other in the writings of the prophets that giveth ground for such expressions. Wherefore seeing the officers of Solomon were twelve, and the apostles of Christ twelve also; and seeing the officers of Solomon made provision for his house, each man his month in a year, and the fruits of this tree of life are called twelve manner of fruits, I do take the twelve manner of fruits here to be signified by the provision of Solomon's officers, according to the twelve seasons of the year, and they a type of the twelve-fold doctrine of the twelve apostles of the Lord Christ, for it is their doctrine that is the bread of the church, yea, the milk for the babe, and the strong meat for men (1 Thess 2:7; 1 Cor 3:2; Heb 5:11-14).|$|E
