"Your {{brother has}} told me that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> servant, and that she is so preposterous as to wish to take her meals with you, but {{that he does not}} intend to allow it. Now, I say to you, as I said to him, that if she {{expected}} to sit at the table before I came, she must do it now. I am used to that sort of thing, and do not mind it a bit. In the families of the farmers about here, with whom I often take a meal, it is the custom for the daughter of the family to cook, to wait on the table, and then sit down with whomever may be there, kings or cobblers. I beg that you will not let my coming make trouble in your household." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{call your}} special {{attention}} to Lamarck, because later on there were Neo-Lamarckians as well as Neo-Darwinians. I was a Neo-Lamarckian. Lamarck passed on from the conception of Evolution as a general law to Charles Darwin's department of it, which was the method of Evolution. Lamarck, whilst making many ingenious suggestions as to the reaction of external causes on life and habit, such as changes of climate, food supply, geological upheavals and so forth, really held as his fundamental proposition that living organisms changed because they wanted to. As he stated it, the great factor in Evolution is use and disuse. If you have no eyes, and want to see, and keep trying to see, you will finally get eyes. If, like a mole or a subterranean fish, you have eyes and dont want to see, you will lose your eyes. If you like eating the tender tops of trees {{enough to make you}} concentrate all your energies on the stretching of your neck, you will finally get a long neck, like the giraffe. This seems absurd to inconsiderate people at the first blush; but it is within the personal experience of all of us that it is just by this process that a child tumbling about the floor becomes a boy walking erect; and that a man sprawling on the road with a bruised chin, or supine on the ice with a bashed occiput, becomes a bicyclist and a skater. The process is not continuous, as it would be if mere practice {{had anything to do with}} it; for though you may improve at each bicycling lesson during the lesson, when you begin your next lesson you do not begin at the point at which you left off: you relapse apparently to the beginning. Finally, you succeed quite suddenly, and do not relapse again. More miraculous still, you at once exercise the new power unconsciously. Although you are adapting your front wheel to your balance so elaborately and actively that the accidental locking of your handle bars for a second will throw you off; though five minutes before you could not do it at all, yet now you do it as unconsciously as you grow your finger nails. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> faculty, and must have created some new bodily tissue as its organ. And you have done it solely by willing. For here there can be no question of Circumstantial Selection, or the survival of the fittest. The man who is learning how to ride a bicycle has no advantage over the non-cyclist in the struggle for existence: quite the contrary. He has acquired a new habit, an automatic unconscious habit, solely because he wanted to, and kept trying until it was added unto him.|$|E

50|$|Breeding in {{the game}} is simple. Buy a {{breeding}} structure to use. Then get two different species of monsters and feed them to level 4. Then just mix them in the breeding structure and wait. When they are done, the new egg can be delivered to the nursery and hatched after a while. When the hatching finishes, click the egg and place it. Finally, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> monster! The monster combinations include Toe Jammer + Potbelly = Oaktopus, Noggin + Mammott = Drumpler, Noggin + Potbelly = Shrubb and much, much more. It is possible for a new monster to be breeded {{to be the same}} as one of its parents.|$|E
5000|$|However, Wang's honoring of Ye did not last. Wang's {{wife was}} Lady Li, the {{daughter}} of the chancellor Li Min (李敏) and a sister of Wang Lin's. However, Wang favored his concubine Consort Li Chunyan and treated Lady Li coldly. Ye stated to Wang, [...] "The Lady is a niece of the late Emperor. She became your wife with proper ceremony. Why do you abandon her because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> love?" [...] Wang ignored Ye, and thereafter became to distance himself from Ye. Not long after that, there was an occasion when Ye was submitting a petition on another matter. Wang wrote a comment on it, [...] "The leaf is falling into the imperial moat!" [...] ("Ye" [...] means [...] "leaf.") He thereafter put Ye into retirement at Yongtai, and Ye died there in retirement, although the date is not known.|$|E

5000|$|Enrique Patterson {{describes}} {{race as a}} [...] "social bomb" [...] {{and says}} that [...] "If the Cuban government were to permit black Cubans to organize and raise their problems before authorities ... totalitarianism would fall". Esteban Morales Domínguez, {{a professor at the}} University of Havana, says that [...] "The absence of the debate on the racial problem already threatens ... the revolution's social project". Carlos Moore, who has written extensively on the issue, says that [...] "There is an unstated threat, blacks in Cuba know that whenever you raise race in Cuba, you go to jail. Therefore the struggle in Cuba is different. There cannot be a civil rights movement. You will have instantly 10,000 black people dead. ... The government is frightened {{to the extent to which}} it does not understand black Cubans today. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> generation of black Cubans who are looking at politics in another way." [...] Barack Obama's victory has raised disturbing questions about the institutional racism in Cuba. The Economist noted [...] "The danger starts with his example: after all, a young, black, progressive politician has no chance of reaching the highest office in Cuba, although a majority of the island's people are black" ...|$|E
5000|$|The band {{said in a}} {{statement}} that the song is about overcoming adversity. [...] "We're so excited to announce our new single Sun Comes Up, a song we wrote about overcoming adversity. We spent a long time looking for the right singer for it, and were close to giving up until we met James Arthur, he sang it and we were blown away. We aren't afraid of taking new directions, and our new material has stepped up to another level. We've travelled the world far and wide and finally we feel like we've returned home on this album." [...] "We wanted to work with him Arthur from the first time we saw him on TV. We didn't care where he came from. We thought his voice was amazing, unique," [...] Rudimental told London Evening Standard. Kesi Dryden of Rudimental said that the song is about [...] "a relationship breakup and how there is a new day when the sun comes up". [...] "But when James heard the song he said the message he got from it was there has been a lot of negative times in the past but when the sun comes up it is a new day, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> chance. There was a new lease of life he got from it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Say <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> disease, called Super-AIDS. Only one in {{a million}} people gets Super-AIDS. You develop a test for Super-AIDS that's 99 percent accurate. I mean, 99 percent of the time, it gives the correct result - true if the subject is infected, and false if the subject is healthy. You give the test to a million people.One in a million people have Super-AIDS. One in a hundred people that you test will {{generate}} a [...] "false positive" [...] - the test will say he has Super-AIDS even though he doesn't. That's what [...] "99 percent accurate" [...] means: one percent wrong.What's one percent of one million?1,000,000/100 = 10,000One in a million people has Super-AIDS. If you test a million random people, you'll probably only find one case of real Super-AIDS. But your test won't identify one person as having Super-AIDS. It will identify 10,000 people as having it.Your 99 percent accurate test will perform with 99.99 percent inaccuracy.That's the paradox of the false positive. When you try to find something really rare, your test's accuracy has to match the rarity of the thing you're looking for. If you're trying to point at a single pixel on your screen, a sharp pencil is a good pointer: the pencil-tip is a lot smaller (more accurate) than the pixels. But a pencil-tip is no good at pointing at a single atom in your screen. For that, you need a pointer - a test - that's one atom wide or less at the tip.|$|E
