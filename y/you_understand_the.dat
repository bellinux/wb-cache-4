5|$|Never before have I {{written to}} {{a player to}} express my regret at his {{omission}} from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I {{want you to know}} how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good.|$|E

25|$|The mere {{pocketing}} of a ball isn't that hard; in fact, it's relatively simple. What drives many, {{many players}} to distraction is {{the unpredictability of}} the cueball's path of travel...the game of billiards requires you to drive a ball someplace; pool, in any form, mostly asks you to stop a ball someplace. In either case, you'll fare much better when <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> how and why of a ball's getting {{from one place to}} another.|$|E

25|$|Radio 816 / Lisbon 14-Dec.1961: <b>You</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> {{bitterness}} {{with which}} I send you this message. It is horrible {{to think that}} this may mean total sacrifice, but I believe that sacrifice is the only way for us to keep up to the highest traditions and provide service {{to the future of the}} Nation. Do not expect the possibility of truce or of Portuguese prisoners, as there will be no surrender rendered because I feel that our soldiers and sailors can be either victorious or dead. These words could, by their seriousness, be directed only to a soldier of higher duties fully prepared to fulfill them. God will not allow you to be the last Governor of the State of India.|$|E
25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E
500|$|Although many of {{his works}} are orchestral in nature, Soule has denied that it is his [...] "style", as he feels that the term boxes him into only {{creating}} one type of music. He prefers to call himself a [...] "music practitioner", or someone who creates music in general rather than just one type of music as {{he is capable of}} many styles, such as Japanese pop, which he has written along with Jeff Miyahara. Soule considers music to be like a language, which can be arranged in many different ways if <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> structure. He does not have a favorite genre of game to compose for, preferring instead to compose for [...] "ambitious" [...] games by people with [...] "new ideas".|$|E

500|$|The story's central {{location}} {{was set at}} Steventon rectory where Austen was raised. While it had been demolished in 1824, Jarrold and his crew [...] "fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like the original... We honed the script as well {{to make it as}} practical as possible." [...] Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth, [...] "I think that you will lose the central thrust of the story unless <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> status of the Austen's and that they are pretty poor. Jane spent all her formative years there and that was the place that influenced her view of the world. You have to believe that the family live in that house because that is a crucial piece of the jigsaw." [...] Scenes at Steventon rectory were filmed in Higginsbrook House, a few miles off Trim in County Meath. Later in fall 2006, it appeared again as the house of the Morlands in Northanger Abbey.|$|E

So, anecdotal evidence involves all your subjectivity—if we do it like this we don't have that anymore. Why, surely do you understand how powerful that is?" [...] And if they don't, then that's what you have to explain to them. It's an extremely powerful thing and a very basic thing.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Alex McClimens, whom Muller quoted above, also wrote, [...] "This {{magnificent}} {{essay in}} communication is compulsory reading {{for anyone with}} the slightest interest in autistic spectrum disorders. This book is also required reading for those who simply enjoy a fascinating story... we are offered a first person narrative to match anything by contemporary writers. Mark Haddon has created a true literary character and {{his handling of the}} teenage Asperger's heroic adventure is brilliantly crafted. He uses the literal mind-set of his hero to mask the true direction of the plot." [...] Reviewer Paul Moorehead calls the book [...] "a fairly ripping adventure story" [...] and writes, [...] "It's also quite a feat of writing. The actual use of language is somewhat austere—an unavoidable consequence of having a boy with autism as a narrator—but it has its own beauty, and it works. So persuasive and so effective is the construction of Christopher, not only is he a character you're rooting for, he's also the character in the story <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> best. It's startling how believably and comfortably this story puts you into what you might have thought were likely to be some pretty alien shoes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Madonna {{also met}} {{controversy}} while performing in the United States. Madonna created controversy at her performance in Washington, D.C. when she urged fans {{to vote for}} President Barack Obama and claimed {{that he is a}} [...] "Black Muslim" [...] which was largely seen as offensive since President Obama is a Christian and has discussed about his faith in the past. Madonna clarified her statements by saying that she merely being ironic and said [...] "Yes, I know Obama is not a Muslim— though I know that plenty {{of people in this country}} think he is. And what if he were? The point I was making is that a good man is a good man, no matter who he prays to. I don’t care what religion Obama is— nor should anyone else in America."

2500|$|On August 16, 1986, Slippery When Wet was {{released}}. The album reached {{number one}} in U.S., where it spent 8 weeks at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 album chart. The first two singles from the album, [...] "You Give Love a Bad Name" [...] and [...] "Livin' on a Prayer", both reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Slippery When Wet was named the top selling album of 1987 by Billboard [...] "Livin' On A Prayer" [...] won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Stage Performance. The band won an award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band at the American Music Awards and an award for Favorite Rock Group at the People's Choice Awards. When Slippery When Wet was released in August 1986, Bon Jovi was the support act for 38 Special. By the end of 1986, Bon Jovi were well into six months of headline dates in arenas across America. In August 1987, the band headlined England's [...] "Monsters of Rock" [...] festival. During their set Dee Snider, Bruce Dickinson and Paul Stanley joined the band to perform [...] "We're an American Band". The band ended the year having headlined 130 shows in the [...] "Tour Without End", grossing $28,400,000. Jon Bon Jovi was asked what this breakthrough to worldwide fame meant, to which he answered, [...] "Everything is bigger, and it moves twice as fast. You're recognized twice as often. This is bigger, the whole world gets bigger. You have to sell more records, be huger. You get smarter and <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> business a little more, so it's more responsibility.

2500|$|After Australia's biggest {{defeat at}} home in 50 years the Australian press were in uproar and the {{selectors}} Ewart Macmillan, Jack Ryder and Don Bradman took drastic action, dropping the captain Brian Booth, batsman Bob Cowper and the bowlers Garth McKenzie, Peter Philpott and David Sincock. Booth {{received a letter from}} Bradman on behalf of the selectors explaining [...] "Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I want you to know how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good." [...] Booth had made only 84 runs (16.80) in the series and never played for Australia again. Cowper was blamed for slow scoring even though he had made 99 and 60 in the Second and Third Tests. Peter Allan of Queensland was brought back into the side after he had taken the third best bowling figures in Australia – 10/61 in the first innings against Victoria, but was injured and McKenzie was restored to the team. The off-spinner Tom Veivers and young batsmen Ian Chappell were called up and Keith Stackpole made his Test debut, so Australia went to Adelaide with only three specialist bowlers – McKenzie, Hawke and Veivers. England simply kept the same XI from Sydney, even though this meant that Geoff Boycott was their third place bowler after Jeff Jones and Dave Brown. Mike Smith won the toss and decided to bat.|$|E
