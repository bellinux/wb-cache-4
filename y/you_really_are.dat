5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are,</b> and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
500|$|Astronaut Shannon Lucid, who set {{the record}} for longest stay in space by a woman while aboard Mir (surpassed by Sunita Williams 11 years later on the ISS), also commented about working aboard Mir saying [...] "I think {{going to work on}} a daily basis on Mir is very similar to going to work on a daily basis on an {{outstation}} in Antarctica. The big difference with going to work here is the isolation, because <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> isolated. You don't have a lot of support from the ground. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> on your own." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The {{rules are}} arbitrary, unfathomable, {{and subject to}} sudden change. A brutal social {{hierarchy}} prevails, with the rich, the good-looking, and the athletic lording their advantages over everyone else. To survive {{you have to be}} totally fake. Adults don't seem to understand how high the stakes are; your whole life could be over, and they act like it's just some [...] "phase"! Everyone's always watching you, scrutinizing your clothes or your friends and obsessing over whether you're having sex or taking drugs or getting good enough grades, but no one cares who <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> or how you really feel about anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course. How {{right you}} always are!" [...] Miss Silverton hesitated again. [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> glad if I {{went back to}} the show?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{begin again}} at the beginning," [...] {{continued}} the master cheerfully. [...] "Exactly like one of those--in fact, as if <b>you</b> <b>REALLY</b> <b>were</b> a child again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And would <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> content without pretty frocks and sweets and all {{the things}} young ladies like?" [...] asked Mr. Perrott, concealing a certain amount of pain beneath his ironical manner.|$|R
500|$|In November 2017, Stephenson {{received}} a Pride of Britain Award for Lifetime Achievement, presented {{to him by}} Lenny Henry, who said: [...] "It is a well-known saying that to achieve greatness {{you have to stand}} on the shoulders of giants. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> a giant. So without you, there wouldn’t be any black or Asian politicians." [...] The judges' citation said: [...] "Thanks to Paul’s courage, principles and determination, Britain is a more open and tolerant place today. He has changed the way we all live for the better, and his story reminds us that the battle for civil rights was not confined to America." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Gordon's lyrics on Experimental Jet Set {{addressed}} {{gender roles}} and stereotypes, her contributions to Washing Machine were considered more feminine and girl-oriented. Tom Moon of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "The title track is an odd, earnest love song; 'Panty Lies' is a playground taunt blown to absurd extremes; and ' Trouble Girl', the Spector sendup, is a dramatic, earnest coming-of-age story". The latter {{was described by}} David Browne of Entertainment Weekly as [...] "a teen-pregnancy lullaby" [...] and features vocals by Gordon and Kim Deal (of Pixies and the Breeders) along with other musicians. Gordon felt that Deal had an ideal voice for the melodic part and explained that the song was about [...] "wanting to be seen for who <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are,</b> being able to express those parts of yourself that aren't 'good girl' but that are just as real and true". Ranaldo contributed to two songs, [...] "Saucer-Like" [...] and [...] "Skip Tracer". The latter was co-written with Ranaldo's wife Leah Singer and inspired by a performance that the couple attended of riot grrrl duo Mecca Normal. The song alludes to the band's special relationship with the major labels.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} of The Album Network, Jared Leto {{explained that the}} song is [...] "less about reinventing yourself and more about finding out who <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are,</b> your true self. That's a pretty important thing. That feeling of {{if you could just}} go back, knowing what you know now." [...] Leto said: [...] "In a general sense, it is about a desire for renewal. But I'd rather let people take their own understanding and meaning from the song. I think {{that is one of the}} exciting things about music, the interpretation, from individual to individual and how it can change so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since I must die," [...] he said, [...] "before I {{choose the}} manner of my death, I conjure you on your honour to tell me if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>were</b> in that vase?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are mad, I think, in earnest," [...] said Mowbray; [...] "can <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> so absurd as to rejoice {{that you}} have no way left to relieve {{yourself}} and me from ruin, want, and shame?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What Skip Jellison told 'bout our havin' some of {{your money}} was straight; an' so we've come here to give it up. Here's all I got, an' if I'd know'd what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>were,</b> the money wouldn't 'a' been kept so long as this." ...|$|R
2500|$|On October 22, 2003, {{during his}} one-day shift as Acting Mayor, while Mayor Willie Brown {{traveled}} to Tibet, Daly appointed two {{members to the}} San Francisco Public Utilities Commission without Brown's consent, having consulted with the City Attorney who had advised him that as acting mayor he had the legal authority to make appointments in Mayor Brown's absence. [...] Brown, who had his own people in mind for the assignments, had a different opinion, stating that [...] " [...] were made by {{a person who was}} supposed to be operating in a ceremonial capacity... a conspiracy to... move away from the traditions, the rules, the customs and the conduct that has been the hallmark of this city, long before I became mayor of this city." [...] Brown also compared Daly to a stalker and suicide bomber, stating that, [...] "When you conspire and calculate what you intend to do several days before you're designated as the acting mayor, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> venal, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> violative of all the protocols. It's like stalking. You knew exactly what you were intending to do. You concealed all your steps. You carefully plotted, then you did it behind closed doors, and then you laughed about it." [...] Brown said he found out about Daly's actions when his chief of staff called him in Tibet. Brown was sleeping at the time but with the assistance of Chinese officials, was on a plane home within hours, cutting short his trade and promotion trip to China—reportedly explaining the matter to his hosts simply as a [...] "coup." ...|$|E
2500|$|Easter {{is linked}} to Passover and the Exodus from Egypt {{recorded}} in the Old Testament through the Last Supper, sufferings, and crucifixion of Jesus that preceded the resurrection. According to the New Testament, Jesus gave the Passover meal a new meaning, as in the upper room during the Last Supper he prepared himself and his disciples for his death. He identified the matzah and cup of wine as his body soon to be sacrificed and his blood soon to be shed. Paul states, [...] "Get rid of the old yeast {{that you may be}} a new batch without yeast—as <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are.</b> For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed"; this refers to the Passover requirement to have no yeast in the house and to the allegory of Jesus as the Paschal lamb.|$|E
2500|$|On December 2, 2013, Christie {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that Democrats were just playing {{politics}} by holding hearings into lane closures. [...] "Just because [...] John Wisniewski is obsessed with this, and [...] Loretta Weinberg, it just shows that they really have nothing to do," [...] Christie said. Christie later credited the e-mail documents subpoenaed by the hearings as the first information he had that his staff was involved. When reporter Matt Katz asked, [...] "Governor, did you {{have anything to do with}} these lane closures in September outside the GW Bridge? Have you spoken to--" [...] Christie dismissively joked [...] "I worked the cones, actually, Matt. Unbeknownst to everybody I was actually the guy out there. I was in overalls and a hat. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> not serious with that question." ...|$|E
6000|$|Catherine's {{understanding}} {{began to}} awake: {{an idea of}} the truth suddenly darted into her mind; and, with the natural blush of so new an emotion, she cried out, [...] "Good heaven! My dear Isabella, what do you mean? Can you--can <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> in love with James?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> {{thinking}} of taking Wa-Wa by the coach--and I [...] think you said outside? Think of Johnny, and {{be careful of}} this [...] little man. Are you par hazard something {{in the state of}} the poor [...] capitaine des dragons that comes in singing:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, if you could, you know, {{just try}} to {{interest}} these people to-night with some of your adventures--something told SERIOUSLY, you know, as if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>were</b> in earnest--I'd be awfully obliged to you. The fact is,--you'll excuse me,--but they think you don't come up to your reputation." ...|$|R
2500|$|Motoring {{journalist}} Jeremy Clarkson, {{a famous}} critic of hybrid vehicles and the Toyota Prius especially, admitted {{he loved the}} GS 450h. After claiming that you {{spent most of the}} time on the Prius [...] "chewing a lot of fuel" [...] and [...] "making a green statement," [...] he described [...] "with the Lexus I drove up and down Piccadilly all day. It was great." [...] He also felt that the GS 450h was [...] "balanced nicely by the styling, the quality and the sense that <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> in something a little bit different." [...] Clarkson also positively referred to the benefit of a hybrid car being exempt from the London congestion charge (for a £10 one off administration fee to register it). In 2009, the GS 450h received a new hybrid-only grille and refreshing.|$|E
2500|$|The verdict by Maurice Willson Disher in The Times Literary Supplement of 14 June 1941 was positive: [...] "To {{maintain}} {{a place at}} the head of detective-writers would be difficult enough without the ever increasing rivalry. Even Miss Christie cannot stay there unchallenged though she has a following which will swear her books are best without reading the others. Unbiased opinion may have given the verdict against her last season when new arrivals set a very hot pace; but Evil Under the Sun will take a lot of beating now". After summarising the plot, the Mr. Disher concluded: [...] "Miss Christie casts the shadow of guilt upon first one and then another with such casual ease that it is difficult for the reader not to be led by the nose. Everybody is well aware that any character most strongly indicated is not a likely criminal; yet this guiding principle is forgotten when Miss Christie persuades you that you are more discerning than <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are.</b> Then she springs her secret like a land-mine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout her career, Vélez's onscreen {{persona of}} a hot tempered, lusty [...] "wild" [...] woman was closely tied to her off screen personality. The press often {{referred}} to her by such names as [...] "The Mexican Spitfire", [...] "The Mexican It girl" [...] and [...] "The Mexican Kitten". Vélez consciously chose to promote her [...] "Whoopee Lupe" [...] persona but dismissed {{the idea that she}} was wild. In an interview she said: [...] "What I attribute my success?, I think, simply, because I'm different. I'm not beautiful, but I have beautiful eyes and know exactly what to do with them. Although the public thinks that I'm a very wild girl. Actually I'm not. I'm just me, Lupe Vélez, simple and natural Lupe. If I'm happy, I dance and sing and acted like a child. And if something irritates me, I cry and sob. Someone called that 'personality.' The Personality is nothing more than behave with others as <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are.</b> If I tried to look and act like Norma Talmadge, the great dramatic actress, or like Corinne Griffith, the aristocrat of the movies, or like Mary Pickford, the sweet and gentle Mary, I would be nothing more than an imitation. I just want to be myself: Lupe Velez." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, Mr. Forsyth," [...] she cried, {{when he had}} done, [...] "I am--so--sorry! I wish I hadn't {{laughed at}} you--only <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>were</b> so {{exceedingly}} funny. But I wish I hadn't, and I wouldn't either if I had only known." [...] And she gave him her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "All the same," [...] Philippa continued, more gravely, [...] "I {{shall never}} have a moment's peace whilst {{you are in the}} place. I was {{thinking}} about you last night. I don't believe I have ever realised before how terrible it would <b>be</b> if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>were</b> discovered. What would they do to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How I {{should like}} to know if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>were</b> so sick at heart that you hanged {{yourself}} there, or if it is only a hobgoblin that's before me!' said the man. 'Ah, well! you may hang there for me, whether you are a hobgoblin or not,' and on he went with his ox.|$|R
60|$|CUSINS [revolted] <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> a--well, what I {{was saying}} yesterday.|$|E
60|$|JOHN [carried away]. Maggie, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> a {{very generous}} woman.|$|E
60|$|MARGARET. Not at all. Bobby: <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> a beast: Monsieur Duvallet {{will think}} I'm always fighting.|$|E
60|$|SHE [turning to {{him with}} a gasp of relief] Oh, thank you, thank <b>you!</b> <b>You</b> <b>really</b> can <b>be</b> very nice, Henry.|$|R
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. [Makes no answer, {{but remains}} standing. There is a pause. Then {{the eyes of}} the two women meet. LADY CHILTERN looks stern and pale. MRS. CHEVELEY seem rather amused.] Mrs. Cheveley, I think it is right to tell you quite frankly that, had I known who <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>were,</b> I should not have invited you to my house last night.|$|R
6000|$|... "I dare say. But if so, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>were</b> {{the only}} person that did {{understand}} her. No doubt what she did was quite right, seeing that she was a saint; but we sinners would have thought it very wicked to have made such a will, and then to have trusted to the generosity of another person after we were dead." ...|$|R
60|$|THE MOTHER. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> very helpless, Freddy. Go again; and don't {{come back}} {{until you have}} found a cab.|$|E
60|$|Dick. [She {{stretches}} out her hands, smiling, {{and he takes}} her in his arms.] <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> a detestable person.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The very thing!' Arthur {{answered}} {{in a tone of}} obvious admiration. 'What a wonderfully practical person <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>are,</b> Lady Hilda.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Captain Jay {{appeared}} to be counting the thousand pinnacles of the church. [...] "I think <b>you</b> <b>really</b> must <b>be</b> right," [...] he remarked at last.|$|R
6000|$|... "Harold {{noticed it}} first," [...] she replied, [...] "and called my {{attention}} to it; and now I can see that <b>you</b> <b>really</b> have <b>been</b> failing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, my dear fellow, <b>you</b> can't <b>really</b> <b>be</b> in earnest? <b>You</b> can't {{suppose it}} {{possible}} that he would allow such an engagement?" ...|$|R
