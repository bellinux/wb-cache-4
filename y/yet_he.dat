5|$|From early childhood, Johnson {{suffered}} from poor eyesight, especially {{in his left}} eye, which interfered with his education. There were somewhat contradictory reports about his eyesight from his contemporaries. He {{appeared to have been}} near-sighted, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> did not use eyeglasses. His eyesight became worse with age; still, his handwriting remained quite legible.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring {{was back}} where he started. Park's {{handling}} of the actions was a masterpiece of aggressive defence, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> was not under the same pressure {{as he had been}} in the battles during August when air battles were so confusing they were hard to control. A big set-piece offensive played into his hands.|$|E
6000|$|... “And <b>yet</b> <b>he’s</b> given a whole {{half hour}} to the {{consideration}} of my very small sprat,” interjected the Assistant Commissioner.|$|R

5|$|Octavian had {{previously}} shown little mercy to surrendered enemies and acted {{in ways that}} had proven unpopular with the Roman people, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> was given credit for pardoning many of his opponents after the Battle of Actium.|$|E
5|$|Although Hazlitt had {{reviewed}} {{a performance}} of Measure for Measure for The Examiner on 11 February 1816, and incorporated a few passages, with modifications, into this chapter, including some of his general philosophical reflections and a mention of some of Schlegel's opinions, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> says nothing in Characters of Shakespear's Plays about any stage performances of this play.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of Cicero, the Senate {{inducted}} Octavian as senator on 1 January 43BC, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> also was given the power to vote alongside the former consuls. In addition, Octavian was granted propraetor imperium (commanding power) which legalized his command of troops, sending him to relieve the siege along with Hirtius and Pansa (the consuls for 43BC). In April 43BC, Antony's forces were defeated at the battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina, forcing Antony to retreat to Transalpine Gaul. Both consuls were killed, however, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen to him! You'd think butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, an' <b>yet</b> <b>he's</b> been ridin' {{a mighty}} high hoss, 'cordin' to all I can find out!" ...|$|R

5|$|Dorset South was {{the most}} {{marginal}} Labour seat in the 2001 general election, won by 153 votes. Jim Knight was expecting to have a difficult 2005 election, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> won with a margin of 1,812 votes—this was in contrast to other areas, where Labour suffered a decline in popularity. This was helped by a high-profile anti-Conservative campaign by musician Billy Bragg. The seat was gained from Labour by Drax for the Conservatives at the 2010 General Election.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Jack and Angelica admit {{their love}} for each other, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> distrusts her {{intentions}} (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a cay. Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the Queen Anne's Revenge and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the Revenge. He reclaims the shrunken Black Pearl and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a gunny sack. The two leave, hoping to revert the Black Pearl to its original size and continue living the pirates life.|$|E
5|$|In the late-13th century, many of {{the newly}} {{emerging}} painter's guilds were nominating Luke as their patron saint. The van der Weyden panel is among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art, along with a similar work, a lost triptych panel by Robert Campin. Van der Weyden presents a humanised Virgin and Child, {{as suggested by the}} realistic contemporary surroundings, the lack of halos, and the intimate spatial construction. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> infuses the panel with extensive religious iconography.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,' she replied; 'you're right sickly <b>yet.</b> <b>He's</b> not dead; Doctor Kenneth {{thinks he}} may last another day. I met {{him on the}} road and asked.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe you!" [...] Miss Ellen nodded. [...] "Mark my words, Mr. Meredith, {{that man}} is going to fight {{somebody}} <b>yet.</b> <b>He's</b> ACHING to. He is going to set the world on fire." ...|$|R
6000|$|King David, o' poetic brief, [...] Wrocht 'mang the lasses sic {{mischief}} [...] As {{filled his}} after-life wi' grief, [...] An' bluidy rants, [...] An' <b>yet</b> <b>he's</b> rank'd amang the chief [...] O' lang-syne saunts.|$|R
5|$|The newly {{independent}} Pixar (1986) was headed by Edwin Catmull as President and Alvy Ray Smith as Executive Vice President. While looking for investors, Steve Jobs was interested, but Lucas found his offer too low. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> accepted {{it in the}} end after {{it turned out to}} be impossible to find other investors. Jobs, who had recently been fired from Apple Computer, paid $5million to George Lucas for technology rights and put them and $5million cash as capital into the company, and joined the board of directors as chairman.|$|E
5|$|When the Scott family awoke {{the next}} morning, Beauchamp {{emerged from his}} quarters. He feigned {{surprise}} when told of the murder and was apparently believed at the time. After being told there were no suspects <b>yet,</b> <b>he</b> called for his horse and began his return trip of four days to Bowling Green. Arriving, he told his wife Anna that Sharp was dead. The next morning, a posse from Frankfort arrived and told Beauchamp that he was under suspicion for the murder. He agreed to return with the men to Frankfort and face the charge.|$|E
5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E
6000|$|The Inspector {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "I don't quite know, sir. Between ourselves, I think Mr. Holmes had not quite got over his illness <b>yet.</b> <b>He's</b> been {{behaving}} very queerly, {{and he is}} very much excited." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'What {{kind of a}} looking man is the man {{you work}} for?' he asks. 'Does old George Ramey own this place <b>yet?</b> <b>He's</b> run sheep here {{for the last ten}} years, but never had no success.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When he {{believes}} in himself, he'll be frightening. He still doesn't quite understand his role <b>yet.</b> <b>He's</b> got to learn when to pass it and when to be nice and positive." [...] Manager Micky Adams speaking in September 2009.|$|R
5|$|Archelaus I {{maintained}} {{good relations}} with Athens throughout his reign, relying on Athens to provide naval support in his 410 BC siege of Pydna, and in exchange providing Athens with timber and naval equipment. With improvements to military organization and building of new infrastructure such as fortresses, Archelaus was able to strengthen Macedonia and project his power into Thessaly, where he aided his allies; <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> faced some internal revolt as well as problems fending off Illyrian incursions led by Sirras. Although he retained Aigai as a ceremonial and religious center, Archelaus I moved {{the capital of the}} kingdom north to Pella, which was then positioned by a lake with a river connecting it to the Aegean Sea. He improved Macedonia's currency by minting coins with a higher silver content as well as issuing separate copper coinage. His royal court attracted the presence of well-known intellectuals such as the Athenian playwright Euripides.|$|E
5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates to {{guarantee}} that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, {{knew that it was}} now mathematically impossible for him to win the nomination, as he had captured only 20– 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the next few weeks, Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E
5|$|David is {{best known}} for his crucial {{assistance}} to the Byzantine Macedonian dynasty in the 976–9 civil war and his unique role in the political unification of various Georgian polities as well as his patronage of Christian culture and learning. Between 987 and 989, David joined his friend Bardas Phocas in a revolt against the Byzantine emperor Basil II, but was defeated and agreed to cede his lands to the empire on his death. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> was able to secure for his heir, Bagrat III, an opportunity to become the first ruler of a unified Georgian kingdom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Steve is primitive; I {{guess you}} don't {{understand}} him <b>yet.</b> <b>He's</b> an old trapper and one gets superstitious in the bush. For all that, he's stubborn, {{and if he}} has an object, he'll persist until he carries it out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't know, sir; but we can't get {{an answer}} when we knock at the {{laboratory}} door. <b>Yet</b> <b>he's</b> there, for it's locked on the inside. It has given us all a scare, sir, that, and his goin's-on during the day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heavens!" [...] I exclaimed, feeling humiliated somehow. [...] "Can it be possible? What a fool he must be! That overbearing, impudent loafer! Why! He couldn't. [...] . And <b>yet</b> <b>he's</b> nearly done it, I believe; for the Harbour Office {{was bound}} to send somebody." ...|$|R
5|$|During Western Han, the Chancellor was {{the chief}} civil official. The duties of the {{chancellery}} were divided between a Right Chancellor (右丞相) and Left Chancellor (左丞相) between 196 and 180 BC. After 180 BC, the Left Chancellor's post was merely titular and its incumbent had no real authority. The Western Han Chancellor oversaw state finances, logistics for military campaigns, registers for land and population, maps of the empire's territories, annual provincial reports, high-profile lawsuits, and drafted the government budget. The Chancellor could directly appoint officials who were ranked 600-dan or below, while he was also able to recommend nominees to the emperor for recruitment to the senior roles in central government. The Chancellor was {{held responsible for the}} actions of officials he recommended and appointed, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> could also punish inadequate officials without the emperor's consent.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Constantine I {{followed}} a formal policy of neutrality, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> was openly benevolent towards Germany, which was fighting alongside Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire against the Triple Entente of Russia, France and Britain. Constantine was the brother-in-law of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and had also {{become something of}} a Germanophile following his military training in Prussia. His pro-German attitude provoked a split between the monarch and the prime minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, who wanted to support the Entente in the hope of expanding Greek territory to incorporate the Greek minorities in the Ottoman Empire and the Balkans. Protected by the countries of the Entente, particularly France, in 1916 Venizelos formed a parallel government to that of the king.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not sure what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Joe! you haven't {{seen much}} of Crusoe <b>yet.</b> <b>He's</b> {{as good as}} a man any day. I've done little else but train him for two years gone by, and he can do most {{anything}} but shoot--he can't handle the rifle nohow." ...|$|R
2500|$|One team {{chose to}} replace their regular driver with a substitute. Michael Waltrip Racing chose to replace Mark Martin with Brian Vickers for six races during the season. Team owner Michael Waltrip said, [...] "Brian Vickers {{is a veteran}} driver with almost 10 years experience, but he hasn't even turned 30 <b>yet.</b> <b>He's</b> shown he can win at this level and we have every {{confidence}} he'll run well with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|The 'off-watch' {{was just}} turning in, and I heard some brutal {{laughter}} from them, and such remarks as 'Hello, watchman! an't the new cub turned out <b>yet?</b> <b>He's</b> delicate, likely. Give him some {{sugar in a}} rag and send for the chambermaid to sing rock-a-by-baby to him.' ...|$|R
