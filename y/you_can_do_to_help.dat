5000|$|I got a {{call from}} then-Senator John Kennedy. This was during the campaign. He said, “A judge down in Georgia has incarcerated Martin Luther King.

Because it will be helpful to my career.” You may or may not know that Daddy King was supporting Nixon at that time[...] [...] [...] So I called my brother-in-law and a close friend of mine who had been secretary of state when I was lieutenant governor. His name was George Stewart. George Stewart went out and talked with Judge Mitchell. Judge Mitchell agreed, and I do not know what George told the man. He might have told him that he would get him appointed federal judge or something. Anyway, he agreed that if either Senator Kennedy or Bobby Kennedy would call him personally and ask him to release Dr. King, that he would release him. I called Bobby Kennedy and relayed the message that George Stewart had brought back to me. Bobby Kennedy called Judge Mitchell, and Martin Luther King was released from jail.

5000|$|Lawley {{first met}} William Booth in Bradford soon after The Christian Mission became The Salvation Army in 1878. General Booth also {{conducted}} the ceremony when Lawley married Captain Harriett Charteris in 1887 in Cardiff. Following {{the death of}} Catherine Booth in 1890 Chief of Staff Bramwell Booth acted as his father's assistant at prayer meetings and elsewhere, but it was soon realised that a full-time Officer needed to be appointed who could accompany General Booth in both his British and overseas tours. The choice fell on Colonel Lawley who was in Scotland when a telegram from Bramwell Booth told him meet General Booth at Durham, where a Campaign was in progress. [...] "'Lawley arrived as the General was conducting an afternoon meeting. Slipping into a back seat, he watched the proceedings until the prayer meeting commenced, then the General motioned to him. 'Here, Lawley,' he said, 'see what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me with this.' Lawley mounted {{a seat in the}} middle of the chapel, and led his first prayer meeting with the Founder. Afterwards, the General. took him into the vestry and continued, 'I want some one to help me to pull, when it comes to the prayer meeting. Some one who will give his life up to help me to capture souls. I believe you're the man. Will you come?' Lawley replied, 'Yes, General, by the grace of God I will live to be a fisher of men - but '-he added, with a sudden consciousness of the strain which the call would entail, 'my voice and throat are very bad just now.' 'A few meetings will put that right,' twinkled the Founder. They knelt, and with his hand upon Lawley's shoulder, he prayed God's blessing upon the appointment. Then the Founder exclaimed: 'Lawley, I've annexed you.' From that day, except when illness forbade, for twenty-two years-until the Founder lay down his sword - Lawley was ever at his side in his world-wide labours for souls."He acted as William Booth's aide-de-camp and was his loyal companion from 1890 until Booth's death in 1912. During services held by General Booth Lawley would often lead the prayers and sing solos. In the early 1900s he accompanied Booth on several motorcades around Britain and went with him on various overseas tours including visits to Europe and Asia, South Africa, Japan, Australia, Canada and the USA. En route to Australia in 1905 they stopped at Palestine where they visited various sites connected with the life of Jesus, including Bethany and the Tomb of Lazarus. In all he travelled 500,000 miles with General Booth.|$|E
