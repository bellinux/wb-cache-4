5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E

Technically this meant that any performance was eligible to win the award, {{regardless of whether they}} were an official nominee or not. While the Academy does not officially recognize this as a nomination for Davis, they have included her in the list of nominees for the 1935 ceremony on their official website.|$|E
