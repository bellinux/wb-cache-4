25|$|You write: „in {{order to}} avoid {{unnecessary}} bloodshed“. Who {{is the cause of}} this bloodshed? We or you? Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but <b>your</b> <b>boss</b> will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E

500|$|Reed {{attended}} Walter Payton College Prep in Chicago, IL while Ingersoll {{had attended}} Notre Dame High School in Harper Woods, MI {{where he played}} football and basketball, Hernandez attended Bensenville Academy [...] Reed, Hernandez, and Ingersoll first exchanged conversations in 2005 when Reed found a beat on MySpace that Ingersoll had produced. The three met to discuss terms of the beat's sale, and eventually ended up recording for two hours. They were inspired by golden age hip hop and artists like LL Cool J and Eric B. & Rakim. Ingersoll began promoting the new duo's material, and it was eventually booked by Josh Young of Flosstradamus for a DJ performance. At this performance (in a venue called Town Hall Pub), the duo met the DJ Diplo who offered to release a mixtape of their unreleased tracks titled Totally Flossed Out on his label Mad Decent, though it was eventually released on C.A.K.E. Recordings. They also received an offer from the DJ A-Trak to sign to his Fool's Gold Records label, which they did, but only for one single. Of their time with Fool's Gold Records, the Cool Kids felt they weren’t getting enough attention: “When <b>your</b> <b>boss</b> is on tour with Kanye West, it’s easy to have timelines missed,” said Chuck in an interview.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is quite dark and mysterious, {{as much of it}} is often {{interpreted}} to be dealing with issues such as substance abuse, suicide, and depression, with running themes of revenge, annihilation, seclusion, fear, loss, death, and discovery. Cornell was inspired by the writings of Sylvia Plath at the time. Commenting on the album's lyrics, Thayil said that [...] "a lot of Superunknown {{seems to me to be}} about life, not death. Maybe not affirming it, but rejoicing—like the Druids : 'Life is good, but death's gonna be even better!" [...] Cameron said that the lyrics on the album are [...] "a big fuck-you to the world, a plea to 'leave us alone. Cornell stated that [...] "Let Me Drown" [...] is about [...] "crawling back to the womb to die", [...] "Fell on Black Days" [...] is about realizing [...] "you're unhappy in the extreme", [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] is about a [...] "surreal dreamscape", [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] is a [...] "'shame-on-decadence' song", [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] is about [...] "trying to step out of being patterned and closed off and reclusive", and [...] "4th of July" [...] is about using LSD. Cornell talked about [...] "Mailman" [...] at a concert saying, [...] "This next one is about killing <b>your</b> <b>boss.</b> It's about coming to work early one morning cause you have a special agenda and you're going to shoot him in the fucking head." [...] Conversely, [...] "Like Suicide" [...] was literal, written by Cornell after a bird flew into a window of his house. He found the severely injured animal and killed it, hitting it with a brick to end its suffering.|$|E
500|$|... "Wake Up", {{the opening}} track, is a mid-tempo number backed by dance, pop and {{electronic}} beats, and has [...] "a more mature pop-techno sound" [...] than Duff's previous work. Its instrumentation includes a guitar, bass and drums. Kelefa Anneth of The New York Times {{noted that the}} song contains musical influences of The Go-Go's. The lyrics of the song speak about having fun. Duff initially sings {{about the consequences of}} her fame and how people think they know [...] "everything about [...] " [...] ("There's people talking / They talk about me / They know my name / They think they know everything / But they don't know anything about me"). As the chorus draws near, the song takes on a [...] "party anthem" [...] approach, where Duff discusses the [...] "struggle" [...] for joy and self-confidence: [...] "I know I make mistakes / I'm living life day to day / It's never really easy but it's OK..." [...] According to Duff, the song [...] "makes you want to forget about all the pressure of dealing with <b>your</b> <b>boss,</b> or your teacher, or your mom, or ," [...] and lyrically discusses [...] "getting out and not forgetting to have some fun." [...] Duff has also said the song also [...] "talks about being in all [...] favorite places in the world, which is Tokyo and Paris and London and New York." [...] "Beat of My Heart", the third track on the album, is inspired by the new wave genre. The song also draws influences from the bubblegum pop and dance genres. It carries a [...] "soft electronic pop" [...] sound and has the heart beat sound as its base. According to Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine, the word 'beat of my heart' is repeated forty-four times in the song.|$|E

Thieu was promised a better deal under a Nixon administration. Chennault agreed and periodically reported to John Mitchell that Thieu {{had no intention of}} attending a peace conference. On November 2, Chennault informed the South Vietnamese ambassador: [...] "I have just heard from my boss in Albuquerque who says his boss [...] is going to win. And you tell <b>your</b> <b>boss</b> [...] to hold on a while longer." [...] In 1997, Chennault admitted that [...] "I was constantly in touch with Nixon and Mitchell." [...] The effort also involved Texas Senator John Tower and Kissinger, who traveled to Paris on behalf of the Nixon campaign. William Bundy stated that Kissinger obtained [...] "no useful inside information" [...] from his trip to Paris, and [...] "almost any experienced Hanoi watcher might have come to the same conclusion". While Kissinger may have [...] "hinted that his advice was based on contacts with the Paris delegation," [...] this sort of [...] "self-promotion....is at worst a minor and not uncommon practice, quite different from getting and reporting real secrets." ...|$|E
