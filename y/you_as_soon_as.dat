2500|$|On {{the first}} afternoon, Petrelis, {{dressed in a}} mock {{concentration}} camp uniform with a pink triangle, told a panel on confidentiality, “There’s {{no such thing as}} confidentiality. I can tell <b>you,</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> you get on Social Security, your disability is AIDS, and everybody knows it.” Petrelis accused federal health officials of genocide in mishandling the AIDS epidemic and said, “You locked up the Japanese during World War II, and you’ll do it again if you want to. You should start talking about new treatments.” Lavender Hill Mob members also passed out leaflets that said “Test drugs, not people,” and referred to the CDC as “Center for Detention Camps.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{pamphlet}} in English titled JAPAN HAS SURRENDERED {{was dropped}} over the camp by three Beaufighters on 16 August. From 19–23 August, leaflets were dropped by aircraft all over known {{areas in which}} the Japanese were concentrated, giving general war news and news of {{the progress of the}} surrender. On August 19 or 20, more leaflets were dropped on the camp. Signed by Major-General George Wootten, General Officer Commanding, 9th Division, they informed the prisoners of the surrender of Japan, and stated [...] "I know that you will realise that on account of your location, {{it will be difficult to}} get aid to you immediately, but you can rest assured that we will do everything within our power to release and care for <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible".|$|E

(Gordon): [...] "Well, we're {{sorry to}} tell you that due to the severe weather {{conditions}} {{and the fact that we}} are shipping quite a lot of water, we are closing down, and the crew are at this stage leaving the ship. Obviously, we hope to be back with <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible, but just for the moment we would like to say goodbye." [...] (Anderson): [...] "It's not a very good occasion really, we have to hurry this because the lifeboat is standing by. We're not leaving and disappearing, we're going onto the lifeboat hoping that the pumps can take it; if they can, we'll be back, if not, well, we really don't like to say it." [...] (Gordon): [...] "I think we'll be back in one way or another." [...] (Anderson): [...] "Yeah. I think so." [...] (Gordon): [...] "For the moment from all of us, goodbye and God bless." ...|$|E

2500|$|The drink Slusho! {{served as}} part of the viral {{marketing}} campaign. The drink had already appeared in producer Abrams' previous creation, the TV series Alias. Websites for Slusho! and Taguruato were launched to add to the mythology of Cloverfield. The Japanese phone number in the Tagruato website did work, but only played recorded messages. For example, one of the messages was: [...] "Thank you for calling Tagruato. Due to high call volumes, your call has been transferred to an automated answering service. There are no updates at this time. After the tone, please leave a message, and one of our associates will find <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible". A building bearing the company logo for Tagruato can also be seen in the TV spot of the 2009 Star Trek film, and Uhura orders a Slusho! during the bar scene. When Cloverfield was hosted at Comic-Con 2007, gray Slusho! T-shirts were distributed to attendees. Fans who had registered at the Slusho! website received e-mails of fictional sonar images before the film's release that showed a deep-sea creature heading toward Manhattan. Fans who ordered merchandise received pieces of torn Tagruato documents and Japanese newspapers along with their products. Slusho! has also appeared in Fringe and Heroes.|$|E
