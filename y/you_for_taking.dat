500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1990, {{a few weeks before}} his 17th birthday, his father led a group of high school math students, {{including}} Sergey, on a two-week exchange program to the Soviet Union. His roommate on the trip was future Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor John Stamper. As Brin recalls, the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he remembered that [...] "his first impulse on confronting Soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car". Malseed adds, [...] "On {{the second day of the}} trip, while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near Moscow, Brin took his father aside, looked him in the eye and said, 'Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> us all out of Russia.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The game is {{markedly}} {{more difficult}} than its predecessor. Amiga Format called this [...] "good/bad news", whereas The One directed its [...] "major criticism" [...] at the difficulty level, saying [...] "some of the levels are quite simply horrendous", and that the game is [...] "close to being intensely frustrating at times." [...] Amiga Computing also felt the high difficulty to be the [...] "biggest problem": [...] "I like a game to get progressively harder rather than getting virtually impossible after just four missions." [...] Amiga Format also criticised the difficulty and felt [...] "some of the levels are {{a bit of a}} drag." [...] Amiga Power was annoyed at the early tutorial missions, finding them redundant, but otherwise noted the increased challenge as a positive, and said: [...] "The original game went in pulses of fiendishly hard and stupidly simple levels, but in CF2 the difficulty curve's, well, more of a curve." [...] The reviewer praised the clever level design, explaining: [...] "The levels penalise <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> the obvious route and reward you for trying an obscure approach [...] loads of levels make you think before you move, injecting puzzle elements into the killing", citing the example of traps with empty vehicles as bait. The reviewer praised the smaller, tighter levels with a difficulty curve within those levels: [...] "gung-ho" [...] sections building to tactical play against tougher enemies. He compared this favourably with the first game: [...] "The level design is consistently better", in particular the [...] "Beirut, Mediaevil and Chicago levels look and play wonderfully." [...] He nevertheless felt the thematic shifts lacked coherence and atmosphere.|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{would do}} for me, very well," [...] Bob said. [...] "Nothing could be better. What charge would <b>you</b> make, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> me across and {{bringing}} me back, tomorrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Captain Ackinson, I presume," [...] the man remarked with {{extended}} hand. [...] "We are exceedingly {{obliged to}} <b>you,</b> sir, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> us off. This is my wife, Mrs. James B. Watson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{will be no}} {{difficulty}} about that, Mr. Mayfield. You shall hear it, and I trust that it will make <b>you</b> repent <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> so black {{a view of the}} case of your own client." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{always comes}} on unlucky days!' she said. 'I wish I {{could have made}} it go off better. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> all the trouble.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He can't pay <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of him, and {{my mother}} says it isn't worth while to help folks that can't help us,' added Kate.|$|E
6000|$|... "None; and I even {{ventured to}} appear in this fashion lest you should think so. I also wanted to thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} I have met you," [...] said Olive, [...] "and that I {{know who you}} are. And I am glad, too, {{to tell you that}} I forgive <b>you</b> <b>for</b> not <b>taking</b> notice of me seven years ago." ...|$|R
50|$|Hello Mr. Lillywhite,:I thank <b>you</b> {{in advance}} <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> {{the time to}} read this E-mail. I have unintentionally placed myself in a very {{precarious}} situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Brave young signor," [...] {{cried the}} tall man, {{throwing}} his arms round Alleyne, [...] "how can we thank <b>you</b> enough <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> our parts against those horrible drunken barbarians. What {{should we have}} done without you? My Tita would have been dragged away, and my head would have been shivered into a thousand fragments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. He will {{be thankful}} to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> him in hand. Poor boy, I know how {{attractive}} his penitence is, but I have quite left off building on it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good child! I like <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> your mother's part. Mamma {{has another}} merit, my dear. She {{is old enough}} to {{understand}} me better than you do. Go and fetch her." ...|$|E
60|$|THE MAN [ignoring the interruption] Bless <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> him off my hands! I {{have had}} as much of him as I can bear. [He goes {{down the steps and}} disappears].|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] she said, {{and though}} vexed {{at first she}} had too much sense to blame them long or seriously for a devotion to her that was as {{valuable}} as it was rare. She added with a very pretty grace, [...] "Well, I really thank <b>you</b> heartily <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> all this trouble; but I wish you had borrowed anybody's horses but Mr. Boldwood's." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “My {{dear friend}} Osbald … I am {{disappointed}} in <b>you</b> <b>for</b> not <b>taking</b> my advice. I urged {{you in my}} letter that you should give up this way of life. Do not add sin to sin by ruining your country and shedding blood. Think how much blood of emperors, princes, and people has been shed through you and your clan.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have a {{right to}} be proud of the cross, Julian. I should be proud of it myself, British officer as I am. But how do you say that <b>you</b> got it <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> things easy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you care}} to, by all means," [...] he answered. [...] "Tell Mr. Pengarth {{to let me}} have your address. Goodbye! Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of my treasures so well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep your money," [...] he said. [...] "I've {{got more}} than you to-day, I daresay. But thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> a little interest. That's worth more than money to a man that's down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't exaggerate that," [...] said Madame de Bellegarde, {{getting up}} and laying her hand upon her daughter's arm. [...] "You can't expect an honest old woman to thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> away her beautiful, only daughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In the {{critical}} situation our affairs are in, I {{ought to give}} you my orders, so that in all the disastrous cases which are {{in the possibility of}} events, <b>you</b> be authorized <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> the necessary steps.|$|R

6000|$|... "Your words seem only {{sweet and}} gracious now," [...] I returned. [...] "They have lifted a great weight from my heart, and I wish I could repay <b>you</b> <b>for</b> them by <b>taking</b> {{some portion of}} your {{suffering}} on myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'll {{tell you}} why," [...] I said. [...] "I'm rather a chump, you know, but I observe things. I bet {{he was most}} frightfully {{grateful}} to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> Edwin in hand and making him human." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Grace," [...] he said, [...] "is, {{as you can}} see, {{none the}} worse, {{but it was a}} {{fortunate}} thing you turned up when you did. Very much obliged to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> such good care of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I have, and I'm {{very much}} obliged to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> {{me to the}} theatre," [...] I added. After all, perhaps I was misjudging him. What {{possible}} motive could he have for being my enemy? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but one moment," [...] said Peter. [...] "If I'm a vegetarian, how did <b>you</b> account <b>for</b> my <b>taking</b> all {{the chicken}} I could get at dinner last night, and {{looking as if}} I wanted more?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, bully and bluster {{as much as}} you like," [...] he said sulkily; [...] "the {{difficulty}} {{about the}} money is not the only difficulty. <b>You</b> would be <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> strong measures with the women yourself--if you knew as much as I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure we {{are greatly}} indebted {{to your father}} and <b>you,</b> <b>for</b> so {{promptly}} <b>taking</b> measures to assist my mother," [...] Walter said.

6000|$|... "But {{at least}} let my brother thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> his place--in rescuing me. It was so {{thoughtful}} in you to put off at once when you saw I was surrounded. I {{might have been in}} great danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold! so much {{to redeem}} our promise--now for justice; we pay <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> a spy, but we punish you for burning, robbing, and murdering. Seize them, my lads, and give each of them the law of Moses--forty save one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course you've not. And {{as he is}} {{your brother}} it wouldn't be natural that you should like to throw him off. And, my dear, I like <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> his part. Only you needn't have been so fierce with an old woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My uncle {{would not}} allow it," [...] she said simply. [...] "He says that {{servants}} are always prying into one's concerns. Good night, Capitaine Rotherby!

30|$|Thank <b>you</b> {{very much}} <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> {{the time to}} talk with me today and for letting me observe your class.
