Hal then proposes to Sue and in the excitement, her father comes into the room. He is outraged and believes his daughter is too <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married and promptly makes Hal leave before scolding his daughter. Before departing, Hal meets and pleads with the father as he takes the daughter away by car. The father refuses and Hal is knocked down before the father and daughter depart to a boarding school. The father meets with the mistress and leaves Sue in her care, much to Sue's distress.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 940s Constantine {{was an old}} man, perhaps more than 70 years of age. The kingdom of Alba was too new to {{be said to have}} a {{customary}} rule of succession, but Pictish and Irish precedents favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine's surviving son Indulf, probably baptised in 927, would have been too <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine's nephew, MalcolmI. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been impatient. Willingly or not—the 11th-century Prophecy of Berchán, a verse history {{in the form of a}} supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision—Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.|$|E

5|$|He {{was given}} to {{sketching}} and drawing from an early age, without encouragement from his family. However, when he turned sixteen and {{wanted to go to}} Stockholm to study art, they were enthusiastic for him and backed him financially. In 1898, {{he was one of the}} 40 applicants to study at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, and although he was deemed well qualified for a place at the academy, he was too <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accepted. He spent the next two years at the Kaleb Ahltins school for painters. During this time he was, like most teenagers, torn between hope and despair, something that is reflected in his artwork.|$|E
5|$|Ramsey's parents {{hoped that}} he would go to West Point, but at 15, he was too <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> admitted. He was awarded a {{scholarship}} to Kansas University, but in 1930 his father was posted to Governors Island, New York. Ramsey therefore entered Columbia University in 1931, and began studying engineering. He became interested in mathematics, and switched to this as his academic major. By the time he received his B.A. from Columbia in 1935, he had become interested in physics. Columbia awarded him a Kellett Fellowship to Cambridge University where he studied physics at Cavendish Laboratory under Lord Rutherford and Maurice Goldhaber, and encountered notable physicists including Edward Appleton, Max Born, Edward Bullard, James Chadwick, John Cockcroft, Paul Dirac, Arthur Eddington, Ralph Fowler, Mark Oliphant and J.J. Thomson. At Cambridge, he took the tripos in order to study quantum mechanics, which had not been covered at Columbia, resulting in being awarded a second B.A. degree by Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} synopsis {{for both}} films {{was published in}} The Moving Picture World on January 14, 1911. The first film, Everybody Saves Father is focused on Jennie Gear, a young woman whose affections are sought by many men. Jennie's father thinks his daughter is too <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married and drives off four of her suitors. One of the men, John, concocts a plan {{to save his life}} to win the man's approval. The plan is heard by another suitor, George, who decides to hire a rowboat to save the old man himself. This is over heard by George who concocts his own rescue to foil George. The plans go through without failure as each successive suitor's plan works to the actions of the other, and Henry wins the approval of Jennie's father. However, Jennie had already married Bill in the mean time.|$|E

5|$|Umran {{was first}} given {{the command of}} the 5th Brigade in Homs, but was {{promoted}} in June to become commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade. As head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, Jadid appointed friends to senior positions, purged his enemies and appointed several Ba'athists to senior positions. Ahmad Suwaydani, {{one of the new}} members of the Military Committee, was appointed Head of Military Intelligence and Mazyad Hunaydi became Head of the Military Police. The Military Academy at Homs was put under Ba'athist control—several hundred Ba'athists, including Assad's brother Rifaat al-Assad, were given a crash course in military teaching before being given command. Assad became the de facto head of the Syrian Air Force, a dizzying promotion for a man in his thirties. Considering that the members of the Military Committee were all too <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> perceived as the real leaders of Syria by the populace, the Military Committee appointed Colonel Amin al-Hafiz to the post of Minister of the Interior.|$|E
5|$|Farmwork {{combined}} with lessons {{from his mother}} — such was the order of Jan's life {{for the next few}} years. During his early childhood, still too <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> given formal responsibilities on the farm, Jan accompanied the Coloured farm labourers as they went about their daily work. At this time the relations between master and servant, between black and white, were certainly not based on social equality; nevertheless, on these Swartland farms there was little of the rigid segregation which was already emerging elsewhere in South Africa and which was later to have such profound consequences. Since 1828 the Cape had enshrined in law the principle of strict legal equality between the races. Unlike the rest of South Africa, all adult males, were entitled to vote and to stand for election to the Colonial legislature, subject only to a property qualification. In these country districts therefore, there existed a certain intimacy between the farm owners and their labourers. At harvest times it was common to find both working together to gather in the crops and it was also commonplace to find the farm's children playing with one another, irrespective of race.|$|E
5|$|Abi {{gets her}} job back at The Queen Vic and celebrates with Lauren and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Lee's {{pregnant}} fiancée. Abi drunkenly confesses to Lauren about her one-night stand with Lee, so she urges Abi {{to confess to}} Whitney, as Whitney has caught chlamydia from Lee. Abi does so but this results in much resentment. Babe emotionally blackmails Abi, forcing her to resign. Abi exposes Babe's secrets to the pub's landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) with Whitney defending her, so he tells Abi that she can keep her job, but this causes tension when she is later threatened by Babe. However Abi struggles to work on her own and so Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is forced to ask Babe back to help her. Abi then persistently bickers about an order and lack of hygiene so blames it on Babe. Angry with Abi's behaviour, Linda sacks her. Abi locks Babe in the kitchen freezer room {{as an act of}} revenge, although Babe frames her sister Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) who she strongly dislikes and has Alzheimer's disease. Abi is then reinstated at the Vic by a seemingly apologetic Babe but her behaviour, when alone in the kitchen with Abi, is threatening. Babe later leaves Walford after being thrown out by her family, so Abi runs the kitchen alone. Abi forms a friendship with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) when she moves in with Ben and Jay, and Donna convinces Abi to move in as well, though she feels bad about leaving Dot on her own, but Dot gives her blessing when Donna reveals that Abi wants to move out. Abi is inwardly resentful of Lauren's success and, following Lauren's secret abortion of which Abi was made aware, Abi tells Lauren's partner, Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) that they would make a good couple during a heart-to-heart, but he tells her she is too <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a mother. On Father's Day, feeling second best to Lauren and wound up during an argument with Steven, Abi reveals the abortion. Lauren is jealous when her boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), flirts with Abi, which leads to an argument, with Abi throwing a drink over her sister and then evicting her from the party. Later, the tension simmering between Abi and Steven leads to them having sex, even though he warns her it will mean nothing. Abi and Steven continue an affair and Abi learns that Steven is lying about having a brain tumour so that Lauren will not leave him. Despite being against the idea, Abi does not tell Lauren as Steven promises Abi he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. Then Abi is stunned by Steven's public marriage proposal to Lauren. Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) overhears Abi and Steven talking about their relationship and confronts them. Abi then discovers she is pregnant by Steven.|$|E

5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses {{tall trees}} or {{man-made}} pylons to nest in. Often, locations are sought {{where there is}} a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which {{can be used as a}} perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area. The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55mm, they are incubated over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months or until the following breeding season.|$|E
