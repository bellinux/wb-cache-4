25|$|The false scad, Caranx rhonchus (also {{known as}} the spotfin scad, ten-finned horse {{mackerel}} and <b>yellow</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel),</b> is a species of medium-sized marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The false scad is distributed throughout the tropical and temperate waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Namibia {{in the south to}} Spain and throughout most of the Mediterranean in the north. The species has an atypical body form compared to other species of Caranx, and can be distinguished from these on its elongate 'scad-like' body shape alone. Distinguishing the species from members of Decapterus and Trachurus is more difficult, requiring detailed anatomical analysis. The false scad is known to grow to a length of 60cm and a weight of 1 kg. The species lives both pelagically and demersally in continental shelf waters, ranging from depths of 15 to 200 m. It is a predatory fish, taking small fishes, crustaceans including euphausiids and shrimps, and cephalopods as its main prey, with significant dietary shifts as it ages. The false scad reaches sexual maturity at 2 years of age, with spawning occurring between April and July in shallow inshore waters, where the juveniles remain. The species is of major importance to fisheries throughout its range, but particularly from Morocco to Senegal, with annual catches ranging from 500 to 19000 t. The species is caught using trawls, seine nets and gill nets and sold fresh, frozen or salted.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by the French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1817 based on a specimen from Alexandria, Egypt which was designated to be the holotype. He named the species Caranx rhonchus, with the specific epithet of Latin origin meaning 'snorting' or 'croaking', {{in reference to the}} sound the species often makes when pulled from the water. The species placement in Caranx was later revised to Decapterus, although the revision was not accepted by all authors with the generic status of the species undetermined for many years. It has now been accepted by most taxonomic authorities, that despite the species appearance, the false scad shares more anatomical features with Caranx than Decapterus.The species was independently renamed once by Henry Weed Fowler in 1919 under the name of Caranx angolensis, which was similarly shifted to Decapterus before synonymy was recognized and the name sunk into C. rhonchus.The common name of 'false scad' refers to the scad like appearance of the fish, despite it not being a member of Decapterus or Trachurus, the two genera most commonly referred to as 'scads'.

40|$|The Cape <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> Trachurus trachurus capensisis one of Namibia's most {{valuable}} fish stocks, {{and an important}} component to the diet of Cape fur seals, Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus, off northern Namibia. The level of overlap in the utilization of this resource between seals and the purse-seine fishery was investigated using two overlap indices. For high overlap measures, seals and the purse-seine fishery utilized age- 2 <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel.</b> For low overlap measures, seals mainly consumed age- 0 fish whereas the fishery caught age- 2 fish. Both indices were adjusted by the proportion of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the seal diet, {{with the assumption that}} the proportion consumed by the seals reflects the abundance of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the coastal waters of Cape Cross, Namibia.

40|$|Purpose. Analysis of {{the main}} {{population}} parameters of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> caught in {{different areas of the}} Black Sea in 2011 - 2013. Methodology. Individuals of the Mediterranean <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus mediterraneus Staindachner, 1868) were caught by bottom traps in the coastal area of Sevastopol, as well as by trawls in areas of the South Coast, Alushta-Sudak, cape Takil from 2011 to 2013. The ichthiological data for Balaklavskaya and Sevastopolskaya (including Peschanaya, Karantinnaya, Alexandrovskaya bays, an open area in front of Karantinnaya and Peschanaya bays) bays were separated. Size and weight of fish, sex and stage of maturity were examined. Age of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> were determined using otoliths. Findings. Based on the analysis of the size-mass, sex and age structure of Trachurus mediterraneus Staindachner caught in different areas of the Black Sea we can conclude that near Sevastopol and Balaklava, two distinct groups T. mediterraneus are inhabiting but relate to one northern herd. Study of autumn-winter catches of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the areas of the southern coast of Crimea, Sudak - Alushta and cape Takil allowed to see different distribution of fish of different ages and size-weight characteristics that mainly due to seasonal migration of this specie.

Assessments of the <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> resource are currently undertaken through the combined efforts of the Demersal and Pelagic Scientific Working Groups (SWGs) of the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF). A joint effort is required because the resource is available to multiple fisheries: as directed catch to the midwater trawl fishery and as bycatch to the demersal trawl and pelagic purse-seine fisheries. Management of the resources complicated by differences in the age-structures of the <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> caught in each of these three fisheries. The data available for the assessments are described, including the details of their collection and processing. Four age-structured production models (each reflecting different assumptions about the <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> resource) are fitted to those data using the maximum-likelihood estimation method, and are used to provide assessments. Estimates of the current status of the stock indicate that it is healthy, putting it well above its Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) level. For the directed midwater fishery, MSY is estimated to be in the region of 50 000 - 100 000 tonnes per annum.
