When she questions him about Janet, he swears it is over. It seems there is hope for a reconciling when Peggy looks at Charlie with new eyes and (citing a reference from her grandfather who claimed that her grandmother's strudel kept the family together) says, [...] "I'd like to invite <b>you</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> your house for dinner on Sunday with your kids. I'll make a strudel." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not much! And don't {{you dare}} {{to try to}} break away, for if you do I will hand <b>you</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the first {{policeman}} that appears!" ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a hint of}} reproach in the glance Jessie favoured him with. [...] "Then I think Mrs. Nairn {{might have}} brought <b>you</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, Cousin Jerry!" [...] said he. [...] "I {{was just}} going to invite <b>you</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see what you think of my house inside. Just follow me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Weep not, Harmachis!" [...] she sobbed, {{kneeling}} at my side. [...] "I cannot endure to see thee weep. Oh! why wouldst thou not be warned?

Thou didst hear what that false and tigerish woman said--to-morrow she hands <b>thee</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the murderers!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{the general}} send <b>you</b> <b>over</b> here <b>to</b> tell me that?" [...] the man asked, {{in a certain}} tone of irritation, and Sergeant Corney replied, soothingly: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then I turn <b>you</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Reinhart. Reinhart {{will kill}} you instantly. He thinks you're dead, killed when the Albertine Range was annihilated. If he had any idea I had saved you--" ...|$|E
