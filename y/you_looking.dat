5|$|Many Greek Orthodox populations, {{particularly}} {{those outside the}} newly independent modern Greek state, continued to refer to themselves as Romioi (i.e. Romans, Byzantines) well into the 20th century. Peter Charanis, born {{on the island of}} Lemnos in 1908 and later became a professor of Byzantine history at Rutgers University, recounts that when the island was taken from the Ottomans by Greece in 1912, Greek soldiers were sent to each village and stationed themselves in the public squares. Some of the island children ran to see what Greek soldiers looked like. ‘‘What are <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> at?’’ one of the soldiers asked. ‘‘At Hellenes,’’ the children replied. ‘‘Are you not Hellenes yourselves?’’ the soldier retorted. ‘‘No, we are Romans,’’ the children replied.|$|E

Lyrically, Selena is heartbroken after knocking on her love interest's apartment door (number 512) and mistaking his sister for his girlfriend, before the sister asks [...] "are <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> for my brother?". Italian essayists Gaetano Prampolini and Annamaria Pinazzi called the song a [...] "funny love reversal".|$|E

500|$|After the crash, {{there were}} {{claims that the}} media frenzy around the [...] "bogus" [...] record attempt contributed to the {{accident}} by helping promote the flight and pressuring its schedule. This {{was supported by the}} NTSB, which determined that the pressure induced by the intense media attention was a [...] "contributing factor" [...] in the accident. ABC's Ted Koppel reflected on the media's role in the tragedy on Nightline: [...] "We need to begin by acknowledging our own contribution...We feed one another: those of <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> for publicity and those of us looking for stories." [...] Koppel ended by asking [...] "whether we in the media...by our ravenous attention contribute to this phenomenon", and answered: [...] "We did." ...|$|E
500|$|Robey {{was engaged}} to play the title role in the 1905 {{pantomime}} Queen of Hearts. The show was considered risqué by the theatrical press. In one scene Robey accidentally sat on his crown before bellowing [...] "Assistance! Methinks I have sat upon a hedgehog"; in another sketch, the comedian mused, [...] "Then there's Mrs Simkins, the swank! Many's the squeeze she's had of my blue bag on washing day." [...] Robey scored a further hit with the show the following year, in Birmingham, which Cotes describes as [...] "the most famous of all famous Birmingham Theatre Royal pantomimes". Robey incorporated [...] "The Dresser", a music hall sketch taken from his own repertoire, into the show. Over {{the next few years}} he continued to tour the music hall circuit both in London and the English provinces and recorded two songs, [...] "What Are <b>You</b> <b>Looking</b> at Me For?" [...] and [...] "The Mayor of Mudcumdyke", which were later released by the Gramophone and Typewriter Company.|$|E
500|$|A similar, {{although}} more indepth, {{story of the}} recruitment of Gholston has been told by Wilcher: [...] "He {{was walking down the}} hall with a Bible in his hands," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "He was already built like a grown man; he was all cut up (like a bodybuilder). I asked him, 'Can I help you sir?' He looked around to see who I was talking to. I said, 'Are <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> for a student?' He said, 'No, I go here.' He said he was a freshman. I thought he was lying." [...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house and dragged him back into the program: [...] "I told him I didn't care if he wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to play. My only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E

500|$|Barker's {{material}} {{included the}} sketch {{which came to}} be known as [...] "Four Candles", airing in 1976, although in the original script it was entitled [...] "Annie Finkhouse". It sees a customer (Barker) ask for a series of things in a hardware store. The sketch's humour derives from similarities in word pronunciation, leading to confusion on the part of the store owner (Corbett). These misunderstandings include the confusion between [...] "four candles" [...] and [...] "fork handles". The idea for the sketch came from the owners of a hardware shop in Hayes, Hillingdon who wrote in to The Two Ronnies to describe some of the amusing events and misunderstandings in their store. Barker was never happy with the sketch's final line (a male assistant asking [...] "What sort of billhooks did you want?") and changed it (to a female assistant asking [...] "What sort of knockers were <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> for?") for the stage version of The Two Ronnies, although he was still not totally satisfied with it. Nevertheless, the sketch is considered the show's most famous one and was voted as the show's best in a TV special, while also placing fifth on Channel 4's 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches. The original script, hand-written by Barker, was sold for £48,500 at auction in 2007 after being featured on an episode of Antiques Roadshow the previous year.|$|E
500|$|Other teams, however, {{had more}} serious {{interest}} in signing a black ballplayer. In the mid-1940s, Branch Rickey, club {{president and general}} manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible addition to the Dodgers' roster. Rickey selected Robinson from a list of promising black players and interviewed him for possible assignment to Brooklyn's International League farm club, the Montreal Royals. Rickey was especially interested in making sure his eventual signee could withstand the inevitable racial abuse that would be directed at him. In a famous three-hour exchange on August 28, 1945, Rickey asked Robinson if he could face the racial animus without taking the bait and reacting angrily—a concern given Robinson's prior arguments with law enforcement officials at PJC and in the military. Robinson was aghast: [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> for a Negro who is afraid to fight back?" [...] Rickey replied that he needed a Negro player [...] "with guts enough not to fight back." [...] After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to [...] "turn the other cheek" [...] to racial antagonism, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month, equal to $ today. Rickey did not offer compensation to the Monarchs, instead believing all Negro league players were free agents due to the contracts' not containing a reserve clause. Among those Rickey discussed prospects with was Wendell Smith, writer for the black weekly Pittsburgh Courier, who according to Cleveland Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck [...] "influenced Rickey to take Jack Robinson, for which he's never completely gotten credit." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the time}} that the robot is gone, Antimony meets a {{creature}} called Reynardine, who tries to take over her body but, by accident, instead becomes trapped in the body of a stuffed animal she carries; and becomes subject to her command. Because of her relationship with Reynardine and the events with Coyote and Ysengrin, Antimony is nominated to begin training to become a medium, one of the individuals who moderate disputes between the Wood and the Court and communicates with etheric beings, and she decides to return to the woods to speak with Coyote. When Antimony visits Coyote, she learns that in the past Coyote had travelled across the sea to find Renard (called later Reynardine) and Ysengrin and make them into [...] "powerful being" [...] like himself.Antimony: [...] "Why were <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> for Renard in the first place? [...] Why bring him here?"Coyote: [...] "I sought to make him into a powerful being such as myself!" [...] He had given Ysengrin [...] "power over the trees" [...] and given Reynardine the power to take bodies, but bodies that Reynardine took always died after he left themCoyote: [...] "For some reason, when Renard had the ability , any body he took that was not his own would die when it was used up." [...] and Ysengrin was hardly strong enough to stand without the help of Coyote's tree armor. Reynardine had been in love with Antimony's mother, Surma,Coyote: [...] "I wouldn't be surprised if he cared very deeply about you, ! You see, Renard fell desperately in love with Surma!" [...] and had used his power to steal a young man's body and woo Surma; the man died, however, and Reynardine was imprisoned in Gunnerkrigg Court until the events surrounding his first meeting with Antimony.Coyote: [...] " [...] soon runs away!

2500|$|The first Chinese {{historical}} archive {{also recorded}} that on 4 September 1730 AD (on the lunar calendar), Tian Wenjing, {{governor of the}} Eastern River, fell ill.

Why are <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> all over? Here is your reward.” Imperial records show that Emperor Yongzheng usually rewarded ministers with only 5g of GuilingJi. By rewarding Tian Wenjing with not only 200g, but also the original GuilingJi prescription it showed the emperor highly valued Tian Wenjing.|$|E

2500|$|Petra {{also used}} the record to defuse the backmasking controversy, which had begun to spread into Christian music, as {{conservative}} church leaders accused Christian artists of hiding subliminal messages {{that could only be}} heard when records were played in reverse. Inserting a blatant piece of backmasking in the break between the title track and hard rocker [...] "Judas' Kiss," [...] the band's message was less than subtle. Played in reverse, the backmasked portion stated: [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> for the devil for when you oughta be looking for the Lord?" [...] It was not the first – nor would it be the last – time Petra weighed in against critics of contemporary Christian music.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Christian {{rock group}} Petra {{included}} in their song [...] "Judas Kiss", from the 1982 album More Power to Ya, the message, [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> for the devil for, when {{you ought to}} be looking for the Lord?" [...] Bloodhound Gang's 1996 controversy-begging track [...] "Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)" [...] mocked the Judas Priest controversy directly, and included the backmasked phrase [...] "Devil child, wake up and eat Chef Boyardee Beefaroni". The band Mindless Self Indulgence released a song titled [...] "Backmaskwarning!", which contains the forward lyrics [...] "Play that record backwards / Here's a message yo for the suckas / Play that record backwards / And go fuck yourself".
