500|$|While Windows RT {{functions}} {{similarly to}} Windows 8, {{there are still}} some notable differences, primarily involving software and hardware compatibility. Julie Larson-Green, then {{executive vice president of the}} Devices and Studios group at Microsoft, explained that Windows RT was ultimately designed to provide a [...] "closed, turnkey" [...] user experience, [...] "where it doesn't have all the flexibility of Windows, but it has the power of Office and then all the new style applications. So you could give it to <b>your</b> <b>kid</b> and he's not going to load it up with a bunch of toolbars accidentally out of Internet Explorer and then come to you later and say, 'why am I getting all these pop-ups?' It just isn't capable of doing that by design." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben Ratliff of The New York Times said Cyrus' {{attempt to}} leave Hannah Montana was weak, only {{being driven by}} [...] "more gray thoughts". Ratliff continued, [...] "She eases up on songs with total-affirmation chants about being the captain of her ship ... The lyrics are half-terrible — almost too {{realistic}} as teenage thoughts — but {{the best of them}} transmit the desired message ... It’s a lackluster album, floated by two or three strong singles." [...] Josh Timmermann of PopMatters believed Breakout was [...] "a just-okay teenpop record with audible suggestions of said singer-songwriter aspirations. To be sure, it’s a stronger collection of songs than Moms and Dads with upturned noses ... would probably expect." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine rated the album two and half stars out of five, being disappointed and deeming the songs not to be a [...] "worthy follow-up" [...] to [...] "See You Again". Cinquemani finished, [...] "For teen-pop, <b>your</b> <b>kid</b> could do worse. You know, like Avril [...] ". Mordechai Shinefield of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "If her lyrical prowess hasn't caught up to her voice yet, that should only hold promise of things to come. She's a rare talent; now she only has to survive until adulthood." [...] Ash Dosanjh of Yahoo! Music gave Breakout seven stars out of ten and referred to Cyrus, in Breakout, as the ideal of the American Dream: [...] "a combination of hard work, good Christian living and un-smutty pop".|$|E

2500|$|Legacy admissions {{have had}} a history of controversy; {{economist}} Peter Sacks criticized the practice of legacy admissions as a [...] "social reproduction process" [...] in which [...] "elite institutions have an implicit bargain with their alumni ... 'You give us money, and we will move <b>your</b> <b>kid</b> {{to the front of the}} line.'" [...] Another agreed that legacies perpetuated a [...] "hereditary aristocracy". But an opposing view is that all colleges, to varying extents, make choices as part of the admissions process, including state schools that charge in-state residents (with taxpaying parents) a lower rate than out-of-state residents, and it was argued that there was not really much difference between taxpaying parents contributing to a state school as well as generous alumni contributing to a private school—both with the possibility that it will help their offspring get into college. Consultant Donald Dunbar suggested that admitting legacies encourages future donations, and in turn these incoming money flows help the school subsidize the education of more minority students; another source suggested that alumni gifts was important in helping a college pay for need-blind programs. Legacy admissions was criticized by Daniel Golden in his book The Price of Admission in which elite schools gave [...] "heavy preferences to the wealthy", according to essayist Neal Gabler in the Boston Globe.|$|E

6000|$|Ellen Jorth {{approached}} her home slowly, with dragging, reluctant steps; and never {{before in the}} three unhappy years of her existence there had the ranch seemed so bare, so uncared for, so repugnant to her. As she had seen herself with clarified eyes, so now she saw her home. The cabin that Ellen lived in with {{her father was a}} single-room structure with one door and no windows. It was about twenty feet square. The huge, ragged, stone chimney had been built on the outside, with the wide open fireplace set inside the logs. Smoke was rising from the chimney. As Ellen halted at the door and began unpacking her burro she heard the loud, lazy laughter of men. An adjoining log cabin had been built in two sections, with a wide roofed hall or space between them. The door in each cabin faced the other, and there was a tall man standing in one. Ellen recognized Daggs, a neighbor sheepman, who evidently spent more time with her father than at his own home, wherever that was. Ellen had never seen it. She heard this man drawl, [...] "Jorth, heah's <b>your</b> <b>kid</b> come home." ...|$|E
