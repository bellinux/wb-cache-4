25|$|One of {{the things}} the movie does best is {{transport}} you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>almost</b> smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.|$|E

Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald noted, [...] "The producer's angular synthesizer crunch is all over it [...] at best on the single 'SexyBack' where they dispense with a chorus, leaving the song sustained by its vocal fireworks, electrofunk and Timberlake's repeated declaration that 'I'm bringing sexy back.

500|$|Like the {{concurrently}} recorded [...] "My Sweet Lord", the album's other [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] betrays {{the influence}} of co-producer Phil Spector {{more so than the}} comparatively sedate Version Two. It is also the most extreme example of Harrison's stated intention to allow some of the songs on All Things Must Pass to run longer and feature instrumentation to a greater degree than had been possible {{within the confines of the}} more pop-oriented Beatles approach to recording. [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] (Version One, in its All Things Must Pass context) starts small and builds – [...] "and it builds and it builds", NMEs Alan Smith would soon write. Taping of the backing track took place at Abbey Road Studios on 2 June, and judging by Spector's comments regarding Harrison's early mixes, the orchestral arrangement was not added until late August at the earliest. The first slide-guitar break on the released recording, quite possibly overdubbed some time after the June sessions also, would adopt a near-identical melody to the one Harrison had vocalised when routining the song for the other Beatles on 26 January 1969 – reflecting a quality admired by Elton John in the latter's 2002 tribute to Harrison: [...] "All his solos are very melodic – <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>almost</b> sing his solos." [...] Inglis writes that the effect of Harrison's [...] "elaborate patterns" [...] on slide guitar is to [...] "counterbalance the underlying atmosphere of pessimism with shafts of beauty", similar to the [...] "notes of light and dark" [...] provided by Pete Drake's pedal steel on the song [...] "All Things Must Pass".|$|E

It's the sound of someone [...] who is so driven that they're demented. And the fact that they spent so much time and money on it is so excellent." [...] Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins told Spin, [...] "It's rare in guitar-based music that somebody does something new [...] At the time, everybody was like, 'How the fuck are they doing this?' And, of course, it's way simpler than anybody would imagine." [...] Trey Anastasio of jam band Phish believed that [...] "Loveless [...] the best album recorded in the '90s", and wanted his band to cover the album in its entirety for a Halloween show. Robert Pollard of indie rock band Guided by Voices acknowledged the album as a source of inspiration, noting, [...] "Sometimes when I want to write lyrics, I'll listen to Loveless.

Brian Hiatt from Rolling Stone marked the track as [...] "one of the most arresting moments" [...] on the album and described it as an [...] "anguished, sixties-tinged ballad". Spence Abbott of IGN also noted track as a stand out alongside [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and observed that [...] " [...] track goes straight for Aretha Franklin-inspired territory, with Beyoncé actually getting gritty and dropping her high octave range down a few pegs to get guttural and downright Old School soulful". Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the [...] "agitated goodbye" [...] builds a different kind of overwrought drama. Steve Jones of USA Today the song showcases Beyoncé's [...] "maturing vocal chops," [...] describing the song as spare and gritty. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song would have been better if performed by a trio of [...] "talented" [...] vocalists, such as Destiny's Child, rather than Beyoncé by herself. Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra felt that [...] "Doubters of Beyoncé's immense talent need only give one listen to this track [...] from 2006's B'Day.
