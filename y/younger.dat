5|$|In 1540 Montejo the Elder, {{who was now}} in {{his late}} 60s, turned his royal rights to {{colonise}} Yucatán over to his son, Francisco Montejo the <b>Younger.</b> In early 1541 Montejo the <b>Younger</b> joined his cousin in Champton; he did not remain there long, and quickly moved his forces to Campeche. Once there Montejo the <b>Younger,</b> commanding between three and four hundred Spanish soldiers, established the first permanent Spanish town council in the Yucatán Peninsula. Shortly afterwards, Montejo the <b>Younger</b> summoned the local Maya lords and commanded them {{to submit to the}} Spanish Crown. A number of lords submitted peacefully, including the ruler of the Xiu Maya. The lord of the Canul Maya refused to submit and Montejo the <b>Younger</b> sent his cousin against them (also called Francisco de Montejo); Montejo the <b>Younger</b> remained in Campeche awaiting reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|The best attested sibling of Heraclius the <b>Younger</b> {{was arguably}} Theodore. Maria, sister of Heraclius the <b>Younger,</b> is {{mentioned}} by Nikephoros I and identified as mother of Martina, whom Heraclius the <b>Younger</b> {{would go on}} to marry. It should be noted, however, that both Kedrenos and Michael the Syrian consider Martina to have been a daughter of an unnamed brother of Heraclius the <b>Younger,</b> thus casting some doubt on the precise relation. Finally, Theophanes briefly mentions another Gregoras as a brother of Heraclius the <b>Younger</b> {{on the occasion of the}} former's death at Heliopolis (modern Baalbek) circa 652/653. This is the only mention of this sibling. Theophanes, however, might have misunderstood the relation between Gregoras and the emperor.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} attribution to Droeshout the <b>younger</b> {{can also}} be supported on stylistic grounds. A drawing known to be by Droeshout the elder appears to show superior artistic skill than {{the work of his}} nephew, and the clumsy features of the depiction of Shakespeare's body resemble other prints by Droeshout the <b>Younger.</b> The attribution to the <b>younger</b> artist is provisionally accepted by the National Portrait Gallery.|$|E

5|$|At Campeche, {{a strong}} Maya force {{attacked}} the city, but was repulsed by the Spanish. Aj Canul, {{the lord of}} the attacking Maya, surrendered to the Spanish. After this battle, the <b>younger</b> Francisco de Montejo was despatched to the northern Cupul province, where the lord Naabon Cupul reluctantly allowed him to found the Spanish town of Ciudad Real at Chichen Itza. Montejo parcelled out the province amongst his soldiers as encomiendas. After six months of Spanish rule, Naabon Cupul was killed during a failed attempt to kill Montejo the <b>Younger.</b> The death of their lord only served to inflame Cupul anger and, in mid 1533, they laid siege to the small Spanish garrison at Chichen Itza. Montejo the <b>Younger</b> abandoned Ciudad Real by night, and he and his men fled west, where the Chel, Pech and Xiu provinces remained obedient to Spanish rule. Montejo the <b>Younger</b> was received in friendship by {{the lord of the}} Chel province. In the spring of 1534 he rejoined his father in the Chakan province at Dzikabal, (near modern Mérida).|$|E
