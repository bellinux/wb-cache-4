This partially-blind, controlled, randomized trial (NCT 00541970) evaluated 2 -dose (2 D) schedules using the licensed 20 / 20 F or an alternative formulation containing 40 µg of each antigen (40 / 40 F), compared with the licensed 3 D schedule. Healthy females stratified by age (9 – 14, 15 – 19, 20 – 25 y) were randomized to receive 2 doses of 20 / 20 F at Months (M) 0, 6 (n = 240), 40 / 40 F at M 0, 6 (n = 241) or 40 / 40 F at M 0, 2 (n = 240), or 3 doses of 20 / 20 F at M 0, 1, 6 (licensed schedule/formulation, n = 239).

In the present study we examined to what extent job advertisements are formulated in a gender-fair way and how this correlates with factors such as language, culture as well as status and gender-typicality of the job advertised. The data consisted of job advertisements published online in four European countries which occupy different positions in socio-economic rankings of gender equality (World Economic Forum, 2011) : Switzerland (10), Austria (rank 34), Poland (42), and Czech Republic (75). We randomly selected 100 job advertisements from four lines of business characterized by different proportions of female employees – steels/metals, science, restaurants/food services, and health care. The advertisements were analyzed with regard to the linguistic form of the job title and the remaining text; we also noted indicators of job status, reference to gender-typical traits, pictures of women/men and other information which might be relevant to the use of gender-fair language (e. g., equal opportunity policies). A first analysis of the data indicates that the phrasing of job titles is closely related to the gender-typicality of a profession. While mainly gender-fair forms are used in healthcare, masculine forms are used more often in the domain of steels and metals. Feminine forms only, however, are almost never used.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a methodology {{for the design}} of helicopter rotors with improved brownout char-acteristics. A brownout metric is introduced, based on the density of the sediment cloud in the field of view of the pilot. The metric becomes the objective function of a procedure in which blade chord, rotor radius, and blade twist rate are optimized to minimize brownout in a representative landing ma-neuver. The analysis includes a free-vortex wake model and simulates the dynamics of the sediment particles immersed in the rotor downwash. The results show that the optimized configurations have im-proved visibility within 2 – 3 rotor radii from the pilot, as desired, because the rotor generates increased groundwash that pushes the dust cloud away from the pilot. The clouds, however, do not necessarily become smaller or less dense further away from the pilot’s field of view. Simple polynomial expres-sions are provided that quantify brownout mitigation in terms of rotor design parameters, within the assumptions used in the derivation, and can be used in preliminary design applications.

The compressional behavior of Okra gum matrices prepared by direct compression and wet granulations is analyzed using density measurements, Heckel and Kawakita analysis while the mechanical properties of the formulations were assessed using crushing strength (CS) and friability (FR) as well as CSFR ratio. Formulations prepared by direct compression had lower P k values than those prepared by wet granulation while {{there was no significant}} difference between P <b>y</b> values of <b>formulations</b> prepared by direct compression and wet granulations. Therefore, formulations prepared by direct compression underwent plastic deformation more easily and rapidly than those prepared by wet granulation. The results show that D B values increased with decrease in concentration of the gum and granules undergo higher degree of fragmentation than powders. Formulations containing 90 % w/w Okra gum exhibited the highest amount of total plastic deformation and gave the best packing. Tablets prepared by direct compression showed lower bond strength and higher friability values than those prepared by wet granulations. The crushing strength generally decreases with a decrease in the concentration of the gum while there was an inverse relationship between friability and gum concentration. CSFR decreases with a decrease in gum concentration and tablets prepared by wet granulations showed significantly higher values of CSFR (p < 0. 001) than those prepared by direct compression. The results suggest that the concentration of gum and the method of preparation of materials for compression are critical factors in the formulation of Okra gum matrices with acceptable compressional and mechanical properties. </span...|$|R
40|$|One {{approach}} to motion compensation in reconstruction from emission data is {{to modify the}} existing data to approximate, as best we can, what the data {{would have been had}} the detected motions not occurred and then to process that modified data vector y in the usual way, using the <b>formulation</b> <b>y</b> = Px. Here the matrix P contains the probabilities associated with the motion-free case. Here we suggest a different approach, appropriate for non-rigid motion, {{in which there is no}} modification of the data. The problem again has the form y = Px, but now it is the matrix P that depends on the motion. The main points are: 1) how we process the data does not depend on when the data was recorded or on where the patient was at the time the data was recorded; 2) all the motion information is contained in the probabilities in P, which depend only on how long the patient was in a given position and not on when that happened; 3) the matrix P is a time-weighted average of the projection matrices pertaining to a single motion-free period, so it is likely that great accuracy in specifying each of these individual matrices is not crucial; detailed non-rigid motion models may then not be necessary. The discussion here is an amplification of [1]. The idea of using the time-averaged projection matrix also occurs in [2]. A similar approach has recently been announced in [3]. 1 The Goal The objective in emission tomography is to estimate, at least approximately, the spatial distribution of radionuclide within the patient. When there is no patient motion, this distribution is static, with respect to the fixed ambient space of the room, and can then be described by a nonnegative function f(s) of the continuous two- or three-dimensional spatial variable s, scaled so that, for a given region A, 1 the integral A f(s) ds is the expected number of emissions within A during the scan. When there is patient motion, the distribution changes over time, with respect to the fixed ambient space of the room, and is best described as a spatio-temporal function f(s, t). Our goal, in the case of motion, is to estimate, at least approximately, the function f(s, 0). ...|$|R

40|$|Institutions {{play a very}} {{important}} role in our lives. Many of our daily activities are institutional. Think of going to the office, giving a lecture, standing in line for lunch, paying for it, and attending a seminar. All of these are institutional phenomena. The underlying institutions structure our behaviour. They are social arrangements that often make our lives easier, and sometimes more difficult: they facilitate and obstruct; they enable and constrain. Institutional phenomena, however, are not exhausted by activities. They also involve, among others, objects, persons, events, and relations. Think of driver’s licences, presidents, declarations of war, and marriages. These examples reveal that institutional phenomena are very diverse. Institutions do not just structure our behaviour. They also shape our environment in many other ways. There would not be any traffic lights, mailboxes, psychiatrists, or bachelor parties, {{if it were not for}} our institutions. Institutions are often regarded as rules, and it is easy to see why. The fact that institutions structure our behaviour implies that each institution has a characteristic pattern of behaviour associated with it. Most people stop for traffic lights, use money when they are in a shop, and are silent when a professor gives a lecture. Conceptualising institutions as rules has as an advantage that this fact about institutions is readily explained. If the people involved in an institution follow the relevant rule, a pattern of behaviour ensues. Take the rule that you need a driver’s licence in order to be allowed to drive a car. This rule can be appealed to for explaining the correlation between driving a car and having a driver’s licence. Many people let their behaviour be guided by institutions, or – what might be the same – by rules, and this provides at least a partial explanation for the regularities we can observe in institutional reality. But there is more to institutional reality than patterns of behaviour. There is an important conceptual dimension to institutions as well. We conceptualise certain actions as getting married, we take certain objects to be driver’s licenses or money, and we regard certain people as presidents or police officers. And it seems plausible to say that the objects and persons really have that character at least in part because of that. This conceptual dimension of institutions plays an important role in the work of philosophers such as Wittgenstein, Rawls, Searle, and Tuomela. It is the hypothesis of this thesis that this conceptual dimension can also be accounted for in terms of rules. The notion of a constitutive rule, which plays an especially prominent role in the work of Searle, might be of help in this regard. Constitutive rules are, or our acceptance of such rules is, constitutive of the institutional phenomena to which they pertain. This implies that these phenomena would not have their institutional character if it were not for the underlying constitutive rules. Our conceptualisations of them as institutional phenomena involve these rules. The core question of this thesis is how the notion of a constitutive rule can further our understanding of institutions. The point of departure for answering it is Searle’s theory of constitutive rules. Searle’s theory of constitutive rules is the most developed theory available. Searle claims that the form, or syntax as I prefer to call it, of a constitutive rule is ‘X counts as Y in C’. A particular kind of piece of paper, for instance, counts as a driver’s licence in the Netherlands. The idea is that we impose institutional concepts such as that of a driver’s licence on other phenomena such as a piece of paper. The intuition that underlies Searle’s theory is that the way we conceptualise institutional reality matters for the way the world is. This intuition will be retained. We will find, however, that Searle’s theory is deficient in other respects. It provides some useful insights for accounting for the institutional character that many actions, objects, persons, events, and relations have. Nevertheless, we will see that the theory is underdeveloped in that respect. The main deficiency of Searle’s theory, however, is that the behavioural dimension of institutions is not integrated in his conception of constitutive rules, or so I will argue. The main contribution of this thesis is a proposal for a new theory of constitutive rules. This theory accounts for both the conceptual and the behavioural dimension that many institutional phenomena have. 1. 11. 11. 11. 1 RulesRulesRulesRules aaaannnnd Id Id Id Innnnssssttttititititutionutionutionutionssss 1. 1. 1 The XYZ-Conception of Constitutive Rules Someone who is familiar with Searle’s conception of constitutive rules might be surprised by my claim that it does not properly account for Introduction the behavioural dimension of institutions. After all, many of the examples that he gives concern institutional actions. Uttering certain words in a particular kind of setting counts as making a promise on his view. Similarly, going through a certain kind of ceremony counts as getting married. Finally, handing over a piece of paper in a bakery and receiving a loaf of bread in return counts as buying a loaf of bread. These examples, however, do not get to the core of the behavioural dimension of institutions. Consider buying a loaf of bread. Let us pretend for the moment that there is a single constitutive rule for buying bread and that the description of the example provides the correct formulation of that rule (in practice, buying items of a particular kind can be accounted for in more general constitutive rules concerning, among others, money, property, and bakeries). This rule then accounts for the character that handing over some money has in certain circumstances, i. e. that of buying something. It does not, however, account for the consequences of that action. Buying a loaf of bread gives one the right to use it as one sees fit. Similarly for driver’s licenses. The rule that certain pieces of paper count as driver’s licenses in the Netherlands may account for the fact that these pieces of paper are indeed driver’s licenses. The central feature of institutional phenomena such as this one, however, is that they structure our behaviour. Driver’s licenses do so because having a driver’s licence is a prerequisite for being permitted to drive a car. Even though Searle has said some things about rights and obligations (and functions as we will see shortly) involved in institutions, he has not integrated them in his theory of constitutive rules. The main task that I have set myself in this thesis is to do just this. In chapter 6, I present my theory of constitutive rules, which I call the XYZ-conception of constitutive rules. The X and the Y of ‘XYZ’ are the X and the <b>Y</b> of Searle’s <b>formulation</b> of the syntax of constitutive rules. In order to see what I add to Searle’s theory, let me first say a bit more about his ideas. Searle holds that, if something is Y it has a certain status. In other words, Y-terms are status terms. A status is the set of properties an entity has due to the fact that the entity occurs in an institutional setting. It only has that status if we consider it to have that status, or if we count it as having that status. More specifically, having that status depends on human agreement or collective acceptance. ‘Money’ is an example of a status term. What is crucial to the existence of money is that we, for instance, count certain pieces of paper or certain pieces of metal as money or collectively accept them as such. The X-term specifies what kind of entity or entities instantiate a status. When objects are concerned, a particular X-term characterises the material of which a particular status is made of. In case of our example this is a particular kind of piece of paper or a piece of metal. I add a third ingredient to this theory represented by Z-terms. Such terms represent the behavioural dimension of institutional phenomena. The behavioural dimension of money is its function. Money is a means of exchange, and, hence, particular instances of money can be used for buying and selling (I assume for simplicity that means of exchange is the only function of money). The behavioural dimension of a driver’s licence consists of an institutional right: having a driver’s licence provides one the right to drive a car. ‘Means of exchange’ and ‘being permitted to drive a car’ are examples of Z-terms. As a rough and ready indication, this is how Z-terms figure in the XYZ-conception of constitutive rules: what it means to be a Y is to be a Z. The idea is that institutional statuses can be defined in terms of the practical import they have. ‘Money is a means of exchange’, and ‘Driver’s licences give one the permission to drive a car’ should be seen as definitions of status terms. So, I agree with Searle that Y is a status and X the stuff it is made of. But I then go on to say that Z is the behavioural dimension of statuses or Ys. I call statements of the form ‘To be a Y is to be a Z’ or just ‘Y is Z’ status rules, and such rules define status terms. The XYZ-conception of constitutive rules accommodates both the insight that a certain kind of stuff (e. g. paper) has a particular kind of status (e. g. money), and the idea that having the relevant status has behavioural implications (e. g. the stuff can be used for buying and selling). It contains both statements akin to ‘X counts as Y in C’ and statements the syntax of which is ‘Y is Z’. Postponing the details of this theory to chapter 6 let me here just present the main conclusion of that chapter: the XYZ-conception of constitutive rules integrates the conceptual and the behavioural dimension of many institutional phenomena (I say ‘many’ because I will argue below that, pace Searle, not all institutional phenomena involve constitutive rules). This conclusion provides the basis for an answer to the core question of this thesis. Recall that this question was how the notion of a constitutive rule can further our understanding of institutions. Given the conclusion of chapter 6 just mentioned, we can now say the following: T 1. The XYZ-conception of constitutive rules furthers our understanding of institutions by revealing how their conceptual and behavioural dimensions (can) relate to one another. Introduction This is the first central claim of this thesis. Chapter 6 presents the XYZ­conception in more detail...|$|R
