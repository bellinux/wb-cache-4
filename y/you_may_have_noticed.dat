A defining characteristic of the design methodology at play in this thesis is the recombinant effects of disparate parts. In other words, sometimes crazy different things work great together! The author/narrator wishes you the opportunity to actively engage in this process. To read the book in sequence, simply match top page numbers with the same bottom page numbers and read as though there was no divide at all. Or, for a more dynamic and participatory experience, match different top and bottom pages, and you might find something interesting! Sometimes not. But sometimes yes. More on bottom-page 3.

One sweet {{instance}} of such simple conception, {{in the end}} of the Odyssey, must surely recur to your minds in connection with our subject of to-day, but <b>you</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> the recurrent manner in which Homer insists on the thought. When Ulysses first bends and strings his bow, the vibration of the chord is shrill, [...] "like the note of a swallow." [...] A poor and unwarlike simile, it seems! But in the next book, when Ulysses stands with his bow lifted, and Telemachus has brought the lances, and laid them at his feet, and Athena comes to his side to encourage him,--do you recollect the gist of her speech? [...] "You fought," [...] she says, [...] "nine years for the sake of Helen, and for another's house:--now, returned, after all those wanderings, and under your own roof, for it, and its treasures, will you not fight, then?"

This seal Houman showed to the Treasurer whereon they produced the gold that was weighed in the scales against me, and to others when he ordered the boat to be prepared for you to lie in.

There is a very clear and conclusive combination of evidence against Thomas Burton Brown, otherwise myself. But there is one peculiarity about that evidence, which <b>you</b> <b>may</b> perhaps <b>have</b> <b>noticed.</b> It all comes ultimately from one source, and that a rather unusual one. Thus, the woodcutter says I had his ax, but what makes him think so? He says I told him I had his ax; that I told him so again and again. Once more, Mr. Paynter here pulled up the ax out of the well; but how? I think Mr. Paynter will testify that I brought him the tackle for fishing it up, tackle he might never have got in any other way. Curious, is it not? Again, the ax is found to be wrapped in lint that was in my possession, according to the fisherman. But who showed the lint to the fisherman? I did. Who marked it with large letters as mine? I did. Who wrapped it round the handle at all? I did. Rather a singular thing to do; has anyone ever explained it?" ...|$|R

40|$|How does water boil? As commonplace as {{the event}} is, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> {{all of its}} curious {{features}}. Some of the features are important in industrial applications, while others {{appear to be the}} basis for certain dangerous stunts once per-formed by daredevils in carnival sideshows. Arrange for a pan of tap water to be heated from below by a flame or electric heat source. As the water warms, air molecules are driven out of solution in the water, collecting as tiny bubbles in crevices along {{the bottom of the pan}} (Fig. 1 a). The air bubbles gradually inflate, and then they begin to pinch off from the crevices and rise to the top sur-face of the water (Figs. 1 b – f). As they leave, more air bub-bles form in the crevices and pinch off, until the supply of air in the water is depleted. The formation of air bubbles is a sign that the water is heating but has nothing to do with boiling. Water that is directly exposed to the atmosphere boils at what is sometimes called its normal boiling temperature TS. For example, TS is about 100 C when the air pressure is 1 atm. Since the water at the bottom of your pan is not directly exposed to the atmosphere, it remains liquid even when it superheats above TS by as much as a few degrees. During this process, the water is constantly mixed by con-vection as hot water rises and cooler water descends. If you continue to increase the pan’s temperature, the bottom layer of water begins to vaporize, with water mole-cules gathering in small vapor bubbles in the now dry crev-ices, as the air bubbles do in Fig. 1. This phase of boiling is signaled by pops, pings, and eventually buzzing. The wate...|$|R

40|$|Energy is much in {{the news}} lately. The term 2 ̆ 2 energy 2 ̆ 2 usually refers to the {{inherent}} ability of a material system, such as a person, a flashlight battery, or rocket fuel, to bring about changes in its environment or in itself. Some common sources of energy are the fuel used to heat hot water, the gasoline that propels a car, the dammed water that drives the turbine in a hydroelectric plant, and the spinning yo-yo that can climb up its own string. Inanimate energy sources are of central importance in raising {{the standard of living}} of mankind above the subsistence level. The physicist distinguishes among several types of energy, including kinetic energy (associated with a flying arrow or other moving object), elastic energy (associated with stretched or compressed strings), chemical energy (associated with fuel-oxygen systems or a storage battery), thermal energy (associated with the sun and other objects that are hotter than their surroundings), and nuclear energy. Applications of the energy concept in the science of mechanics, which you are studying now, usually concentrate on kinetic energy, potential energy (to be introduced in the module Conservation of Energy) and work (the transfer of energy by the action of a force. Sometimes the phrase 2 ̆ 2 mechanical energy 2 ̆ 2 is used to refer to the forms of energy of importance in mechanics. When you get on your bicycle, you <b>have</b> undoubtedly <b>noticed</b> that it takes a good deal of effort to get yourself moving rapidly. If you exert yourself very strenuously, you can reach a given speed after a short distance; or you can take it easy and pedal over a longer distance to reach the same speed. In some sense it always takes the same amount of 2 ̆ 2 work 2 ̆ 2 to reach a given speed [...] either a large exertion for a short distance or a small exertion for a long distance. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> that if you are carrying a passenger on your bike, then it takes more 2 ̆ 2 work 2 ̆ 2 to reach the same speed. It turns out that these intuitive relationships among the 2 ̆ 2 work 2 ̆ 2 done on a system, its mass, and changes in its speed can be sharpened into a precise statement, called the work-energy theorem. (One caution, though: the technical definition of work needed for this precise statement is different from its everyday usage and physiologic meanings; e. g., you do no work on a heavy box by merely holding it still.) As you will begin to see in the present module, this relationship between work and mechanical energy gives you a new and powerful tool for the solution of many problems, a tool that is often easier to use than a direct application of Newton 2 ̆ 7 s second law...|$|R
