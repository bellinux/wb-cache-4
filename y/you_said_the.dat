And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> title tag is a ranking signal, but you said that you use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I was just wondering what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search. Help says pretty much the same things, as does Matt Cutts, in one of this [...]|$|E
