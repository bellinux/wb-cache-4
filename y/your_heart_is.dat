500|$|The second verse {{begins with}} {{an example of what}} Harrison biographer Alan Clayson views as the [...] "restricted code" [...] found in the lyrics on much of Extra Texture. Harrison sings, [...] "The speech of flowers excels the flowers of speech / But what's often in <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> the hardest thing to reach" [...] – the second line of which, Allison writes, [...] "is surely [...] talking about his {{inability}} to find God, who for him dwells, above all, inside the human being". Allison suggests that, with the singer describing life as first an [...] "enigma" [...] and then a [...] "mystery", the previous certainties of his faith have disappeared; true to the song title, Allison continues, [...] "Only death will reveal... whether his religious beliefs have been true or false." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Shades of Cool" [...] {{was written}} by Del Rey and Rick Nowels, and {{produced}} by Dan Auerbach. Composed in the key of D minor, the song runs at a moderate slow tempo of 46 beats per minute. It {{was described as a}} waltz instrumented by [...] "slow-burn" [...] bassline, guitar, and string instruments; the track features a guitar solo delivered by Auerbach. [...] Del Rey's vocals span from A3 to B5. Her [...] "operatic" [...] soprano vocals blending with [...] "trademark wailing vibrato" [...] create a ghostly atmosphere on [...] "Shades of Cool". Chris Coplan from Consequence of Sound described the song as [...] "a slow and slightly gloomy ballad." [...] Meanwhile, [...] "Shades of Cool" [...] was characterized as a [...] "seeping, atmospheric" [...] ballad that contrasts the more [...] "pop-savvy swaggering 'West Coast'" [...] by Billboards Colin Stutz. On the single, Del Rey sings about an [...] "unfixable" [...] man: [...] "But you are unfixable / I can’t break through your world / ‘Cause you live in shades of cool / <b>Your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> unbreakable." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the single}} {{received}} favorable reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic chose the song as an album highlight. Echoing this thought, Steve Beebee of rock magazine Kerrang! added that it [...] "develops into a searching, soulful hook, ranging high {{among the best}} material this band has ever recorded." [...] Digital Spys Lewis Corner labelled the recording as a track to consider downloading, further writing that [...] "'My Heart Is Broken' would strongly beg to differ, with a dashing piano riff skittling over growling guitar strums serving as a backdrop for her emotive alto-soprano." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote, [...] "On 'My Heart Is Broken', a gorgeous piano intro rises alongside Lee's vibrant vocal delivery as Will Hunt's airtight drumming propels the tune into another realm." [...] Tom Goodwyn of NME praised [...] "My Heart Is Broken", saying that it [...] "sounds quite {{a lot like a}} Disney ballad, beginning with Amy Lee cooing 'I will wander until the end of time' over a piano line straight off Powers Ballad Vol.12. It gets heavier at the end though, don't worry." [...] Chris Willman of Reuters concluded that the song was [...] "bluntly titled", while The Hollywood Reporters Sophie Schillaci called it a [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] ballad. Describing the song as [...] "fiery", Chad Grischow of IGN noted that in [...] "My Heart Is Broken", [...] "Lee's siren-esque vocals shine, [...] the band takes a few interesting chances late in the album." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe called the single [...] "a banshee howl of defiant, [...] self-lacerating rage." [...] Billboard magazine's Christa Titus wrote that Lee's voice was [...] "powerful and flexible as ever, as heard in her piercing wails on hit-in-waiting 'My Heart Is Broken'." [...] Serene Dominic of The Arizona Republic confessed that, [...] "Really, when <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> broken, you want a song that's as idea driven as 'My Heart is Broken' to carry you through and that's what she [...] delivers." [...] Additionally, Arwa Haider of Metro commented, [...] "Standard romantic rock bluster from Evanescence. Frontwoman Amy Lee still sounds like she’d tear strips off any would-be lothario." ...|$|E

2500|$|After-touch: A feature {{brought in}} the late 1980s (although synthesizers like the CS-80 {{extensively}} used by artists like Vangelis featured after-touch as early as 1977) whereby dynamics are added after the key is hit, allowing the sound to be modulated in some way (such as fade away or return), based upon the amount of pressure applied to the keyboard. [...] For example, in some synth voices, if the key continues to be pressed hard after the initial note has been sounded, the keyboard will add an effect such as vibrato or sustain. After-touch is found on many mid-range and high-range synthesizers, and is an important modulation source on modern keyboards. After-touch is most prevalent in music of {{the mid to late}} 1980s, such as the opening string-pad on Cock Robin's When <b>Your</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Is</b> Weak, which is only possible with the use of after-touch (or one hand on the volume control). After-touch is not normally found on inexpensive, beginner-level home keyboards.|$|E
2500|$|Director Marc Webb has {{described}} the film {{as more of a}} [...] "coming of age" [...] story as opposed to a [...] "rom-com". He stated, [...] "We arrive at a different conclusion, for one thing. Plus, most romantic comedies are more loyal to a formula than to emotional truth. It's about happiness, and learning that you'll find it within yourself, rather than in the big blue eyes of the girl in the cubicle down the hall. I wanted to make an unsentimental movie and an uncynical movie. In my mind, I wanted it to be something you could dance to. That's why we put a parenthesis in the title – it's like a pop song in movie form. It's not a big film. It's not about war or poverty. It's about 500 days in a young guy's relationship, but it's no less deserving of scrutiny. When <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> first broken, it consumes you. And it's an emotion I wanted to make a movie about, before I forgot how it felt".|$|E

[...] Otello hides as Iago and Cassio enter. Cassio says {{he had hoped to}} see Desdemona here, for he wanted to know whether she had been {{successful}} with Otello (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Vieni; l'aula è deserta / [...] "Come, the hall is deserted"). Iago asks him to tell of his adventures with that woman. Cassio asks which woman, and, softly, so that Otello cannot hear, Iago says [...] "Bianca" [...] (the name of Cassio's actual lover). As Cassio laughs about his romantic adventures, Otello assumes he is speaking of Desdemona. In a conversation only partially heard, Cassio seems to be telling Iago that another woman, a secret admirer, left him a handkerchief as a token. At Iago's urging, Cassio produces it, whereupon Iago seizes it—for it is Desdemona's—and holds it out where he knows Otello can see it. He then returns it to Cassio and teases him, while in his hiding place Otello fumes (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Questa è una ragna dove il tuo cuor casca / [...] "This is a spiderweb in which <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> caught").|$|E
