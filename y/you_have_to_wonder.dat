50|$|This enabled Cork {{to build}} {{themselves}} a winning lead {{and hold on}} to survive the best challenges Galway offered. Only the impressive scoring formm of Nevin kept Galway in touch, leaving them four points down at half time, 2-7 to 0-9. Ian O'Riordan wrote in the Irish Times:Lynn Dunlea was simply outstanding at full forward, drilling over nine points, six from frees, and proving once again how games can be won or lost with dependable free-takers. Added to that was the firepower of Irene O'Keeffe, whose two goals {{in the first half}} had Galway constantly playing catch-up afterwards. Last year’s captain, Linda Mellerick, was once again a marvel at midfield and even though she only once made the scoreboard, she created plenty of scores. Considering Mellerick <b>had</b> planned <b>to</b> retire after last season's victory, <b>you</b> just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> where she continues to get her energy and enthusiasm.”Jim O'Sullivan, who described Mellerick’s performance as her “her best ever in the red and white” wrote in the Irish Examiner:This was a victory for grit and determination, a never-say-die attitude that many a male side could copy and an absolute will to win that will set this team apart from all the others. Picture the scene: Cork, who could only manage a four-point (2-7 to 0-9) half time lead after playing with the driving wind and rain, were battling with their backs to the wall and a point in front with four minutes to go, as Galway threw everything at them in search of the winning goal. Yet, the Leesiders found reserves of strength to weather the storm and finish with two match-winning points from Lyn Dunlea to give the county its 19th title, and their second in a row over the westerners.The double goal scorer O'Keeffe said:We always thought that there wouldn't be much more in it than a couple of goals. They kept coming at us alright but our back line was very strong and that made a big difference in the end. Winning again against Galway adds a little extra buzz because they're probably our greatest rivals at the moment.|$|R
