40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{productivity of}} estuarine fisheries worldwide {{is threatened by}} over-fishing, habitat destruction andwater impoundment. In some cases, the natural variability of freshwater inputs {{has been shown to}} affect catchwhen low flows reduce nutrient input and inundated nursery habitats. Historically, the annual commercial catch of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in Queensland has been highly variable for reasons not fully understood. In conjunction with a life-cycle model, statistical analyses of climate variables and barramundi catch data from the Princess Charlotte Bay area identified several significant relationships. Warm sea surface temperatures, high rainfall, increased freshwater flow and low evaporation (all measures of an extensive and productive nursery habitat) were significantly correlated with barramundi catch 2 years later and suggest that young barramundi survival is enhanced under these conditions.

In 1990 gonadal development was determined and after about 1 year it was re-examined to check if sex ratios had changed. Undifferentiated gonads were seldom found, and were mainly present in the youngest year sample 89 - 1 + (numbers refer to <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> followed by freshwater age), This gonadal stage can develop directly into an ovary. Differentiation of male sex proceeded via an intersexual stage with male and female sex cells. Phenotypic expression of female gonadal sex was considered as being gonochoristic and differentiated. The female gonad gradually developed towards a fourth stage ovary, characterised {{by the presence of}} follicles containing oocytes arrested in the late prophase of meiosis. Yolk formation in oocytes was not observed. The intersexual progression to males was termed pre-maturational sex change. The testes of full grown males contained numerous tubules with spermatogonia in mitotic arrest, The percentage of intersexual eels in 1990 of the youngest year sample (89 - 1 +) was very high (91 %). Most of these animals differentiated into males in 1991 (89 - 2 +). The percentages of undifferentiated and intersexual eels in the older year samples of 1988 and 1987 examined in 1990 were low, showing that sex differentiation in most animals had occurred after 2 - 3 years.

40|$|Scope As is {{the case}} overseas, the wild {{fisheries}} of Australia are under increasing threat from the pressures of over-fishing, habitat destruction and water quality degradation. In addition, inshore fisheries that are dependant on freshwater flows to provide nutrient pulses and nursery habitats are also affected by changes in natural flow regimes {{as a result of}} water impoundment and extraction (Robins, Halliday et al. 2005). The barramundi (Lates calcarifer) is an important commercial fish species in Australia worth 8. 8 million in 2004 / 05 (ABARE 2006), and supports valuable tourism and recreational fishing industries. Commercial catch displays a high degree of inter-annual variation; a characteristic that many fishers believe is the result of climate variability. However, apart from rainfall and freshwater flow, previous studies of the barramundi have not examined the impacts from climate in any detail, and existing management strategies do not consider natural climate variability or climate change. This study examined the effects from long-term (biannual to decadal) and short-term (inter-annual) climate variability, extreme and threshold climate events, and anthropogenic climate, change on the commercial catch of wild barramundi in north-east Queensland. The possibility of incorporating climate parameters into the management of the fishery was also examined. Methods A life cycle model of the barramundi was developed to link climate parameters with the complex developmental stages of the species from spawning in the estuary through maturation in freshwater rivers. Fisheries and climate data were extracted {{from a variety of sources}} and compiled for analysis. A gamma distributed logarithm link function model was constructed to calculate total freshwater flow for those years when records were incomplete. Correlation analysis identified significant relationships between climate parameters and catch, and forward stepwise ridge regression was used to develop a model of barramundi catch using climate parameters as predictors. The impact of threshold events was determined by non-linear analysis and the effects of extreme events on barramundi habitat were qualified against MODIS satellite imagery. A selection of climate change scenarios from a range of global climate models (GCMs), were run through the predictive model developed to determine the likely impacts of future anthropogenic climate change on the fishery. Results In the near-pristine Princess Charlotte Bay area, warm sea surface temperatures, high rainfall, increased freshwater flow and low evaporation (all measures of an extensive and productive nursery habitat) were significantly correlated with barramundi catch two years later as recorded by the CFISH logbook system. These results suggest that early barramundi survival is enhanced in these conditions. Catchability was significantly increased after high freshwater flow and rainfall events in the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch,</b> a result that reinforced previous observations that mature fish in freshwater habitats are flushed into the commercial estuarine fishery. October – December rainfall and April – June flow showed non-linear asymptotic relationships and annual evaporation a quadratic relationship, with commercial catch two years later. Curves peaked at approximately 325 mm, 245 000 Ml and 2 000 mm respectively, a result that demonstrated that once these hydro-meteorological threshold events occurred, the response from the fishery was reversed and subsequent commercial barramundi catch reduced. A comparative analysis of data from the Fitzroy River area, a catchment and near shore area that has been highly modified by human intervention, showed only increased freshwater flow prior to the wet season enhanced subsequent barramundi catch. This result indicated that the anthropogenic changes to habitat either affected or masked the relationship between other climate variables and barramundi catch in the area. Total long-term barramundi landings as recorded by the Queensland Fish Board for six regions along the north-east coast of Queensland showed a near decadal cycle. Correlation analyses returned significant relationships between catch and the January – March average L-index (a measure of the latitude of the subtropical ridge) two, three and four years prior to catch, and the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO) three and four years prior to catch. These results suggest that each of these cycles affects climate in the north-east Queensland region and subsequent survival of barramundi in the early life cycle stages, and provides an opportunity to estimate catch a number of years in advance. A forward stepwise ridge regression model was built to predict commercial barramundi catch in Princess Charlotte Bay. The model contained July – September rainfall and annual evaporation two years prior to catch and explained 62...|$|E
40|$|Quality {{control of}} data {{collections}} {{is an issue}} of primary importance in conducting science and this is no different for surveys intended to monitor changes in fish abundance. Essentially, quality control {{is the responsibility of the}} national institutes conducting the surveys. However, if the national data are combined in a common international data base, as is the case with DATRAS, the consistency of the data submitted engages an international dimension, because the reliability of any comprehensive analysis of changes in the fish community at large that could serve as the basis for ICES advice depends on the reliability of the species identifications in all national subsets. Many of the surveys that are routinely carried out jointly under the auspices of ICES have a long history during which the primary objectives have changed. Thus, the IBTS started as a Young Herring Survey, was then transformed in a Young Fish Survey to obtain recruitment estimates of commercial species, and became only a general monitoring survey of the entire fish community at a later stage. Despite these changes in general objectives, the emphasis in data use is still largely focused on the commercial species that are relatively easy to identify. Although measurement errors and punching errors for this group may have entered the data base, as evident from unrealistically small or large individuals reported in some cases, it seems generally safe to conclude that, in view of the large amount of detailed data collected for these species, these could lead only to minor and negligible distortions in the analyses. However, when it comes to the less common species, studies of the IBTS component in the past have proven major inconsistencies in species identification in the data set that has been entered in DATRAS. This problem is not restricted to a single or a few countries, but affects all countries, although the species involved may differ. This suggests that it is a direct consequence of the large number of people involved in data collection on board and of a generic lack of good taxonomic knowledge among the scientific staff at large that inhibits the maintenance of enough quality control. The problems identified in the past have been the direct reason for holding this one-off workshop to discuss the various aspects of identifying inconsistencies and correcting species identifications in historic data sets and of ensuring correct species identification in future data collections. Taxonomic quality control is a complex issue, because the problems vary by region depending on the species that may be encountered and therefore may require specific approaches regionally. Moreover, the ultimate responsibility for introducing specific protocols for quality control rests with the survey working groups responsible for data collection rather than that the appropriate procedures can be prescribed by others. Therefore, the aim of the workshop has been to provide generic guidelines for development of suitable protocols by the survey working groups rather than to come up with a final answer. It must be emphasized that so far progress in identifying inconsistencies in reporting of various taxa has been restricted to the IBTS component of DATRAS, which covers the North Sea, Skagerak and Kattegat. For all other surveys, similar analyses have not yet been conducted, but there is no reason to assume that the situation would be any different. Following the Terms of Reference, the report is split in four sections that deal with each of these respectively. Section 3 deals with ToR a) : “Identify and correct taxonomic mis-identifications and input errors in DATRAS”. Obviously, this ultimate goal was beyond reach during a three-day workshop, and a lot more work needs to be done. This section lists dubious species, inconsistent information provided regarding taxonomic level reported, maximum attainable size and area of distribution, and examples of inconsistent information reported for some problematic taxa. The information given is restricted to the IBTS component of DATRAS, but should not be interpreted as a comprehensive analysis of all inconsistencies that may be 2 | ICES WKTQD Report 2007 present in this data set. Rather, it highlights methodical aspects as to how inconsistencies may be elucidated. Section 4 deals with ToR b) : ”Development of protocols for ensuring the appropriate treatment of data reported at higher taxonomic levels”. Historically, different countries have reported variously species at different taxonomic levels (genus or families). Also, uncertain species records may have to be adjusted by using a higher taxonomic level. As a consequence, subsequent community analyses may require that these higher taxa are split into its constituting species based on identifications considered reliable. Because there are various ways to do such computations depending on the assumptions made, different analyses could give different answers. From an ICES perspective, some consistency in the approaches used by different working groups would seem appropriate. This section provides the essentials of an appropriate algorithm based on using length frequencies, area of distribution and <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch,</b> that could serve as a first guideline for comprehensive community analyses as well as for trend analysis of individual species. Section 5 deals with ToR c) : “Develop improved protocols to ensure that species identification in trawl surveys is appropriate for fish community studies, including the development of photo-ID keys for nations participating in surveys”. Various initiatives have been taken by individual countries to develop appropriate tools for species identification, including training courses. This section lists a number of ways by which future data collections may be improved or by which species identification can be ascertained at a later stage in the process. Finally, section 6 deals with ToR d). “Develop protocols for (i) improving quality control during the submission of data to DATRAS and (ii) the future checking and quality assurance of DATRAS data. This ToR relates to the important aspect of the responsibility of ICES for ensuring that all taxonomic data in DATRAS are correct or, if they are dubious but cannot be corrected, that the information provided to external users is properly identified as being of a dubious nature. The section describes a warning system that should be developed at the submission stage of new data so as to inform each country that the data submitted contain information that is inconsistent with what is known about the biology of the species and therefore should be carefully checked. It is also stressed that historic data that cannot be corrected but remain dubious are properly flagged internally and potentially adjusted when made available to external users. Proper taxonomic quality control will remain an issue of all monitoring programmes that needs continuous attention and adjustments. We can only hope that this comprehensive description of its many aspects helps the survey working groups to make real progress in achieving an urgently required revision of the historic information provided as well as in improving future data submission...|$|E

This study aimed to evaluate cod catch per unit effort and prey frequency in relation to spatial, temporal and environmental variables. There was substantial spatio-temporal heterogeneity in catches through the time series. The highest catches were generally in the 1930 s and 1940 s, although at some localities more cod were recorded late in the 1950 s. Generalized Additive Models showed that environmental, spatial and temporal variables are all valuable descriptors <b>of</b> cod <b>catches,</b> with the highest occurring from 15 - 45 °E longitude and 73 - 77 °N latitude, at bottom temperatures between 2 and 4 °C and at depths between 150 and 250 m.

Environmental variables were particularly good at describing the importance of capelin and Clupea harengus (herring) in the diet. These new analyses support existing knowledge about how the ecology of the region is controlled by climatic variability.

This study aimed to evaluate cod catch per unit effort and prey frequency in relation to spatial, temporal and environmental variables. There was substantial spatio-temporal heterogeneity in catches through the time series. The highest catches were generally in the 1930 s and 1940 s, although at some localities more cod were recorded late in the 1950 s. Generalized Additive Models showed that environmental, spatial and temporal variables are all valuable descriptors <b>of</b> cod <b>catches,</b> with the highest occurring from 15 - 45 °E longitude and 73 - 77 °N latitude, at bottom temperatures between 2 and 4 °C and at depths between 150 and 250 m. Cod diets were highly variable during the study period, with frequent changes in the relative frequencies of different prey species, particularly Mallotus villosus (capelin). Environmental variables were particularly good at describing the importance of capelin and Clupea harengus (herring) in the diet. These new analyses support existing knowledge about how the ecology of the region is controlled by climatic variability. When viewed in combination with more recent data, these historical relationships will be valuable in forecasting the future of Barents Sea fisheries, and in understanding how environments and ecosystems may respond...|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} of the American Plaice in Div. 3 m was carried out using Integrated Catch at Age (ICA). The {{results indicate that the}} stock has been in a continual decline since 1988. The rate of exploitation has been relatively constant in recent years at levels close to the assumed value of natural mortality. Methods The Integrated catch at Age (ICA, Patterson and Melvin, 1996) stock assessment model was fitted to the stock assessment data set for the American Plaice in NAFO Div. 3 M. The separable model fitted to the last four <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> at age data. The reference age was set at age 7 and after an iterative selection process, model selection at the oldest age was set to 1. 5. The catch at age data for the youngest partially selected ages produced large residuals within the fitted model structure. The youngest ages were therefore down-weighted by setting the relative weighting to 0. 01 for age 3, 0. 1 at age 4 and 0. 5 at age 5 all other ages were assigned a weight of 1. 0. The model was fitted to the cpue data from the EU Div. 3 m survey for the years 1994 - 2001. Data for the years 1988 - 1993 were excluded as they were derived using an average age length key and showed strong positive residuals within the results from exploratory model fits. Result...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} an optimal control {{model of the}} Banana Northern Prawn Fishery, {{one of the most}} important fisheries in Australia. The life cycle of this species involves migration between the sea, where the catch takes place, and the estuary, where post-larvae and juveniles develop. The model combines a stage-matrix population dynamics model and an economic model <b>of</b> sustainable <b>catch.</b> The controls involve the amount of effort allowed and the length of the fishing season. Life stages are defined in terms of prawn size, allowing catch revenue to be adjusted to the expected proportion of specific sized classes caught in a particular month <b>of</b> the <b>year,</b> hence providing a more realistic projection of profits when price is influenced by size. The model is calibrated based on 18 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> detailed <b>catch</b> data. fisheries management, Australia, optimal control, profit maximisation, banana prawns., Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Northeast {{arctic cod}} stock {{is one of}} a most {{valuable}} target of fisheries in the Barents Sea. The <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> cod for the period 1960 - 2014 are widely changed. The minimum level <b>of</b> <b>catches</b> is marked in 1990 (212 thousands ton), and the maximum values <b>of</b> <b>catches</b> were observed in 1969 – 1. 2 mill. ton. In the recent <b>years</b> international <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> cod exceeded 1 mill. ton. Fishable and spawning stock biomass (SSB) also widely changed in this period. According to ICES data, SSB had a minimum in 1965 (102 thousand tons), and extremely high level in 2013 – 2 150 thousand tons. Fishable biomass changed also widely. The maximum level is registered in 2013 – 3 636 thousand tons, and minimum value was 5 times less, 739 thousand tons (1983). The ratio between historical high level <b>of</b> SSB and <b>catch</b> in 2013 was 2. 2 : 1. 0, due to low value of fishing mortality. Possibility to increase catch will be discussed...|$|R

The annual <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> glass eels of the Japanese eel Anguilla japonica highly fluctuates in East Asia, {{which is a great}} risk to the eel aquaculture industry and makes resource management difficult. An analysis of data <b>of</b> the <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> glass eels from 1972 to 2008 in Taiwan indicated that the glass eel catch mainly fluctuates in a cycle of 5 and 6 yr, which matches the dominant reproductive cycle of this species. The peak <b>catch</b> percentage <b>of</b> silver eels in the estuary of the Kaoping River in southwestern Taiwan occurred 1 yr before a glass eel peak catch, implying a possible spawner-recruit relationship. Burst <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> glass eels every 11 yr match periods of maximum solar activity. The annual glass eel catch was not statistically correlated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index, although strong El Niño events seemed to correspond to <b>years</b> <b>of</b> poor <b>catches.</b> Thus, fluctuations in the annual glass eel catch are likely shaped by both the reproductive cycle of the eel and environmental variations such as sunspot cycles and strong El Niño events...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{studies at}} the Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research (RIVO) aim to stimulate the use of {{satellite}} images on board of Dutch freezer-trawlers in the Mauritanian Exclusive Economic Zone (MEEZ). During four research missions (5 - 12 July 2002, 23 - 30 August 2002, 13 - 20 October 2002, and 14 - 23 November 2002) NOAA-AVHRR images of sea surface temperatures (SST) and SeaWifs plankton images were used to locate the fronts at which sardinella, the target species of the Dutch fleet at West Africa, tend to concentrate. These ‘RIVO-images’ are transmitted biweekly with specified annotation to enable easy interpretation. Remote sensing helps locate target species and reduces by-catches associated with ‘random’ trawling. Satellite-derived time series are furthermore applied to analyse apparent spatial shifts of the stock in recent <b>years.</b> Comparison <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> data (size, location) with associated satellite-derived oceanography yields insight into the behaviour and migration patterns of sardinella...|$|R
40|$|A Caribbean fishery {{index is}} used to {{identify}} contrasting environmental conditions in atmosphere and ocean reanalysis fields associated with high- and low-catch years over the period 1971 – 2004. A number of composite features are noted: cooler surface temperatures and warmer, drier weather across the southern half of the Caribbean favors higher catch rates. There is a ridge of elevated sea level on 16 °N. South of the ridge the Caribbean Current is strengthened while north of the ridge anomalous eastward currents flow past the Antilles Islands. The atmospheric Hadley circulation weakens in <b>years</b> <b>of</b> high <b>catch</b> and tropical cyclones are rare. This paper uncovers basin-scale forcing <b>of</b> aggregate fish <b>catch,</b> reflecting a north-south gradient in land-atmosphere hydrology, and composite oceanographic differences based on reanalysis data. In addition, seasonal and interannual cycles of ocean productivity are investigated using satellite ocean color. Summertime upwelling {{along the coast of}} Venezuela joins fresher waters from the North Brazil Current to infuse the Caribbean ecosystem with higher nutrients...|$|R
40|$|A growing push to {{implement}} catch share fishery programs is based {{partly on the}} recognition that they may provide stronger incentives for ecological stewardship than conventional fisheries management. Using data on population status, quota compliance, discard rates, use of habitat-damaging gear, and landings for 15 catch share programs in North America, I tested the hypothesis that catch share systems lead to improved ecological stewardship and status of exploited populations. Impacts <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> share programs were measured through comparisons <b>of</b> fisheries with <b>catch</b> shares to fisheries without catch shares or by comparing fisheries before and after catch shares were implemented. The average levels of most indicators were unaffected by catch share implementation: only discard rate, which declined significantly in catch share fisheries, showed a significant response. However, catch share fisheries were distinguished by markedly reduced interannual variability in all indicators, being statistically significant for exploitation rate, landings, discard rate, and the ratio <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> to catch quotas. These impacts <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> shares were common between nations and ocean basins and were independent of the number <b>of</b> <b>years</b> that <b>catch</b> share programs had been in place. These findings suggest that for the indicators examined, the primary effect <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> shares was greater consistency over time. This enhanced consistency could be beneficial to fishery systems and might also be an indication of more effective management...|$|R
