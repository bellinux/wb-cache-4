500|$|J. P. Davis was {{inspired}} to write the script after observing an older trainer working with a young boxer in a Brooklyn gym: [...] "I watched the guy spar. You could tell he wasn't going anywhere, but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> convince the trainer. He's almost a caretaker. He's watching out for you completely. You could see the devotion involved." [...] Drawing upon material originally created for his critically acclaimed one-man off-Broadway show [...] "Dreamer Awakens," [...] Davis completed the script in 1999 and moved to Los Angeles.|$|E

He played on the traveling team called the Kansas City Red Sox during the summers of 1908 and 1909, going as far west as Wyoming and earning a dollar a day. He was offered a contract by the minor league Kansas City Blues for $135 a month, more money than his father was making. Since young Stengel was underage, his father had to agree, which he did. Louis Stengel recalled, [...] "So I put down my paper and signed. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> change that boy's mind anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Lemon {{retired in}} 1958 with 207 wins, all but ten of them {{occurring}} in a ten-year span. He recorded 274 hits in 1,1883 at-bats (.232), and his 37 career home runs are {{second on the}} all-time career list for pitchers (behind Wes Ferrell's 38). In 1951, Ted Williams had written of Lemon: [...] "I have to rate Lemon {{as one of the}} very best pitchers I ever faced. His ball was always moving, hard, sinking, fast-breaking. [...] <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> really uhmmmph with Lemon". The Indians organization retired Lemon's jersey number, 21, in 1998, making him the sixth Indian to receive the honor.|$|E

500|$|Sayers' {{ability as}} a runner in the open field was {{considered}} unmatched, both during his playing career and since his retirement. Although he possessed modest raw speed—he completed a 100-yard dash in 9.7 seconds—he was highly elusive and had terrific vision, a combination which made him very difficult to tackle. Actor Billy Dee Williams, who portrayed Sayers in the 1971 film Brian's Song, likened his running to [...] "ballet" [...] and [...] "poetry". Mike Ditka, a teammate of Sayers' for two seasons, called him [...] "the greatest player I've ever seen. That's right—the greatest." [...] Another former teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus, famous for his tackling ability, said of Sayers: He had this ability to go full speed, cut and then go full speed again right away. I saw it every day in practice. We played live, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> get a clean shot on Gale. Never.|$|E
500|$|By {{making the}} biopic, Dodd Darin and Spacey {{acknowledged}} the similar career experiences between Darin and Spacey. [...] "A {{lot of people}} doubted my dad's abilities, and Kevin's had doubters and naysayers," [...] Dodd commented. [...] "But both [...] {{were willing to take}} risks, and both were very resilient. My dad would always try new things. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> pin him down. Kevin's career is similar." [...] David Evanier, author of Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin (...) , said [...] "You can put Kevin's obsessiveness about getting the film made right up there with Bobby's obsessiveness. He's also the ideal person to play Bobby. He has an uncanny physical resemblance to him, and he also has Bobby's intensity and dark side. Also, there's the connection with his mother. Bobby's mother's belief in him sent him soaring. Kevin's mother wanted him to make this film. Kevin sees the film as an act of devotion to his mother." ...|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{versions}} of the story featured a sensate from Iraq and more about Whispers, the villain of the show. The show was transformed when the writers decided to limit the storytelling, {{with the exception of}} the opening scene of the first episode, to the perspective of the eight characters. This means that every scene set in San Francisco must be about Nomi, in Chicago about Will and so on. Since the show begins with the characters not knowing what is happening to them and without being able to cut e.g. to the villains like a traditional show, the audience starts with the same questions and confusion as the characters do. As the characters slowly begin to understand more about what's happening to them over the course of several episodes, the audience does as well, at the same pace. Straczynski notes this type of writing wouldn't work if they were writing for a traditional network. [...] "The first episode is written in a way that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> do a pilot. With pilots you have to set up all the rules and explain everything to hook people in," [...] said Stranczynski. Instead, taking advantage of the binge-watching model Netflix promotes, the series was written as a continuous 12-hour movie, making it possible to tell the story at a different pace.|$|E

500|$|The stage play Being Sellers premiered in Australia in 1998, {{three years}} after the release of the {{biography}} by Roger Lewis, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. [...] In 2004, the book was turned into an HBO film with the same title, starring Geoffrey Rush. The play later transferred to New York in December 2010. The Belfast Telegraph notes how the film captured Sellers's [...] "life of drugs, drink, fast cars and lots and lots of beautiful women". Although the film was widely praised by critics, both Lord Snowdon and Britt Ekland were highly critical of the film and the enactment of Sellers; Ekland believed that the film left the audiences with the wrong idea of her former husband, saying [...] "the film leaves you with the impression that Peter Sellers was essentially a likeable man when in reality he was a monster. He may have been a brilliant actor, but as a human being he had no saving graces at all". Snowdon disagreed with Ekland's verdict, and with the film, and stated that Sellers [...] "had a light touch, a sense of humour, I can't bear to see him portrayed as somebody who was apparently without either... The man on the screen is charmless, humourless and boring—the one thing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> say about Peter." ...|$|E
