60|$|PATRICIA. [Turning {{back into}} the room.] <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the truth about yourself. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you were only the Conjurer.|$|E
60|$|ANNYS Geoffrey! [She {{puts her}} arms about him.] <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> anything.|$|E
60|$|MRS. JUNO. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you couldn't fight, Tops. I {{thought you}} were an {{accomplished}} boxer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{allow myself}} to expect anything, dear. I desire you to follow your own feeling. <b>You</b> have <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what that was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, mother, I {{thought as}} you had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{about all the}} beauty places in Thrums, and <b>you</b> ain't <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about the Den." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Was {{that what}} you were {{thinking}} of," [...] Iris said, [...] "when you allowed me to translate English into French for <b>you,</b> and <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the truth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed! <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you {{had hurt}} your back;' and Albinia began {{describing}} the fall, and declaring {{there must be}} a sprain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, grandma, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that story," [...] said Fanny, hurrying in, {{finding the}} {{prospect}} {{was a pleasant}} one for a stormy afternoon.|$|E
6000|$|... "A snake!" [...] she repeated, aghast, [...] "a snake! Oh, Elma! Why, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that. And he coiled round your arm. How horrible!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all, not at all; but <b>you</b> have <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how <b>you</b> got on with Lady Bellamy--that is, {{except what}} she told you about Mr. Heigham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I can't let {{you out of}} my sight. I {{have seen}} you. You have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> your story. You are honest. <b>You</b> have <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> loved me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, Aura, 'tis {{my turn to}} blush!" [...] {{cried the}} Major, comically hiding his face behind Betty's fan. [...] "But all this time <b>you</b> have <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> who was this young spark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a good thing, Phil, {{that you}} knew Mr. Cameron," [...] said Dave, on the way. [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about {{stopping}} a runaway horse for Mrs. Cameron." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] Poirot {{caught me}} violently by the shoulders. [...] "Was Dr. Bauerstein here on Tuesday evening? Here? And <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me?</b> Why {{did you not}} tell me? Why? Why?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Cecil {{lay back}} so white, that Grindstone {{approached}} with some drops, but this made her spring up, crying, [...] "No, no, don't come near me! <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me!</b> You deceived me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Martin," [...] said Foy, {{sitting down}} upon a stool and {{dragging}} off his leather jerkin, [...] "what used {{you to do}} before you turned holy? <b>You</b> have <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all the story. Come now, speak up. I won't tell Adrian." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! hush, hush, Bernard," [...] exclaimed Grisell, who was toiling with aching {{fingers at}} the repairs of her father's greasy old buff coat. [...] "Such things are, as Robin well says, for noble demoiselles with fair faces and leisure times like the Lady Margaret. And oh, Robin, <b>you</b> have <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of the Lady Margaret, my dear mate at Amesbury." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{my money}} alone. Then he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that he was}} engaged to <b>you.</b> He had <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> before, but yet I knew it. It all came out then. Lucy, though he is engaged to you, it is me that he loves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A position!" [...] she cried, betraying the gladness of her {{surprise}} {{in all her}} body, nestling closer to him, pressing his hand, smiling. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me!</b> What is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all this!" [...] she reproached him, as {{they looked}} across the little {{clearing}} and over the descending slopes of woods to the great curving sweep of Sonoma Valley.|$|E
6000|$|... "Came to see you!" [...] exclaimed her brother. [...] "What in {{the world}} did he do that for? <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that you were ailin'. Is it that sprain in your ankle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Told <b>me!</b> <b>You</b> have <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> when <b>you</b> {{have got}} your hair cut, but I have had senses to {{perceive}} it. You have always adored her, ever since I have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together. <b>Told</b> <b>me!</b> Why, {{you have always}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all day long. When you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> your own story, you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> plainly that you began adoring her {{the first time you}} saw her, when you were very young indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{where have}} you been, truant?" [...] Sir William exclaimed as Archie entered the room in the governor's house which had been set apart {{for the use of}} Wallace since the {{expulsion}} of the English. [...] "Sir Robert Gordon has been here several times, and tells me that they have seen nought of you; and although I have made many inquiries I have been able to obtain no news, save that you and your band have disappeared. I even sent to Glen Cairn, thinking that you might have been repairing the damages which the fire, lighted by the Kerrs, did to your hold; but I found not only that you were not there yourself, but that none of your band had returned thither. This made it more mysterious; for had you alone disappeared I should have supposed that you had been following up some love adventure, though, indeed, <b>you</b> have <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that your heart was in any way touched." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Too much of {{yourself}} in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't {{know you were}} so vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who {{looks as if he}} was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you--well, of course you have an intellectual expression, and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say {{when he was a boy}} of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name <b>you</b> have <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some brainless, beautiful creature, who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don't flatter yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him." ...|$|R
60|$|PATRICIA. [Thinking.] Yes, you {{did tell}} {{me a great deal}} of the truth. You told me {{hundreds}} and thousands of truths. But <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the truth that one wants to know.|$|E
6000|$|Clara now recurred {{to these}} {{words of his}} as she sat looking at him through her tears across the breakfast table. [...] "Was that the reason <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about poor Ben before?" ...|$|E
60|$|Miss D. (Capturing her friend's left arm, {{taking away}} all the books, placing books in 'rickshaw, {{returning}} to arm, securing hand by third finger and investigating.) Well! You bad girl! And <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "I was {{not sure}} it was she; <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> her name. When I had divined the fact, I was so soon to see you, that I thought best to keep it till we met." ...|$|E
