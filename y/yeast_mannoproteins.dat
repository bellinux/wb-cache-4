However, this solution not only acts on tartaric acid but also other compounds especially potassium {{which is responsible}} for the formation of insoluble bitartrate and also modifies the organoleptic qualities. However, it does allow a definitive stabilization. Reports of high tartaric stability in white wines matured on lees has led to research in this area. A protein from the hydrolyzate of the <b>yeast</b> (<b>mannoproteins)</b> allows salts of tartar to keep their solubility. The addition of this compound industrially permits a good quality stabilization.

This treatment results in the loss of {{a significant portion of the}} wine itself, as well as aroma compounds important for the quality of white wines. Among other interesting effects on wine quality, <b>yeast</b> cell wall <b>mannoproteins</b> have been shown to stabilize wine against protein haze. A previous work showed that wine yeast strains engineered by deletion of KNR 4 release increased amounts of mannoproteins and produce wines showing attenuated responses in protein haze tests. This paper describes the technological properties of several new recombinant wine yeast strains, deleted for genes involved in cell-wall biogenesis, as well as the regulatory gene KNR 4. Stabilization of wines produced by three of the six recombinant strains analyzed required 20 − 40 % less bentonite than those made with their nonrecombinant counterparts.

Purified HvPR 5 c interacted with insoluble (1, 3) -β-D-glucans, but not with cellulose, pustulan, xylan, chitin or a <b>yeast</b> <b>mannoprotein.</b> Tight binding was observed with unbranched and unsubstituted (1, 3) -β-D-glucans, and weaker binding was seen if (1, 6) -β-linked branch points or β-glucosyl substituents were present in the substrate. The HvPR 5 b protein interacted weakly with insoluble (1, 3) -β-D-glucans and did not bind to any of the other polysaccharides tested. This indicated that only specific barley PR 5 isoforms interact tightly with (1, 3) -β-D-glucans. The complete primary structures of HvPR 5 b and HvPR 5 c were determined and used to construct molecular models of HvPR 5 b and HvPR 5 c, based on known three-dimensional structures of related thaumatin-like proteins.

The most effective treatments in the reduction of the concentration of volatile phenols were the addition of fine lees, cream and potassium caseinate. Apart from being able to partially remove these compounds (approximately 35 % removal), fine lees contributed to a greater “freshness” and complexity of the wines. Although the addition of cream did decrease the sensory impact of volatile phenols, it did not benefit the wines as these were strongly marked by dairy aromas.

40|$|Slow {{denaturation}} of wine proteins {{is thought}} to lead to protein aggregation, flocculation into a hazy suspension and formation of precipitates. The majority of wine proteins responsible for haze are grapederived, have low isoelectric points and molecular weight. They are grape pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins that are expressed throughout the ripening period post véraison, and are highly resistant to low pH and enzymatic or non-enzymatic proteolysis. Protein levels in un-fined white wine differ by variety and range up to 300 mg/L. Infection with some common grapevine pathogens or skin contact, such as occurs during transport of mechanically harvested fruit, results in enhanced concentrations of some PR proteins in juice and wine. Oenological control of protein instability is achieved through adsorption of wine proteins onto bentonite. The adsorption of proteins onto bentonite occurs within several minutes, suggesting that a continuous contacting process could be developed. The addition of proteolytic enzyme during short term heat exposure, to induce PR protein denaturation, showed promise {{as an alternative to}} bentonite fining. The addition of haze-protective factors, <b>yeast</b> <b>mannoproteins,</b> to wines results in decreased particle size of haze, probably by competition with wine proteins for other non-proteinaceous wine components required for the formation of large insoluble aggregations of protein.

The kinetics of the release of both mannose- and glucose-containing polymers during the growth cycle of PDM were determined {{as a guide to}} the release of HPM. Active HPM was first detected in the culture supernatant when the cells were exponentially growing. HPM was also released into the medium under an environment simulating winemaking conditions by PDM cells during fermentation as well as during storage on yeast lees. Since the amounts of HPM released during fermentation are greater than those subsequently extracted from the cell wall, fermentation would be a more viable procedure than extraction from yeast cells for the commercial production of HPM. <b>Yeast</b> invertase, a <b>mannoprotein</b> with haze protective activity, was used as a model substrate to investigate the mechanism of haze protection. Invertase was found to reduce visible turbidity but not prevent protein precipitation. Invertase itself did not precipitate but remained soluble in the wine.

As the available concentration of these components decreases, due to the presence of HPM, the particle size of the haze decreases and thus visible turbidity declines. Isabelle V. S. Dupin, Brett M.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of host cells by the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans, is probably an essential {{step in the}} pathogenesis of disease development. The interaction of <b>yeast</b> and hyphal <b>mannoproteins</b> with host cell receptors has been studied {{by a number of}} labora-tories. C. albicans recognizes a variety of host cells as well as host cell extracellular matrix proteins. This observation is not unexpected given the number of sites within and on the body which can be colonized and infected by the organism. Indeed, it would appear that C. albicans has evolved a number of ways in which it recognizes the host. This statement is made with the qualification that the organism uses other processes to infect, such as morphogenesis, phenotypic switching and the production of invasive enzymes, including secreted aspartyl proteases and phosholipases. Recognition of epithelial cells is accomplished through cell surface mannoproteins (adhesins) which bind to carbohydrate-containing receptors. The number of such man-noproteins is not know; pro adhesins exist. The organism also binds to keratinocytes, endothelial cells and matrix proteins, such as fibronectin, laminin, collagen and entactin, and, as such, appears to have a integrin-like cell surface adhesin. In most cases, the adhesin for each of these host proteins is a mannoprotein. The biochemistry of the can-didal adhesins has been extensively studied. However, molecular analyses of the enco-ding genes is only now being studied. Thus, until clean, genetic analyses are complete and strains lacking an adhesin function are constructed, a direct role for the adhesins in pathogenesis can only be inferred.

40|$|Cell wall mannoproteins {{are largely}} {{responsible}} for the adhesive properties and immunomodulation ability of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. The outer chain extension of <b>yeast</b> <b>mannoproteins</b> occurs in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. GDP-mannose must first be transported from the cytosol into the Golgi lumen, where mannose is transferred to mannans. GDP is hydrolyzed by a GDPase, encoded by GDA 1, to GMP, which then exits the Golgi lumen in a coupled, equimolar exchange with cytosolic GDP-mannose. We isolated and disrupted the C albicans homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GDA 1 gene in order to investigate its role in protein mannosylation and pathogenesis. CaGda 1 p shares four apyrase conserved regions with other nucleoside diphosphatases. Membranes prepared from the C. albicans disrupted gda 1 /gda 1 strain had a 90 % decrease in the ability to hydrolyze GDP compared to wild type. The gda 1 /gda 1 mutants showed a severe defect in O-mannosylation and reduced cell wall phosphate content. Other cell wall-related phenotypes are present, such as elevated chitin levels and increased susceptibility to attack by beta- 1, 3 -glucanases. Our results show that the C. albicans organism contains beta-mannose at their nonreducing end, differing from S. cerevisiae, which has only alpha-linked mannose residues in its O-glycans. Mutants lacking both alleles of GDA 1 grow {{at the same rate as}} the wild type but are partially blocked in hyphal formation in Lee solid medium and during induction in liquid by changes in temperature and pH. However, the mutants still form normal hyphae in the presence of serum and N-acetylglucosamine and do not change their adherence to HeLa cells. Taken together, our data are in agreement with the hypothesis that several pathways regulate the yeast-hypha transition. Gda 1 /gda 1 cells offer a model for discriminating among them...|$|E
40|$|Stabilization against {{protein haze}} {{was one of}} the first {{positive}} properties attributed to <b>yeast</b> <b>mannoproteins</b> in winemaking. In previous work we demonstrated that deletion of KNR 4 leads to increased mannoprotein release in laboratory Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. We have now constructed strains with KNR 4 deleted in two different industrial wine yeast backgrounds. This required replacement of two and three alleles of KNR 4 for the EC 1118 and T 73 - 4 backgrounds, respectively, and the use of three different selection markers for yeast genetic transformation. The actual effect of the genetic modification was dependent on both the genetic background and the culture conditions. The fermentation performance of T 73 - 4 derivatives was clearly impaired, and these derivatives did not contribute to the protein stability of the wine, even though they showed increased mannoprotein release in vitro. In contrast, the EC 1118 derivative with both alleles of KNR 4 deleted released increased amounts of mannoproteins both in vitro and during wine fermentation assays, and the resulting wines were consistently less susceptible to protein haze. The fermentation performance of this strain was slightly impaired, but only with must with a very high sugar content. These results pave the way for the development of new commercial strains with the potential to improve several mannoprotein-related quality and technological parameters of wine.

40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{research}} have identified similarities between behaviors associated with {{major depressive disorder}} (MDD) and those associated with immune activation, referred to as sickness behaviors. Reports of altered immune parameters in MDD patients further point to a shared mechanism underlying depressive and sickness behaviors. Most reliable of these immune changes are suppressed natural killer cell activity (NKCA) and alterations in leukocyte subsets. Further, some {{studies have demonstrated that}} treatment of MDD with the selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increase NKCA in a subset of depressed patients. In light of these findings the following questions were posed: (1) Is sickness behavior induced by animal models of depressive states? (2) Is NKCA suppression observed in rodent models of MDD, and is this reduction reversible by SSRI administration? (3) Does repeated immune activation induce depressive behaviors and the immune alterations observed in MDD patients, and does SSRI administration restore these alterations? ^ Behavioral similarities between depressive and sickness behaviors, and immune alterations associated with MDD suggest that immune activation leads to depressive behaviors. The immune alterations found with MDD are also associated with the release of proinflammatory cytokines from activated macrophages which have been implicated in sickness behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation. Administration of proinflammatory mediators to non-depressed patients induces depressive symptoms and increases HPA axis activity. HPA axis activation is associated with MDD and is modulated by SSRIs. Further, SSRIs have been shown to suppress macrophage function. Chronic mild stress (CMS) in rodents is used to model MDD, and elicits depressive behaviors and increases HPA axis activity. With the questions above, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) CMS and repeated immune activation with zymosan (<b>yeast</b> cell wall <b>mannoprotein)</b> will have similar and parallel effects on depressive behaviors measured in Porsolt 2 ̆ 7 s forced swim test and on sickness behaviors defined by the social investigation task; (2) Both CMS and repeated immune activation will activate the HPA axis evidenced by elevated circulating corticosterone; (3) Both CMS and repeated immune activation will disrupt innate immune function measured by decreased NKCA and macrophage activation evidenced by increased intracellular ROS; and (4) chronic fluoxetine will normalize behavior, endocrine, and immune responses. ^ CMS suppressed NKCA, and consistent with findings in MDD patients, chronic fluoxetine abrogated CMS-induced suppression of NKCA. Furthermore, CMS stimulated macrophage activity as evidenced by increased ROS, which was not altered by fluoxetine. Taken together these findings suggest that the CMS model is an appropriate model to further explore the relationship between depressive behaviors and related immune function. In contrast, chronic zymosan did not alter immune measures. Both CMS and chronic zymosan induced depressive behaviors, however neither manipulation induced sickness behavior. While previous studies have evaluated acute pathogen administration, given the chronic nature of MDD, the current study used repeated administration of pathogen. This may account for the differences with previous research. FLX did not reverse behavior alterations induced by chronic zymosan. ...|$|R
40|$|Processing {{techniques}} for red wines {{and their potential}} health benefits have intensively been investigated, however, information relevant to the grape and wine industry in Texas is less frequently available. The overall objective of this work {{was to investigate the}} reduction of 3 -alkyl- 2 -methoxypyrazines that can affect the quality of Texas wines and to study the health benefits of Texas wines. The methods used include SPME-GC-MS and molecular bioassays. The first objective was to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory potential effect of red wine polyphenols from Black Spanish wine (Vitis aestivalis hybrid) in colonic human fibroblast cells. Results show that an extract prepared from Black Spanish wine decreased gene expression and activation of NF-kB transcription factor and target proinflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. Induction of microRNA- 126 (miR- 126) by wine extract was found {{to be one of the}} underlying molecular mechanism by which wine extract decreased vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM- 1) and inflammation in colon cells. These mechanisms may be relevant to the prevention of iv inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may increase the risk for colon cancer. The second objective was to investigate the role of the green june beetle (GJB) as exogenous source of MPs other than the multicolored Asian Lady beetle (Harmonia axyridis). Over the last decade, the green june beetle has been suspected to be a source of MPs based on intermittent reports from Texas growers of an atypical aroma and flavor reminiscent of crushed green June beetles (GJB). Specifically the North region of Texas seems affected. Results demonstrated GJB as source of 3 -isopropyl- 2 - methoxypyrazine, where one GJB could elevate MPs above sensory perceptible levels in 4. 3 gallons of wine. The incorporation of GJB to the winemaking process may contribute negatively to the sensory properties of Texas wines and therefore should be strictly controlled. The third objective was to explore the potential effect of micro-oxygenation treatment and accelerated aging techniques relevant for the state of Texas in the reduction of 3 -Isobutyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (IBMP), and 3 -isopropyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (IPMP) levels as determined by SPME-GC-MS. Results show that MPs were not affected by MOX or oak interaction. Although the data suggest that MOX and oak exposure do not directly affect MPs concentration. The fourth research objective was to explore the potential effect of three commercial available yeast strains, BM 45, K 1, and D 80, on MPs levels in Black Spanish wines. Black Spanish wines were fermented with MB 45 strain resulted in the highest amount of MPs. Conversely K 1 and D 80 yeast strains reduced IBMP levels in comparison with the control. An increase in IBMP was not expected. However it has been demonstrated that amino acids valine and leucine are MPs precursors. If Vitis v aestivalis hybrid grapes contained a similar methyltransferase enzyme found in Vitis vinifera grapes and S. cerevisiae contained similar IPMP biosynthesis pathway found in Pseudomonas perolens BM 45 may have led to the increased IBMP observed in the fermentation. In addition we evaluated MPs levels of wines fermented over 20 days with a chemical defined grape juice medium containing a concentration of yeast available nitrogen of 200 mg N/L. Data suggest that wines fermented with BM 45 and D 80 yeast strains reduced IBMP but K 1 yeast did not show any effect in comparison with the control. In addition MPs were evaluated in the <b>yeast</b> <b>mannoproteins</b> fraction. Results show the presence of IBMP in low concentration below the method detection limit. This data demonstrate for the first time that <b>yeast</b> <b>mannoproteins</b> binds IBMP. to evidence for interactions between mannoproteins secreted by the D 80 yeast strain and IBMP. This work will provide valuable information regarding the potential health benefits of Vitis aestivalis hybrid grapes and reduction of MPs and thus improving the quality of Texas wine...|$|E
