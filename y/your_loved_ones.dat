40|$|For {{families}} and caregivers in Sierra Leone. 1. If a <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> is sick with suspected Ebola, call 117 for help. Do not touch them, their blood, or their body fluids (vomit, feces, urine, sweat). Tell them to drink plenty of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or water. Patients who drink lots of ORS early {{have a much}} better chance of surviving. Do not touch the cup the patient drinks from. Refill it without touching. Wash your hands often while you wait for help. 2. If you have a sick <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> an ambulance is the safest way to get them to a treatment facility. Do not use taxis or other public vehicles. If <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> is taken to a treatment facility early, they {{have a much better}} chance of surviving Ebola.
