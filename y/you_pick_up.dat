5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} generally negative reviews {{in the mainstream}} press. However, Variety stated the film [...] "satisfies as a solidly crafted and persuasively acted thriller that relies more on dark secrets than black magic" [...] while The Hollywood Reporter commented, [...] "Not Forgotten reminds you of a paperback <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> at the airport...where the cover promises a pulp-ish combination of suspense, murder and...the story is so engrossing, you wish the flight were longer".|$|E
2500|$|Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy wrote Slumdog Millionaire {{based on}} the Boeke Prize-winning and Commonwealth Writers' Prize-nominated novel Q & A by Vikas Swarup. To hone the script, Beaufoy made three {{research}} trips to India and interviewed street children, finding himself impressed with their attitudes. The screenwriter said of his goal for the script: [...] "I wanted to get (across) the sense of this huge amount of fun, laughter, chat, and sense of community that is in these slums. What <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> on is this mass of energy." ...|$|E

[...] You report us with your mouth, and we cut off your lips? [...] Who is to blame? [...] It is you! [...] The Bible says that if your hand, eye or mouth is at fault, it should be cut off." [...] While the {{government}} efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency. [...] However, this was tempered by the deep-seated antagonism towards the occupying government forces.|$|E

2500|$|The {{genesis of}} [...] "In the Midnight Hour" [...] was a {{recording}} session on May 12, 1965, at which Wexler {{worked out a}} powerful rhythm track with studio musicians Steve Cropper and Al Jackson of the Stax Records house band, including bassist Donald [...] "Duck" [...] Dunn. (Stax keyboard player Booker T. Jones, who usually played with Dunn, Cropper and Jackson as Booker T. & the M.G.'s, did not play on the studio sessions with Pickett.) Wexler said to Cropper and Jackson, [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> on this thing here?" [...] He performed a dance step. Cropper explained {{in an interview that}} Wexler told them that [...] "this was the way the kids were dancing; they were putting the accent on two. Basically, we'd been one-beat-accenters with an afterbeat; it was like 'boom dah,' but here was a thing that went 'um-chaw,' just the reverse as far as the accent goes." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the filming}} of the movie, Bhansali also choreographed some of the songs. He used to dance on the sets of Guzaarish at times to make the moves clear to his actors. Many times he broke into a dance himself to convey the steps that he had in mind. This took most of his crew by surprise. Pony Verma, who was the {{choreographer}} {{for most of the}} songs in the film, revealed that as soon as Bhansali conceived a song, he would send it to her and then sing it to her as well. During the shooting of the song, a singer and a guitarist were on the sets. The choreography took place to the accompaniment of live guitar strings and song. According to Verma, this novel way of functioning had enhanced the appeal of the song. She added that when [...] "... the song is playing live, <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a lot of nuances on the spot, which really helps the song". Verma was in full praises for Bhansali who gave her complete freedom over the choreography; she also acknowledged the efforts put in by the lead actress Aishwarya Rai, with whom she had frequent discussion about the feel of the song.|$|E
