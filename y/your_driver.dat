This application can greatly reduce carbon emissions and improve city environments. Another innovation is to calculate and compensate all emissions on behalf of <b>your</b> <b>drivers</b> according to the Kyoto protocol, e.g. via reforestation schemes.

40|$|This {{publication}} is a {{guide for}} parents and guardians of teenagers learning to drive. It should be used with the Iowa Driver’s Manual to aid you in instructing <b>your</b> new <b>driver</b> about how to safely and responsibly operate a motor vehicle. Since the task of driving is affected by changing conditions, this manual does not attempt to cover all situations that may arise. Under Iowa’s graduated driver licensing system young drivers must complete 20 hours of supervised drive time with their parents or guardians during the instruction permit stage and 10 hours during the intermediate license stage. Even though your teenager is taking or has completed driver education in school, {{there is a great}} deal of benefit to be obtained from you providing this additional practice time. Learning from your experience and under your guidance, your teenager will apply the rules of the road and more fully understand the risks involved in driving. This will require time and patience on your part, but the effort will result in you knowing that your teenager will be better able to cope with the demands of safe driving. In the back of this manual you will find several pages of diagrams. Use these diagrams to illustrate different driving situations for <b>your</b> teenage <b>driver.</b> Consider taking a notepad and pencil along during your practice sessions for additional drawings. This manual also contains a chart to log your supervised drive time. As <b>your</b> new <b>driver</b> advances through the graduated system you will be required to certify to an Iowa driver’s license examiner that you completed the minimum number of hours of supervised drive time. By becoming involved in the learning driver’s educational process, you are contributing to Iowa’s overall highway safety effort and helping your teenager develop safe driving habits that will last a lifetime...|$|R

40|$|Befor e {{we go on}} to more {{advanced}} topics, {{we need to stop}} for a quick note on portability issues. Modern versions of the Linux kernel are highly portable, running on several very differ ent architectur es. Given the multiplatform natur e of Linux, drivers intended for serious use should be portable as well. But a core issue with kernel code is being able both to access data items of known length (for example, filesystem data structures or registers on device boards) and to exploit the capabilities of differ ent pr ocessors (32 -bit and 64 -bit architectur es, and possibly 16 bit as well). Several of the problems encountered by kernel developers while porting x 86 code to new architectur es have been related to incorrect data typing. Adherence to strict data typing and compiling with the-Wall-Wstrict-prototypes flags can prevent most bugs. Data types used by kernel data are divided into three main classes: standard C types such as int, explicitly sized types such as u 32, and types used for specific ker nel objects, such as pid_t. We are going to see when and how each of the thr ee typing classes should be used. The final sections of the chapter talk about some other typical problems you might run into when porting driver code from the x 86 to other platforms, and introduce the generalized support for linked lists exported by recent kernel headers. If you follow the guidelines we provide, <b>your</b> <b>driver</b> should compile and run even on platforms on which you are unable to test it. Use of Standard C Types Although most programmers are accustomed to freely using standard types like int and long, writing device drivers requir es some care to avoid typing conflicts and obscure bugs...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{academic}} discussion of federated authentication, and quite some political manoeuvring about ‘e-ID’. The grand vision, which {{has been around for}} years in various forms but was recently articulated in the US National Strategy for Trustworthy Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), is that a single logon should work everywhere [1]. You should be able to use your identity provider of choice to log on anywhere; so you might use <b>your</b> <b>driver’s</b> license to log on to Gmail, or use your Facebook logon to file your tax return. More restricted versions include the vision of governments of places like Estonia and Germany (and until May 2010 the UK) that a government-issued identity card should serve as a universal logon. Yet few systems have been fielded at any scale. In this paper I will briefly discuss the four existing examples we have of federated authentication, and then go on to discuss a much larger, looming problem.
