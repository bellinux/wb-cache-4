5|$|Your Honor, <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>I</b> {{recognized}} my {{kinship with}} all living beings, and I {{made up my}} mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
25|$|For 60 days, my {{body was}} used as a {{thoroughfare}} for all the hoodlums, militia men and soldiers in the district... Those men completely destroyed me; they caused me so much pain. They raped me in front of my six children... Three <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>I</b> discovered I had HIV/AIDS. There {{is no doubt in my}} mind that I was infected during these rapes.|$|E
25|$|The villa {{was sold}} in 1960 to the Vuilleumier family, who used it first as a private family home, {{and for the past}} few years as a hotel. In 1976 the American writer Gore Vidal (who lived in La Rondinaia, a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett, from 1972 to 2004) wrote of Villa Cimbrone: Twenty five <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>I</b> was asked by an American {{magazine}} what was the most beautiful place that I had ever seen in all my travels and I said the view from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day when the sky and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to tell one from the other.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his closing}} remarks, Reagan asked viewers: [...] "Are you better off now {{than you were}} four <b>years</b> <b>ago?</b> <b>Is</b> it easier {{for you to go}} and buy things in the stores than it was four <b>years</b> <b>ago?</b> <b>Is</b> there more or less {{unemployment}} in the country than there was four <b>years</b> <b>ago?</b> <b>Is</b> America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four <b>years</b> <b>ago?</b> And if you answer all of those questions 'yes', why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on {{for the last four years}} is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have." ...|$|R

500|$|Stone was {{nominated}} for an award for Outstanding Directing by the Directors Guild of America but did not win. He also won a Golden Globe for Best Director and in his acceptance speech, he said, [...] "A terrible lie was told to us 28 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>I</b> hope that this film can {{be the first step}} in righting that wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Three {{months before}} he died, Hergé stated that [...] "Unfortunately I cannot say much about this {{forthcoming}} Tintin adventure because, though I started it three <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>I</b> have not had much {{time to work on}} it and still do not know how it will turn out. I know very roughly where I am going... I am continuing my research and I really do not know where this story will lead me." ...|$|E

500|$|On the {{day that}} Pinfold was published, Waugh was persuaded to attend a Foyle's Literary Luncheon, {{as a means of}} {{promoting}} the book. He informed his audience that [...] "Three <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>I</b> had quite a new experience. I went off my head for about three weeks". To further stimulate sales the dust-jacket also emphasised Waugh's experiences of madness, which brought him a large correspondence from strangers anxious to relate their own parallel experiences—"the voices... of the persecuted, turning to him as confessor".|$|E
500|$|On June 2, 2015, current Federal Housing Finance Agency {{director}} and former U.S. Representative Mel Watt, Democrat of North Carolina, {{released a statement}} saying: [...] "Over 15 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>I</b> heard an unseemly rumor from someone who, contrary {{to what has been}} reported, was not an intermediary or advocate for the alleged victim's family. It would not be the first nor last time that I, as a Member of Congress, would hear rumors or innuendoes about colleagues. I had no direct knowledge of any abuse by former Speaker Hastert and, therefore, took no action." ...|$|E
500|$|My mind {{rejects the}} whole present social order and Christianity—home, the {{recognised}} virtues, classes {{of life and}} religious doctrines. [...] Six <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>I</b> left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it {{impossible for me to}} remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.|$|E

500|$|On July 29, 2010, Rangel {{was charged}} by the {{committee}} with 13 counts of violating House rules and federal laws. [...] Rangel's lawyers continued to insist {{that he had not}} intentionally violated any law or regulation, had not handed out political favors, and had not misused his office for personal financial gain. [...] Rangel somberly said only this on the day the charges were announced: Sixty <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>I</b> survived a Chinese attack in North Korea. And as a result I wrote a book that, having survived that, that I haven't had a bad day since. Today I have to reassess that.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} chapter, Cartwright writes [...] "About five <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>I</b> decided I {{wanted to write}} this book. I knew that The Simpsons would end some day. [...] I decided that I wanted to write it while the show {{was still on the}} air." [...] In an {{interview}} with Scotland on Sunday, she added [...] "I wanted to tell my story and I needed to because I get so much fan mail. People are so interested in the whole process, how it all comes together. This book does that." [...] In a 1995 interview, five years before writing the book, Cartwright remarked that she wanted to write a book and that if she did, it would be titled [...] "My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{statement}} to The New York Times on August 21, 2015, Dre again addressed his abusive past, stating, [...] "Twenty-five <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>I</b> {{was a young man}} drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I've been married for 19 years and every day I'm working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I'm doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again." [...] He went on to apologize to all the women he abused, saying, [...] "I apologize to the women I've hurt.

500|$|... "I {{could stay}} forever {{on the show}} and be safe. But three <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>I</b> did Night of the Iguana in Williamstown , and I had a quote from Tennessee Williams taped on my mirror, taken from an essay he'd written on success. It said, and I'm paraphrasing here: 'Security is {{in the shape of a}} {{kidney-shaped}} pool in Los Angeles, where you sit waiting for your residual checks.' I was in a comfortable spot on Knots, and an artist should not be comfortable. I'd forgotten that there was a character I'd loved for 13 years. She was the seed of the show. I am the sole person to spin off from Dallas (because actor David Ackroyd originated the role of Gary on that show). Valene gave Knots a note of spirituality. There was a heart that was Valene. I hope they treat her with respect, that she is seen out with a resolution she deserves." ...|$|E
500|$|Gwen's {{father and}} a New York City Police Department captain who hunts both Spider-Man out of {{distrust}} and the Lizard for his rampage. Leary explained {{that he did not}} know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was [...] "more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [...] but the really dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The first time I met you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>I</b> was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|E
500|$|Jyoti Singh {{was born}} and raised in Delhi while her parents were from a small village in the Ballia {{district}} of Uttar Pradesh. Her father sold his ancestral land to educate her, and worked double shifts to continue to pay for her schooling. In an interview he related that as a youth he had dreamed of becoming a school teacher, but at that time education was not considered important and girls were not even sent to school. [...] "Attitudes are changing back home now, but when I left 30 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>I</b> vowed never deny my children so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge." [...] He said that he put his daughter's education above that of even his two sons. [...] "It never entered our hearts to ever discriminate. How could I be happy if my son is happy and my daughter isn't? And it was impossible to refuse a little girl who loved going to school." ...|$|E

500|$|Creator Tim Schafer {{has said}} that he has been a heavy metal music fan since high school, and roadies have long fascinated him. As Schafer said in 2007, [...] "The name was one of the very first things I thought of, over fifteen <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>I</b> was riding a bus, {{thinking}} about a game that would be the complete opposite of what we were working on, The Secret of Monkey Island [...] And Brütal Legend leapt into my head. I've been hanging on to that name ever since." [...] The title, which he describes as sounding [...] "like the hardest core fantasy thing out there", makes use of the metal umlaut. The idea behind the game first came to Schafer about fifteen years prior to its release, but its core concepts did not completely come together until after the completion of Psychonauts (2005), when he presented his idea for the game to the team, they became excited at the concept and decided to make that their next title.|$|E
500|$|In his {{appearances}} on The Howard Stern Show, he was frequently challenged {{to defend his}} ratings. Ebert stood by his opinions with one notable exception– when Stern pointed out that Ebert had given The Godfather Part II a three-star rating in 1974, but had subsequently given The Godfather Part III {{three and a half}} stars. Ebert later added The Godfather Part II to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list in October 2008 stating that his original review has often been cited as proof of his [...] "worthlessness" [...] but he still had not changed his mind and would not change a word of his original review. When reviewing the 2009 remake of The Last House on the Left, Ebert noted how he had given the controversial 1972 original three and a half stars and declined to make a comparison between the two versions: [...] "I wrote that original [...] "Last House" [...] review 37 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>I</b> am not the same person. I am uninterested in being 'consistent.|$|E
500|$|John Tobias {{said that}} his inspirations for the game's story and {{characters}} came from the Chinese mythology {{and some of the}} stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks. Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I knew exactly what I was going to do with a future story. A few <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>I</b> [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots. The goal was to not runaway from what came before with a retelling, but to move the themes forward. I did it for fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but it felt good to get that out of my system." ...|$|E
