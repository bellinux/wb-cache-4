500|$|Clough {{was quoted}} as saying [...] "I'm not {{equipped}} to manage successfully without Peter Taylor. I am the shop window and he is the goods in the back." [...] The two worked as a pair by complementing each other's strengths, as Clough had a forceful personality and was adept at motivating players, whilst Taylor was more reserved, though he had an ability to spot talented players. Former Hartlepools player Cliff Wright described the pair as [...] "good cop, bad cop. Cloughie would knock you to the ground, verbally at least, and Pete would pick <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> put you back together." [...] As the bigger personality and the man with the title of manager, Clough garnered much greater publicity than Taylor, which caused Taylor to grumble that [...] "I sometimes wonder why he never says to Bell's whisky, for instance, when they're handing out Manager of the Month awards, 'You'll have to present an extra gallon bottle. There are two of us." [...] On a personal level they were very close, and often finished each other's sentences.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{noted that}} there was a greater focus on Moore's {{keyboards}} than Matheos' guitar riffs. Blogcritics said that [...] "Free focuses a lot on the keyboards and programming of Kevin Moore", although Matheos' [...] "heavy guitar riffs, while not as frequent on this disc, have an even harder edge. They have an energy, and urgency, and serious metal crunch to them that will make any rocker sit up and pay attention." [...] Chad Bower of About.com noted that Free [...] "isn't one of those metal albums that hypes <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> makes you want to break stuff. It's one where you have to sit back, throw on the headphones, and appreciate the complexity and musicianship." [...] Olav Björnsen of Prog4you.com stated that [...] "layers upon layers of electronic sounds, that fill out the soundscapes of the songs, create nuances and subtle moods as well as walls of sound and tension." [...] He said that Matheos used acoustic and electric guitars [...] "to fill out the soundscapes even more, and is at the most effective when playing the acoustic guitar, giving life and warmth to songs {{that would have been a}} bit cold sounding without that input." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics, ranging from largely positive to negative. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A–, calling it [...] "gorgeously shot", citing the [...] "lush, smoky gaming sequences" [...] in particular. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Hell Money" [...] the eleventh most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show noting, [...] "If there’s one thing you don’t want to mess with, it’s the Chinese mafia. Especially the branch that dresses up like Slipknot and either a) burns you alive, if you’re lucky, or b) forces you {{to participate in a}} haunted organ-harvesting raffle only to slowly carve <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sell your vital organs on the black market, {{whether you like it or}} not." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called it a [...] "hard episode to love [...] sincere and purposeful". The two praised the conceit of the episode, arguing that by presenting the situation from the Chinese immigrants—members of an alien culture—and Chao's point of view, [...] "Mulder and Scully seem clumsy and arrogant. And by implication, the audience are made to feel just as arrogant." ...|$|E

500|$|Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy {{compared}} it to [...] "Since U Been Gone," [...] which has [...] "a super radio-friendly hook." [...] Elizabeth Lancaster of MTV Newsroom listed {{it as one of}} five key tracks in Stronger, writing [...] "Upbeat yet soulful, the chorus will drag <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> onto the floor to dance the heartache away alongside her." [...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly thought that the song's [...] "belty pop/rock wheelhouse" [...] should please fans of the sound. He later added that [...] "Clarkson might have been better off releasing [...] "What Doesn’t Kill You" [...] as the first track from Stronger." [...] Another positive reception came from Glenn Gamboa of Newsday, who praised Clarkson for [...] "infusing her tales of empowerment after a breakup with her unique combo of vulnerability and sass." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant thought that the song is [...] "tailor-made for radio play" [...] and that [...] "the chilly electro-pop that Greg Kurstin brings to the verses, suggests a top forty version of Robyn's [...] "Call Your Girlfriend" [...] (2010). On March 5, 2013, Billboard ranked the song at number two in its list of Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time. Additionally, it also appeared at number two of Clarkson's Top 15 Biggest Billboard Hot 100 hits through the week ending April 29, 2017.|$|E
500|$|The game's storyline, themes, graphics, and {{artificial}} intelligence were praised by critics. A reviewer from Game Informer stated {{that despite the}} game did not [...] "hold back" [...] the decadent experience from being an [...] "unhinged flaming rollercoaster ride". A reviewer from the Official Xbox Magazine concluded stated that the game was an accomplished shooter [...] "on the whole", and a fittingly [...] "thunderous" [...] send-off for Resident Evil, while also praising the length and variety of the game. GameTrailers noted the shift away from the style and tone of past games in the series, yet still praised the overall direction, stating that despite the [...] "old identity stripped away", the game presented itself as a [...] "massive" [...] action game. Richard George of IGN was favourable toward the technical and artistic design of the game, stating that the game was among Capcom’s greatest successes with an [...] "incredibly strong" [...] world, lighting, and creature designs. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN also noted the new enemies as [...] "some of the best" [...] designs and concepts {{in the history of}} the franchise. Hollander Cooper of GamesRadar praised the improvements to the controls over its predecessor, stating that the game had an emphasis placed on fluidity and movement, although noted that the cover system [...] "never seems to work right". The Escapist also praised the improved AI companion that [...] "does a decent job of backing <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> taking the fight to the enemy rather than just standing by", however also disliked the cover system, calling it [...] "the most forgettable new feature of the game".|$|E
