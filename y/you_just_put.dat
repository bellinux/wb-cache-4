500|$|Following surgery, Raonic {{withdrew from}} the Italian Open and the French Open. He {{returned}} {{in time for the}} grass court season. [...] Having played in Halle in previous years, Raonic elected to play at the Queen's Club Championships for the first time. [...] Raonic lost in the quarterfinals in his Queen's debut, and lost in the third round at Wimbledon. After his Wimbledon loss to Kyrgios, Raonic commented that his foot injury had led to problems throughout his body: [...] "There wasn't a place it wasn't ... First ankle, then the hip, and then the back. Then when those things aren't working, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> too much pressure on your shoulder, and then your shoulder hurts." [...] The cascading injuries led to a withdrawal from Canada's Davis Cup tie against Belgium; a withdrawal from the Washington Open, where Raonic was the defending champion; first round losses at the Canadian Open and Cincinnati Masters; and a third round loss at the US Open to López.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Lizard {{merchandise}} designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape {{with a layer}} of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics. Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more [...] "Steve Ditko derived" [...] (the character's original artist). Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling. He stated [...] "that in a comic book, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> that thing up there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you try to do that and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bogart's cremated {{remains were}} interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Glendale, California, in the Garden of Memory, Columbarium of Eternal Light, Garden Niche 647. [...] He was buried with a small, gold whistle {{once part of}} a charm {{bracelet}} he had given to Lauren Bacall before they married. On it was inscribed an allusion to a line from their first movie together, in 1944, To Have and Have Not, where Bacall had said to him shortly after their first meeting: [...] "You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> your lips together and blow". The inscription read: [...] "If you want anything, just whistle." ...|$|E

2500|$|..... We {{originally}} {{had a car}} called the Tarpon, which should have been produced ... {{it was really a}} neat car, a tight little fastback. We showed it to the S.A.E. (Society of Automotive Engineers) convention (February, 1964 in Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan) and everybody was steamed up about it! But the thing that killed the Tarpon was the fact that we didn't have a V-8 for it at that time.... Roy Abernethy didn't like little cars. Never did. He liked big cars, because he was a big guy -- hell of a nice guy. And he felt that this car was too small, so he said, [...] "Well, heck, Teague, why don't <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> it on the Rambler Classic wheel-base? That way you've got V-8 availability and you've got more room inside it." [...] And then on top of that he added an inch to the roof while I was in Europe. I still have never gotten over that..." ...|$|E

"Now, then, miss," [...] she said, {{giving up}} the shaking as a bad job, [...] "no highstrikes, if <b>you</b> please. <b>Just</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> on your hat and come {{for a bit of}} a walk in this queer place with me.

6000|$|... "So that <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> {{it to me}} as a {{definite}} request?"--oh how she tried to divest this of all sound of the hardness of bargaining!

The next wish shall be that every time you open your mouth a gold coin shall fall out of it, and your voice shall be like the most beautiful music. The third wish shall be that you may be married to the young king, and become the queen of the country. At the same time I shall give you a cap, which you must carefully keep, for it can save you, if you ever are in danger of your life, if <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> it on your head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor devil, there's {{something}} in that. We are right down sorry for you, but we--well, hang it, we don't want the small-pox, you see. Look here, I'll {{tell you what}} to do.

500|$|Reflecting on Australia's {{involvement}} in the Vietnam War, Wilton considered that it was justified, and that the West's intervention helped delay the takeover of South Vietnam, {{and the spread of}} communism to Laos and Cambodia, by almost a decade. [...] "Whether that was worthwhile", he added, [...] "is a matter for the historian to judge". The key lesson, he felt, was not to intervene in a conflict [...] "unless you are prepared to win", because it was [...] "not something that <b>you</b> can <b>just</b> <b>put</b> one foot in and feel the temperature".|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, mind," [...] Frank said sharply, [...] "no {{struggling}} and nonsense, you fellows. I will keep {{quite close to}} you and stick to you, so you needn't be afraid.

5000|$|One of the album's {{themes and}} some of the songs reflect on the current {{worldwide}} financial crisis. Morrison has spoken out that he felt the need to comment on what he perceives as [...] "the worldwide preoccupation with money, materialism, income equality, and the greed that has poisoned society" [...] while further remarking: [...] "I’m not proselytizing, it’s not some kind of manifesto. Songs are just ideas, concepts, and <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> the mic there and go." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Steve Priest's 1994 autobiography, Are You Ready, Steve?, Tucker {{offered his}} {{feedback}} while recording [...] "The Six Teens," [...] and songwriter/producer Mike Chapman said, [...] "We don't f**king need you anyway, Mick!" [...] Tucker's ended the argument by saying, [...] "If you don't need us, why don't <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> that tape player on 'record' and erase the whole track?" [...] He was serious {{when it came}} to making music, and he stood up for his band's integrity when necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to {{becoming}} a comedian, Llewellyn served an apprenticeship and became a professional shoemaker, working at James Taylor & Son and John Lobb Bootmaker in London. Speaking to Richard Herring, he said he still maintains {{an interest in the}} craft; [...] "There is still a side of me that wants to develop a kind of 3D printed shoe thing... where <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> your foot in a thing and you just get a shoe and it's there. and it fits absolutely exquisitely, immediately." ...|$|E
30|$|In {{trying to}} {{construct}} the models described above, I did make a number of somewhat arbitrary choices, as the Appendix: Propositional specifications for Sanday models illustrates. On the other hand, <b>you</b> can’t <b>just</b> <b>put</b> anything into a POPCO model—not {{if the goal is}} to try to capture preexisting ideas about how certain complex cultural variations interact with each other. My experience so far is that it’s in fact quite difficult to capture ideas like Sanday’s in a POPCO model. I think that the goal of trying to model a certain kind of cognitive process which plausibly might operate in the world places severe constraints on modeling with POPCO.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't KNOW, but I can IMAGINE," [...] said Anne eagerly. [...] "I'm sure it {{must have}} been very disturbing. But then, there is our side of it too. Have you any imagination, Miss Barry? If <b>you</b> have, <b>just</b> <b>put</b> {{yourself}} in our place. We didn't know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly scared us to death. It was simply awful the way we felt. And then we couldn't sleep in the spare room after being promised. I suppose you are used to sleeping in spare rooms. But <b>just</b> imagine what <b>you</b> would feel like if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's not playing"--Mr. Mitchett gravely {{confirmed}} it. [...] "Don't {{you feel}} in the very air the vibration of the passion that she's simply too charming to shake at the window as the housemaid shakes the tablecloth or the jingo the flag?" [...] Then he took up what Vanderbank had previously said. [...] "Of course, my dear man, I'm 'aware,' as <b>you</b> <b>just</b> now <b>put</b> it, of everything, and I'm not indiscreet, am I, Mrs. Brook? in admitting for you {{as well as for}} myself that there WAS an impossibility you and I used sometimes to turn over together.
