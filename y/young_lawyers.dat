5|$|In 1828, Bolívar {{issued a}} decree {{establishing}} his dictatorship in the country; as a result, {{a group of}} <b>young</b> <b>lawyers</b> gathered to depose Bolívar and proclaim Francisco de Paula Santander as constitutional president. On the night of September 25, 1828 the conspirators attempted to assassinate Bolivar at the presidential palace; Bolívar managed to escape {{with the help of}} Manuela Sáenz by jumping from a window until the military forces restored control of the city. Pedro Carujo, born in Barcelona, became a Commander in 1828, hand picked by Simón Bolívar to lead the Military Academy founded in Bogotá. However, Carujo joined the supporters of Santander and attempted to kill Bolívar while on the revolt of September 25, for which he was sentenced to death and moved to the Solano fort in March 1829. After managing to escape several months later, he was recaptured and irons were attached to him. He was deported to Curacao in June 1830, only to return several months later under the government of José Antonio Páez.|$|E

25|$|Edmund Pendleton {{received}} {{a license to}} practice law in April 1741. His success before nearby county courts, including as the prosecuting attorney for Essex County allowed Pendleton {{to become a member}} of the General Court bar in October 1745. When attorneys were forbidden to practice before both courts, Pendleton chose the General Court, and wrapped up his lower court practice—which allowed him to accept appointment as a justice of the peace for Caroline County in 1751. Pendleton also trained many <b>young</b> <b>lawyers,</b> including his nephews John Penn (later one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence) and John Taylor of Caroline (who became a U.S. Senator).|$|E

25|$|Non-governmental {{organizations}} (NGOs) {{played a}} significant role in the Rose Revolution. By the end of 2000, the amount of NGOs estimated to be in Georgia numbered around four thousand. The 1997 Civil Code made the registration of an NGO relatively easy, and they operated in Georgia with few restrictions. Though only a small portion of those likely had influence on the government or were successful in lobbying, several had leverage in parliament. While public participation in these NGOs was relatively low, they were ultimately successful in mobilizing the population to play a more active role in government. Two of the most important were the Georgian <b>Young</b> <b>Lawyers</b> Association and the Liberty Institute, both of which were active in the promotion of human rights and freedom of information legislation before the Rose Revolution.|$|E

In 2002, he joined the liability defense service group and the business litigation service group at the Lexington law firm of Stites & Harbison. While there, he worked for former Democratic Kentucky Attorney General and future Governor Steve Beshear, who urged him {{to get involved in}} state politics. Barr and colleague Brad Cowgill were employed by Republican gubernatorial candidate Ernie Fletcher in 2003 to fight charges that Fletcher's running mate, Hunter Bates, did not meet the state's residency requirements for eligibility for the office of lieutenant governor. A judge ruled against Bates, and he was dropped from the ticket.|$|E
25|$|Estuardo Galvez, {{who took}} that Dean office in 2000 -and later {{went on to}} become {{university}} president, was {{one of the members of}} the networks established by Soto; realizing the importance of the Bar Association, which was also a participant in the election of judges -and until then controlled by lawyers linked to the traditional capital of the country- Galvez sought from the beginning of his term to favor his post graduate students placing them in public institutions so that they could show their loyalty with favorable votes in the Bar elections. After several elections, and once Galvez was no longer Dean, the network that Soto set up beat the traditional capital lawyers in the Bar Association elections by 300 votes; as recorded in the minutes, the majority of his votes were <b>young</b> <b>lawyers</b> -his former students.|$|E

25|$|In December 1932, {{the general}} counsel of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) resigned, and Reed was {{appointed}} the agency's new general counsel. Since 1930, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Eugene Meyer, had pressed Hoover to take a more active approach to ameliorating the Great Depression. Hoover finally relented and submitted legislation. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act was signed into law on January 22, 1932, but its operations were kept secret for five months. Hoover feared both political attacks from Republicans and that publicity about which corporations were receiving RFC assistance might disrupt the agency's attempts to keep companies financially viable. When Congress passed legislation in July 1932 forcing the RFC to make public the companies that received loans, the resulting political embarrassment led to the resignation of the RFC's president and his successor as well as other staff turnover at the agency. Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as President in November 1932 led to further staff changes. On December 1, 1932, the RFC's general counsel resigned, and Hoover appointed Reed to the position. Roosevelt, impressed with Reed's work and needing someone who knew the agency, its staff and its operations, kept Reed on. Reed mentored and protected the careers of a number of <b>young</b> <b>lawyers</b> at RFC, many of whom became highly influential in the Roosevelt administration: Alger Hiss, Robert H. Jackson, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, Charles Edward Wyzanski, Jr. (later an important federal district court judge), and David Cushman Coyle.|$|E

500|$|In 1856, Arthur courted Ellen Herndon, the {{daughter}} of William Lewis Herndon, a Virginia naval officer. [...] The two were soon engaged to be married. [...] Later that year, he started a new law partnership with a friend, Henry D. Gardiner, and traveled with him to Kansas to consider purchasing land and setting up a law practice there. [...] At that time, the state {{was the scene of}} a brutal struggle between pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces, and Arthur lined up firmly with the latter. [...] The rough frontier life did not agree with the genteel New Yorkers; after three or four months the two <b>young</b> <b>lawyers</b> returned to New York City, where Arthur comforted his fiancée after her father was lost at sea in the wreck of the SS Central America. [...] In 1859, they were married at Calvary Episcopal Church in Manhattan. [...] After his marriage, Arthur devoted his efforts to building his law practice, but also found time to engage in Republican party politics. In addition, he indulged his military interest by becoming Judge Advocate General for the Second Brigade of the New York Militia.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of Brownlee's {{graduation}} from Victoria College, the path of entry to his chosen profession, law, was through three years of articling instead of law school. [...] Brownlee and Victoria classmate Fred Albright resolved to go west; after narrowing the choice to either Calgary or Vancouver, the former was {{selected on the basis}} that its legal community was less established, and it offered better prospects to <b>young</b> <b>lawyers</b> without significant capital. [...] There, Brownlee was articled to Lougheed, Bennett, Allison & McLaws, whose partners included Sir James Lougheed and R. B. Bennett. [...] Brownlee became quite close to Bennett; the future Prime Minister often visited him after hours while Brownlee was studying, and used his honed memory and impressive oratorical skills to give the younger man detailed lectures on whatever area of law he was reading about, illustrated by precise and invariably accurate references to cases. [...] Despite his relationship with Bennett, Brownlee was dissatisfied with the work he was being given, and he moved to Muir, Jephson and Adams, where he hoped to practice more commercial law. [...] There he benefited from the tutelage of James Muir, who spent hours finding precise citations relevant to Brownlee's studies, and then left the casebooks open to the appropriate page for Brownlee to find the next morning.|$|E
