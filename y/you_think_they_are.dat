60|$|THE LADY. Then <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> there still! But if the German War Office {{gets the}} list--and she will copy it before she gives {{it back to}} Blueloo, you may depend on it--all is lost.|$|E

6000|$|... "And there isn't one I want destroyed, I'm {{sorry to}} say," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Bowen. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> all very agreeable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{may have}} a headache, but I think {{it is more than}} that," [...] was the reply from Dave's sister. [...] "Oh, Belle, if matters are as <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> what in the world are we going to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Emily. Where do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are?</b> We've {{been looking}} a great [...] while for them. I {{know we are}} lost, for when we went after the [...] flowers we only turned once, and coming back, we have turned three [...] times.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{better for}} having it quickened, stimulated? Isn't it better {{that they should}} remain {{unconscious}} of the hazel, isn't it better that they should see as a whole, without all this pulling to pieces, all this knowledge?' ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{their return}} to a justifiably proud Vancouver, someone in the crowd asked Read, [...] "When did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to win?" [...] Read's reply, [...] "When they left the boathouse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wasn't he a {{funny little}} man? Did I {{do it all}} proper?—I didn't know what I was doing. I'm sure <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{laughing}} at me—do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were?</b> Oh, just look at my frock—what a sight! What would they think——!" [...] The baby had slightly soiled {{the front of her}} dress.|$|R
6000|$|And the Little Breeze laughed happily as {{he danced}} away {{to join the}} other Merry Little Breezes on the Green Meadows. There he found them very, very busy, very busy indeed, so busy that they could hardly find time to nod to him. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing? <b>They</b> <b>were</b> toting gold! Yes, Sir, toting gold! And {{this is how it}} happened: ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Our mutual friend's {{stories are}} like himself, Mr Bloom apropos of knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> genuine? He could spin those yarns {{for hours on}} end all night long and lie like old boots. Look at him.|$|E
6000|$|Within there runs blood, [...] The {{same old}} blood! the same red-running blood!

6000|$|... "That's right! That's right! Smile away, Peter Rabbit. Smile away! Your troubles, sir, are all to-day.

60|$|<b>You</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> better dressed abroad {{because they}} wear a blouse?--Because they wear a costume {{appropriate}} to their work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{something}} in Miss Morton's style of painting, Ma'am?--She DOES paint most delightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed, Rupert,' said Anne, 'I do {{not want}} {{to make the most of}} their faults, I only wish to study their characters, because I think it is a useful thing to do.

6000|$|... "I wasn't {{altogether}} disinterested in it," [...] he returned. [...] "I wished you {{to compliment}} me on them.

6000|$|... "You hold Lucile Clamette? Bah! I defy you to drag a {{whole family}} like {{that out of}} our clutches. The man a cripple, the {{children}} helpless! And you think they can escape our vigilance when all our men are warned! How do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going to get across the river, Sir Percy, when every bridge is closely watched? How will they get across Paris, when at every gate our men are on the look-out for them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not very well; but she understands. Small Bird, {{the lady}} says, thank <b>you.</b> She <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> very fine. Her heart is glad. Go help her dress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some scare--and all for nothing," [...] muttered Tom. [...] "The way {{he carried}} on <b>you</b> would <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to shake down half of yonder cliff." ...|$|R

6000|$|I was {{perfectly}} confounded at the sight, and knew {{not what the}} meaning of it should be; Friday called out to me in English, {{as well as he}} could, [...] "O master! you see English mans eat prisoners as well as savage mans."--"Why," [...] said I, [...] "Friday, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going to eat them then"--"Yes," [...] says Friday, [...] "they will eat them."--"No, no," [...] said I, [...] "Friday; I am afraid they will murder them indeed; but you may be sure they will not eat them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Those you've done up at Albany Street Barracks are famous: I've seen 'em," [...] said Mr. Sherrick; and {{remarking}} {{that his}} guest looked rather {{surprised at the}} idea of his being in such company, Sherrick said, [...] "What, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> too great swells for me? Law bless you, I often go there. I've business with several of 'em; had with Captain Belsize, with the Earl of Kew, who's every inch the gentleman--one of nature's aristocracy, and paid up like a man. The Earl and me has had many dealings together:" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, Baas," [...] {{he broke}} in from his corner by the curtain, [...] "not me. I don't care for hunting spooks, Baas, which leave no spoor {{that you can}} follow and are always behind when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in front. Also {{there are too many}} of them waiting for me down there and how can I stand up to them until I am a spook myself and know their ways of fighting? Also if you should die when your spirit is away, I want to be left that I may bury you nicely." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{uniformity}} of lime-washed houses makes Cordova {{the most difficult}} {{place in the world}} wherein to find your way. The streets are exactly alike, so narrow that a carriage could hardly pass, paved with rough cobbles, and tortuous: their intricacy is amazing, labyrinthine; they wind in and out of one another, leading nowhither; they meander on for half a mile and stop suddenly, or turn back, so that you are forced to go in the direction you came. You may wander for hours, trying to find some point that from the steeple appeared quite close. Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> interminable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing--if {{you want}} to {{communicate}} your address by means of your box--nothing whatever. Think; pray think! Do you really suppose {{that the people who}} are looking for you are such fools as not to have an eye on the cloakroom? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> such fools--when they find you don't come to Mr. Huxtable's at eight to-night--as not to inquire at all the hotels? Do you think a young lady of your striking appearance (even if they consented to receive you) could take up her abode at an inn without becoming the subject of universal curiosity and remark? Here is night coming on as fast as it can. Don't let me bore you; only let me ask once more--Where are you to sleep?" ...|$|E
6000|$|God {{gives us}} more than, were we not overbold, we should dare to ask for, and yet how often (perhaps after saying [...] "Thank God" [...] so curtly {{that it is}} only a form of swearing) we are suppliants again within the hour. Gavin was to be {{satisfied}} if he were told that no evil had befallen her he loved, and all the way between the school-house and Windyghoul Babbie craved for no more than Gavin's life. Now they had got their desires; but do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> content? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{can tell}} you," [...] she said, [...] "that if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not the nicest people you ever saw, you're mightily mistaken. They {{had about the}} best manners; and <b>they</b> had <b>been</b> everywhere, and knew everything. I declare {{it made me feel}} as if we had always lived in the backwoods. I don't know but the mother and the daughters would have let you feel so a little, if they'd showed out all they thought; but they never did; and the son--well, I can't express it, Silas! But that young man had about perfect ways." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And after all," [...] {{the young}} lady went on, [...] "here {{we are at the}} end of it very much as though it had never happened. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> able to stop wars in the future?" ...|$|R
