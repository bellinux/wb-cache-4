5000|$|In {{the fourth}} and final {{pre-season}} game, the Steelers' defense once again played well, but the offense was the weak link in a 16-13 loss to the Dallas Cowboys (in what {{would turn out to}} be a preview of the Super Bowl XIII matchup). The Steelers had difficulty running the ball, with six players combining for just 101 yards on 29 rushing attempts. Despite the offensive sluggishness, the Steelers led 13-3 after three quarters. Unfortunately, the defense was worn out (they faced a staggering 82 plays in the game) and they gave up two touchdown passes to Roger Staubach in the fourth quarter. The lack of offensive rhythm led Terry Bradshaw to comment, [...] "I feel terrible. I'm concerned. It's easy to say that it'll come. But I don't want to go into the Buffalo game worried about the offense. ... If <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>this,</b> you'd have to say we have a lot of work to do." ...|$|R

You can't describe it, you can't give it to anybody. Former Wigan manager Steve Bruce has also been highly impressed with Zaki, and has told the press he believes he is [...] "awesome". Bruce said [...] "he put in a fantastic performance.

The cast also included: Stellan Skarsgård (in his sixth film for von Trier), Shia LaBeouf, Willem Dafoe, Jamie Bell, Christian Slater, and Uma Thurman. In {{response}} to claims that he had merely created a [...] "porn film", Skarsgård stated: [...] "... if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> film, it's actually a really bad porn movie, even if you fast forward. And {{after a while you}} find you don't even react to the explicit scenes. They become as natural as seeing someone eating a bowl of cereal." [...] VonTrier refused to attend the private screening due to the negative response to Nazi-related remarks he had made at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, which had led to his expulsion from it. In the director's defense, Skarsgård stated at the screening, [...] "Everyone knows he's not a Nazi, and it was disgraceful the way the press had these headlines saying he was." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1963 and 1964 Ruf {{built the}} house for the chancellor. It was to be a house to live in and also to be a {{representative}} building to welcome guests of state. In a park beside the river Rhine he built a flat-roofed house with large glass-windows, that should show the open democratic way, the new Germany was thinking. The bungalow is designed with two quadrates with two atriums and one part of the house is wide open to the park and the other private part into one atrium with a little swimming pool. When Ludwig Erhard got the keys he said: [...] "You can understand me better, when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> house, as if you would listen to a political speech of mine".Ludwig Erhard and Helmut Schmidt liked the modern building, Willy Brandt, who had young children, stayed in the house he lived in before and used it for state visitors. Helmut Kohl lived there nearly 16 years, until Berlin became the new capital city. Today it is a museum and can be visited. Until today no representative in the world has had such an open residence, as the Chancellor's Bungalow was.|$|E

In the address, he advocated gay law reform, greater concern for the environment, more attention to Aboriginal and unemployed health, and greater co-operation between the medical profession and politicians of all sides to build a better health system. In November, he told a national Aboriginal conference in Sydney that he was ashamed of the medical profession's track record on Aboriginal health, arguing that [...] "doctors need to ask themselves how a person can be well when they've been denied their land, their hunting grounds, their citizenship and freedom and even their own children. Of course Aboriginal people's health has suffered when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> litany of misery". As president, while personally opposing euthanasia, he supported the right of doctors to withdraw treatment from consenting critically ill patients, and supported euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke's case against the Royal Darwin Hospital.|$|E
5000|$|Airing {{opposite}} Nitro {{this night}} was the episode of Raw Is War in which Mick Foley (as Mankind) won the WWF Championship from The Rock. As per their procedures at the time, the WWF had taped this particular episode of Raw Is War six days {{in advance of the}} program's airing and even acknowledged the title change on their website immediately after the taping had concluded. Earlier that night, armed with knowledge of what happened, WCW announcer Tony Schiavone, who was acting on orders from Eric Bischoff, gave away the result of the match before it aired: [...] "Fans, as Hollywood Hogan walks away and <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> 40,000 plus on hand, if you're even thinking about changing the channel to our competition, fans, do not, because we understand that Mick Foley, who wrestled here one time as Cactus Jack, is going to win their world title. Ha! That's gonna put some butts in the seats, heh". Within minutes, as shown by Nielsen ratings, several hundred thousand viewers switched channels from Nitro on TNT to Raw Is War on the USA Network. After Mankind won the title, many fans then switched back to Nitro, which still had five minutes of air time left. The final ratings for the night were 5.7 for Raw Is War and 5.0 for Nitro.|$|E
