25|$|On {{his fourth}} {{worldwide}} release, Viva la Dolce Vita (Universal Music), he remained true to {{his reputation as}} an “Ambassador for the Italian song” while also broadening his horizons by putting an international slant on his natural way with both previously published and original songs. Among the tracks, he gave spirited interpretations of Neapolitan, Sicilian and more Italian standards such as “Gli occhi miei” (Help <b>yourself)</b> <b>the</b> Tom Jones hit or Charlie Chaplin’s “Smile,” in Italian.|$|E

Produced by Jacquire King, responsible for the mainstream success of fellow American rock band Kings of Leon, the album marks as a departure from the band's dark blues rock-influenced folk tales heard in their previous records into a more mainstream sound with lyrics that talk about personal relationships.|$|E

25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood {{is the place to be}} <b>yourself.</b> <b>The</b> individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{finishing}} his stint with Second City in 1988, Mochrie's career {{was quiet for}} a while as he spent some time with his new wife and child. In 1989, he auditioned for the new British Channel 4 improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, but did not make the cut. Mochrie has stated that the audition was a good learning experience because while improv is about setting other people up to be funny, auditions should be about giving <b>yourself</b> <b>the</b> chance to stand out. He moved to Los Angeles the following year, and again auditioned for Whose Line, this time making the cut and was asked to fly to London. He appeared on one episode and was again let go. The third time he auditioned, he earned a regular spot on the show. He spent seven years as a regular on Whose Line Is It Anyway? and remained a cast member until the show's end in 1998.|$|E

25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within <b>yourself</b> <b>the</b> kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the pilot}} were {{generally}} positive. David Hinckley of the New York Daily News called it [...] "bold, different and exciting, with a central character and performance that take your breath away". Hinckley praised Hall's dynamic Emmy-worthy performance, and the [...] "indispensable and haunting" [...] narration. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune claimed [...] "to deny <b>yourself</b> <b>the</b> engrossing Dexter based on its subject matter would be {{to miss out on}} one of television's most fiendishly intelligent new dramas". Ryan enjoyed the series' black comedy aspects, which she thought were [...] "infused with the most pitch-dark irony on television". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe was impressed by Hall's grand performance, especially in his ability to make Dexter likable. Gilbert praised the set designers, comparing the crime scenes to a Vanity Fair photo spread.|$|E

Montgomery stated that [...] "Love Me" [...] and [...] "International Smile" [...] both [...] "seem destined for the dance floors". The latter was inspired by Perry's friend Mia Moretti, and was compared to the songs on Perry's previous album. Lipshutz called it a [...] "straightforward pop-rock offering" [...] and described its guitar hook as [...] "kicky", adding that the song also includes a [...] "Melting Daft Punk-esque vocoder breakdown".

500|$|Due to the father-son {{dynamics}} of the hunting world depicted in the series' first season with the Winchesters, the writers decided to explore a mother-daughter relationship. This resulted in {{the introduction of the}} character Jo Harvelle and her mother Ellen, though the Alex character was eventually renamed Jo. Tal had been a fan of the show, and decided to audition for the role. Since the character was not fully explored during her first few appearances on the show, Tal did not know what her personality would be. Because of the way Jo is introducedthreatening Dean with a rifleTal {{was under the impression that}} the character was an experienced hunter. With this in mind, she decided to portray her as [...] "somewhat confident and cool" [...] by making use of her experience in the Israeli army, where she served for two years. Tal commented, [...] "When I was in the army I was holding my gun and feeling all dangerous and badass.

500|$|On 4 September, Elliot {{sailed to}} Kowloon in the cutter Louisa for food supplies, {{accompanied}} by the small-armed schooner Pearl, and a pinnace from the Volage of Captain Smith. Upon arrival, they encountered three anchored Chinese men-of-war junks, whose presence prevented the regular supplies of food. Elliot sent interpreter Karl Gutzlaff in a small boat with two men to the centremost junk, which Elliot thought was the commanding vessel due to its size and superior equipment. Gutzlaff carried two documents that he translated from Elliot. They included demands for food shipments to be restored and a plea not to repeat the poisoning of the colony's water springs. After a Chinese spokesman read the messages, he told Gutzlaff that they lacked the authority to renew food sales but was willing to report the matter to his superiors. Gutzlaff responded, [...] "Suppose you were without food {{for any length of}} time, and debarred from buying it, would you wait until the case was transmitted to the higher authorities, or procure for <b>yourself</b> <b>the</b> same by every means in your power?" [...] to which they exclaimed, [...] "Certainly nobody will like to starve, and necessity has no law." [...] They then directed him to another junk where a naval officer was said to reside. The local Chinese commander was Lieutenant-Colonel Lai Enjue.|$|E
500|$|Fincher {{supervised}} {{the composition of}} the DVD packaging {{and was one of the}} first directors to participate in a film's transition to home media. The film was released in two DVD editions. The single-disc edition included a commentary track, while the two-disc special edition included the commentary track, behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, fake public service announcements, the promotional music video [...] "This is Your Life", Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, storyboards, and publicity materials. The director worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented the director's vision: [...] "The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for <b>yourself.</b> <b>The</b> more you look at it, the more you'll get out of it." [...] The studio developed the packaging for two months. The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper. The title [...] "Fight Club" [...] was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, [...] "We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's inside." [...] Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, described the design: [...] "From a retail standpoint, [...] has incredible shelf-presence." ...|$|E
