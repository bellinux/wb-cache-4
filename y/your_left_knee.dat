50|$|On July 7, 2016, Ezeli {{signed with}} the Portland Trail Blazers. On August 23, 2016, he was ruled out for six weeks after {{undergoing}} a <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> injection. Two months later, he suffered a minor setback in his comeback from the procedure, with swelling in his <b>left</b> <b>knee.</b> In mid-December, it became apparent to the Trail Blazers that conservative treatment of Ezeli's aching <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> wasn't working, and that season-ending surgery was imminent. On March 8, 2017, he underwent surgery on his <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> and was ruled out for the entire 2016-17 season. On June 30, 2017, he was waived by the Trail Blazers before appearing in a game for them.|$|R

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> showed degenerative arthritis, partial tear of medial meniscus, and a complex fluid collection along the posteromedial aspect of the <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> suggestive of popliteal cyst. He underwent arthroscopy with partial medial meniscectomy. Intraoperative joint fluid was noted to be cloudy but cultures were negative. Arthroscopic procedure provided him with temporary relief but the pain and swelling in the posterior aspect of the <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> recurred in 6 weeks. Repeat MRI showed complex fluid collection in the posterolateral aspect of <b>left</b> <b>knee.</b> Ultrasound guided aspiration of the fluid collection revealed purulent material and cultures grew Actinomyces meyeri.

40|$|SummaryNon-tuberculous {{mycobacteria}} {{are increasingly}} being recognized as important human pathogens. We present {{the case of a}} 44 -year-old non-diabetic male who underwent <b>left</b> total <b>knee</b> arthroplasty for degenerative arthritis after trauma. He developed <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> swelling and progressively worsening pain over the next 4 weeks. He was referred for treatment using whirlpool baths and developed a blister at the surgical incision site. Repeated aspirations of the <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> failed to show any growth of organism on routine cultures. He finally underwent explantation of the <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> prosthesis with antimicrobial spacer placement 4 months later. Cultures of three different intra-operative specimens turned positive for Mycobacterium goodii. This infection was successfully treated with combination oral antimicrobials for 6 months. The patient underwent revision <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> arthroplasty subsequently and was symptom-free until his last follow-up visit 1 year later. This patient highlights the importance of testing for mycobacteria in prosthesis-related infections with previously negative routine bacterial cultures...|$|R
