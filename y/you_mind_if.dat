500|$|There {{was this}} one time where I {{had to take a}} blind lady across the street and I’d never done that before. I took her hand which is so {{obviously}} wrong! You don’t take a stranger’s hand! Like a 45-year-old woman! But once you take someone’s hand you can’t just let go because then you’re admitting your own awkwardness. I just held her hand {{and in the middle of}} the street she turns around and is like, ‘Do <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> we don’t hold hands.’ ...|$|E
500|$|Drayton and Brown {{sat next}} to each other on the bus, Drayton by the aisle and Brown by the window. When Officer Lang arrived at their row, he {{identified}} himself as a police investigator and showed his badge. In a voice [...] "just loud enough" [...] to hear, he said he was a police officer [...] "conducting bus interdiction , attempting to deter drugs and illegal weapons being transported on the bus". When Lang asked Drayton and Brown if they had any luggage on the bus, they both pointed to the same green bag on the overhead luggage rack. Lang asked, [...] "o <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> I check it?", and Brown replied, [...] "o ahead". The officers inspected the bag and discovered no contraband inside.|$|E
500|$|Steinman {{had secured}} a {{contract}} with Meat Loaf's recording label MCA for Lorraine Crosby, a club singer from North East England whom he was managing. While visiting the company's recording studios on Sunset Boulevard, Crosby was asked to provide guide vocals for Meat Loaf, who was recording [...] "I'd Do Anything for Love". Crosby recalls, [...] "I went and sang it twice and I never thought anything more of it until six months later when I {{got a phone call}} saying, 'Would <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> we used your vocals?'" [...] Cher, Melissa Etheridge and Bonnie Tyler had been considered for the role. However, as Crosby had recorded her part as guide vocals, she did not receive any royalties from the song.|$|E

500|$|Officer Lang {{observed}} that Drayton and Brown were wearing [...] "heavy jackets and baggy pants", despite warm weather that day. Lang suspected Brown and Drayton {{might have been}} using their baggy clothing to conceal weapons or drugs, so he asked Brown, [...] "o <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> I check your person?" [...] Brown responded, [...] "ure", leaned up in his seat, removed a cellular phone from his pocket, and opened his jacket. Lang patted down the outside of his clothing and felt small packages [...] "similar to drug packages detected on other occasions". Officer Lang then arrested Brown, handcuffed him, and Officer Hoover walked him off the bus. Lang then asked Drayton, [...] "ind if I check you?", to which Drayton responded [...] "by lifting his hands about eight inches from his legs". Lang detected similar objects during a pat down of Drayton's legs, placed him under arrest, and escorted him off the bus. A further search determined that Brown had duct-taped three bundles containing 483 grams of cocaine between several layers of boxer shorts, and Drayton had duct-taped two bundles between several layers of boxer shorts containing 295 grams of cocaine.|$|E
