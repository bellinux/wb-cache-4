Her sixth husband and widower, writer William Dufty (1916–2002), was {{the co-author of}} Billie Holiday's autobiography Lady Sings the Blues, the author of Sugar Blues, a 1975 best-selling health book still in print, {{and the author of}} the English version of Georges Ohsawa's <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>All</b> Sanpaku.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} depicts complex {{personality and}} devotion to Mary. Her head is gently leaning to her right, {{her eyes are}} half closed, her hands are crossed in devotion; this reminds {{that she is a}} virgin, humble servant of the Lord, merciful mother and patron of the people. At the same time, her head is surrounded by an aureola with golden rays and her body is usually covered in elaborate gold and silver clothes and crowns; these are the symbols of her divine and majestic role as the Queen of Heaven. The painting also reminds of Tota pulchra es (<b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> beautiful), an old Catholic prayer.|$|E

[...] She had expected, however, that progressive forces would {{push for the}} enfranchisment of African Americans and women {{at the same time}} and was distressed when they did not. [...] In 1867, she wrote to Abby Kelley Foster, an abolitionist, to protest the plan to enfranchise black men first. [...] "O Abby", she wrote, [...] "it is a terrible mistake <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> making... There is no other name given by which this country can be saved, but that of woman." ...|$|E

500|$|Robinson's {{promotion}} met {{a generally}} positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players. However, racial tension {{existed in the}} Dodger clubhouse. Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager Leo Durocher informed the team, [...] "I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And {{if any of you}} cannot use the money, I will see that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> traded." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{chief of}} {{thoracic}} surgery, Benjamin L. Aaron, decided {{to perform a}} thoracotomy lasting 105 minutes because the bleeding persisted. Ultimately, Reagan lost over half of his blood volume {{in the emergency room}} and during surgery, which removed the bullet. In the operating room, Reagan removed his oxygen mask to joke, [...] "I hope <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> Republicans." [...] The doctors and nurses laughed, and Giordano, a liberal Democrat, replied, [...] "Today, Mr. President, we are all Republicans." [...] Reagan's post-operative course was complicated by fever, which was treated with multiple antibiotics. The surgery was routine enough that they predicted Reagan would be able to leave the hospital in two weeks and return to work at the Oval Office within a month.|$|E
500|$|The jury {{returned}} guilty verdicts for {{all eight}} defendants. Before being sentenced, Neebe {{told the court}} that Schaack's officers were among the city's worst gangs, ransacking houses and stealing money and watches. Schaack laughed and Neebe retorted, [...] "You need not laugh about it, Captain Schaack. You are one of them. You are an anarchist, as you understand it. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> anarchists, in this sense of the word, I must say." [...] Judge Gary sentenced seven of the defendants to death by hanging and Neebe to 15 years in prison. The sentencing provoked outrage from labor and workers' movements and their supporters, resulting in protests around the world, and elevating the defendants {{to the status of}} martyrs, especially abroad. Portrayals of the anarchists as bloodthirsty foreign fanatics in the press along with the 1889 publication of Captain Schaack's sensational account, Anarchy and Anarchism, on the other hand, inspired widespread public fear and revulsion against the strikers and general anti-immigrant feeling, polarizing public opinion.|$|E

500|$|In January 2005, Ferguson and Wenger were {{embroiled in}} a new row over what had {{happened}} in the tunnel after Pizzagate. Ferguson alleged that Wenger called his players [...] "cheats" [...] and never apologised for his team's behaviour: [...] "It's a disgrace, but I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person." [...] Wenger then claimed Ferguson was guilty of bringing the game into disrepute; he told reporters that he [...] "will never answer any questions any more about this man," [...] but went further to question the motive of the press: [...] "What I don't understand is that he does what he wants and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> at his feet." [...] Both managers came under pressure from the Metropolitan Police Service, then Sports Minister Richard Caborn and Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore {{to put an end to}} the bickering. Ferguson and Wenger agreed to tone down their words, in an attempt to defuse the rivalry. In later years, Ferguson said Arsenal's defeat [...] "scrambled Arsène’s brain" [...] and caused their relationship to breakdown for almost five years.|$|E

He is in a position of power. He pretty much runs the world, and Alice is an annoyance.
