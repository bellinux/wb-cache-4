500|$|In Marc Cherry's first {{script for}} the pilot of Desperate Housewives, the {{character}} was originally named Mary Alice Scott, but he was later forced to change the character's surname when the series {{was picked up by}} ABC. In the book Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors, a companion to the first season of the series, he explained: [...] "We changed Mary Alice Scott to Mary Alice Young because we couldn't get the name cleared with our lawyers. If over three people in the country have that name you're fine but with anything less than that, they make <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> different name. Apparently there was one Mary Alice Scott in the country." [...] The role of Mary Alice was originally given to Sheryl Lee, who portrayed the character in the original pilot that was filmed for ABC, but Lee was soon replaced by Strong after Cherry and the producers decided that Lee was not right for the part. Marcia Cross, who would later be cast as Bree Van de Kamp, also expressed interest in Mary Alice, but after reading for the part Cherry insisted that she read for Bree instead.|$|E
500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that he used the word to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I hate this 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and think no further than what anyone would presume. I hate that angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. I hate it when people talk to me about sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E

500|$|Never Let Me Gos {{score was}} {{composed}} by British composer Rachel Portman. She worked on Never Let Me Gos music for four months. Portman {{said that because}} of the film's sad themes, she wanted to [...] "put some hope" [...] and humanity into the music. It was important to her that there be a [...] "real emotional heartbeat {{in the midst of this}} story." [...] Believing that a [...] "huge sweeping score" [...] would not have fit Never Let Me Go, she instead worked with a smaller orchestra of no more than 48 players. At the urgent request of the director and the producers, she tried other approaches, such as the use of a child's voice and what was described as a [...] "big finale cue." [...] In the end, they went for a simpler and more subtle approach. Stating that most of the score was written for piano, strings and harp, with solos for violin and cello, she called her score something of a [...] "chamber piece". [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> solo instrument, it's like having a voice", she says. [...] "It highlights the emotion." [...] But, she adds, [...] "the violin is played with virtually no vibrato, because I didn't ever want it to sound sentimental". She notes that [...] "for my own taste, I stay on the side of restraint, because I think it works better in film". Her work on Never Let Me Go earned her a San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Score.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} is a transcript provided by [...] from a [...] in which John Mueller of Google speaks about the Title tag {{and its relation to}} SEO:DANIEL PICKEN: I had a quick question. And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but you said that <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I was just wondering what you meant by that, when you say <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search.

2500|$|In Gutenberg's time, inks used by scribes {{to produce}} manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg {{developed}} an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type. His ink was primarily carbon, but {{also had a}} high metallic content, with copper, lead, and titanium predominating. Head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, described it thus: [...] "if you look (at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible) closely you will see {{this is a very}} shiny surface. When you write <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> water based ink, [...] you put your pen into it and it runs off. [...] Now [...] if you print that's exactly what you don't want. One of Gutenberg's inventions was an ink which wasn't ink, it's a varnish. So what we call printer's ink is actually a varnish, and that means it sticks to its surface." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{with similar}} claims was RUC Special Patrol Group officer Billy McCaughey, {{who was one}} of the first RUC {{officers}} on the scene of the massacre. He told Toby Harnden, [...] "the sides of the road were running red with blood and it was the blood of totally innocent Protestants". Afterwards, McCaughey says, he began passing RUC intelligence to loyalist militants and also to participate in their operations. McCaughey was convicted in 1980 of a sectarian killing, the kidnapping of a Catholic priest, and an attempted bombing. However, McCaughey had colluded with loyalists before the Kingsmill attack, and later admitted taking part in the Reavey killings the day before – he claimed he [...] "was at the house but fired no shots". McCaughey also gave his view on how the massacre affected loyalists:I think Kingsmills forced people to ask themselves where they were going, especially the Protestant support base, the civilian support base – the people who were not members of the UVF but would let <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> building or a field. Those people, many of them withdrew. It wasn't because of anything the UVF did. It was fear of retaliation.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors regarding public opinion about illegal immigration is the level of unemployment; anti-illegal immigrant sentiment is highest where unemployment is highest and vice versa. In general, some say that illegal immigrants are taking away jobs from Americans; however businesses and agricultural groups disagree and say that migrant workers are needed to fill unattractive jobs. This is further supported by a May 2006 New York Times/CBS News Poll report that 53 percent of Americans felt [...] "illegal immigrants mostly take the jobs Americans don't want". However, there are others who say that illegal immigration helps to [...] "decimate the bargaining leverage of the American worker. If <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> form of labor recruitment that bids down the cost of labor, that leads you to a society where a small number are very, very rich, there's nobody in the middle, and everyone is left scrambling for crumbs at the bottom. Yet there are still others who say that the U.S. [...] "has an economy that depends on illegal immigration" [...] and [...] "without illegal immigration labor, it would almost certainly not be possible to produce the same volume of food in the country." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, Dragon Quest III {{introduced}} a character progression system allowing the player {{to change the}} party's character classes {{during the course of}} the game, and keep a character's stats and skills learned from previous classes.
