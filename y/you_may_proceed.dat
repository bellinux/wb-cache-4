6000|$|When a {{man says}} that {{democracy}} is false because most people are stupid, there are several courses which the philosopher may pursue. The most obvious is to hit him smartly and with precision on the exact tip of the nose. But if you have scruples (moral or physical) about this course, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>proceed</b> to employ Reason, {{which in this case}} has all the savage solidity of a blow with the fist. It is stupid to say that [...] "most people" [...] are stupid. It is like saying [...] "most people are tall," [...] when it is obvious that [...] "tall" [...] can only mean taller than most people. It is absurd to denounce the majority of mankind as below the average of mankind.|$|E

The face of the country now wears a different aspect: the sides of the hill are under the plough, the verges of the bogs are reclaimed and the southern coast from Skibbereen to Bandon is one continued garden of grain and potatoes except the barren pinnacles of some hills and the boggy hollows between which are preserved for fuel’ (Original in British Library) ...|$|R

Take the first bit of branch or stump that comes to hand, with a fork in it; cut off {{the ends of the}} forking branches, so as to leave the whole only about a foot in length; get a piece of paper the same size, fix your bit of branch in some place where its position will not be altered, and draw it thoroughly, in all its light and shade, full size; striving, above all things, to get an accurate expression of its structure at the fork of the branch. When once you have mastered the tree at its armpits, you will have little more trouble with it.|$|E
60|$|There {{is another}} {{advantage}} in taking up this business singly and by an arrangement {{for the single}} object. It is that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>proceed</b> by degrees. We must all obey the great law of change. It {{is the most powerful}} law of Nature, and the means perhaps of its conservation. All we can do, and that human wisdom can do, is to provide that the change shall proceed by insensible degrees. This has all the benefits which may be in change, without any of the inconveniences of mutation. Everything is provided for as it arrives. This mode will, on the one hand, prevent the unfixing old interests at once: a thing which is apt to breed a black and sullen discontent in those who are at once dispossessed of all their influence and consideration. This gradual course, on the other side, will prevent men long under depression from being intoxicated with a large draught of new power, which they always abuse with a licentious insolence. But, wishing, as I do, the change to be gradual and cautious, I would, in my first steps, lean rather to the side of enlargement than restriction.|$|E

This is because the supplier also owns a duty of care to the arcade owner as well as a contractual duty to provide safe, functioning equipment.|$|E

40|$|Humans {{throughout}} history have always sought {{to mimic the}} appearance, mobility, functionality, intelligent operation, and thinking process of biological creatures. This field of biologically inspired technology, having the moniker biomimetics, has evolved from making static copies of human and animals {{in the form of}} statues to the emergence of robots that operate with realistic behavior. Imagine a person walking towards you where suddenly you notice something weird about him – he is not real but rather he is a robot. Your reaction would probably be “I can’t believable it but this robot looks very real ” just as you would react to an artificial flower that is a good imitation. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> even <b>proceed</b> and touch the robot to check if your assessment is correct but, as oppose to the flower case, the robot may be programmed to respond physical and verbally. This science fiction scenario could become a reality as the current trend continues in developing biologically inspired technologies. Technology evolution led to such fields as artificial muscles, artificial intelligence, and artificial vision as well as biomimetic capabilities in materials science, mechanics, electronics, computing science, information technology and many others. This paper will review {{the state of the art}} and challenges to biologically-inspired technologies and the role that EAP is expected to play as the technology evolves...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{entrance}} from Jalan Tebrau is Jalan Utama. During {{the early}} stages of Kampung Melayu's settlement period, that area were supposedly to be developed into the pekan, or town. Jalan Utama is supposedly to become Kampung Melayu's main entrance road. Since the initial plan changed, Jalan Utama had since became an ordinary linkage road to Jalan Rahmat but remained important. Jalan Utama can be accessed from Jalan Tebrau from Johor Bahru or from the northeast as if after exiting the Johor Bahru toll plaza of the North-South Highway. A notable landmark is the Petronas station, as one passes through, one goes up the first hill. Driving through Jalan Utama about 3 minutes or in 1 kilometre's distance leads to the Jalan Rahmat junction. Turning to the right is the sloppy uphill, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>proceed</b> to the mosque and the village area. Turning left will direct one out of Kampung Melayu from the exit junction with the second traffic light at Jalan Stulang Baru.|$|E
5000|$|On March 9, 1724, the Chapter of Utrecht sent {{a letter}} to all Roman Catholic bishops on the sufferings of the Church of Utrecht, then {{received}} news of the death of Pope Innocent XIII on March 7. Pope Innocent XIII did not confirm Steenoven's election, but neither did he condemn it; the hope was had that his successor might more kindly look upon the plight of the Church of Utrecht. Steenoven and Van Dyck, in their capacity as vicars general of the Chapter, published a pastoral letter asking for the prayers of the faithful for the deceased pope. The next day, on April 8, 1724, the cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church met in conclave and issued a letter in which they reproached the Chapter of Utrecht. The Internuncio also denounced the work of the Chapter of Utrecht in a widely-disbursed pamphlet addressed to all Roman Catholics in Holland. The Chapter responded with a firm reply to the Internuncio. The Chapter also issued a letter to all Catholic deans and chapters, urging them to stand against the papacy's invasion of local church rights; they also wrote to the universities of Louvain, Douai, Paris, Rheims, Nantes, Caen, Poictiers, Cologne, Vienna, Prague, and Strasbourg. On the dearth of replies to the communications of the Chapter of Utrecht, Kemp wrote: [...] "Verily, they were all dumb dogs—they could not bark! Let them all, let bishops, canons, universities, be silent! Such a silence, noble clergy and illustrious Chapter Utrecht, is a clear proof that your Archbishop has been well and validly elected, and that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>proceed</b> with full assurance to his consecration.” ...|$|E

Of how Pearl took to him and insisted on making him her special friend; of the terrible incident of her being swept overboard, and of the gallant rescue. Mrs. Stonehouse was much moved as she spoke. All that fearful time, of which the minutes had seemed years of agony, came back to her so vividly at times that she could hardly speak. Pearl listened too; all eagerness, but without fear. Stephen was greatly moved and held Pearl close to her all the time, as though protecting her. When the mother spoke of her feeling when she saw the brave man struggling up and down the giant waves, and now and again losing sight of him in the trough of the sea, she put out one hand and held the mother's with a grasp which vibrated in sympathy, whilst the great tears welled over in her eyes and ran down her cheeks. Pearl, watching her keenly, said nothing, but taking her tiny cambric handkerchief from her pocket silently wiped the tears away, and clung all the tighter. It was her turn to protect now! ...|$|R

"As {{we are now}} at {{war with}} France, and it is {{possible}} that the vessel in which <b>you</b> are <b>proceeding</b> <b>may</b> be attacked by the way, I have thought it proper that you should be armed. You will, therefore, find in your cabin a brace of pistols, a rifle, and a double-barrel shotgun: which last, I am informed, is a useful weapon at close quarters. Should your avocations in India permit your doing so, you will find them useful in the pursuit of game. I hope that you will not be extravagant; but as a matter of business I find that it is useful to be able to give entertainments, to persons who may be in a position to benefit or advance you. I have, therefore, arranged that you will draw from the factor at Madras the sum of two hundred pounds, annually, in addition to your pay.

Quest cards give objectives; when the four requirements, or Attributes, for the objective are achieved, Experience points are awarded. The Experience total is modified by additional cards that were played on the League cards: Waylays and Treasures.

40|$|Suppose {{there is}} a need to swiftly {{navigate}} through a spatial arrangement of possibly forbidden regions, each region marked with the probability that it is indeed forbidden. In close proximity to any of these regions, you have the dynamic capability of disambiguating the region and learning for certain whether or not the region is forbidden—only in the latter case <b>may</b> <b>you</b> <b>proceed</b> through that region. The central issue is how to most effectively exploit this disambiguation capability to minimize the expected length of the traversal. Regions are never entered while they are possibly forbidden and, thus, no risk is ever actually incurred. Nonetheless, for the sole purpose of deciding where to disambiguate, it may be advantageous to simulate risk, temporarily pretending that possibly forbidden regions are riskily traversable, and each potential traversal is weighted with its level of undesirability, which is a function of its traversal length and traversal risk. Introduced in this paper is the simulated risk disambiguation protocol, which has you follow along a shortest traversal—in this undesirability sense—until an ambiguous region is about to be entered; at that location, a disambiguation is performed on this ambiguous region.
