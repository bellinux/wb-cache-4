500|$|... "A Little Bit" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single, on October 29, 2001. The song was used to promote Bally Total Fitness and thus, a limited CD single pressing was made available to people who joined the club. The song only managed to reach number sixty-two on the Australian Singles Chart. A music video, directed by Hype Williams, features Simpson dancing in a futuristic spaceship-like setting, with her backup dancers. A third single was planned to be released, but after September 11 terrorist attacks, Sony refused to promote a third single, which Joe Simpson believed critical for Jessica's prospects.

500|$|Ernest's {{support of}} the Prussians in the Austro-Prussian War and later Franco Prussian War meant {{he was no longer}} the {{potential}} leader of a political movement; although it was true that {{he had been able to}} retain his duchies, it had come at a price. According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat, Ernest [...] "was increasingly lost in a whirl of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside". Ernest funneled his political thoughts into the private sphere, preferring to write covertly sponsored articles in the Coburg press that became increasingly embittered against England. In 1886, Ernest published Co-Regents and Foreign Influence in Germany, a pamphlet that greatly angered his family; though produced anonymously, no one doubted that it was written by Ernest. It attacked Vicky as a disloyal German that was too dependent on her mother, and declared that she had been too indiscreet in passing along confidential information during both war and peacetime. Queen Victoria was furious, writing to Vicky, [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me of Uncle E and that pamphlet is simply monstrous. I assure you that I felt great difficulty in writing to him for his birthday, but I wrote it as short and cool as I could consistently with civility". [...] "Dear Uncle Ernest does us all a great deal of harm by his odd ways and uncontrollable tongue with his very lively imagination".|$|E

When Hutch asks {{him if he had}} ever heard of the archery-champion-turned-actor Howard Hill, Dillon replies: [...] "I don't think so... <b>You</b> <b>told</b> me about Zhou Tong". Hutch then says: [...] "Oh, yeah. Zhou Tong was something. Taught the Song Dynasty to be the best military archers in history. But Howard Hill [...] ". Later in chapter fifty, while Hutch is trailing a killer through an airport, a page goes out over the intercom system for a [...] "Mr. Zhou Tong". When the page goes out again, Hutch muses: [...] "Zhou Tong had been a famous archery teacher and military arts tutor in the Song Dynasty. [...] had long telephone conversations about him, because of Tong's blending of archery skills and self-discipline.

500|$|It is an R {{song with}} {{elements}} of electro. Lyrically, Carey is recounting a past relationship which fell into [...] "violent times", {{and how she}} still deals {{with the effects of}} what she experienced. Carey begins with the line [...] "I was a girl/ You were ‘the man'/ I was too young to understand/ I was naïve /Believing everything <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me." [...] Although Carey never mentions Mottola's name, many critics believed that she was addressing him directly in the lines [...] "Shining like a chandelier/ That decorated every room inside/ The private hell we built", [...] "Sleeping with the enemy, aware that he was smothering every last part of me" [...] and [...] "Said you were strong/ Protecting me/ Then I found out that you were weak/ Keepin' me there, under your thumb/ Cause you were scared that I'd become much/ More than you could handle." [...] After confessing that she would [...] " [...] up scared some nights, still dreaming about the violent times," [...] Carey decides {{to walk away from the}} relationship, and declares [...] "but I still live with the side effects".

500|$|Walter Afanasieff, long-time Mariah Carey collaborator, {{worked with}} Simpson on three cuts from Irresistible. One of the songs, [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Told</b> Me You Loved Me", {{was written by}} Afanasieff in {{collaboration}} with Billy Mann. In an interview with Allpop, Simpson named the song {{as one of her}} favorites and said, [...] "I really base that on a situation of a friend of mine whose parents are divorced. I like the emotion behind that song." [...] Cory Rooney wrote [...] "Hot Like Fire" [...] solely, which Simpson described as [...] "certainly not kid stuff", a song [...] "with a lot of attitude." [...] Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters were also brought in to write and produce songs for the album. One of the cuts, [...] "For Your Love", according to Simpson, is reminiscent of [...] "I Wanna Love You Forever" [...] (1999). Simpson covered the gospel hymn [...] "His Eye is on the Sparrow" [...] as the last song of the album. She said, [...] "I wanted to give my audience a piece of my heart and soul. The message is there's so much in life that can get you discouraged, but if you trust that you're being watched over, you have a reason to live and a sense of freedom. It's different for everyone, but for me, my relationship with God is the way I clear out the shadows that hang in our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|... "All Around the World" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jenna Rubenstein of MTV {{thought that the}} [...] "fist-pumping club banger" [...] is a complete departure from Bieber's previous work, while Diadem Pambid of the International Business Times stated that the singer joined the [...] "'synth-pop' bandwagon" [...] along with Britney Spears, Chris Brown and Usher. Jocelyn Vena also of MTV stated that the song could have been recorded by Usher, due to its [...] "grinding, fist-pumping" [...] background. Entertainment Weekly columnist Ray Rahman gave [...] "All Around the World" [...] a positive review, and stated: [...] "a Euro beat worthy of The Wanted? The vocal swagger of Chris Brown? Lyrics smacking of One Direction? Check, check, and check, please!" [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect rated [...] "All Around the World" [...] five out of five stars, and commented that the track {{is not only a}} sequel to [...] "Baby", but is also [...] "a whole new level for pop itself." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator explained that the song {{is a good example of}} how Bieber is taking [...] "baby steps to 'swaggy' adulthood through the evolution of his music — keep the content G-Rated, but make the beat something the older club-going crowd can enjoy. So far, it’s working." [...] Amy Sciaretto of Pop Crush gave the track a mixed review, and deemed it as highly similar to the work of Spears, stating: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>told</b> us this song was penned for Britney Spears for her last album Femme Fatale, we'd Believe it, because the computerized style and the thick vocal effects remind us of recent Brit material. It's safe to say that 'All Around the World' is a club banger. And while we love Bieber, it's not our favorite song on Believe so far." ...|$|E

500|$|... "When <b>You</b> <b>Told</b> Me You Loved Me" [...] {{is another}} power ballad about love, this time {{utilizing}} a spanish guitar. Backed by a full 60 piece orchestra, {{the song and}} Simpson's vocals were {{compared to that of}} Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. [...] "Hot Like Fire", which received positive reviews from critics, is a funky mid-tempo number. Compared to the likes of Michael Jackson and Destiny's Child, the song begins with a [...] "faux" [...] telephone call between Simpson and her friend; the latter explains that Simpson's boyfriend has been cheating on her. The lyrics, sung with [...] "hard edge vocals" [...] over synth horns, hip-hop beats, and electronica rhythms, demonstrate Simpson's annoyance at being cheated on by her boyfriend. [...] "Imagination" [...] is a song with electronic and R influences. Rick de Yampert of The Daytona Beach News-Journal commented that the song contained Stevie Wonder-styled funk music. [...] "To Fall in Love Again" [...] and [...] "For Your Love" [...] are ballads; the former is backed by a 60 piece orchestra, and Peter Marsh of BBC Music noted it [...] "morphs [...] into an R'n'B tinged slow jam." [...] It also contains a jazz breakdown, towards its end. Bob Waliszewski wrote that through the latter, [...] "Simpson pledges devotion to a partner". [...] "I Never", produced by Darkchild, infuses Spanish guitars, and has an [...] "urban" [...] tinge. The song portrays the theme of self-respect, and has Simpson getting rid of her cheating partner. The closing track, the cover of the hymn [...] "His Eye Is on the Sparrow", is backed by a gospel choir and [...] "praises God for watching over His children". Reviewers called it one of the standout tracks from the album. According to Kirsten Koba of PopMatters, Simpson sings it [...] "with a depth and passion that is lacking {{on the rest of the}} album." ...|$|E
