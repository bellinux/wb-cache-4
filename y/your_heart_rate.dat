500|$|Super Meat Boys soundtrack was {{composed}} by Danny Baranowsky, who previously composed the soundtracks for the indie video games Canabalt, Cortex Command, and Gravity Hook. He also composed {{the music for}} the original Meat Boy. McMillen knew of Baranowsky's other work, and approached him late in Meat Boys development, asking him to supply whatever tracks he had on hand. For the soundtrack of Super Meat Boy, Baranowsky incorporated the music he had provided for Meat Boy into an expanded soundtrack. He tried {{to ensure that the}} music would accompany the action on the screen without overpowering the sound effects. Baranowsky was given complete freedom for the game's music, and retained all of the rights to it; McMillen believed that being more invested in the game would let Baranowsky express the part of him that was [...] "manic, obsessive, complex, and full of life". McMillen feels that the soundtrack [...] "gets <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> up, complements every aspect of its gameplay, and stays with you for days".|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, {{only hours}} after the Virginia Tech {{shooting}} (and before Seung-Hui Cho was actually identified), Thompson predicted that the shooter had trained on the game Counter-Strike. According to Thompson, the game [...] "drills you and gives you scenarios on how to kill them [...] gets you to kill them with <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> lower." [...] He says that Seung-Hui [...] "was in a hyper-reality situation in virtual reality." [...] Though Seung-Hui had last been known to have played Counter-Strike in high school, four {{years prior to the}} shooting, Thompson asserts that [...] "you don't drop it when you go to college, typically." [...] Thompson disputed Seung-Hui's roommate's claim that Seung-Hui only used his computer to write fiction, on the grounds that [...] "Cho was able to go room to room calmly, efficiently, coolly killing people." [...] Prior to being identified, Thompson attributed the [...] "flat effect on [...] face" [...] and the efficiency of his attack to video game rehearsals of the shooting. However, a search warrant released, listing the items found in Cho's dorm room, did not contain any video games, and a Washington Post story cited by Thompson later removed a paragraph stating that Seung-Hui enjoyed violent video games in high school. Despite all evidence indicating that Seung-Hui had not played Counter-Strike in years, Thompson continued to insist that [...] "this is not rocket science. When a kid who has never killed anyone in his life goes on a rampage and looks like the Terminator, he's a video gamer." [...] Thompson also sent a letter to Bill Gates, saying, [...] "Mr. Gates, your company is potentially legally liable (for) the harm done at Virginia Tech. Your game, a killing simulator, according to the news that {{used to be in the}} Post, trained him to enjoy killing and how to kill." [...] However, Microsoft did not create Counter-Strike - they only published the Xbox version of the game.

40|$|What {{does the}} <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> signify? It’s {{a window into}} your muscles and lungs; it reveals how hard they are working. <b>Your</b> <b>heart</b> pounds to pump {{oxygen-rich}} blood to your muscles and to carry cell waste products away from your muscles. The more you demand of your muscles, the harder <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> has to work to perform these tasks. That means <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> must beat faster to deliver more blood. The <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> gives a good indication during exercise routines of how effective that routine is improving your health. Once only used by elite athletes, <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> monitors are now becoming an essential tool for everyone from the casual athlete to the personal trainer.

40|$|Two University of Notre Dame Australia medical {{students}} {{will attempt to}} break a world record by {{running up and down}} Jacob’s ladder in Western Australia’s Kings Park for 24 hours. Jonathan Hague and classmate Bernard Cregan will try to break the Guinness World record for the most height climbed in 24 hours by attempting to ascend the popular 43 metre stair climb approximately 350 times. The current world record stands at 15, 000 m set in 2004 when Kurt Hess ascended the Swiss Esterli Tower 333. 3 times. Jonathan, a national volleyball and beach volleyball player, was first introduced to Jacob’s ladder in 2005 when he moved to Perth from Adelaide for his studies. “For me it is the perfect interval training for fitness, as each lap pushes <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> slightly higher until you max out,” he said. Jonathan’s idea of a Jacob’s Challenge formed {{at the end of last}} year. After consulting Guinness World Records, he has been training progressively harder with Bernard to prepare for the ‘absolute pain-fest’. The pair are now looking forward to the challenge. “I am heading into the unknown but can’t wait to find my limit wherever that lies on Jacob’s ladder,” Jonathan said. Whilst attempting a world record the students will also be raising money for Variety Club WA, supporting sick, disadvantage and special needs children. “We wanted to do something beneficial, not just the challenge. It will be a great way to raise money and awareness for the work of Variety WA - whilst attempting something a little crazy,” Jonathan said...|$|E
40|$|Over {{recent years}} the world has seen a spike in the {{download}} and usage of fitness and health apps. In 2014 fitness app usage grew at a substantial rate, being up there as the most used category of application for that year. Since then it has maintained its user base and continues to grow, with the inclusion of wearables like google fit, Fitbit and Healthkit. This is {{the dawn of a}} new era, an era where people look more to their mobiles or their fitness watches to check on their health, rather than the traditional method of going and seeing a doctor. These apps provide a great avenue for those who are interested on tracking their fitness levels runners, cyclists, and gym goers alike. Everything can be tracked nowadays, even the standard iPhone comes with a health app built in, with a range of features. There are several highly successful fitness apps on the market, some of these include mapmyrun, mapmyride, and the FitBit app. Both mapmyrun and mapmyride are made by the same group and are simple route trackers for running and cycling. Once your journey is finished the app then gives detailed statistics of the route and calories burned.
