500|$|On 28 May 2011, {{immediately}} following the broadcast of [...] "The Almost People", the BBC released a prequel to [...] "A Good Man Goes to War". The prequel had Dorium talking to two Headless Monks. He gives them the brain of a Judoon, which contains a security protocol the monks need. Dorium tells them he knows what they are up to, as he has heard rumours around the area. He asks them, [...] "All this, to imprison one child? Oh, I know what you're up to, I hear everything in this place. I even hear rumours about whose child you've taken. Are <b>you</b> <b>mad?</b> You know the stories about the Doctor? The things that man has done? God help us if you make him angry!" ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{had more}} mixed to negative {{responses to the}} song. The Tartan's Laura Scherb commended the track as [...] "adding to the beautiful representation {{of the destruction of}} Simba’s kingdom and the peace of the paradise in which he hides", but he noted that the audience felt at unease due to their lack of familiarity with the new material. Brandon Jones of The Global Dispatch criticized [...] "The Madness of King Scar" [...] and [...] "Chow Down" [...] as [...] "a bit too tedious", and felt that the beginning of the second act was too long. Heather Violanti was critical of the song's content, writing that its [...] "disgusting jokes about intestinal worms may drive <b>you</b> <b>mad</b> yourself", and negatively compared it to the Lebo M.-written [...] "One by One".|$|E

500|$|Official Xbox Magazine {{gave the}} game a 4.5 {{out of a}} {{possible}} 10, stating, [...] "Whether you're swinging a pipe or a scalpel, the controls never feel responsive, and rotten collision detection will drive <b>you</b> <b>mad</b> before Jigsaw's twisted games even have the chance." [...] David Clayman, writer for IGN, gave Saw a 7.5 {{out of a possible}} ten, earning it a rating of [...] "Good". Clayman praised the unique take on the survival horror franchise and the omnipresence of Jigsaw, but criticized the repetitive puzzles and the flawed combat system. Clayman even called the combat the Achilles' heel of the game. He went on to say: Overall, Saw is a welcome entry in the horror genre that provides a good dosage of thrills. Depending on your tolerance for repetition, it's a good way to test your nerves and scare yourself silly during a dark and stormy night.|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 2015, Carey {{posted a}} photo on her Instagram account {{accompanied}} by Hudson, French Montana and Justin Bieber at recording studio Record Plant in Hollywood. It {{was reported by}} TMZ that Carey, Hudson and Montana were working on a remix to [...] "Infinity", and that Bieber [...] "decided to pop in". They played the remix to Bieber, who after expressing his admiration for Carey and the song, decided to contribute some vocals to it. On August 8, TMZ leaked {{what appeared to be}} the final mix of the track, called [...] "Why <b>You</b> <b>Mad?</b> (Infinity Remix)", featuring Montana, Bieber and T.I.. With Carey only performing the hook to the original version of [...] "Infinity", the theme of the remix is that she rejects each of the three featured artists proposals. The song begins with a [...] "laconic rap" [...] by Montana, followed by Carey singing the hook over a [...] "synth-laden chorus", which has a heavier instrumental and bass compared to the original version.|$|E
2500|$|Bono {{described}} the song's theme as such: [...] "It {{is a song}} about coming together, but it's not the old hippie idea of 'Let's all live together.' It is, in fact, the opposite. It's saying, We are one, but we're not the same. It's not saying we even want to get along, but {{that we have to}} get along together in this world if it is to survive. It's a reminder that we have no choice". The Edge described it on one level as a [...] "bitter, twisted, vitriolic conversation between two people who've been through some nasty, heavy stuff". On another level, he suggested that the line [...] "we get to carry each other" [...] introduces [...] "grace" [...] to the song and that the wording [...] "get to" [...] (instead of [...] "got to") is essential, as it suggests that it is a privilege to help one another, not an obligation. The band have been told by many fans that they played the song at their weddings, prompting Bono to respond, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>mad?</b> It's about splitting up!" [...] There was some speculation that the song described a conversation between a father and his HIV-positive gay son, based on the connection of the song to David Wojnarowicz, a gay artist who died of AIDS.|$|E

2500|$|Joe {{was then}} {{announced}} as the teammate of Kevin Nash and Scott Hall in their match against the Angle Alliance at Turning Point. Hall, however, no-showed the event. Before the match, Joe {{was asked to}} cut a promo alleviating heat from the company and introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe went five minutes overtime and ranted against Hall (whom he sarcastically referred to as [...] "The Phantom of the Impact Zone"), Nash and some other superstars, which legitimately upset Nash and TNA President Dixie Carter at ringside. Before calling Young {{to come to the}} ring he told the TNA ringside staff, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>mad?</b> Go ahead, fire me, I don't care". Joe, Nash and Young defeated the Angle Alliance when Joe pinned Tomko after a Muscle Buster. After the match, Joe and Nash briefly argued and shoved one another backstage, with Joe apologizing at a talent meeting the following day. On-screen, though, Joe continued to direct his frustration towards TNA management, going as far as to trash a Christmas party organized by Matt Morgan. In storyline, after complaining to Jim Cornette {{that he did not have}} a match at Final Resolution, Cornette decided to team Joe with Kevin Nash, who was to receive a title shot with Scott Hall when he returned. At Final Resolution, Joe, along with his tag team partner Kevin Nash lost to the team of A.J. Styles and Tomko. This occurred after Nash refused to tag himself into the match leaving Joe to fend for himself. In addition, Nash [...] "flipped off" [...] Joe whilst leaving the ringside area. After Nash had screwed Joe at Final Resolution, a furious Joe stormed to the backstage area on the hunt for Nash, only to find him welding a baseball bat for protection and refusing to fight Joe unless they got paid. Nash explained to Joe that he was teaching him a lesson about the wrestling business and told Joe he could help him to the top if he followed his direction. In good faith, Nash gave Joe the bat and implored to hit him if he was not satisfied with his explanation. Joe was still fuming, but let Nash go without incident. On the January 24 edition of Impact!, Joe went on a rampage, attacking several TNA employees, culminating in his attacking of Jeremy Borash after being announced as the MVP of 2007.|$|E
