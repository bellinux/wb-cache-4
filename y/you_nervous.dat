3000|$|Once you {{are getting}} so nervous in the conversation, try to relax but it is always hard. Because once you make a mistake, <b>you</b> will feel <b>nervous.</b> Once <b>you</b> feel <b>nervous,</b> <b>you</b> will make more mistakes. So just stop {{for a few seconds}} trying to adjust {{yourself}} and back to the right side. (P 10, ED, Advanced) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|And {{to herself}} she was saying: 'God, why am I so nervous--why are <b>you</b> so <b>nervous,</b> <b>you</b> fool. If {{he sees it}} I'm done for forever--you KNOW you're done for forever, if he sees the absurd state you're in.' ...|$|R

Whereas Pylyshyn explains cognitive (im) penetrability by focusing solely on computations {{carried out by}} <b>thee</b> <b>nervous</b> system, according to the ecological approach the perceiver as a knowing agent influences the entire animal-environmental system: in the determination of what constitutes the environment (affordantes), what constitutes information, what information is detected and, thus, what is perceived...|$|R

6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS (to THE PORTER, {{who walks}} {{away to the}} end of the car, and sits down near the door). Oh, thank you. Aunty, do <b>you</b> feel <b>nervous</b> the least bit? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'All {{the more}} reason, {{when there is}} but one. Perhaps it is because you are tired out that <b>you</b> get <b>nervous</b> and agitated. <b>You</b> will be quite {{different}} after a rest.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Positive fact I {{never knew}} Mark Twain {{to make me}} tired before. Positive fact." [...] Ross slammed [...] "Roughing It" [...] on the floor. [...] "When you're snowbound this-away you want tragedy, I guess. Humor just seems to bring out all your cussedness. You read a man's poor, pitiful {{attempts}} to be funny and it makes <b>you</b> so <b>nervous</b> <b>you</b> want to tear the book up, get out your bandana, and have a good, long cry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{there is}} room enough in Adele's little bed for you. You must share it with her to-night, Jane: {{it is no wonder}} that the {{incident}} you have related should make <b>you</b> <b>nervous,</b> and I would rather you did not sleep alone: promise me to go to the nursery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eighty. Call him {{a hundred}} pound at the outside. He's worth about four 'n' a half dollars. Ain't it awful? Ain't {{it enough to}} give <b>you</b> <b>nervous</b> prostration? Ain't it paralysin'? Why, I come just around that curve--" [...] and the Mogul told the tale again, for he was very badly shaken.|$|E
6000|$|Mitchy looked with {{interest}} into his hat. [...] "Then {{what is it}} I'm to 'leave' to you?"

60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. <b>You</b> are too <b>nervous,</b> Caroline. Believe me, <b>you</b> are too <b>nervous.</b> Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day. I was {{in hopes}} {{he would have}} married lady Kelso. But I believe he said her family was too large. Or was it her feet? I forget which. I regret it very much. She was made to be an ambassador's wife.|$|R
6000|$|But {{how was he}} to get at her {{to prosecute}} his suit? As to writing to her direct,--he didn't much believe in that. [...] "It looks as though one were afraid of her, you know;--which I ain't the least. I stood up to her before, and I wasn't a bit more nervous than I am at this moment. Were <b>you</b> <b>nervous</b> in that affair with Miss Maxwell?" ...|$|E
60|$|Smiling, passing {{each other}} the pressed-glass pickle-dish, seeing Mrs. Gurrey's linty supper-cloth {{irradiated}} {{by the light of}} intimacy, Vida and Raymie talked about Carol's rose-colored turban, Carol's sweetness, Carol's new low shoes, Carol's erroneous theory that there was no need of strict discipline in school, Carol's amiability in the Bon Ton, Carol's flow of wild ideas, which, honestly, just simply made <b>you</b> <b>nervous</b> trying to keep track of them.|$|E
60|$|It was a rainy afternoon, and we {{had been}} passing the time by telling ghost stories. That {{is a very good}} sort of thing for a rainy afternoon, and it is a much better time than after night. If you tell ghost stories after dark they are apt to make <b>you</b> <b>nervous,</b> whether you own up to it or not, and you sneak home and dodge upstairs in mortal terror, and undress with your back to the wall, so that you can't fancy there is {{anything}} behind you.|$|E
60|$|COKESON. You don't want {{to upset}} {{the young man in}} there, do <b>you?</b> He's a <b>nervous</b> young feller.|$|R
6000|$|Hetty laughed mockingly. [...] "You and I {{are going}} to drive over to the Newcombes and stay the night. <b>You</b> get <b>nervous</b> when my father is away. But {{we are not going}} there quite straight; and you had better put your warmest things on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will drive}} {{you to the}} hotel {{by way of the}} stables, and you can go at once to your room and change your clothes. You are tired, <b>you</b> are <b>nervous</b> and worried, and want rest. Don't tell me {{anything}} now until you feel quite yourself again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not all the time, {{too much}} {{confinement}} makes <b>you</b> <b>nervous,</b> {{and then you}} are unfitted for everything. Besides, you owe something to John {{as well as to}} the babies. Don't neglect husband for children, don't shut him out of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it. His place is there as well as yours, and the children need him. Let him feel that he has a part to do, and he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it will be better for you all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That 's {{a view of}} the {{situation}} I can't accept; in your own interest, no less than in mine. It can only make us both very uncomfortable. I know all I owe you; I feel it; you know that! But I am not a small boy nor an outer barbarian any longer, and, whatever I do, I do with my eyes open. When I do well, the merit 's mine; if I do ill, the fault 's mine! The idea that I make <b>you</b> <b>nervous</b> is detestable. Dedicate your nerves to some better cause, and believe that if Miss Garland and I have a quarrel, we shall settle it between ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{must surely}} be some special and secret manufactory for the {{production}} of lodging-house ornaments. Precisely the same articles are to be found at every lodging-house all over the kingdom, and they are never seen anywhere else. There are the two--what do you call them? they stand one {{at each end of the}} mantel-piece, where they are never safe, and they are hung round with long triangular slips of glass that clank against one another and make <b>you</b> <b>nervous.</b> In the commoner class of rooms these works of art are supplemented by a couple of pieces of china which might each be meant to represent a cow sitting upon its hind legs, or a model of the temple of Diana at Ephesus, or a dog, or anything else you like to fancy. Somewhere about the room you come across a bilious-looking object, which at first you take to be a lump of dough left about by one of the children, but which on scrutiny seems to resemble an underdone cupid. This thing the landlady calls a statue. Then there is a [...] "sampler" [...] worked by some idiot related to the family, a picture of the [...] "Huguenots," [...] two or three Scripture texts, and a highly framed and glazed certificate to the effect that the father has been vaccinated, or is an Odd Fellow, or something of that sort.|$|E

50|$|In {{a letter}} to Horace Mann, from Strawberry Hill, dated Sunday, August 29, 1762, Horace Walpole ended his long epistle: PS. When I was {{mentioning}} acquaintance you have lost, I forgot to name Lady Fane; <b>you</b> see <b>nervous</b> disorders are not very mortal; I think {{she must have been}} above seventy.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} your {{first chance to}} do a bit of regular auctioneering," [...] smiled Andy. [...] "I trust <b>you</b> are not <b>nervous</b> over the prospects." ...|$|R
60|$|My dearest Miss Mitford,--I {{am quite}} in pain {{to have to}} write a {{farewell}} to you after all. As soon as Wilson had returned--and she stayed away much longer than last year--we found ourselves pushed {{to the edge of}} our time for remaining in England, and the accumulation of business to be done before we could go pressed on us. I am almost mad with the amount of things to be done, as it is; but I should have put the visit to you at the head of them, and swept all the rest on one side for a day, if it hadn't been for the detestable weather, and my horrible cough which combines with it. When Wilson came back she found me coughing in my old way, and it has been without intermission up to now, or rather waxing worse and worse. To have gone down to you and inflicted the noise of it on you would have simply made <b>you</b> <b>nervous,</b> while the risk to myself would have been very great indeed. Still, I have waited and waited, feeling it scarcely possible to write to you to say, 'I am not coming this year.' Ah, I am so very sorry and disappointed! I hoped against hope for a break in the weather, and an improvement in myself; now we must go, and there is no hope. For about a fortnight I have been a prisoner in the house. This climate won't let me live, there's the truth. So we are going on Monday. We go to Paris for a week or two, and then to Florence, and then to Rome, and then to Naples; but we shall be back next year, if God pleases, and then I shall seize an early summer day to run down straight to you and find you stronger, if God blesses me so far. Think of me and love me a little meanwhile. I shall do it by you. And do, do--since there is no time to hear from you in London--send a fragment of a note to Arabel for me, that I may have it in Paris before we set out on our long Italian journey. Let me have the comfort of knowing exactly how you are before we set out. As for me, I expect to be better on crossing the Channel. How people manage to live and enjoy life in this fog and cold is inexplicable to me. I understand the system of the American rapping spirits considerably better....|$|E
