500|$|There {{was some}} racially tinged comic bantering in the series, such as scenes with Noland giving cotton to {{a nurse and}} stating, [...] "Honey, picking cotton is part of my heritage," [...] or observing some {{adhesive}} strips labeled [...] "flesh colored" [...] and remarking, [...] "Maybe this is <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> flesh colored, but it wouldn't make it in my neighborhood." [...] Aside from these, racial issues were avoided, as Asher and Ackerman felt that ABC {{was not interested in}} having them mixed into the comedy.|$|E
500|$|Although Shields feared a {{critical}} panning, reviews of Loveless were almost unanimously favourable. [...] "An album without parallel", wrote Andrew Perry in Select. [...] "Its creative inspiration defies belief. Though 'To Here Knows When' is pretty well the weirdest {{track of the}} eleven, that glorious distortion gives a fair signal of what to expect – the unexpected. Everything you hear confounds <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how a pop song should be played, arranged and produced." [...] "The instrumental 'Touched' is especially startling", noted Martin Aston in Q, [...] "like a drunken fight between a syrupy Disney soundtrack and an Eastern mantra. All in all, Loveless amounts to a virtual reinvention of the guitar." ...|$|E
500|$|Cardinale {{published}} an autobiography, with Anne Mori, Io Claudia, Tu Claudia in 1995. She {{has been a}} regular attendee of the Academy Awards. Her awards have included an honorary Golden Lion at the 1993 Venice Film Festival, and an honorary Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival. The Los Angeles Times Magazine, in a February 2011 online feature, named Cardinale among the 50 most beautiful women in film history. Cardinale said of her acting, [...] "I never felt scandal and confession were necessary to be an actress. I've never revealed my self or even my body in films. Mystery is very important." [...] In a 2014 interview, she revealed her secret of success: [...] "If you want to practise this craft, {{you have to have}} inner strength. Otherwise, you’ll lose <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> who you are. Every film I make entails becoming a different woman. And in front of a camera, no less! But when I’m finished, I’m me again." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the debate}} over {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "redskin", team {{supporters}} frequently cite a paper by Ives Goddard, a Smithsonian Institution senior linguist and curator emeritus, who asserts that the term was a direct translation of words used by Native Americans to refer to themselves and was benign in its original meaning. In an interview Goddard admits that it is impossible to verify if the native words were accurately translated. Darren R. Reid, a history lecturer at Coventry University, contends that Native American usage was generally attributed to them by European writers. Reid states that the team logo works together with the name to reinforce an unrealistic stereotype: [...] "It is not up to non-Indians to define an idealized image of what it is to a Native American." [...] The [...] "positive" [...] stereotypes allow fans and supporters to honestly state that they are honoring Native Americans, but this is [...] "...forcing <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what it is to honour those people onto them and that, fundamentally, is disrespectful." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, other columnists {{applauded the}} film's comedic theme. A. O. Scott of The New York Times {{imparted}} [...] "it's not as cheekily knowing as the Scream movies or as trashily Grand Guignol as the Evil Dead franchise, but like those pictures it recognizes the {{close relationship between}} fright and laughter, and dispenses both with a free, unpretentious hand." [...] C. W. Nevius of San Francisco Chronicle conveyed its [...] "funnier than the original." [...] Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide pronounced [...] "if this is <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> fun, step right up." [...] William Arnold of Seattle Post-Intelligencer found it as [...] "a series of Grand Guignol skits played for mean-spirited laughs." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle admired how [...] "it is surprisingly good fun for {{the current crop of}} horror films, reasonably well-plotted and full of jaw-dropping, white-knuckle scares. That said, it’s most definitely not for the squeamish nor the easily offended." [...] Nev Pierce of BBC saw that [...] "it's simple, but effective"; whereas Sheila Norman-Culp of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution proclaimed that [...] "what Final Destination did for the fear of flying, Final Destination 2 does for the fear of driving." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 15, Madonna threw a pre-release {{party at}} New York City's Industria Superstudio, and signed all the invitations under her Sex alter ego [...] "Dita". During the party, Madonna showed up dressed as Little Bo Peep and even carried {{with her a}} stuffed toy lamb. Madonna's {{publicist}} Liz Rosenberg showed concern at first due to [...] "what the parents of America's impressionable teens will soon be thinking" [...] but later said that it [...] "all depends on <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> lovemaking, which in Madonna's case, should give {{new meaning to the}} word erotic". Both Waldenbooks and Barnes & Noble prepared corporate statements that the managers could share with customers who are offended by Sex. (Both statements defended the right of bookstores to provide [...] "diversity and choice" [...] to customers and say censorship is not the role of bookstores.) Many book stores, too, stated that the book would not be sold to anyone under 18 {{and that it would be}} for display only behind the cash register. Bookstore owner David Epstein stated that [...] "The feeling of most people who have ordered the book is that Madonna is something special, that this is cutting-edge art, , they're not the kind of people who are buying it because it's smut and dirty pictures. People are interested in it as art." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, very well, {{since my}} {{daughter}} insists on it, pray come in," [...] and he bowed. [...] "If such an intrusion falls in with <b>your</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> decency {{it is not}} for me to complain." ...|$|R

2500|$|Sun Quan responded, [...] "The old villain has harboured the {{intention}} of usurping the Han dynasty for a long time, but he feared the two Yuans (Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu), Lü Bu, Liu Biao and me. Now, all the others have been destroyed and I'm the only one left. The old villain and me cannot coexist together. <b>Your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> going to war coincides closely with my thoughts.

6000|$|... "I expect <b>your</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> what's {{interesting}} {{are different}} from mine. Concrete's all right in the daytime, though you can have {{too much of it}} then, but you want to please your eye and relax your brain at night." ...|$|R

60|$|To {{the anthropological}} philosopher 'a plain man' would {{naturally}} put the question: 'Having got <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> spirit or soul--your theory of Animism--out {{of the idea}} of ghosts, and having got <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> ghosts out of dreams and visions, how do you get at the Idea of God?' Now by 'God' the proverbial 'plain man' of controversy means a primal eternal Being, author of all things, the father and friend of man, the invisible, omniscient guardian of morality.|$|E

6000|$|The man {{gazed at}} her in surprise. Though he was {{prepared}} for much, he was scarcely prepared for such devotion to principle.

Surely, surely, you won't carry <b>your</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> freedom to such an extreme, such a dangerous conclusion!" ...|$|R
6000|$|...
