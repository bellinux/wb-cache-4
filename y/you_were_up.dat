60|$|REDPENNY. Old Paddy Cullen {{was here}} before <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up,</b> {{to be the}} first to congratulate you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] he stammered. [...] "Worthy {{said that}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> here, but I {{thought he was}} crazy the way he talked--I didn't think--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, la, la!" [...] Sophy exclaimed. [...] "Is {{that all}} you have to tell us? I shall begin to think that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> to {{mischief}} there." ...|$|E
60|$|SIR HOWARD (looking suspiciously at her). Cicely: <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>up</b> to some devilment.|$|R
6000|$|... "My eye!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Whose clothes have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> stealing? What have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>up</b> to, eh? Committing a {{burglary}} or a murder?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. He {{heard that}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> hard <b>up</b> just now, and that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going <b>up</b> the river a {{considerable}} distance to hunt--is not that so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{the thing}} for the children, ma'am. You've none of your own, Mrs. Lopez, but there's a good time coming. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> to-day, weren't you, Lopez? Any news?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{take it to}} heart, lad," [...] he said kindly. [...] "You {{did your}} best. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> {{against one of the}} biggest brains of the century. And you came very near success. Remember that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} been exposed to a {{tremendous}} fire. The walls are everywhere pitted with bullet marks, and the upper story seems perfectly riddled with balls; but of course none of <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> there." ...|$|E
50|$|Once {{a player}} {{has no more}} trumps in their hand, they <b>are</b> <b>up</b> (out of that game). <b>You</b> <b>are</b> not allowed to declare that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>up</b> until it <b>is</b> your turn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! and the ghosts, I suppose. Well, {{see that}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>up</b> betimes to-morrow and have these salmon nets {{looked over and}} repaired." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must {{mind what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>up</b> to, Bullen," [...] {{one of his}} companions said. [...] "They are terrible fellows those Nihilists, they say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, of course!" [...] {{answered}} Professor Jeffer. [...] "And you--it {{seems to}} me your face looks familiar. Why, yes, I have it now! <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> there at the same time, on a hunting trip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shan't forget," [...] she murmured. [...] "The dark {{one looks}} like Brightman, the detective <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> against in that Fall River business--the man who {{believed}} {{that you were the}} High Priest of crime in New York." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, there's {{just one}} chance. If that doesn't come off, I'm done. My pater said he'd {{give me a}} quid for every race I won at the sports. I got the half {{yesterday}} all right when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> at Aldershot.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I've got a {{committee}} meetin' of Agriculture," [...] said Mr. Redbrook. [...] "Could <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> here at Mis' Peasley's about eight to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--yes. I {{could not}} do so last night, and I shall be back in London either to-night or before <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>up</b> to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better. We'll {{look out for}} ourselves. There must be work done to-night, so get ready for it while <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>up</b> stairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “We {{have offered}} no reward, {{but we are}} willing to pay for the capture,” replied the leader of the circus men. “But if you caught the lion how is it <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> in the house when we rode up?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, do {{you suppose}} that such a girl as that, when she had {{made up her mind}} to starve, wouldn't know what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> to if you pretended to have found a lot of money {{belonging}} to her under the cupboard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Jack Archer!" [...] exclaimed {{the officer}} addressed, [...] "where {{on earth did}} you come from? {{and what are you}} {{masquerading}} as a Cossack for? We saw you here, and of course took you for an enemy. I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> at the front." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know what}} Chicago is," [...] {{interposed}} the New Yorker. [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>up</b> Fifth Avenue {{to see the}} magnificent residences of our mil--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>up</b> {{in the air}} again," [...] Ernest remarked dryly. [...] "Come back to earth. Remember, {{we agreed}} that the average man is selfish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go back to England to-morrow. Chuck it altogether. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>up</b> against {{too big a}} combination. You can do no one any good. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> a {{great deal}} more likely to come to harm yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Binkie-boy {{went for}} a walk this morning before <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up,</b> Torp. I saw him making love to the butcher at the corner when the {{shutters}} were being taken down--just as if he hadn't enough to eat in his own proper house," [...] said Dick.|$|E
6000|$|... "You chaps {{kicked up}} such a confounded row above.... Enough to scare any one.... I didn't know what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> to.... Bash in the blamed planks... my head.... Just what a silly, scary gang of fools would do.... Not much good to me anyhow.... Just as well... drown.... Pah." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} known, {{when we were}} sitting there in Harrods, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> against it, too, but I couldn't think of {{anything}} but the way I was fixed. The agent's been here twice this week for the rent, and I was kind of desperate for a square meal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you do? Then I {{am quite}} sure that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>up</b> to some {{mischief}} or other, Bob, or you wouldn't want me {{to help you with}} Carrie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--now, Dolores; for, before <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>up,</b> I must <b>be</b> {{on horseback}} {{and on my}} way to join the troops. The march to Montevideo will {{probably}} commence almost immediately." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>up</b> to?" [...] he asked. [...] "Look washed out, {{as though}} you'd had a fever or something. I've been {{expecting to see}} you every day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{we met in}} Havana I'd no {{idea that}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> against me," [...] Cliffe said with a laugh. [...] "Curious, isn't it, that we should make friends while I was backing the President and you the rebels!" [...] He turned to the window. [...] "What's the fire outside?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{of the old}} witch-doctor Zikali's spirits {{which he}} sets {{at the mouth of}} this kloof to warn him of who comes or goes. I know it well, and so do others. I saw it {{listening}} behind a stone when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> the kloof last evening talking with the Opener-of-Roads." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Knight, {{when you}} are gone, will you send me {{something}} you have written? I think I should like to see whether you write as you have lately spoken, or in your better mood. Which is your true self--the cynic you have been this evening, or the nice philosopher <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> to to-night?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What damned foolery have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>up</b> to NOW?" [...] he demanded. [...] "Can't I move a step without {{stubbing}} my toe on you? Why {{the devil}} did you bid?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course! You {{will not}} realize what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>up</b> against. <b>You</b> {{might as well}} have sent for the Angel Gabriel. Now will you do exactly as I ask you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Chock full o' science,' {{said the}} radiant Captain, 'as ever he was! Sol Gills, Sol Gills, what have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>up</b> to, for this many a long day, my ould boy?' ...|$|R
