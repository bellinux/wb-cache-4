5|$|<b>Yeah,</b> we {{were over}} the moon. We don't play ourselves, {{because most people}} won't know who we are, but they'll look like yellow {{versions}} of ourselves. We play counsellors at an arts camp that Lisa's going to. It's pretty fun. We just went to a studio and recorded it, but, <b>yeah,</b> we were really flattered.|$|E
5|$|Drake, Nicki Minaj and Casey Veggies have {{acknowledged}} being influenced directly by West.

5|$|In April 2017, KMFDM {{revealed}} a new EP entitled Yeah!; an album called Hell <b>Yeah</b> {{was released in}} August, with a U.S. tour planned {{in support of the}} releases for October. On June 23, <b>Yeah!</b> was released, followed by the release of Hell <b>Yeah</b> on August 18. Guitarists White and Hodgson were unavailable, so Konietzko recruited Chris Harms from Lord of the Lost to record the guitar parts. Harms, along with Lord of the Lost bandmates Pi (guitar) and Gared Dirge (keyboards), had been slated to perform as the live band for KMFDM's late 2017 tour. Lord of the Lost were unable to secure work visas to enter the U.S., so Andee Blacksugar was tapped to handle guitar tasks instead.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} April 2005, Silent Alarm had charted in {{eighteen}} {{countries on}} four continents. Bloc Party toured in Japan with The Rakes {{at the start of}} May and completed a headlining tour of the US in June. The band members played their first concerts in Australia in July and spent the whole of August on the European festivals circuit. The remix album Silent Alarm Remixed was released on 29 August 2005 following Bloc Party's headlining slots at the Reading and Leeds Festivals on 26–28 August. The record includes reworked versions of all original tracks by artists such as Ladytron, Death From Above 1979, and Nick Zinner from <b>Yeah</b> <b>Yeah</b> Yeahs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of this attention, {{existing}} acts like <b>Yeah</b> <b>Yeah</b> Yeahs were able to sign to major record labels. A second wave of bands that managed to gain international recognition {{as a result of}} the movement included Interpol, the Killers, the Catheters, Mooney Suzuki and the Go in the US, and Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, Maxïmo Park, Editors, the Cribs, the Libertines, the Fratellis, Razorlight and Kaiser Chiefs in the UK. Arctic Monkeys were the most prominent act to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking, with two No. 1 singles and Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), which became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history.|$|E
5|$|There were {{attempts}} to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s, and by 2000, scenes {{had grown up}} {{as part of the}} alternative and indie music scenes in several countries. The Detroit rock scene included the White Stripes, the Von Bondies, Electric Six, the Dirtbombs, the Go, the Muggs, the Hard Lessons, Tally Hall and the Detroit Cobras. The city was also a crucial stomping ground for Ohio's the Black Keys. New York's scene included the Strokes, Interpol, Radio 4, Liars, <b>Yeah</b> <b>Yeah</b> Yeahs, TV on the Radio and the Rapture. In Los Angeles & San Francisco, the scene was centered around Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the Brian Jonestown Massacre, the Dandy Warhols and the Warlocks (most of whom would later be more associated with underground psychedelic rock than the mainstream garage rock bands of the era), while bands like Silversun Pickups delivered a more poppy take on post-punk. Billy Childish and the Buff Medways from the United Kingdom, the (International) Noise Conspiracy from Sweden, and the 5.6.7.8's from Japan enjoyed underground, regional or national success.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yeah,</b> I don't know. I mean, I mostly {{only know}} things are {{different}} because people ask me different questions, but I don't feel like things are very changed. I mean, I still, I {{do the same things}} that I did before … I think about the same things, so … I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.|$|E
5|$|We've {{always thought}} Lutz {{was the first}} one to sell it. But it's like how people claim they saw Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or were at Woodstock. The {{landscape}} is littered with salesmen who say, 'Oh <b>yeah,</b> I {{was the first one}} to bring that in.' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E
5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, <b>yeah,</b> the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, NOU was on {{tour with}} Bikini Kill, {{and when they}} arrived in Memphis, the found that the {{promoter}} for the show hadn't actually promoted the show. So, while {{out on the town}} flyering the streets and ducking into record stores, NOU ran into Primal Scream, a band which had been in town recording their own album. Primal Scream then decided to attend NOU's show at the Antenna Club, and then proceeded to invite NOU to record with them in the studio the next day. Nation of Ulysses then recorded five songs with Primal Scream in nine hours, though of course only after a quick errand for some tin foil to smoke a bit of crack, according to Tim Green. These recordings are known as Memphis Demos, and include the demos of N-Sub Ulysses, 50,000 Watts, Mockingbird, <b>Yeah,</b> and Shakedown.|$|E
25|$|Bikini Kill is {{the first}} EP by the American punk rock band Bikini Kill led by singer Kathleen Hanna. The six-song vinyl EP was {{released}} in 1992 on Kill Rock Stars.

25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, <b>yeah,</b> <b>yeah,</b> it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E
25|$|<b>Yeah,</b> it's a paste, tastes pretty good, actually. It has {{millions}} of little computers — {{we call them}} trackers — which work their way into your cells.|$|E
25|$|ARMITAGE: <b>Yeah.</b> And I know Joe Wilson's {{been calling}} everybody. He's pissed off {{because he was}} {{designated}} as a low-level guy, went out to look at it. So, he's all pissed off.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} Snow Patrol has {{influenced}} the thriving Belfast music scene positively. This includes Lightbody, {{who returned to}} the city and now lives there. The band's kindness towards local bands, partly by founding Polar Music, and Lightbody being an active part of the Oh <b>Yeah</b> Music Centre has resulted in high optimism in the scene.|$|E

25|$|<b>Yeah</b> sure, we see {{ourselves}} as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E
25|$|The area {{includes}} {{critically acclaimed}} rock and metal bands, including A Life Once Lost, Cinderella, Circa Survive, Valencia, Sinch, Free Energy, Dead Milkmen, Hall and Oates, The Hooters and The A's, Todd Rundgren.
