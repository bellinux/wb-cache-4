5000|$|It is {{important}} to minimize plant wounding and maintain proper soil nutrition. If <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> <b>on</b> pruning, always allow four to five days for healing before exposing the plants to water. Chemicals {{can be used in}} some cases. However, the spraying of chemicals is only efficient if it is sprayed on the entire raspberry plant. [...] These include lime sulfur or copper application, captan/fenhexamid mixture (Captevate 68WDG) applied when 8-10” shoot growth, and Strobilurins. Recent research indicates that chitinases may effectively control against Raspberry Spur Blight. Specifically, chitinases, when applied, were found to reduce lesion size, and control infection of internal tissues.Notably, the application of Phytoverm, a Streptomyces avermitilis metabolite, had a similar inhibitory effect on disease growth. Other plant pathogens have also been found to reduce the growth rate of casual agent D. applanata such as entornopathogenic fungi (Hyphomycetes).|$|E

40|$|As you {{embark on}} your senior project, {{it will be}} useful for you to keep the {{following}} points especially in mind: 1) <b>You</b> should <b>plan</b> <b>on</b> taking EE 460 /EE 463 /EE 464 in three successive quarters, if at all possible. This makes the senior project experience more cohesive. You should also not plan to use EE 400 to extend the length of your senior project, even though students have done this {{from time to time}} in the past. One of the challenges of the senior project experience is time management. 2) The senior project proposal abstract that you produce in EE 460 should be regarded as critical to your overall project success. A good project begins with a carefully thought-out project proposal. Note that the nature of senior project is such that what you have originally proposed may indeed evolve with time. This is normal, but does not minimize the importance of your original planning process. 3) Although “deadlines ” are typically instructor-dependent, <b>you</b> should <b>plan</b> <b>on</b> finishing your full proposal by the first day of Week Two of EE 463, and should <b>plan</b> <b>on</b> submitting a written progress report by the last day of classes in the quarter you are taking EE 463...|$|R

40|$|Reviewed October 1993. "The idea of inserts {{came about}} for three reasons. First, {{research}} showed that conventional fireplaces were very inefficient and, therefore, not an effective heat source. Second, since the OPEC oil embargo of 1973, Americans {{have become more}} aware of energy. Third, because a high percentage of American homes already have these inefficient fireplaces, people began searching for a solution. Generally, inserts greatly improve heat generation efficiency in comparison to the conventional brick or stone fireplace. Fireplaces are 10 percent efficient at best, and as the outside temperature drops, their efficiency declines. On the other hand, a good insert can operate at 40 percent efficiency if it is fired properly. Because the cost of inserts ranges from $ 800 to $ 1500, consumers wonder whether putting an insert into their fireplace is a wise economic choice. Of course, this depends on how often the fireplace (insert) is used. If you only use your fireplace occasionally and not necessarily as a heat source, then the purchase of an insert is not a good choice. On the other hand, if you plan to burn one or more cords of wood per year for the heat, then buying the insert may be wise. The more wood <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> <b>on</b> burning each year for heat, the shorter the payback period will be...|$|E
