25|$|Rotations {{around the}} x, y and z axes are called {{principal}} rotations. Rotation around any axis {{can be performed}} by taking a rotation around the x axis, followed by a rotation around the <b>y</b> <b>axis,</b> and followed by a rotation around the z axis. That is to say, any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations.|$|E

25|$|In two dimensions, {{the angular}} {{velocity}} {{is a single}} number with an orientation but no direction. The angular velocity in two dimensions is a pseudoscalar, a quantity that changes its sign under a parity inversion (for example {{if one of the}} axes is inverted or if axes are swapped). The positive direction of rotation is taken, by convention, to be in the direction towards the <b>y</b> <b>axis</b> from the x axis. If the parity is inverted, but the orientation of a rotation is not, then the sign of the angular velocity changes.|$|E
25|$|The {{polarization}} {{of the incoming}} photon (or beam) can be resolved as two polarizations on the x and <b>y</b> <b>axis.</b> If the input polarization {{is parallel to the}} fast or slow axis, then there is no {{polarization of}} the other axis, so the output polarization {{is the same as the}} input (only the phase more or less delayed). If the input polarization is 45° to the fast and slow axis, the polarization on those axes are equal. But the phase of the output of the slow axis will be delayed 90° with the output of the fast axis. If not the amplitude but both sinus values are displayed, then x and y combined will describe a circle. With other angles than 0° or 45° the values in fast and slow axis will differ and their resultant output will describe an ellipse.|$|E
25|$|Vectors are {{fundamental}} {{in the physical}} sciences. They {{can be used to}} represent any quantity that has magnitude, has direction, and which adheres to the rules of vector addition. An example is velocity, the magnitude of which is speed. For example, the velocity 5 meters per second upward could be represented by the vector (0,5) (in 2 dimensions with the positive <b>y</b> <b>axis</b> as 'up'). Another quantity represented by a vector is force, since it has a magnitude and direction and follows the rules of vector addition. Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as linear displacement, displacement, linear acceleration, angular acceleration, linear momentum, and angular momentum. Other physical vectors, such as the electric and magnetic field, are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a vector field. Examples of quantities that have magnitude and direction but fail to follow the rules of vector addition: Angular displacement and electric current. Consequently, these are not vectors.|$|E
