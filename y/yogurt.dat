40|$|<b>Yogurts</b> from goat milk were {{elaborated}} and water-soluble soybean extract (WSSE) and Bifidobacterium lactis probiotic culture added during processing. The {{characteristics of}} apparent viscosity, water retention capacity and syneresis were analyzed during 29 days of storage {{and it was}} verified the influence of WSSE and the probiotic on these rheological properties. The suplementation of WSSE provoked {{an increase in the}} viscosity and water retention capacity of the <b>yogurts</b> while reducing the syneresis. The inoculation of the probiotic culture during elaboration of the <b>yogurts</b> did not significantly alter the rheological characteristics of the products. Therefore, the water-soluble soybean extract and the probiotic culture can contribute to the rheological characteristics of <b>yogurts,</b> besides the nutritional and functional improvement advantages already known with the use of these products...|$|R

40|$|<b>Yogurts</b> {{purchased}} from retail outlets were examined {{for the presence}} of yeasts by being plated onto oxytetracycline malt extract agar. Of the 128 samples examined, 45 % exhibited yeast counts above 103 cells per g. A total of 73 yeast strains were isolated and identified as belonging to the genera Torulopsis, Kluyveromyces, Saccharomyces, Candida, Rhodotorula, Pichia, Debaryomyces, and Sporobolomyces. Torulopsis candida and Kluyveromyces fragilis were the most frequently isolated species, followed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula rubra, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Torulopsis versatilis. The growth of yeasts in <b>yogurts</b> was related to the ability of the yeasts to grow at refrigeration temperatures, to ferment lactose and sucrose, and to hydrolyze milk casein. Most yeast isolates grew in the presence of 100 μg of sorbate and benzoate preservatives per ml. Higher yeast counts from <b>yogurts</b> were obtained when the <b>yogurts</b> were plated onto oxytetracycline malt extract agar than when they were plated onto acidified malt extract agar...|$|R
