Brezhnev's ethnicity was specified as Ukrainian in some documents, including his passport, and Russian in others. Like many <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years after the Russian Revolution of 1917, he received a technical education, at first in land management where he started as a land surveyor and then in metallurgy.

Pedro de la Portilla, a Criollo employee {{in the tax}} collectors' office, met with about twenty <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alley of the Gachupines (Spurs) in Mexico City. The meeting discussed the situation Criollos found themselves in relation to Peninsulares. (Criollos were Europeans born in the New World, and Peninsulares were Europeans born in Iberia. Gachupines became an insulting term for Peninsulares.) Those present agreed to rise in arms to rid the country of the Gachupines. For this purpose, they assembled a number of old cutlasses. As this was almost their only armament, the conspiracy {{became known as the}} Conspiracy of the Machetes.|$|E
25|$|The Tenderloin {{has been}} the home of Raphael House, the first {{provider}} {{in the city of}} shelter for homeless parents and children, since 1971. It is an ethnically diverse community, consisting of families, young people living in cheap apartments, downtown bohemian artists, and recent immigrants from Latin America and Southeast Asia. It is home to a large population of homeless, those living in extreme poverty, and numerous non-profit social service agencies, soup kitchens, religious rescue missions, homeless shelters and single room occupancy hotels. Many homeless <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tenderloin district are at risk of serious emotional and psychological problems arising from past traumatic experiences. Lack of appropriately targeted options available in the area has meant many youths will have few viable paths to deal effectively with their problems.|$|E

25|$|Both {{the novel}} and film {{are based on the}} real story of Herbert Norkus' life. Norkus, a Hitler Youth member, had died from {{injuries}} suffered while being chased and confronted by Communist <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night of 23/24 January 1932 in the Beusselkietz neighbourhood of Moabit, Berlin. Already on the next morning, Joseph Goebbels began to use Norkus' death for propaganda purposes during a rally in Berlin's Sportpalast. The funeral on 29 January at Plötzensee, Berlin, was turned into a major ceremony of several Nazi party organizations, under the aegis of Goebbels. While the murder was condemned also by non-Nazi press, the Communists started a counter-propaganda offensive, describing the incident as an accidental result of Communist self-defence during a Nazi attack. In the subsequent trial, several people were sentenced by the Landgericht I court in Moabit, yet the most prominent accomplices Willi Simon, Bernhard Klingbeil and Harry Tack had been able to escape to the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 Redfern riots {{began on}} 14 February 2004, {{at the end}} of Eveleigh Street outside Redfern station, sparked by the death of Thomas 'TJ' Hickey. The teenager, riding on his bicycle, was {{allegedly}} being chased by a police vehicle, which led to his impalement on a fence. Members of his family were then reported to have started grieving for TJ around Eveleigh Street with a crowd gathering commiserating with the family. Fliers were distributed blaming police for TJ's death. The police closed the Eveleigh Street entrance to the railway station, but <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crowd became violent, throwing bricks and bottles; this escalated into a riot. A subsequent inquest found that although the police were following Hickey, they had not caused the accident, a verdict that caused controversy in Redfern's Aboriginal community. The riots sparked fresh debate into the welfare of Aboriginal Australians and the response of the police to those living in the Redfern area.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} man the force, Murad II {{developed}} the devşirme system of recruiting <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of taxes from Christians in the empire. Murad used {{the strength of}} the kapikulus and played them off against the nobility, forcing them to pay taxes or land so that the treasury could obtain the money it needed to maintain the Kapikulu army. The janissaries comprised infantry units that formed the Ottoman sultan's household troops and bodyguard. The first janissary units comprised war captives and slaves. After the 1380s Sultan Mehmet I filled their ranks with the results of taxation in human form called devshirmeh: the Sultan's men conscripted a number of non-Muslim, usually Christian, boysat first at random, later, by strict selectionto be trained. Initially they favored Greeks, Albanians (who also supplied many gendarmes), usually selecting about one in five boys of ages seven to fourteen but the numbers could be changed to correspond with the need for soldiers. Next the devshirmeh was extended to also include Serbs, Bosnians and other Balkan countries, later especially Ukraine and southern Russia.|$|E

25|$|Heraclitus {{was born}} to an aristocratic family in Ephesus, in the Persian Empire, {{in what is now}} called present-day Efes, Turkey. His father was named either Blosôn or Herakôn. Diogenes says that he abdicated the kingship (basileia) in favor of his brother and Strabo {{confirms}} that there was a ruling family in Ephesus descended from the Ionian founder, Androclus, which still kept the title and could sit in the chief seat at the games, as well as a few other privileges. How much power the king had is another question. Ephesus {{had been part of the}} Persian Empire since 547 and was ruled by a satrap, a more distant figure, as the Great King allowed the Ionians considerable autonomy. Diogenes says that Heraclitus used to play knucklebones with the <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temple of Artemis and when asked to start making laws he refused saying that the constitution (politeia) was ponêra, which can mean either that it was fundamentally wrong or that he considered it toilsome. Two extant letters between Heraclitus and Darius I, quoted by Diogenes, are undoubtedly later forgeries.|$|E
500|$|In 1924 J.

[...] J. Jovanović's account changed {{back and forth over the}} years and never adequately addressed Colonel Lesanin's statement. [...] Bilinski did not speak openly on the subject, but his press department chief confirmed that a meeting had taken place including a vague warning, but there was no mention of an ethnic Serb Austro-Hungarian soldier shooting Franz Ferdinand.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time that he was {{appointed}} leader of the USS, Blažeković was also named commander of the male Ustaše Youth organisation. In its first months, many young Croats joined the movement, with recruitment being fuelled [...] mostly by extreme Croatian nationalism. In addition, many were motivated to join because the Youth provided athletic, intellectual and artistic training for [...] "the next generation of Ustaše leaders." [...] For others, membership gave [...] "a sense of meaning to their lives" [...] and was appealing because it represented [...] "a youthful rebellion against the Yugoslav state." [...] By May, some Ustaše Youth camps publicly announced their refusal to accept new members as they lacked the capacity to do so. Although it is unclear how many young Croats joined the movement, Blažeković claimed a figure of half a million members. He defined the Ustaše Youth as a [...] "secular movement" [...] meant to promote [...] "brotherly cooperation and mutual life" [...] of peasant, working-class and intellectual <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NDH.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Ooser" [...] was {{pronounced}} with a short, quick s by villagers as Osser. It is unclear if the head itself was the Ooser, {{or whether it}} instead {{was designed as a}} depiction of an entity called the Ooser. Dewar suggested the possibility that it might have been connected to the term Wurse, used for the Devil in Layamon's Brut, or to the 17th-century Italian term Oser, again used for the Devil. Alternately, he suggested that it might be a derivative of Guisard or Guiser, two old terms for a mummer. Hutton instead proposed that Osser possibly derived from Wooset, a term used in the dialect around Wiltshire to refer to a pole upon which a horse's skull with deer's horns was affixed. This Wooset was recorded as having been paraded by <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marlborough district until the 1830s, where it was used to mock neighbours whose partners were suspected of marital infidelity, the horns being a traditional sign of cuckoldry. Similar traditions have been recorded in Wiltshire and Somerset, where they {{can be traced back to}} at least the early 17th century.|$|E
500|$|Eve {{was born}} in New York City, to a {{immigrant}} father from the Dominican Republic. He was raised in Florida. After studies at West Virginia State College he arrived in Buffalo in February 1953 {{as a product of}} the segregated south, with less than $10 ($ today) in his pocket. Eve served in the United States Army from 19531955 and achieved the rank of corporal. [...] Eve holds an Associate's degree from Erie Community College and a Bachelor of Science from West Virginia. He had been an All-High basketball player in Florida and became an All-Europe player during his Army tour of duty in Germany, where he ran a program for orphans. [...] After completing his Army service he returned to Buffalo in 1955. [...] Eve's first job in Buffalo was in a Chevrolet plant. While working there he became aware of drugs problems with local <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city's parks, and observed a lack of guidance for youth in the community. He surrendered his job to pursue a post in parks recreation, but learned that such jobs were doled out by political patronage to party loyalists. [...] Eve joined the Democratic Party and got one of the patronage parks jobs. [...] By 1958, he was blossoming as an independent activist within the party, pursuing minority rights, and was the only ward leader who {{was not part of the}} political establishment. [...] This role led to his 1966 New York State Assembly election victory.|$|E
500|$|Nixon gave {{a speech}} from the rear {{platform}} of the train.

[...] The candidate asserted that though his opponent, Vice President Humphrey, claimed that Americans had never had it so good, he should tell that to the farmer. Nixon pledged that he would give special attention to agricultural issues and would make the Secretary of Agriculture a farmer's advocate to the White House. He promised to restore order: [...] "The most important civil right is the right to be free from [...] violence." [...] He noted the many <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crowd, stating, [...] "Young Americans know their future is at stake. They don't want four more years of the same." [...] He recalled that his father had hailed from Ohio: [...] "his roots are here and mine are too!" [...] As Nixon spoke, Cole observed him, and thought he was a good family man, looking warm and friendly and appearing much as she expected him to. She later stated that she did not even look at the sign until she was teased about it by a classmate, who suggested the sign, [...] "Bring Us Together Again" [...] was about boys, not politics. She kept the dress, but told the media she threw away the sign.|$|E
