Ferris has made it his mission to show Cameron that the whole world in front of him is passing him by, and that life can be pretty sweet if <b>you</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> embrace it. That's the lasting message of Ferris Bueller's Day Off." [...] Roeper pays homage to the film with a license plate that reads [...] "SVFRRIS".

So we {{adjusted}} the script accordingly. And certainly we were very concerned how Jim would feel, as we would be concerned about how any actor would feel about something that approached his personal life in such a way. And Jim was okay with it. I think that's a tribute to him as an actor and as a person, that he's not afraid to explore those areas. Or they are areas that he has in some part explored and he's not afraid to put on the screen. The temptation scene in [...] "Armageddon" [...] was a very unusual scene. It's hard to watch in some way, probably hard to do." [...] Abramowitz says, [...] "I loved [...] "Armageddon" [...] because Jim Byrnes gave an incredible performance, which was heartbreaking." [...] He says further, [...] "I called him before and I said, 'Jim, how do you feel about this?' Because I would never do anything that would make him uncomfortable as a human being. But he was actually excited to do it. He was really into it, up for it, going for it. He's come to terms with his life and who he is. (…) Joe is pretty much the human factor, but he's the heroic human factor." [...] Associate Creative Consultant Gillian Horvath says, [...] "It's big stuff for him. It's issues from his own life, but it's not about him; it's about Joe, but they obviously share some certain traits. That he's willing to bare his own life, his own feelings, in order to give Joe something that strong. That he cares enough about the character to say, 'Yeah, let's give him this big scene and in order to do it I will use myself, part of me will be offered up.'" [...] Lettow recalls that when the producers viewed the dailies of Armageddon, in which Ahriman looking like James Horton offers his legs to Dawson, there was [...] "not a dry eye in the room. And we watched those over and over and just marveled at Jim Byrnes' ability. And sat here saying, 'Oh my God, what have we done to him?'" ...|$|E
