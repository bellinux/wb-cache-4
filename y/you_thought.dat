5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E

25|$|If I had {{not heard}} long ago from other people {{that you were a}} fool, I might now have known it of myself, since <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> I was sitting in an empty jug, and went to cover it up with your hand, as if you had me caught. I don't think you worth the trouble, or I would have given you, long since, such a lesson, that you should {{remember}} me long enough. But before long you will get a slight ducking.|$|E

25|$|As {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win {{to reduce the}} negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not bet against desired outcomes {{that are important to}} their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting against your team or political candidate, for example, may signal to you that you are not as committed to them as <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> you were.|$|E

25|$|Skins Rise follows Cook (now {{somewhere in}} his early 20s) {{who is on the}} run and living alone in Manchester. In an {{introductory}} voiceover, Cook explains his thoughts and alludes towards a murder he may have committed; it is implied but not outright stated that he is avoiding capture after killing John Foster a few years back. He is now a drug dealer and has a semi-serious relationship with a woman named Emma (Esther Smith), but becomes mesmerised by Charlie (Hannah Britland), the girlfriend of local drug lord Louis (Liam Boyle) after he is asked to watch over her for a few days. After Louis brutally kills a man named Jason (Lucien Laviscount) for having an affair with Charlie, Cook flees Manchester, taking Emma with him. En route, Charlie calls Cook and begs him to take her with them. The three end up at Emma's family's old country home, in a remote part of the country. Not long after though, Louis arrives, explaining that he tracked their car. After Charlie refuses to go with him, the three leave the house and find Emma's parents' car abandoned, indicating they have been killed. The trio are stranded in the woods, where Louis catches up with and murders Emma. Seeing this, Cook decides he is done running, confronting Louis and beating him to a pulp. He declares, I'm Cook. <b>You</b> <b>thought</b> you could kill me? I'm fucking Cook. He helps Charlie escape and alerting the police, while a voiceover indicates he is pondering the significance of life and death.|$|E
500|$|Shand: Will {{you admit}} {{one of two}} things: either your report to the Board or your {{statement}} that that was your state of mind, that <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> his conduct was so serious as {{to be left out}} of the team—one or other is a deliberate lie? ...|$|E
500|$|Shand: How {{could you}} really have {{thought that he had}} behaved in a manner {{befitting}} worthy representatives of Australia and {{on and off the field}} his conduct was exemplary if <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> his conduct was so serious as to warrant his omission from the team? How do you reconcile those two? ...|$|E

500|$|Jaws 2 {{was briefly}} the highest-grossing sequel in history until Rocky II was {{released}} in 1979. The film's tagline, [...] "Just when <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> {{it was safe to}} go back in the water...," [...] {{has become one of the}} most famous in film history and has been parodied and homaged several times. Jaws 2 is generally considered to be the best of the three Jaws sequels.|$|E
500|$|The film's tagline, [...] "Just when <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> it {{was safe}} to go back in the water...", {{has become one of the}} most famous in film history. Andrew J. Kuehn, who {{developed}} the first film's trailer, is credited with coining the phrase. It has been parodied in numerous films; most notably the tagline of the 1996 feature film adaptation of the television series, Flipper, [...] "This summer it's finally safe to go back in the water." ...|$|E
500|$|For Prost, {{his debut}} victory was memorable mostly {{for the change}} it made in his mindset. [...] "Before, <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> you could do it," [...] he said. [...] "Now you know you can." [...] Prost led from the start the next 5 races, and won two more races during the season, took his first pole {{position}} in Germany and finished on the podium every time he completed a race distance. He won again in Holland and Italy, and finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship, seven points behind champion Nelson Piquet.|$|E

500|$|... "Do You..." [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Evan Rytlewski from The A.V. Club said the song [...] "spins the ostensibly sleazy pickup line 'Do you like drugs?' into an irresistibly sweet proposal, imagining lovely, perfectly wasted afternoons {{spent in a}} content daze." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly called it a [...] "fabulous song" [...] and felt that [...] "Miguel's smooth, subtle swagger is so appealing that a line like 'I wanna do you like drugs tonight' comes off as audacious instead of offensive." [...] Rob Tannenbaum of Rolling Stone quipped, [...] "Just when <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> there were no new ways to say 'I love you'".|$|E
500|$|Then it says, [...] "Lay {{down all}} thoughts, {{surrender}} to the void – it is shining. That you may see the meaning of within – it is being." [...] From birth to death all we ever do is think: we have one thought, we have another thought, another thought, another thought. Even when you are asleep you are having dreams, so there is never a time from birth to death when the mind isn't always active with thoughts.

[...] 4 Music's Chris Younie agreed calling Lewis [...] "one lucky lady," [...] {{as well as being}} surprised by the video.

500|$|The Daily Telegraph {{described}} the video as a moving inspiration {{to a child}} suffering from grief. The Huffington Post wrote {{that if they were}} able to engage in time travel themselves, they would be unable to encounter a kinder tale. Io9 appreciated that Capaldi was using his celebrity status to effect positive change through his portrayal of the character, and praised his use of the fictional role as a force for public good. The South Wales Evening Post noted that Capaldi had appeared in a brief video as himself congratulating a bride on her wedding, and wrote that this video was more impressive than the previous appearance. Metro commented [...] "Just when <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> Peter Capaldi couldn't possibly get any cooler, he's gone and outdone himself with this video." ...|$|E
500|$|Every so often, I’d get a {{call from}} the {{producer}} saying, it’s going out at this time. The publicity people would be alerted, then we’d {{get a call}} saying no, it’s not, it’s been put back. That happened six times, I think, altogether – seven reschedules in a year or so... It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just one of these things that happen. I mean, a lot of shows are left on people’s desks and they hardly get seen, and Joking Apart was certainly one of those. Meanwhile, they were making about four series of The Brittas Empire, and <b>you</b> <b>thought,</b> [...] "Bloody Hell! Come on, surely….?"
