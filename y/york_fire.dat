25|$|Hooks, ladders and buckets were financed {{through the}} {{collection}} of fines for dirty chimneys, and a fire watch was established, consisting of eight wardens which were drawn from the male population. An organization known as the prowlers but given the nickname the rattle watch patrolled the streets with buckets, ladders and hooks from nine in the evening until dawn looking for fires. Leather shoe buckets, 250 in all, were manufactured by local Dutch shoemakers in 1658, and these bucket brigades are regarded {{as the beginning of}} the New <b>York</b> <b>Fire</b> Department.|$|E
25|$|During his mission, New York City (then {{the area}} at the {{southern}} tip of Manhattan around Wall Street) fell to British forces on September 15 and Washington was forced to retreat to the island's north in Harlem Heights (what is now Morningside Heights). On September 21, a quarter of the lower portion of Manhattan burned in the Great New <b>York</b> <b>Fire</b> of 1776. The fire was later widely thought to have been started by American saboteurs to keep the city from falling into British hands, though Washington and the Congress had already denied this idea. It has also been speculated that the fire was the work of British soldiers acting without orders. In the fire's aftermath, more than 200 American partisans were rounded up by the British.|$|E

25|$|Between 17:45 and 18:00 on 9 February 1942, {{authorities}} {{considered the}} fire under control, and began winding down operations until 20:00. Water entering the ship through submerged openings and flowing {{to the lower}} decks negated efforts to counter-flood, and Lafayettes list gradually increased to port. Shortly after midnight, Rear Adm. Andrews ordered Lafayette abandoned, and the ship continued to list, a process hastened by the 6,000 tons of water that had been played on her. New <b>York</b> <b>fire</b> officials were concerned that the fire could spread to the nearby city buildings. Lafayette eventually capsized during the mid watch (02:45) on 10 February, nearly crushing a fire boat, and {{came to rest on}} her port side at an angle of approximately 80 degrees. Recognising that his incompetence had caused the disaster, Admiral Andrews ordered all pressmen barred from viewing the moment of capsize in an effort to lower the level of publicity.|$|E
25|$|The first {{fatalities}} of the North and South in the American Civil War {{occurred in}} Alexandria. Within {{a month of}} the Battle of Fort Sumter, where two died, Union troops occupied Alexandria, landing troops {{at the base of}} King Street on the Potomac River on May 24, 1861. A few blocks up King Street from their landing site, the commander of the New <b>York</b> <b>Fire</b> Zouaves, Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth, sortied with a small detachment to retrieve a large Confederate flag displayed {{on the roof of the}} Marshall House Inn that had been visible from the White House. While descending from the roof, Ellsworth was shot dead by Captain James W. Jackson, the hotel's proprietor. One of the Ellsworth's soldier immediately killed Jackson. Ellsworth was publicized as a Union martyr, and the incident generated great excitement in the North, with many children being named for him. Jackson's death defending his home caused a similar, though less lasting sensation, in the South.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} American {{fire departments}} were volunteers, including the volunteer fire company in New Amsterdam, {{now known as}} New <b>York.</b> <b>Fire</b> companies were composed of citizens who volunteered their time to help protect the community. As time progressed and new towns popped up throughout the region there was {{a sharp increase in}} the number of volunteer departments. The first career fire department was not established in the United States until 1853 in Cincinnati, Ohio (Cincinnati Fire & EMS Department). Many large cities began establishing paid, full-time, staff in order to try facilitate greater fire-related call volume. St. Louis Fire Department followed Cincinnati four years later and became the second established career fire department in the country followed by other large cities like New York (FDNY). City fire departments draw their funding directly from city taxes and share the same budget as other public works like the police department and trash services. Aside from big city fire departments, many populated suburbs and towns have career fire departments. The primary difference between a municipality department and a City department is the funding. Municipal fire departments do not share their budget with any other service and are considered to be private entities within a jurisdiction. This means that they have their own taxes that feed into their budgeting needs. Another main difference is the structure of the department. City fire departments have the mayor at the top of the chain where as municipal departments have elected board officials who help maintain and run the department along with the chief officer staff.|$|E
