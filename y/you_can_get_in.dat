500|$|Every spring, {{each member}} of the {{association}} votes for two players. [...] A shortlist of nominees is published in April and the winner of the award, along with the winners of the PFA's other annual awards, is announced at a gala event in London a few days later. [...] The award is regarded by the players themselves as extremely prestigious, with Teddy Sheringham describing it in 2001 as [...] "the biggest personal award <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the game", and John Terry stating in 2005 that he considered it [...] "the ultimate accolade to be voted for by your fellow professionals whom you play against week-in and week-out".|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Sun of a Gun", {{directed}} by ThirtyTwo, was first released onto Vevo on 19 October 2010. It was filmed in 2010 in Brooklyn, and displays Oh Land {{in two different}} themes: dark and light. According to Oh Land herself, she [...] "wanted the video to show the two different states that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> {{when you are in}} love with someone". The dark side reflects her [...] "desire to protect oneself from being hurt and celebrating independence", while the light side reflects her [...] "desire to be loved and the joys of being in love". The video opens with the dark side of Oh Land, wearing a black dress and extensive eye makeup. She performs the song's choreography atop a cloud-like stage, surrounded by blinking lights. As the track's chorus begins, the light side of Oh Land appears, in a skin-colored dress and longer hair, in front of a screen displaying the sun. The second verse finds her wearing a different black dress, and singing the song by many mirrors; simultaneously, visuals of Oh Land on the ground dancing appear. The following chorus shows the same scenario, but in the same skin-colored dress from earlier. In the song's bridge, both versions of the singer pull a shawl over their head, allowing it to move with the wind. The video concludes with Oh Land closing her eyes as the screen cuts to black.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Orwig {{received}} the James J. Corbett Memorial Award, presented annually to the collegiate administrator who “through {{the years has}} most typified Corbett’s devotion to intercollegiate athletics and worked unceasingly for its betterment." [...] On receiving the award, Orwig said: [...] "This award {{is kind of like}} being named coach of the year. [...] It's the top award <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the field of athletic administration. [...] It pleases me immensely, particularly since I was elected by my peers after I had retired." ...|$|E

2500|$|A brothel may not {{in itself}} be shocking. But women painted without charm or sadness, without irony or social comment, women painted like the palings of a stockade through eyes that look out as if at death – that is shocking. And equally the method of painting. Picasso himself {{has said that he}} was {{influenced}} at the time by archaic Spanish (Iberian) sculpture. He was also influenced – particularly in the two heads at the right – by African masks…here it seems that Picasso’s quotations are simple, direct, and emotional. He is not in the least concerned with formal problems. The dislocations in this picture are the result of aggression, not aesthetics; it is the nearest <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> a painting to an outrage… ...|$|E
2500|$|Overall, Farther Along had a {{much less}} {{cluttered}} sound than its predecessor, as guitarist and band leader Roger McGuinn noted to journalist David Fricke in 2000: [...] "It was as live as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the studio. We didn't {{do a lot of}} overdubs, mostly just the vocals." [...] Nonetheless, while the album succeeded in countering the over-production present on Byrdmaniax, the band themselves weren't particularly satisfied with the finished product. [...] In a 1997 interview, bass player Skip Battin expressed his dissatisfaction with the album by saying [...] "When we finished it, I didn't think we had anything, I thought the stuff was rotten - it didn't sound good, it was scattered and there was no unification." [...] Drummer Gene Parsons concurred with Battin's assessment of the album, stating [...] "I felt that Farther Along was a good album, but it was under produced. It was done really rapidly and it suffered in under production as a reaction to Byrdmaniax." ...|$|E

And if you remember, too, that these are cultivated girls who have all been to the Mariposa high school and can do decimal fractions, you will understand that an Algerian corsair would sharpen his scimitar at the very sight of them.|$|E
