500|$|By {{the end of}} 1898 Dresser {{reported}} that nearly one million copies of sheet music would soon be sold, making [...] "Wabash" [...] a [...] "sensation", the [...] "great hit of the day." [...] In a newspaper interview Dresser said, [...] "I canâ€™t tell you just how much I have cleared off of the song, but the $50,000 estimate I have seen in some papers is very modest. You see I am a publisher {{as well as a}} composer and have a big printing house of my own in New York. I also write the words for all my songs, dictate the circumstances and stage settings for their public introductions, write my own ads, and sometimes sing my own songs. Now what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> for a monopoly. Eh?" [...] Dresser earned a substantial income from the song, including royalties through the sale of sheet music.|$|E
2500|$|The 1963 {{game between}} Victoria and South Australia at the MCG was also of {{significance}} in the rivalry between the two states. [...] Before the game Jack Dyer was asked {{what he would do}} if he was coaching Victoria, and said, [...] "I'd give them a Pep Talk and go to the races". [...] Neil Kerley who was playing, was in an interview before the game when this was mentioned. [...] After it was said the interviewer said to Kerley [...] "what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> young Kerley", in which he responded [...] "everyone is entitled to their opinion". Kerley angered by this, as a result told teammates before the game [...] "something is going to happen at the first Bounce" [...] and then put down a Victorian player with a [...] "Hip and Shoulder". [...] Kerley also injured another Victorian in the last quarter which saw him leave the field. [...] It was a drought breaking win for South Australia in Victoria. [...] When the South Australians returned to Adelaide they were greeted with a heroic welcome, with nearly 8,000 people attending in poor weather, with the crowd hurling streamers and letting off fire crackers, with hundreds surging onto the Tarmac.|$|E

60|$|RAINA (furious--throwing {{the words}} right into his face). You have a low, shopkeeping mind. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> things <b>that</b> {{would never come}} into a gentleman's head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> before <b>you</b> asked her?" [...] said Alexandrina. But {{there was}} very little of {{condemnation}} in her tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have not}} thought it {{necessary}} to go further than this," [...] he said. [...] "Is there any point <b>you</b> can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> is still left unexplained?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "In {{what sort}} <b>of</b> way? Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{anything}} <b>of</b> <b>that</b> kind {{can be managed}} better by the lawyer? If there is a thing I hate, it is business." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "O Quraysh, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the {{treatment}} <b>that</b> I should accord you?" ...|$|R

60|$|TREHERNE (making {{sure that}} TWEENY {{is out of}} hearing). What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> {{brilliant}} robe he got the girls to make for him.|$|E

6000|$|... "She'll go {{down inside}} an hour--that is certain, and Savine will lose {{thousands}} of dollars," [...] said Summers, whose {{eyes were wide}} with apprehension. [...] "I'm rattled completely. Can't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> anything <b>that</b> might be done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Mrs. Beighton, piously, [...] "we {{cannot be}} {{other than an}} all-ruling Providence has made us. Besides, you will take {{precedence}} of your own Mother, <b>you</b> know! <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> and be reasonable." ...|$|R

6000|$|MRS HUSHABYE. Yes, dear; {{but that}} was for the ship with the {{magnetic}} keel that sucked up submarines. Living at the rate we do, you cannot afford life-saving inventions. Can't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> something <b>that</b> will murder half Europe at one bang? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Henry; {{you will}} be ruined. You will, indeed. Can you not wait? Remember how headstrong your father is, and yet how good;--and how he loves <b>you!</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> all <b>that</b> he has done for you. When did he refuse you anything?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Thank you, and may God {{bless you}}; and He will bless {{you if you}} try. 'Who giveth {{a drop of water}} to one of them in my name, giveth it also to me.' <b>You</b> will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> will <b>you</b> not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|BURKE--[Following her--with fierce, {{pleading}} insistence.] I'm {{telling you}} there's {{the will of}} God in it that brought me safe through the storm and fog to the wan spot {{in the world where}} <b>you</b> was! <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> now, and isn't it queer-- ...|$|R
