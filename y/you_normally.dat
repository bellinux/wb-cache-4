500|$|TV Week {{described}} Donna as [...] "beautiful and a {{free spirit}} {{who is also a}} little loud and obnoxious", while the Metro called her [...] "kooky." [...] The teens of Ramsay Street warm to her eventually and with their help, Donna changes her ways and becomes accepted. The official Neighbours website states that Donna has become a warm, loveable, charming and playful girl. Her integration into the street and the lives of the other residents has matured Donna and she leads the normal life she always wanted. In May 2009, Robbie said that Donna is a [...] "really likeable character" [...] and that she gets to play out funny and crazy storylines while playing her. In November of that year, it was revealed that Robbie had begged the scriptwriters to let Donna go off the rails or go to rehab. Robbie said that she would like a dramatic storyline, but the show's G rating makes it difficult. Robbie also said that she enjoys playing Donna, as she is [...] "great" [...] and a [...] "bit crazy". She added [...] "I'm really glad I get to play her and not an average, boring teenage girl. You can be an average, boring teenage girl every other day of the week. It's fun {{to be able to say}} and do these things <b>you</b> <b>normally</b> wouldn't".|$|E

Selznick to Hecht, 12/19/1956: [...] "My present {{feeling is}} that eighty per cent of the script is eighty percent right, and that twenty per cent of it is eighty per cent wrong.

2500|$|The Royal Navy's best {{test pilot}}, Captain Eric Brown, chief naval test pilot and {{commanding}} officer of the Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight Royal Aircraft Establishment, who tested the Me 262 noted: [...] "This was a Blitzkrieg aircraft. You whack in at your bomber. It {{was never meant to}} be a dogfighter, {{it was meant to be}} a destroyer of bombers... The great problem with it was it did not have dive brakes. For example, if you want to fight and destroy a B-17, you come in on a dive. The 30mm cannon were not so accurate beyond 600 metres. So <b>you</b> <b>normally</b> came in at 600 yards and would open fire on your B-17. And your closing speed was still high and since you had to break away at 200 meters to avoid a collision, you only had two seconds firing time. Now, in two seconds, you can't sight. You can fire randomly and hope for the best. If you want to sight and fire, you need to double that time to four seconds. And with dive brakes, you could have done that." ...|$|E

It's in his costume, in his lightsaber—how you kind of get the sense that it could just not work at any moment; that it could just blow up. That’s kind of like a big metaphor for him.|$|E

50|$|The {{benefits}} of this system over series elements is that should one small element fail {{then the rest of}} the system will continue to operate, a draw back of this system is that its length is limited to multiples of the notch distance, so when installing on site <b>you</b> <b>normally</b> have to install slightly beyond the end of the pipe work. It is still subject to overheating and burnout if overlapped, but it is generally bad practice to overlap when installing.|$|E
