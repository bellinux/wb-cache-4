2500|$|<b>Yet</b> <b>today,</b> the Yacht Club boasts Seaside {{views and}} as {{recently}} as 5 to 10 years ago had its roof blown off and severely damaged in a large storm after decades of erosion drew a new coastline almost to the doorstep of the Yacht Club. Seawalls constructed of natural rocks have been strategically placed around the coastline of Somers Beach complemented by wooden seawalls and many small wave-breaks that have all slowly succumbed to the waves of the sea. Experts such as marine geomorphologists have assessed the erosion situation, however no definitive explanation can be found {{as to why the}} erosion occurs. The most popular theory is that of Longshore Drift, where successive [...] "waves" [...] of sand pass Somers, with sand build up when such a wave passes, and erosion at other times. A commonly held view is that the man-made channelisation of Merricks Creek has upset the delicate equilibrium of the coastline. In recent years the erosion has slowed and almost stopped, and experts predict it could be due to a major decrease in easterly winds, tending to slow the effects of longshore drift, thus the erosion. An alternative view is that the decrease in rainfall has limited the period when Merricks Creek is flowing into the sea, thus allowing sand build up {{at the mouth of the}} creek, which then allows the sand build up to propagate along the beach. Between 2011 and 2015, the beaches of Somers have lost a considerable amount of dunage and sand, seen most evidently west of the Wits End Creek and west of Merricks Creek. These areas have lost up to as much as six to eight metres of dunes in a five-year period. As recently as May 2015, the beach west of Merricks Creek lost three metres of dunes in as little as three days, caused by gale-force winds, large swell and king tides.|$|E

40|$|Software {{pipelining}} is {{an effective}} technique to reduce cycle count by exploiting instruction level parallelism in loops. It has been implemented in most VLIW DSP compilers. However, software pipelining expands the code size due {{to the introduction of}} prelude and postlude. To address this problem, many VLIW DSP compilers include certain code size reduction features. During compilation, a user is given limited options of exercising these code reduction features. As a result, the tradeoff options between cycle count and code size are also limited. <b>Yet</b> <b>today’s</b> software development often requires an optimum balance between code size and cycle count, which in turn requires a much wider tradeoff space. This paper presents a new heuristic code-size-constraint loop optimization approach to extend the tradeoff space. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the new approach can significantly widen the tradeoff space, thus providing DSP users with more flexibility to meet their various design criteria. 1...|$|R

Clouds are responsible for storage and computing demanding tasks, and mobile devices colocating with each other share bandwidth and cooperatively stream media content to distribute the load.

40|$|Abstract—Access control schemes come in {{all shapes}} and sizes, which makes {{choosing}} the right one for a particular application a challenge. <b>Yet</b> <b>today’s</b> techniques for comparing access control schemes completely ignore the setting in which the scheme is to be deployed. In this paper, we present a formal framework for comparing access control schemes with respect to a particular application. The analyst’s main task is to evaluate an access control scheme in terms of how well it implements a given access control workload (a formalism that we introduce to represent an application’s access control needs). One implementation is better than another if it has stronger security guarantees, and in this paper we introduce several such guarantees: correctness, homomorphism, AC-preservation, safety, administrationpreservation, and compatibility. The scheme that admits the implementation with the strongest guarantees is deemed the best fit for the application. We demonstrate the use of our framework by evaluating two workloads on ten different access control schemes.
