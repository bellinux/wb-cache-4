40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims to {{evaluate}} the suitability of flaxseed oil (rich plant source of long chain omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid) as healthy oil in formulation of therapeutic <b>fat</b> <b>spread.</b> Eight <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples containing 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % total blend fat were prepared. Total blend fat used in preparing different <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples were prepared by blending flaxseed oil at various ratios with palm oil. However, other four <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples were prepared as control sample using palm oil and soybean oil at different ratios. Each <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> sample was analyzed for its moisture, fat, protein, ash and carbohydrate content {{as well as its}} sensory properties and microbiological characteristics. Total blend fat extracted from each <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> sample was also analyzed for its physical and chemical properties, oxidative stability and fatty acid profile. The obtained results showed that all formulated <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples were found to be in good microbiologically characteristics as they were free from contamination by different microorganism groups. The eight formulated <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> contained zero-trans fatty acids. The fatty acid C 16 : 0 was the predominant saturated fatty acid, in all prepared formulated <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples, while, C 18 : 3 was the highest unsaturated one (the only omega- 3 fatty acid in vegetable oils) followed by C 18 : 1, the highest C 18 : 3 level of different <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> formulated from flaxseed oil is due to the highest percent of C 18 : 3 in such oil. Incorporation of flaxseed oil into <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples had marked effect on their contents of such fatty acid. Inversely, all <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples prepared from flaxseed oil showed less oxidative stability compared to control samples, another decreasing effect on resistance against the oxidative rancidity occurred as flaxseed oil% increased in the formulation. No significant differences were observed for sensory properties resulted from using flaxseed oil in <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> formulations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sheep {{carcasses}} with <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> are sporadically {{observed at}} Norwegian slaughter houses. This phenomenon {{is known to}} be inherited as a recessive trait, and is caused by accumulation of carotenoids in adipose tissue. Two enzymes are known to be important in carotenoid degradation in mammals, and are therefore potential candidate genes for this trait. These are beta-carotene 15, 15 '-monooxygenase 1 (BCMO 1) and the beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO 2). Results In the present study the coding region of the BCMO 1 and the BCO 2 gene were sequenced in <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> individuals and compared to the corresponding sequences from control animals with white <b>fat.</b> In the <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> individuals a nonsense mutation was found in BCO 2 nucleotide position 196 (c. 196 C>T), introducing a stop codon in amino acid position 66. The full length protein consists of 575 amino acids. In spite of a very low frequency of this mutation in the Norwegian AI-ram population, 16 out of 18 <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> lambs were found to be homozygous for this mutation. Conclusion In the present study a nonsense mutation (c. 196 C>T) in the beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO 2) gene is found to strongly associate with the <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> phenotype in sheep. The existence of individuals lacking this mutation, but still demonstrating <b>yellow</b> <b>fat,</b> suggests that additional mutations may cause a similar phenotype in this population. The results demonstrate a quantitatively important role for BCO 2 in carotenoid degradation, which might indicate a broad enzyme specificity for carotenoids. Animals homozygous for the mutation are not reported to suffer from any negative health or development traits, pointing towards a minor role of BCO 2 in vitamin A formation. Genotyping AI rams for c. 196 C>T can now be actively used in selection against the <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> trait. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstracr. Adipose {{tissue of}} piglets with <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> disease had {{increased}} activity of nonspecific esterase, 5 -nucleotidase, and acid phosphatase. Since these enzymes are as-sociated with different cell structures and damage to these structures {{can result in}} increased enzyme activity, they are criteria for pathogenetic study of <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> disease. <b>Yellow</b> <b>fat</b> disease is a generalised disorder of fat depots, characterised by extensive adipose-cell degeneration (steatosis) and inflammation of adipose tissue (steatitis). During these processes a progressive peroxidation of unsa-turated fatty acids may occur. Lipofuscin pigment, {{which is responsible for}} the typical yellow discoloration of the adipose tissue, is the final product of this peroxidation process [25, 39]. Steatitis was observed in natural cases in horses [24], pigs [22, 341, minks [26] and other animals [3, 5, 9]. The regular occurrence of this disorder in young animals, in particular, is remarkable [42, 431. An experimentally induced disease was described in pigs [14, 29], minks [151 and rats [25].

In this context the influence of some process parameters in the production of shortenings and 80 % <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> on microstructure and product properties has been investigated. Shear, cooling regime and crystallization conditions influence both the emulsion structure and the fat crystalline matrix.

40|$|AbstractThe hypolipidemic {{effect of}} <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> {{containing}} flaxseed oil (rich plant source of longchain omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid) represents {{the aim of}} the present study. Such effect was biologically evaluated through assessment of four biochemical parameters that reflect the blood serum lipid profile, namely total cholesterol, low- and high-density lipoproteins and triglyceride levels during a feeding experiment for 8 successive weeks using male albino rats. Eight <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> containing 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % total fat were used; of these, four spreads were formulated using palm and flaxseed oils while the other four treatments were prepared by palm and soybean oils at the same concentrations. Results showed that <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> containing flaxseed oil exerted reducing effect on total cholesterol, LDL levels, TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios at higher rates compared with those containing soybean oil or pharmaceutical product especially after 8 weeks of feeding experiment. Levels of HDL in animals administered the studied <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> were lowered at significant to insignificant different rates. Flaxseed oil exerted its beneficial effect when it was incorporated into formulation at high amounts since G 6 (FPB 3, containing 29. 5 % flaxseed oil) and G 8 (FPB 4, containing 39 % flaxseed oil) animal groups exerted higher/comparative levels of HDL after 8 weeks of feeding compared to the initial concentration. Concerning triglycerides levels, all studied groups (except G 8, FPB 4) and controls showed significant higher levels at the end of feeding experiment compared to initial concentration. On the other hand, animals received the highest% of flaxseed oil (G 8, FPB 4) exerted its healthy effect as triglycerides levels were decreased from 104. 3 mg/dL at zero time to 92. 7 mg/dL after 4 weeks of feeding with decreasing rate of 11. 1 %, another reducing effect was noted after 8 weeks as triglycerides levels were significantly decreased to 79. 7 mg/dL (decreasing rate of 23. 6 %) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{a context}} of the {{reduction}} of fat consumption, {{the objective of the}} food industry is to develop low-fat. food products while maintaining their sensory properties. However, these sensory properties depend on. both subject’s physiology and product characteristics but, to date, their respective importance is not well. known. In this context, in-mouth phenomena during <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> consumption appear to be an essential. phase to investigate in order to identify some of the mechanisms driving fat perception. Among the different studies published on dairy product consumption, <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> were poorly considered. while they represent an important industrial market. Moreover spread products are interesting by their. particular structure and composition (water-in-oil emulsions, solid fat content and different sources of fat. (vegetal and animal)) supposing the involvement of specific in-mouth mechanisms. In this context, our. objective was to understand better the respective impact of inter- individual and inter-product variability. on the oral processing events during consumption of <b>fat</b> <b>spreads.</b> In the current study, 15 subjects highly contrasted regarding their oral physiological characteristics were. selected. According to the literature, the oral physiological parameters (oral volume, saliva flow and. viscosity, saliva composition) chosen were considered as important in in-mouth <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> breakdown and. then perception. In parallel, 4 experimental <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> were designed with two levels (53 % and 20 %) and. 2 qualities (mix of animal and vegetable, and only vegetable) of fat. The matrices were aromatized with a. specific dairy flavouring ingredient to improve in-mouth aroma release. Curcumin, a food grade. fluorescent probe, was added to the matrices and was used to measure the thickness of the lipid on the. tongue after swallowing (1). The release of aroma during product consumption was measured by APCIMS. (Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry) (2) on 6 aroma compounds (2, 3 -. butanedione, 2, 3 -pentanedione, 3 -hydroxy- 2 -butanone, γ-hexalactone, benzaldehyde, 2 -nonanone). differing by their structure and polarity. Results show that product_'s effect is more important than subject’s effect. In particular, product physicochemical. parameters (solid content, granulometry, texture) and predict better food bolus properties and. tongue coating than oral physiological characteristics. Concerning aroma release, results obtained were. different depending on the molecule considered and there was mainly a polarity effect. Interestingly, the. releases of 2 -nonanone were affected more by inter-individual variability than by inter-product. variability. This work underline the necessity to consider both subject’s oral physiology and product characteristics to. understand better the different mechanisms that drive in-mouth spread breakdown and then their. perception...|$|R

However, studies analyzing {{the effect of a}} combination of both in individuals at increased cardiometabolic risk are lacking. Therefore, this randomized, controlled, double-blind study investigated the effect of a <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> enriched with two different doses of MCT {{and a special}} long-chain fatty acid-micronutrient combination on cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight diabetic patients. Methods: Fifty-four patients received either a <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> with 6 g/d MCT (MCT 30 %) or 1. 2 g/d (MCT 6 %). Forty-three completed the study. Analysis was performed according to the median of MCT intake (supplemented and foodderived MCT). Clinical, anthropometric, blood, 24 h-urine parameters and dietary intake were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Results: Total MCT intake> 7 g/d (MCT> 7 group) significantly reduced waist circumference (WC) by 1. 81 ± 2. 69 cm, whereas ≤ 7 g/d MCT (MCT ≤ 7 group) increased WC by 0. 32 ± 3. 03 cm (p = 0. 027), which was supported by a change in waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) (p = 0. 018). Fasting serum triglycerides (TG) increased in both groups over time due to dietary habits. In contrast, diabetic metabolic situation and urinary albumin excretion did not alter. Urinary pH differed significantly between groups after 12 weeks. Conclusion: An intake of> 7 g/d MCT reduced WC in overweight diabetics, whereas the increase in the intake of fatty acids may have worsened fasting TG.
