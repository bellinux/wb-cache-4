500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of December 12–13, 1994, McGovern's {{daughter}} Teresa fell into a snowbank in Madison, Wisconsin, while heavily intoxicated and died of hypothermia. Heavy press attention followed, and McGovern revealed his daughter had battled her alcoholism for years and had {{been in and out}} of many treatment programs while having had one extended period of sobriety. He authored an account of her life, Terry: My Daughter's Life-and-Death Struggle with Alcoholism; published in 1996, it presented a harrowing, unsparing view of the depths to which she had descended, the torment that he and the rest of his family had experienced in trying unsuccessfully to help her, and his ongoing thoughts and guilt about whether the demands of his political career and the time he had spent away from the family had made things worse for her. The book was a modest best-seller, and with the proceeds, he founded the Teresa McGovern Center in Madison to help others suffering from the combination of alcoholism and mental health problems. He would later say that Terry's death was by far the most painful event in his life: [...] "You never get over it, I'm sure of that. You get so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> with it, that's all." ...|$|E
500|$|Like Eno's {{previous}} album Here Come the Warm Jets, Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) {{received a}} mostly very positive reception from critics. Writing for the Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave the album {{a rating of}} A–, writing [...] "Every cut on this clear, consistent, elusive album affords distinct present pleasure. Admittedly, when they're over they're over—you don't flash on them {{the way you do}} on [...] "Cindy Tells Me" [...] and [...] "Baby's on Fire". But that's just his way of being modest." [...] Wayne Robbins of Creem lauded Eno for the way he [...] "grafts seemingly disparate elements in any way that might be useful to his flow". Robbins explained, [...] "It sounds like it might be pretentious; it's not, because Eno is comfortable with those pretensions"; he concluded that [...] "a man who can write songs like 'Burning Airlines Give You So Much More' has seen the future, and the future is a sonic Disney named Eno, who makes music <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> with". Circus magazine described the album as [...] "Sick! Sick! Sick! But, oh-h-h, it feels so good! [...] guaranteed to be put on the 'Most Wanted' list by psychopaths everywhere [...] takes you on a dada-ists tour-de-force, lampooning and integrating every type of music conceivable". Critic Ed Naha, writing in Crawdaddy!, gave the album a negative review, writing [...] "Much of the Wonderlandish magic found on Eno's first LP is lost on this rocky terrain, being replaced by a dull, repetitive aura that is annoying as all hell." [...] In 1975 Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) was voted one of the best albums {{of the year in the}} Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1975.|$|E

But you can play in the mud and the dirt, and you’re probably not going to get a disease either, because you get immune to it.

[...] "I am sorry I let the things you said make me angry," [...] First Man said. [...] And then the men sent a raft to the women's {{side of the river}} to bring the women across.

2500|$|Jessie J {{has been}} criticized by people who find the lyrics of the song hypocritical: a [...] "rich rock star" [...] telling {{the rest of us}} that money doesn't matter, or {{questioning}} why she then charges for her music. She has repeatedly explained in interviews that this is a misreading of her meaning, which skewers the superficiality of conspicuous consumption -- or more simply, that [...] "show-offs suck." [...] "For me, so much I hear about how much money people have and how people just take stuff too seriously. It’s not me saying that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> for free, because obviously that isn’t the case; but I’m saying that you don’t always have to let it be about that. It isn’t always about how much your shoes cost. It’s {{about the fact that you}} even have a pair of shoes to walk in." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the topic}} of Twilight's {{ascension}} to becoming a princess, writer Meghan McCarthy explained that Twilight had been embarking on a journey since the first episode of the series that would eventually lead to this outcome. McCarthy explained that the title of princess in Equestria has to be earned by sharing their gifts with others, and that [...] "every little girl {{wants to be a}} princess, and not everybody can get to be a princess—but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> up to the ideals that should come along with being a princess." [...] McCarthy noted that, despite Twilight's new role and the new challenges she will face, her personality will remain the same. McCarthy considers the episode as the first part of a story arc that would continue with the two-part season four premiere episode [...] "Princess Twilight Sparkle", which premiered on November 23, 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Mayor Rob Ford {{called for}} the Danzig Street {{shooters}} to be expelled from the city, saying: [...] "I want these {{people out of the}} city. And I'm not going to stop.

[...] The day after the shooting, he added, [...] "We must use every legal means to make life for these thugs miserable, to put them behind bars, or to run them out of town. We will not rest until being a gang member is a miserable, undesirable life. Ford called for longer prison sentences and decried [...] "hug a thug" [...] social programs, voting against accepting federal grants worth more than $16million.|$|E

2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter because you feel so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> in reality, you can see it for what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E

[...] "Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> here, you know? You feel like you have a life. I come to work, I go home, play with my kid, walk to the store. It's really nice. I get to teach. It's wonderful here." [...] In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, [...] "If I came back here, you can put me anywhere", he says. [...] "Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver— even play the line. The NFL is so structured— 'You do this.'
