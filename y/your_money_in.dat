2500|$|Many {{cultures}} have colloquialisms and proverbs that include donkeys or asses. British phrases include [...] "to talk the hind legs off a donkey", {{used to describe}} someone talking excessively and generally persuasively. Donkeys are the animals featured most often in Greek proverbs, including such statements of fatalistic resignation as [...] "the donkey lets the rain soak him". The French philosopher Jean Buridan constructed the paradox called Buridan's ass, in which a donkey, placed exactly midway between water and food, would die of hunger and thirst {{because he could not}} find a reason to choose one of the options over the other, and so would never make a decision. Italy has several phrases regarding donkeys, including [...] "put <b>your</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the ass of a donkey and they'll call him sir" [...] (meaning, if you're rich, you'll get respect) and [...] "women, donkeys and goats all have heads" [...] (meaning, women are as stubborn as donkeys and goats). [...] The United States developed its own expressions, including [...] "better a donkey that carries me than a horse that throws me", [...] "a donkey looks beautiful to a donkey", and [...] "a donkey is but a donkey though laden with gold", among others. From Afghanistan, we find the Pashto proverb, [...] "Even if a donkey goes to Mecca, he is still a donkey." [...] In Ethiopia, there are many Amharic proverbs that demean donkeys, such as, [...] "The heifer that spends time with a donkey learns to fart" [...] (Bad company corrupts good morals).|$|E

[...] As {{early as}} 1903, Yoakum claimed his movement had performed some 800 healings, and the Los Angeles Times described Yoakum as the [...] "leading apostle of the 'faith-healing' movement in this city." [...] However, the Times noted discrepancies in the dates and {{circumstances of the}} [...] "healings" [...] under the headline [...] "Pouring Oil on the Sick ... Stories Don't Jibe." [...] In 1909, the Los Angeles Times published a lengthy article criticizing Yoakum's tactics. [...] The article, titled [...] "No Miracles Without Cash: Services Halt While Money Is Collected," [...] described events {{at one of the}} healing services held at Pisgah Home. [...] The Times opened by quoting the Pisgah Home motto: [...] "God loves a cheerful giver." [...] It then described a [...] "Healing and Testimony of the Healed" [...] service:"Collection boxes were placed on the grounds about the home and in the tabernacle, and an extra large one was on the platform, where Dr. Yoakum and his assistants perform their miracles. [...] A large audience was present, but the sight alone of the collection boxes did not draw the dollars quite fast enough for the doctor, so the testimony service was stopped long enough for him to tell how necessary it is for one to give away all his money before entering the kingdom of heaven. [...] Dr. Yoakum said that he performs such miracles as mentioned in the Bible, but that the one-tenth of a person's income {{for the purposes of the}} Lord was entirely too small, and that every one should give all their money to God's servants, or rather servant. [...] After his talk the large box was placed on the front of the platform with the simple statement that there were several more at hand should one not prove large enough to hold all. [...] This admonition opened the persons of many and soon the space around the platform was crowded with cheerful givers, many of whom looked as though they needed the money at home. ... Dr. Yoakum said: 'If you have a debt to pay, do not hoard <b>your</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> trying to pay it and be a tight-wad, but give it for God's work and he will find a way for you to get along.'" ...|$|E
