This is {{demonstrated in the}} opening lines: [...] "You know I hate sleepin alone, but <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will soon be home. But baby, {{that was a long}} time ago." [...] As the song progresses, she also wonders: [...] "What about my body, body?/You don’t want my body, body." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the female protagonist [...] "literally packs up her pussy" [...] and leaves the man who no longer seems interested in her, shown in the chorus lines: [...] "Let's go, little kitty kat / I think it's time to go / He don't want you anymore."

Online commented that it was about Knowles' sex organ. Eb Haynes of AllHipHop commented that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] warns all restless boys that they too, become restless. Elysa Gardner of USA Today commented that the lyrics of the song include raw feelings for an unfaithful lover which are sung with [...] "sass".|$|E

And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I was just wondering what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search.
