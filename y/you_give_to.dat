[...] That patient is, I think, a reasonably cured person. It was a severe washing compulsion, as much as twenty hours a day. I didn't go in to the cause or the etiology; the only searching question I asked was [...] "When you get in the shower to scrub yourself for hours, tell me, do you start {{at the top of your}} head, or the soles of your feet, or in the middle? Do you wash from the neck down, or do you start with your feet and wash up? Or do you start with your head and wash down?" ...|$|E

[...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
