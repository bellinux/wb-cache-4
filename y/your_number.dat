500|$|Over the two bridges, Harrison {{presents}} a more engaged perspective. He states that he's [...] "too much in love", but had {{he and his}} lover met [...] "some other day", the outcome might have been different. Fontenot cites these lyrics as the reason why some commentators attach an alternative meaning to the song, whereby the singer is already in a committed relationship and is addressing another woman, {{with the prospect of}} continuing a casual encounter. While considering that Harrison appears to be [...] "playing his options, albeit gently", author John Kruth deems the line [...] "Carve <b>your</b> <b>number</b> on my wall" [...] to be [...] "one of Rubber Souls most enigmatic lyrics" [...] and an evocation of the imagery in [...] "Norwegian Wood".|$|E

500|$|Author Jonathan Gould {{describes}} [...] "If I Needed Someone" [...] as [...] "a rueful {{rain check}} {{of a love}} song" [...] and [...] "an exercise in hypothetical romance". He comments that the melody's phrasing on the off-beat and the [...] "drastically arpeggiated" [...] bass line mirror the lyrical theme of [...] "right person at the wrong time". The lyrics reflect the influence of Bob Dylan, in terms of tone and content. Further to {{the message of the}} song title, Harrison offers his love only if he should happen to need [...] "someone", and on the condition that time allows for such a relationship, and he conveys his feelings in matter-of-fact terms. In Fontenot's description, the lyrics [...] "are representative of the change in the Beatles' outlook and also of its era: tender but ambivalent". Harrison invites the woman he addresses to [...] "Carve <b>your</b> <b>number</b> on my wall", yet offers only the possibility that he will contact her in the future.|$|E
500|$|The Houston Astros officially retired Bagwell's jersey number 5 on August 26, 2007, {{prior to}} the start of a game versus the Pittsburgh Pirates.

[...] Yastrzemski, Bagwell's childhood hero, delivered a special message: [...] "Congratulations, Jeff, on <b>your</b> <b>number</b> being retired. [...] I begged the Red Sox not to trade you when you were in the minors with us. [...] Boston's loss was Houston's gain. [...] See you in Cooperstown." [...] Three first bases were used in the game, each embossed with a commemorative insignia and inscription, [...] "No. 5, Jeff Bagwell jersey retirement, Aug. 26, 2007." [...] One was given to Bagwell and the other two were auctioned to raise funds on behalf of the Astros in Action Foundation.|$|E

2500|$|Pro ranking {{points are}} similar to the National {{armateur}} points awards. [...] "A" [...] Pros get the equivalent of National Intermediate points. i.e. 120 for first, 100 points for second etc. [...] "AA" [...] Pro get Expert equivalent points i.e. 240 for first etc. Both like in the amateur classes get participant points if the racer makes the Main. The person with the most points in a season will be District Pro #1, the same is true to become state Pro #1. However, on the national level not only you must receive the most points, you must race in at least 10 nationals plus the Grand Nationals, the ABA's multi-day season ending event, for the best 10 of your finishes will go toward your national rankings.
