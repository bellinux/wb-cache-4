The staff of Official Xbox Magazine praised the developers for preserving the original gameplay, avoiding [...] "revisionist horrors" [...] and Star Wars rerelease moments.

[...] as [...] "a pretty song, with a sinister monologue {{over the top of}} it"; Greenwood likened its lyrics to a Grimms' fairy tale.

500|$|Eve's {{character}} and storylines initially elicited {{a positive response}} from Passions cast members. Johnson praised the show for its use of its African American characters like Eve. He appreciated the show's representation of [...] "a full African American family" [...] on daytime television with serious storylines, not [...] "just a flash in the pan". According to Johnson, the Russell family was also well-received by African American viewers. He said {{the chance to work}} with Tracey Ross, who he called the it girl for the African American community following her appearance on Star Search, influenced his acceptance of the role. Marshall commented on the absurdity of her character's rivalry with Eve, particularly their fight in the Crane mansion. She went on to praise Ross' acting, and said: [...] "t's a gift as an actor to have a good relationship with your scene partner when you're always the aggressor because you can go where <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and not be afraid." ...|$|E
500|$|Marshall based her {{understanding}} of Liz on the character's relationship with Eve, which served as the primary focus for her character development and story arcs. Liz was initially {{not included in the}} show's descriptions of Eve's past. In the 2001 tie-in novel , Eve is characterized as the only child of [...] "too-busy Harvard history Professor Warren Johnson and journalist Tanya Lincoln Johnson". Marshall felt Liz was irredeemable for her actions against Eve and her love interest Julian Crane. Interpreting the character as having a form of mental illness due to her repeated sexual abuse, Marshall said that [...] "very emotion she has it twisted". Ross added to Marshall's commentary by recommending that Liz should get [...] "some serious electroshock therapy". Marshall found Liz's rivalry with Eve to be absurd, particularly a scene in which they fight in the Crane mansion. She went on to praise her working relationship with Ross, saying: [...] "t's a gift as an actor to have a good relationship with your scene partner when you're always the aggressor because you can go where <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and not be afraid." ...|$|E
500|$|He wrote [...] "Day 'n' Nite" [...] {{after the}} death of his uncle. The two were not on {{speaking}} terms after his uncle forced him out of his home before Cudi could find another living situation. A [...] bitter Cudi never apologized to him before his death, which he now regrets. Other songs on the album expand upon themes discussed in that single. Back in 2007, Drake, who was one of Cudi's first supporters, had shown interest in doing an official remix of [...] the song with him. However, Cudi chose against it since he was not interested in working with people who are in the [...] "same creative realm" [...] as him and because he was in the midst of creating his own works. Beginning in the fourth grade, and getting more tense after his father's death when he was 11, Cudi began dreaming of his own death (which usually was an automobile accident). He channeled these things into his material. Speaking to BlackBook in May 2009, Cudi said of the album and its content, [...] "Each song is a message. All the hooks are stadium-worthy, crowd sing-along, powerful joints that I can't wait for people to hear in stadium magnitude. My album definitely needs to be heard loudly, but it's also a great album if you're smoking and <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to sleep. So far I have the lineup of how I want the first seven tracks on my album and if I play the first seven from the beginning to the end, I'm zoned out and it's the best trip ever. You need to be high to appreciate the instrumentation and how everything is put together on the album—but you don't have to be high just to enjoy it in general." ...|$|E

5000|$|Locomotive, {{written by}} Floca, is a nonfiction book of 64 pages that teaches readers {{about the history}} of the first transcontinental {{railroad}} and locomotive of U.S in the 19th century. The illustrations by Floca follow the history, and the train, engine, station, countries, and people are shown as it was in the 19th century. Through the lines of the book, words are repeated and lines rhyme: [...] "here is how this road was built, with grunt and a heave and a swing, with the ring of shovels on stone, the ring of hammers on spikes," [...] and [...] "Wheels spinning, rods swinging." [...] Similes are used to describe places: [...] "The country opens, opens wide, empty as an ocean."

Creativity is everywhere. ... The initial idea for a job comes to me literally just like that sometimes, and if that first idea is good then you are on the right track. It's not a sign of creativity to have 65 ideas for one problem, that's just a waste of energy. I also don't think <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> anywhere particular to be creative; people just use that as an excuse.

2500|$|On May 27, 2011, Pippen {{generated}} {{a great deal}} of criticism by saying that Miami Heat star LeBron James may be a better player than Michael Jordan. This came only a day after the Heat beat the Bulls 4 games to 1 to advance to the 2011 NBA Finals. Pippen said: [...] "Michael Jordan is probably the greatest scorer to ever play the game. I may go so far as saying LeBron James may be the greatest player to ever play the game." [...] Pippen faced a backlash from Bulls fans after his comments, and even former teammates such as Horace Grant who stated in a radio interview: [...] "Wow, Pippen's my man, and we'll always be close, but I totally disagree. LeBron {{is going to be one}} of the top players to ever play the game, but Michael Jeffrey Jordan, who we bumped heads at times, is I think, the best basketball player I've ever seen."

When I tell them the way I feel, it's like they hear but they're really not listening. I never wanted to become one of those prisoner people. I always wanted to feel free." [...] The singer also commented on her feelings towards fans and her music style. [...] "It's weird because your music is a reflection of what you're going through," [...] she says. [...] "It's such a part of me, the record, 'cause of what I've gone through." [...] In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. [...] "If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, it all goes away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster," [...] she says. [...] "People think that when you go through something in life {{you have to go to}} therapy. For me, art is therapy, because it's like you're expressing yourself in such a spiritual way.

A special thank <b>you</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> few people in particular.

Dr. JunaJuan Wu taught me so much in her Retail Design course and Consumer Behavior course, from those two classes I was exposed to a wide array of retail, merchandising, and business articles.

Dr. Wu also was integral in the design of my research instrument. Additionally, her expertise guided me with the statistical design used in this research.
