It {{is the last}} film in the series to be released by The Walt Disney Company's subsidiary Miramax Films, under the brand Dimension Films. After Dimension Films brand left Disney, Scary Movie 4 became the first film to be released by The Weinstein Company.

25|$|Windows Explorer also {{contains}} modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to Windows Explorer is the Details pane, which displays metadata and {{information relating to}} the currently selected file or folder. Windows Vista introduces a newer IThumbnailProvider interface that shows thumbnails in the Details pane {{as well as in}} large icon views. Furthermore, different imagery is overlaid on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a picture frame around the thumbnail of an image file, or a filmstrip on a video file. Thumbnails can be zoomed on. The preview panel allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> thumbnails of all sorts of files and view the contents of documents, similar to the way you can preview email messages in Outlook, without opening the files. There's a new intelligent algorithm for creation of Video thumbnails, which chooses a random frame inside the video and ensures the thumbnail is not black (XP showed the first frame, it was usually black).|$|E

On her MySpace blog, actress Jenna Fischer urged readers to watch the episode, declaring that [...] "The stuff [...] do together is the absolute funniest thing ever on our show.

500|$|CMX {{came under}} {{a great deal}} of {{criticism}} for its edits from readers. These edits included the length and breadth of the book, censoring out anything they felt was questionable for a teen audience such as covering up or removing nudity, fanservice, and sexual innuendo as well as a removal of an omake chapter. This was done by a brand whose promotional material asserts that it offers [...] "pure manga [...] 100% the way the original Japanese creators want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it." [...] One of grievances made against CMX is that the edits are not only severe, but very noticeable. One review states it is [...] "possibly the most heavily censored title {{in the history of the}} North American manga industry." ...|$|E

500|$|Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India {{gave the}} film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "You cannot {{appreciate}} the smarts {{in the script}} has been written, and how humorously it all gets translated onscreen without getting unduly melodramatic. Since this is ANR's last film, the cumulative nostalgia and feel goodness of the movie might just paper over the structural issues. It's definitely worth a watch". Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle also gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "Vikram Kumar has {{come out with a}} nice story and screenplay and created a classic masterpiece. Though there are past life regressions and rebirths, the director’s intelligent screenplay makes <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more comfortably without any confusion. Manam is a good film to watch and a fitting tribute to Akkineni Nageswara Rao." ...|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four, {{calling it a}} disappointment. Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder's line: [...] "I'm not a psychologist"—reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself—noting that it {{undermines}} established continuity within the series including the character's background in psychology. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, praises the installment, saying, [...] "Place a devil in the plot and I'll follow <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what you can cook up.... I enjoyed this tale of a devil looking {{to be just a}} normal dad immensely." [...] In his view the episode showed a return to the earlier horror-based narratives the series was known for; though he praises the casting of Campbell, he writes that moments between Mulder and Scully are lacking.|$|E

Not only will you want to replay this clip, but her voice on the song will get <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in a completely different light."

500|$|Chuck Taylor also {{reviewed}} [...] "I Want You to Need Me" [...] {{and wrote}} that linking Dion and Diane Warren {{has always been}} about [...] "as fine a fit as a trusty pair of Thom McAn's." [...] Between Warren's [...] "heart-drenched" [...] words and dramatic melody writing and Dion's [...] "potent vocals straight from soulside, divadom has never sounded so mighty." [...] According to him, for fans of Dion's [...] "high-caliber" [...] power ballads, this is truly among the best ever and a highlight on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Longing for romantic attention, Dion sings, [...] "I want you [...] to need me, like the air you breathe/I {{want you to feel}} me, in everything/I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me, in your every dream/The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you." [...] Taylor stated that Warren's trusty melody is wholly natural and free-flowing, while production from the usually rock-oriented Matt Serletic is [...] "sheer perfection". It all peaks from the glorious midsection through to the end, where Dion delivers exactly what we've come to expect: a crescendo as [...] "spine-tingling" [...] as those first few times we heard [...] "My Heart Will Go On".|$|E
500|$|Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald praised Webber's {{ability to}} [...] "... build {{individual}} moments [...] the crackle of a bed-sheet which has grown an ice overcoat after being hung {{out to dry}} in the wintry air ...," [...] but opined that he failed to [...] "... invest these elegant reproductions {{of the art of}} the period with the emotional charge you've been set up to expect." [...] Griet and Vermeer's relationship, Hall wrote, lacked [...] "... the sense of two people breathing easily in one another's company." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, remarked that Girl with a Pearl Earring [...] "... brings off something that few dramas about artists do. It gets <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world through new– which is to say, old– eyes." [...] Gleiberman added that while Johansson is silent for most of the film, [...] "... the interplay on her face of fear, ignorance, curiosity, and sex is intensely dramatic." [...] In Sight & Sound, David Jays wrote that [...] "Johansson's marvellous performance builds on the complex innocence of her screen presence (Ghost World, Lost in Translation)." [...] Jays concluded his review by praising Webber and Serra's ability to [...] "... deftly deploy daylight, candle and shadow, denying our desire to see clearly just as Vermeer refuses to explicate the situations in his paintings. The film's scenarios may be unsurprising, but Webber's solemn evocation of art in a grey world gives his story an apt, unspoken gravity." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} {{theme in}} many of García Márquez's work is {{the setting of the}} village he calls Macondo. He uses his home town of Aracataca, Colombia as a cultural, historical and geographical reference to create this imaginary town, but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area. García Márquez shares, [...] "Macondo {{is not so much a}} place as a state of mind, which allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what you want, and how you want to see it." [...] Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo, there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location. So while they are often set with [...] "a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland... otherwise unspecified, in accordance with García Márquez's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis." [...] This fictional town has become well known in the literary world. As Stavans notes of Macondo, [...] "its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers, politicians, and tourist agents..." [...] makes it [...] "...hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication." [...] In Leaf Storm García Márquez depicts the realities of the Banana Boom in Macondo, which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies. As well, One Hundred Years of Solitude takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom.|$|E

500|$|Released in March 2006 and {{reported}} on game news sites as a curiosity in April {{of the same}} year, the Oblivion Topless Mod had been created by a woman calling herself [...] "Maeyanie." [...] Maeyanie created the mod in protest against what she called [...] "government/society/whatever forcing companies to 'protect our innocent population from seeing those evil dirty things 50% of them possess personally anyways.'" [...] The gaming website Joystiq reported on the mod on April 6, 2006: [...] "Modders are already {{hard at work on}} bending the code of the recently released PC version of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to their will. Early success: topless mod FTW!" [...] Kotaku, another gaming site, reporting on the mod on April 5, 2006, didn't consider the mod anything new and said, [...] "As usual in the world of computer gaming, one of the very first mods released for a popular game allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the breasts of the main character." [...] The content of the mod, wrote commentator Michael Zenke, Editor of Slashdot games, was fairly tame. Without nudity of the lower torso, and without self-consciousness {{on the part of the}} nude NPCs, Zenke wrote, the Oblivion Topless Mod was [...] "as erotic as a doctor's visit." [...] Pete Hines had discussed the mod with GameSpot staff before the game was re-rated, saying that he did not consider it a concern. [...] "We can't control and don't condone the actions of anyone who alters the game so that it displays material that may be considered offensive. We haven't received any complaints on the issue from anyone." ...|$|E

Raeder argued that: [...] "This was possible only because, despite all outside efforts to influence it, the training of the Navy [...] derived from an inner attitude that was itself truly National Socialist. For this reason, we did not have to change, but could become followers of the Führer with open hearts. I find it particularly satisfying that the Führer has always attributed this to me, and I would like to ask all of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> to it that the Navy remains a strong and reliable support of the Führer in this regard". Though Hitler had cordial relations with Raeder, the two had never been close, and there was nothing like the mutual admiration that Hitler and Dönitz shared.|$|E
