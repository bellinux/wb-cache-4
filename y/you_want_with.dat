That is not Justice Brown's philosophy. It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right to do what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>with</b> your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom. Yet {{that seems to be the}} manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document.|$|E
500|$|The first {{track on}} the EP, [...] "Smokin'", was {{commissioned}} by British television station Channel 4 for a programme about sloth presented by Howard Marks {{as part of a}} series on the seven deadly sins. The band went into Grassroots, a community recording studio in Cardiff, in June 1997 and looped a sample of the Black Uhuru track [...] "I Love King Selassie", playing along and writing [...] "Smokin'" [...] "completely spontaneously". According to singer Gruff Rhys the song is [...] "really light and up" [...] as a result of being recorded in the summer. The track's lyrics refer to smoking cannabis, with Rhys stating that it [...] "seems ridiculous that you can't do what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>with</b> a plant that grows naturally" [...] in reference to the drug's illegal status in many countries. Rhys has claimed that he does not consider the track to be subversive, however — it is about the band's own drug use and he doesn't [...] "expect everyone who buys the record to do the same. They'd be quite sad if they did".|$|E
500|$|... "Do What U Want" [...] is a mid-tempo synthpop and R track, drawing {{influence}} from 1980s-inspired throbbing synths and an electronic beat. Eric R. Danton of Rolling Stone {{described it as}} a [...] "muscular club beat". James Montgomery from MTV News said that a [...] "lurching, lascivious beat" [...] was the main backbone of the song, interspersed with Gaga's loud-voiced vocals, a [...] "corky" [...] chorus and Kelly's [...] "cool, coital" [...] singing. The song's chorus is built around arpeggios. Complex described its [...] "Do what you want, what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>with</b> my body" [...] hook as [...] "catchy and somewhat raunchy". The song's lyrics represent themes of sexual submissiveness, with Gaga telling off detractors that her thoughts, dreams, and feelings are her own, no matter what one does with her body. Jim Farber of New York Daily News suggested [...] "Do What U Want" [...] to be a response to [...] "everyone who ever made a tart comment about her — which, by now, involves half the planet". Gaga and Kelly alternate singing the lines [...] "Do what u want/ What u want with my body/ Do what u want/ What u want with my body/ Write what you want, say what you want about me/ If you want you know that I'm not sorry".|$|E

500|$|Willie Dixon's [...] "The Red Rooster"/"Little Red Rooster" [...] uses {{elements}} from several earlier blues songs. [...] The theme reflects {{early twentieth century}} folk beliefs in the American South that a rooster contributes to peace in the barnyard. The image of the rooster appears in several blues songs from the 1920s and 1930s, with two particular songs identified as precursors. [...] Influential Delta blues musician Charlie Patton's 1929 [...] "Banty Rooster Blues" [...] contains the verses [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>with</b> a rooster, he won't crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "I know my dog anywhere I hear him bark", which are analogous to Dixon's [...] "I have a little red rooster, too lazy to crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "Oh the dogs begin to bark". Some of the lyrics to Memphis Minnie's 1936 acoustic combo blues [...] "If You See My Rooster (Please Run Him Home)" [...] are also similar. [...] For example, she sings [...] "If you see my rooster, please run 'im on back home", while Dixon uses [...] "If you see my little red rooster, please drive 'im home". [...] Additionally, similar melody lines are found in both songs. [...] For her recording, Memphis Minnie does a full-throated imitation of a rooster's crow. Mimicking animal sounds later became a feature of several recordings of [...] "Little Red Rooster".|$|E
500|$|... "Nature Boy" [...] was {{released}} for streaming on Gaga's Vevo channel from September 16, 2014. Preceding the release, Gaga tweeted about {{the background of}} the song, about the death of flautist Horn, as well as about ahbez, saying [...] "This composer was part of a sub-culture of nomadic hippies! We channeled our own Gypsy lives in this performance". Gil Kaufman from MTV News gave a positive review, saying that [...] "This song sounds like what you imagine a smoky jazz club in 1940s New York would feel like." [...] Grow praised it as [...] "sublime", describing the track as a [...] "loungier" [...] version Gaga and Bennett's collaboration. Dave Lewis from HitFix believed that the [...] "magic" [...] of the song really happened once Bennett's vocals were heard, following Gaga's singing and the orchestration. Lewis said that [...] "It's not exactly 'Do What <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>with</b> My Body', but Gaga and Bennett generate a different kind of heat." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said that the song was [...] "treated with the greatest delicacy". He praised the flute sounds and the contrast between Gaga's [...] "vulnerable" [...] vocals and Bennett's [...] "assured" [...] one. Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine gave a negative review, saying that her timbre in [...] "Nature Boy" [...] appeared inconsistent, [...] "shifting from soft and almost pleasant to parodic and comical, often within just a few short bars." [...] "Nature Boy" [...] debuted on the Billboard Trending 140 Chart at number five and within a few hours, rose to number one. It also debuted at number 22 on the Billboard Jazz Digital Songs chart. In Russia, it peaked at number 259 on the official Tophit airplay chart.|$|E

But her second single [...] "Aoi Kajitsu" [...] peaked at number 9. Japanese pop culture historians have {{credited}} its success to its suggestive lyrics.
