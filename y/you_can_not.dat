2500|$|In 1898 appeared—also {{under the}} {{pseudonym}} Paul Mongré—Hausdorff's epistemological experiment Chaos in cosmic selection. The critique of metaphysics put forward {{in this book}} had its starting point in Hausdorff's confrontation with Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence. It ultimately gets to destroying any kind of metaphysics. Of the world itself, from the transcendent world core—as Hausdorff expressed—we know nothing and we know nothing. We must assume [...] "the world itself" [...] as undetermined and undeterminable, as a mere chaos. The world of our experience, our cosmos {{is the result of}} the selection, the selection that we have always instinctively made according to our possibilities of understanding and make more. From that chaos would also be seen other orders, other Kosmoi, conceivably. At any rate, from the world of our cosmos <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> conclude the existence of a transcendent world.|$|E
2500|$|Before the show, Madonna {{released}} pink wristbands to {{audience members}} {{in support of}} the LGBT community. In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout. Madonna stopped {{in the middle of the}} show to speak on the issues at hand: [...] "...I feel that people are becoming more and more afraid of people who are different. People are becoming more and more intolerant, but we can make a difference...we don't have to do it with violence, but love." [...] She continued, noting Martin Luther King, Jr. as a fighter for the equal rights of African Americans, and stating, [...] "I am here to say that the gay community and gay people here, and all around the world, have the same rights, to be treated with dignity, respect, tolerance, compassion, and love." [...] She then asked the audience to raise their wristbands with her to show their [...] "love and support of the gay community." [...] She concluded, [...] "for people quoting the Bible, and using God as a defense mechanism: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, and Moses preached this—it's in every Holy book—'love thy neighbor as thyself'. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> use religion, or God's name, to treat other people badly.

2500|$|A {{gauge theory}} {{is a type}} of theory in physics. The word gauge means a measurement, a thickness, an {{in-between}} distance, (as in railroad tracks) or a resulting number of units per certain parameter (a number of loops in an inch of fabric or a number of lead balls in a pound of ammunition.) Modern theories describe physical forces in terms of fields, e.g., the electromagnetic field, the gravitational field, and fields that describe forces between the elementary particles. A general feature of these field theories is that the fundamental fields cannot be directly measured; however, some associated quantities can be measured, such as charges, energies, and velocities. For example, as if for some reason <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> measure the diameter of lead balls but you can obtain an information of how many of them fit into a pound. In field theories, different configurations of the unobservable fields can result in identical observable quantities. A transformation from one such field configuration to another is called a gauge transformation; the lack of change in the measurable quantities, despite the field being transformed, is a property called gauge invariance. For example, if you could measure the color of lead balls and discover that when you change the color, you still fit the same number of balls in a pound, the property of [...] "color" [...] would show gauge invariance. Since any kind of invariance under a field transformation is considered a symmetry, gauge invariance is sometimes called gauge symmetry. Generally, any theory that has the property of gauge invariance is considered a gauge theory.|$|E
