5000|$|Several music {{writers have}} also noted Blowout Combs vocals as being [...] "low in the mix". Ishmael Buttler stated [...] "I read where George Clinton said the stuff thats inaudible {{the first couple}} of listens adds {{longevity}} to a record, because it draws the person in. You might catch a word or a phrase on down the road, and that makes that record all the more intriguing". Ishmael also mentioned [...] "The vocals were to be woven in with the fabric of the music, not necessarily something that was on top. The record label was like nobody can hear what <b>youre</b> <b>saying,</b> but I felt like if the music was engaging enough, then over time it would provide a richer listening experience".|$|E
5000|$|This open {{promotion}} of certain viewpoints resulted in criticism from journalism professors and other newspaper editors, who worried that negative news about {{topics such as}} the military and business might not be covered. Dean Nelson, director of the journalism program at Point Loma Nazarene University, argued, [...] "Now if <b>youre</b> <b>saying</b> {{were going to be}} the cheerleaders of the military, why would you report on this guy thats taking bribes?... Wheres the cheerleading there?" [...] a reference to the Union-Tribunes Pulitzer Prize winning coverage of the Duke Cunningham bribery scandal. A New York Times writer added, [...] "There is a growing worry that the falling value and failing business models of many American newspapers could lead to a situation where moneyed interests buy papers and use them to prosecute a political and commercial agenda. That future appears to have arrived in San Diego." ...|$|E

5000|$|Schwinn Bicycle Company: January 1984-Mid June 1984. Schwinn dropped Billy Griggs because Griggs was {{not using}} Schwinn equipment. As Griggs {{explained}} {{in an interview}} in the February 1985 issue of Super BMX & Freestyle:SBMX: So <b>youre</b> <b>saying</b> you had no bicycle to race?Billy Griggs: [...] "I had a bike to race but it wasnt what I would consider a race bike. It would be fine for a novice or a beginner. I was riding a fully short stock frame. I tried to ride a Sting for a while but I just didnt like it. They understood that and they let me try a different frame they made. But you know I prefer Flight crank and day over one-piece cranks, and the other frame they made was too wide in the rear section for Flights, they just hit the frame, and so I didnt want to ride that bike. It was also too short in the front end by three inches easy, it was really a small bike."SBMX: Yet you won quite a few races on Schwinn bicycles.B.G.: No I didnt, the bike I had was made by Voris Dixon.SBMX: It said Schwinn.B.G.: Thats just it, it said Schwinn, but thats as far as it went. I had to put Schwinn stickers on it because I had to fool everyone with it.SBMX: Were you fooling the people at Schwinn?B.G.: For a while. At first they didnt mind it but then when the Schwinn dealers started asking for that bike and they couldnt supply it, then the problem started."SBMX: So did Schwinn leave you or did you leave Schwinn?B.G.: They called me up and gave me a choice: Either put a Sting together or a bike we make and stay on the team, or dont do it and I wouldnt be on the team anymore.He opted to leave the team in part because it would have taken too long to adjust to a bike with a Schwinn manufactured frame.|$|E
60|$|GUNN [interrupting him] I {{know what}} <b>youre</b> going to <b>say,</b> Count. <b>Youre</b> going to <b>say</b> {{that the whole}} thing seems to you to be quite new and unusual and original. The naval {{lieutenant}} is a Frenchman who cracks up the English and runs down the French: the hackneyed old Shaw touch. The characters are second-rate middle class, instead of being dukes and millionaires. The heroine gets kicked through the mud: real mud. Theres no plot. All the old stage conventions and puppets without the old ingenuity and the old enjoyment. And a feeble air of intellectual pretentiousness kept up all through to persuade you that if the author hasnt written a good play it's because hes too clever to stoop to anything so commonplace. And you three experienced men have sat through all this, and cant tell me who wrote it! Why, the play bears the author's signature in every line.|$|R

60|$|JUGGINS. I have noticed, sir, that Denmark Hill {{thinks that}} the higher {{you go in the}} social scale, the less sincerity is allowed; and that only tramps and riff-raff are quite sincere. Thats a mistake. Tramps are often shameless; but theyre never sincere. Swells--if I may use that {{convenient}} name for the upper classes--play much more with their cards on the table. If you tell the young lady that you want to jilt her, and she calls you a pig, the tone of the transaction may leave much to be desired; but itll be less Camberwellian than if you <b>say</b> <b>youre</b> not worthy.|$|R
5000|$|At times, {{to raise}} cash, Miller would sell [...] "spare parts" [...] to other Stutz owners for their repair/restoration projects. However, rather than selling the actual parts (which {{he owned a}} large {{quantity}} of), he would painstakingly fabricate them himself from scrap metal, using his own cars and spare parts as templates. He was known to other Stutz aficionados as a shrewd but cheap businessman. David Brownell, editor of Hemmings Motor News said of Miller Every time youd try {{to do business with}} him, hed quote the Bible to an annoying degree.

And just when <b>youre</b> about to <b>say</b> something, either out of actual outrage or just social obligation, it follows that slap with an {{outright}} punch right in the face. [...] "The F Word" [...] may be one of those episodes." [...] Carlos DelgadoiF magazine [...] "The F Word" [...] was the highest rated episode of the thirteenth season of South Park. The episode was seen by 1.99 million households in the subgroup of adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode earned a higher rating than that of The Jay Leno Show, a primetime late night talk show on NBC. Nevertheless, it was seen by fewer cable viewers than the FX drama series Sons of Anarchy (coincidentally, a show about a motorcycle club), which drew 2.32 million households; the E! reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which drew 2.19 million households; and a television special about reality show star Kate Gosselin, which drew 2.3 million households.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, after a sold-out Carnegie Hall {{debut with}} Yuri Temirkanov, he {{traveled}} to Beijing with the Philadelphia Orchestra on a tour celebrating its 100th anniversary, during which he performed {{to an audience of}} 8,000 at the Great Hall of the People. The same year, he made an acclaimed BBC Proms debut, prompting a music critic of the British newspaper The Times to write, [...] "Lang Lang took a sold-out Royal Albert Hall by storm... This could well be history in the making". In 2003, he returned to the BBC Proms for the First Night concert with Leonard Slatkin. After his recital debut with the Berlin Philharmonic, the Berliner Zeitung wrote: [...] "Lang Lang is a superb musical performer whose artistic touch is always in service of the music". However, recent reviews have been mixed. Lately, a plethora of music critics have protested against too much showmanship; not enough care; not enough sensitivity. But audiences continue to adore him. Lang Lang has become one of those artists whose career prospers outside the boundaries of critical approval. The pianist is bemused by the backlash: [...] ""You get many good reviews from the beginning," [...] he says, [...] "and then the critics start criticising you. Its strange. The things they liked you for first - unique, fresh - they say is great. And then later they <b>say</b> <b>youre</b> too fresh, too unique. But theyre the same thing!" ...|$|R

In future you attend to my orders and not to iz, e says: what does he know about it? You didnt give me any orders, I says. Couldnt you see for yourself there wasnt room for fours, e says: why cant you THINK? General Mitchener tells me Im not to think but to obey orders, I says.

But we were cafoni...I talked to cafoni of all nationalities from Spaniards to Indians, and we understood each other {{as if we were}} at Fontamara. But there was an Italian townsman who came to see us on Sundays...we couldnt make head or tail of what ...he said. The townsmen also mock the cafoni and treat them very badly, <b>saying</b> <b>youre</b> cafoni, youre used to suffering, and Innocenzo la Legge says, Theres no doubt that legal proceedings would be highly effective if it were possible to seize and sell lice. The cafoni also dislike the townsmen and Marietta says [...] "Educated people are pedantic and get very angry about words. Berardo says [...] "Dont argue with the authorities. The law is made by townsmen. It is applied by judges, who are all townsmen, and it is interpreted by lawyers, who are all townsmen. How can a peasant expect justice?. Later when he is talking in prison with the Solito Sconosciuto, Berardo is shocked at the Solito Sconosciutos proposal and starts shouting [...] "What? Townsmen and cafoni unite? But townsmen are well off and cafoni are badly off. Townsmen work less and earn more, they eat, drink and dont pay taxes. Its enough to see how much they make us pay for cloth and hats and boot leather. Were like worms. Everyone exploits us. Everyone tramples on us. Everyone swindles us. Even Don Circonstanza, the Friend of the People, swindles us." ...|$|R
