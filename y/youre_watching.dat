5000|$|Under its [...] "Está pasando, lo estas viendo" [...] (Its happening, <b>youre</b> <b>watching</b> it) slogan, it {{has become}} one of the countrys most {{successful}} TV news stations. Its also known for being the first local CNN version to be launched outside from the United States.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{is about}} knowing {{the end result}} of every {{situation}} youre in, and being able to play it out in your mind and see it before it happens. Its about addiction, really, about knowing how its all going to end up. In that sense, <b>youre</b> <b>watching</b> a movie of yourself all the time - and then you want out of that movie.|$|E
5000|$|The {{musical score}} {{received}} generally positive reviews. Chaz Kangas of City Pages wrote, [...] "Seemingly {{with a much}} bigger orchestra and undoubtedly more resources to play with, one cant help but marvel at Mad Max 2s music. You could put it over stock footage of childrens education films from the 50s and it would still make whatever <b>youre</b> <b>watching</b> feel legendary." ...|$|E
5000|$|TV Guides June 30 - July 13 double issue {{featured}} {{a review of}} Imaginary Bitches written by Michael Logan. In the review Logan raved, [...] "Youre a damn fool if <b>youre</b> not <b>watching</b> [...] "Imaginary Bitches"!", {{and went on to}} call the show, [...] "Fresh, randy and pee-your-pants funny." [...] Logan proclaimed: [...] "Bitches isnt just great. Its Sex and the City great." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{show has}} been criticised for its {{negative}} and stereotypical representation of Essex, {{and there have}} been a number of complaints to ITV2. Some Essex residents felt it was not a true representation of the area and the people who live there. Kirk Norcross responded to this criticism by saying, [...] "We are all from Essex, so this is Essex. Its not acting. Its not like theyve got people from America and said Right, act like you think you know where Essex is. We are Essex people so what <b>youre</b> <b>watching</b> is Essex." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Lauria {{appeared}} as Vince Lombardi in the Broadway play Lombardi. The play received positive reviews, with sports writer Jim Hague commenting, [...] "Lauria truly becomes Vince Lombardi. You almost forget <b>youre</b> <b>watching</b> an actor. Hes Lombardi through and through, {{down to the}} wire-framed glasses and intimidating scowl." [...] North Bergen football coach Vince Ascolese, who met Lombardi, commented [...] "I really {{felt like he was}} Lombardi. It was uncanny." [...] Laurias portrayal of Lombardi was used during the NFL on FOX introduction to Super Bowl XLV, where the Green Bay Packers, the team Lombardi coached to victories in the first two Super Bowls in 1967 and 1968, defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers.|$|E
5000|$|In the San Francisco Chronicle, Edward Guthmann commended Pfeiffer and Jackson but was {{ultimately}} unimpressed: [...] "Pfeiffer, who segued into mother roles in her past two films, One Fine Day and A Thousand Acres, brings {{heart and soul}} to this domestic melodrama, but its not enough. The Deep End of the Ocean has nothing but the noblest of intentions, and Grosbards direction is meticulous, sober and tasteful, but the movie is so deliberate, so enervated that {{you feel as if}} <b>youre</b> <b>watching</b> it through glass... In a difficult role that he doesnt quite pull off, Ryan Merriman plays Sam, the 12-year-old whose allegiance is split between two homes. As his damaged older brother, Jonathan Jackson brings such confidence, maturity and self-possession that he seems to belong in another movie. And Whoopi Goldberg - all-purpose, you-got-a-part-Ill-play-it Whoopi - shows up as a helpful detective named Candy Bliss." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{character}} was not void of criticism. Although Richard Corliss of Time thoroughly enjoyed the film, {{he felt that}} too much {{emphasis was placed on}} Flynn Rider and not enough on Rapunzel. Corliss questioned the future of Disneys animated heroines, writing, [...] "For 60 years ... girls were the focal characters who could be expected to come of age, triumph over adversity and, in general, man up," [...] and accused various film studios of [...] "abolishing female-centered stories." [...] Varietys Justin Chang described Rapunzel as a [...] "bland, plastic" [...] heroine, likening her to a Barbie doll. Similarly, Tom Huddleston of Time Out described Rapunzel as [...] "bland". James Berardinelli of ReelViews was fairly mixed in his review, writing, [...] "although likeable and energetic, Rapunzel is not as memorable as Snow White, Ariel, or Belle." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out described the character as [...] "synthetic". He wrote, [...] "you never feel like <b>youre</b> <b>watching</b> a girl on the empowering cusp of adulthood so much as a selection of attitudes compiled through demographic study." [...] The Independents Anthony Quinn panned the character, describing her as [...] "bland and Valley Girlish". Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined, [...] "when the big-eyed heroine tries to tug at our heartstrings and Flynn turns into Prince Charming, the too-familiar hero-and-damsel motif feels like a fashion faux-pas." [...] Similarly, the SouthtownStars Jake Coyle wrote, [...] "Both Rapunzel and Flynn too much resemble Barbie and Ken, lacking both superficial and emotional individuality." [...] Jen Yamato of Movies.com criticized Disney for [...] "failing to give Rapunzel a backbone and retreading ground so familiar you can fall asleep for ten minutes and still know exactly what happened".|$|E
5000|$|The {{reviews in}} the Serbian online media are more mixed. Although he still gave Parada passing marks, Popboks Đorđe Bajić has {{problems}} with the films overall tone and its [...] "lack of tact and subtlety", concluding that it [...] "hits the target {{when it comes to}} delivering a loud and unconstrained pastime, but fails when it tries to be anything more than that". The review by KakavFilm.com is essentially more of the same while the review published by Filmovanje.com feels Parada couldve been a great movie had Dragojević been more direct, brave, and worthwhile" [...] concluding that [...] "as it is, at times, youre not sure whether <b>youre</b> <b>watching</b> Tesna koža or Šišanje". Writing for far-left portal E-novine, Vladan Petković was extremely critical, seeing Parada as [...] "nothing more than a marketing trick" [...] while citing its main problem to be the fact that [...] "protagonists are caricatures while antagonists are stereotypes". He continues: [...] "Dragojević tried his hardest to pack the film with witty dialogues and thus provide new material for the Balkan movie audiences favourite activity - citing movie one-liners. And I must say I laughed a few times at some original jokes, but for that to truly work well, the movie must be good as a whole unit (such as Maratonci..., Ko to tamo peva, Varljivo leto 68, Kako je propao rokenrol...), which Parada isnt. It stays in the realm of politically correct fuck-about thats camouflaged in political incorrectness". On the other hand, Marko Radojičić of medio.rs gave Parada a particularly favourable review, praising its casting, direction, attention to detail as well as its overall message, and City Magazine gave the film another glowing review, calling it Dragojevićs best work. The film also received online notices from Slobodan Georgijev in BalkanInsight.|$|E
