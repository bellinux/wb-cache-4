5000|$|Throughout the song, {{backed by}} the video, it is unclear and thus left to the listener/viewer to decide who might be implicated in her disappearance. Marxs {{character}} is set up to be neither innocent nor guilty, {{depending on how the}} evidence is viewed. For example, the video makes it apparent that he flees the scene where he sees Mary with the unidentified person, leaving his scarf behind, which is later used as an attempt to place him at the scene. Yet the lyrics state that he left her by the river ... left her safe and sound, which contradicts the video. Additionally, how would he know that he left her there, if he had not been with her, because she went walking alone and never came home? Furthermore, the video opens up the possibility that the sheriff himself could be responsible for Marys disappearance. He is depicted photographing her with the narrator and following her in his car, but it is never established whether his motives for doing so are borne of jealousy or protectiveness, perhaps on account of the narrators reputation. But what of the lyrics [...] "..theres no escape for me this time, all of my rescues are gone.." [...] The words [...] "this time" [...] imply that this situation has occurred before.

We are applying it {{to model the}} exploratory learning of simple interactive devices — such as boxes with buttons and lights, or domestic central heating timers (Cox & Young, 2000) — although {{we would like to}} think that our framework is of considerably greater generality.

The framework promises to offer an account of various empirical phenomena in exploratory device learning, but — despite its rational basis — it is difficult to fit it onto ACT-R.

40|$|Abstract. Researchers in “contextual {{vocabulary}} acquisition ” differ {{over the}} kinds of context involved in vocabulary learning, and the methods and benefits thereof. This paper presents a computational theory of contextual vocabulary acquisition, identifies the relevant notion of context, exhibits the assumptions behind some classic objections, and defends our theory against these objections. 1 A Computational Theory of Contextual Vocabulary Acquisition Contextual vocabulary acquisition (CVA) is the deliberate acquisition of a meaning for a word in a text by reasoning from context, where “context ” includes: (1) the reader’s “internalization ” of the surrounding text, i. e., the reader’s “mental model ” of the word’s “textual context ” (hereafter, “co-text ” [3]) integrated with (2) the reader’s prior knowledge (PK), but it excludes (3) external sources such as dictionaries or people. CVA {{is what you do}} when you come across an unfamiliar word in your reading, realize that you don’t know what it means, decide that you need to know what it means {{in order to understand the}} passage, but there is no one around to ask, and it is not in the dictionary (or you are too lazy to look it up).

40|$|We {{have all}} {{encountered}} the PageRank algorithm: {{it is how}} Google got started ranking web pages. It involves random walks in directed graphs. We {{are going to talk}} more about random walks in directed graphs in a later lecture. But, I need to give you the introduction now. PageRank considers a process that with probability α jumps to a uniformly random vertex of a graph, and with probability 1 − α follows a random edge out of the present node. The PageRank vector is the steady-state distributuion of this process. That is, if we let W be the walk matrix of the directed graph (<b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how to define it), the PageRank vector p will satisfy p = α 1 1 + (1 − α) W p. n We are going to consider a variation of the PageRank vector called the personal PageRank vector. Where PageRank measures the importance of nodes overall, the personal PageRank vector measures the importance of nodes with respect to a give node u. It does this by modifying the walk so that with probability α it jumps back to u, rather than to a random node. We denote the vector that satisfies this equation by p u, and note that it must satisfy the equation p u = αχu + (1 − α) W p, where χu is the elementary unit vector in the direction of vertex u. For today, we will just consider these vectors in undirected graphs. Let’s begin by showing that the vectors p u actuall exist. By maniuplating the equation for p u, we derive p u − (1 − α) W p u = αχu [I − (1 − α) W] p u = αχu p u = [I − (1 − α) W] − 1 αχu. Before we write this, we should be sure that that the inverse exists. We know that it does because all eigenvalues of W lie between − 1 and 1, so all eigenvalues of I − (1 − α) W are at least α...|$|E
