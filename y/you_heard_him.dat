Ray Galton and Alan Simpson wrote for him from 1964 to 1966 when he worked for the BBC and also for a one-off show for Thames, Frankie Howerd meets the Bee Gees, shown on 20 August 1968. He was famous for his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks to the audience, especially in the show Up Pompeii!, which was a direct follow-up from Forum. His television work was characterised by direct addresses to camera and by his littering monologues with verbal tics such as [...] "Oooh, no missus" [...] and [...] "Titter ye not". A later sale of his scripts, however, showed that the seemingly off-the-cuff remarks had all been meticulously planned. Barry Cryer said of his technique: [...] "What he could do with a script was amazing, like all the great performers. He transformed something you'd just written – what you hoped was in a Frankie Howerd idiom – but when <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> do it, my God, it was something else; – it was gossiping over the garden wall, the apparent waffle – he was like a tightrope walker, you thought he's going to fall off in a minute, you thought , 'Come on, Frank' , we're waiting for a laugh, and then, suddenly, Bang. He {{knew exactly what he was}} doing." [...] Another feature of his humour was to feign innocence about his obvious and [...] double entendres, while mockingly censuring the audience for finding them funny.|$|E

6000|$|... "O aunt! {{what have}} <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> say?" [...] said Mary, nearly {{upsetting}} {{a chair in}} the eagerness with which she turned to her aunt.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> ever <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> sing? I {{think what}} first {{attracted}} {{me to him}} was his beautiful voice. He really sings extraordinarily well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why should I?" [...] he answered. And {{becoming}} grave again, added: [...] "Except on Judge Whipple's account. Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>him</b> to-day, Carl?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{great deal}} too often, {{from all that}} people say," [...] said the archdeacon. [...] "I never <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> myself, and never shall, I dare say. <b>You</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him,</b> Mr. Crawley?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{more than}} what <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> say on New Year's day--that he would go {{as soon as the}} weather got warm enough, and it was {{considered}} safe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "I remember! That packer {{has been}} puzzling me. His face was familiar. The same thing struck the major, as <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes: the Secret. It is {{our only}} sure hold on him. I can force {{him from his}} {{position}} of security, I can drag him and his villainy {{into the face of}} day, by no other means. Whatever the Count may have done, Sir Percival has consented to the conspiracy against Laura from another motive besides the motive of gain. <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> tell the Count that he believed his wife knew enough to ruin him? <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> say that he was a lost man if the secret of Anne Catherick was known?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have been}} {{rendered}} uneasy by {{an account of}} the Lisbon packet's non-arrival, lest Southey should have been on board it. Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>him</b> lately? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If Isaac {{goes about}} the world like that, trouble will come of it," [...] he said thoughtfully. [...] "Have <b>you</b> ever <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> speak of Rosario before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Reverend Edward was abashed. [...] "I wasn't {{thinking}} of his character," [...] he said. [...] "I was thinking rather of his doctrines. Wait till <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> preach." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Are {{you sure}} <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> rightly, Toby, boy?" [...] asked the old gentleman {{as he pushed}} his glasses up on his forehead, {{as he always did}} when he was {{surprised}} or perplexed.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was partly}} owing to his modest air and reticence," [...] {{returned}} the laird. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> converse {{on what he}} would call metapheesical subjects, you would perhaps have been still more surprised." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl {{shook her}} head. [...] "When she sails," [...] said she, [...] "he sails in her. If <b>you</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> talking as I have <b>heard</b> <b>him,</b> <b>you</b> would not doubt that. And if he sails, I sail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, Major Sergine," [...] cried Sophie, in triumph, [...] "that {{is surely}} sufficient. <b>You</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> {{say that he}} gives me his parole. I will be {{answerable}} for his safety." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>heard</b> of <b>you</b> very often, Duke," [...] she said. [...] "Your brother, Lord Ronald, took us down to Norfolk, you know. By the by, have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>him</b> yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what does}} your father think. He is always so fearless--I might say reckless--that I don't feel certain as to his real opinion. Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> {{speaking}} about the chance of that rascal Stalker following him up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don’t {{understand}} it," [...] {{said the}} skipper, shaking his head. [...] "Why, only yesterday {{he was up}} on deck here eating his dinner, and saying {{it was the best}} meat he ever tasted. <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him,</b> Bob?" ...|$|E
60|$|Eliz. I heard him, and his merry carol revelled Through all my brain, {{and woke}} my parched throat To join his song: then angel melodies Burst through the dull dark, and the mad air quivered Unutterable music. Nay, <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'How is {{your son}} now? I have only once <b>heard</b> from <b>him</b> since {{he went to}} India. I daresay <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> speak of me--Mr. Knight, who became acquainted with him some years ago in Exonbury.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "was {{over six}} feet, and broad! It was not he. It {{may have been}} some one whom he sent, but it was not he. Guy, have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>him?</b> Do <b>you</b> know where he is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good night, Mouse dear. I'm {{glad you}} {{got a chance to}} talk to the Silver Girl. But was Mr. Hargis rude to <b>you?</b> I <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> talking Single Tax--or was it Matisse?--and he's usually rude when he talks about them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What was I to do?" [...] Mapuhi protested. [...] "I {{owed him}} the money. He knew I had the pearl. <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> {{yourself}} {{ask to see}} it. I had not told him. He knew. Somebody else told him. And I owed him the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aw, what's {{the good}} of talkin'? We got you red-handed. Right up there's where you left the trail when <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> comin'. You laid among the trees an' bushwhacked him. A short shot. You couldn't 'a' missed. Pierre, go an' get that gun he dropped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You hear, Paul," [...] {{his master}} said, sternly looking at him; [...] "you {{have been found}} guilty, and must die. Alexis, you {{restrained}} yourself for my sake from taking the life of this wretch when <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> plotting against me; you will now act as executioner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Reassuring!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Plimpton, whose {{customary}} noonday hunger was lacking, [...] "I wish <b>you</b> {{could have}} <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> say it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No! No! I haven't! I didn't {{know he was}} here. It's Peter Ivanovitch himself {{who told}} me. <b>You</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> {{yourself}} mentioning a new arrival from Petersburg.... Well, that is the man of 'unstained, lofty, and solitary existence.' My brother's friend!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is never}} dull, {{and the sense}} seems {{sharpened}} at present. Sir Philip was here to tea last night. I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> sing to <b>him</b> some song which he had brought <b>you.</b> I <b>heard</b> <b>him,</b> when he took his departure at eleven o'clock, call you out on to the pavement, {{to look at the}} evening star." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> {{talk you}} would not doubt it. Sometimes I assure you I can hardly {{understand}} him. He seems to have declared war on the King's English {{as well as on}} the English king. Must you really go? He may be here any moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> {{call your}} misthress the name he called; {{and you saw}} him sthrike at me the way he did, and I having nothing but my fist to help me; and were you so afraid of a man like Keegan, you wouldn't step forward to strike a blow for me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> {{shout at}} the wind--louder than the wind? I have heard, being far forward. And before, too, {{in the many}} years I served this white man I have heard him often cry magic words that make all safe. Ya-wa! This is truth. Ask Wasub who is a Haji, even as I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, <b>you</b> {{should have}} <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> just whoop, and cackle, and carry on! He {{reached up and}} hit me one on the shoulder, and says: ...|$|R
60|$|Have {{you seen}} Townshend's {{magnetic}} boy? <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>him,</b> no doubt, from Count D'Orsay. If {{you get him}} to Gore House, don't, I entreat you, have more than eight people--four is a better number--to see him. He fails in a crowd, and is marvellous before a few.|$|R
60|$|THE MOTHER. I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> call <b>him</b> by it. Don't try {{to deceive}} me.|$|R
