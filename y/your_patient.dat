2500|$|The {{concept of}} non-maleficence is {{embodied}} by the phrase, [...] "first, do no harm," [...] or the Latin, primum non nocere. Many consider {{that should be}} the main or primary consideration (hence primum): that it is more important not to harm <b>your</b> <b>patient,</b> than to do them good. This is partly because enthusiastic practitioners are prone to using treatments that they believe will do good, without first having evaluated them adequately to ensure they do no (or only acceptable levels of) harm. Much harm has been done to patients as a result, as in the saying, [...] "The treatment was a success, but the patient died." [...] It is not only more important to do no harm than to do good; {{it is also important to}} know how likely it is that your treatment will harm a patient. So a physician should go further than not prescribing medications they know to be harmful—he or she should not prescribe medications (or otherwise treat the patient) unless s/he knows that the treatment is unlikely to be harmful; or at the very least, that patient understands the risks and benefits, and that the likely benefits outweigh the likely risks.|$|E
