6000|$|... "That {{is for me}} to judge!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You {{say that}} because <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand.</b> A few hours may make all the {{difference}} in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> me. This is {{a matter}} of mere common politeness and good-breeding, and {{has nothing to do with}} any {{encouragement}} to people to marry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand,</b> Hans, {{any more}} than you {{coloured}} people understand what gratitude is. But what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean about this trek of ours? Are you afraid?" ...|$|R

5000|$|In his journalistic {{articles}} and flyers, Scalabrini Ortiz {{tried to show}} the general public what he had learned by investigating.

6000|$|... 'Bah! brother, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand,</b> half a {{foreigner}} as you are. This {{was the only}} way left to me to protect my sister from the insults your English folly had brought on her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are a good}} fellow," [...] he said; [...] "but, forgive me, {{like all}} your countrymen, you carry chivalry just a thought too far--even to simplicity. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> such people and their ways." ...|$|R
