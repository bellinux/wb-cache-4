50|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> is {{essentially}} a nocturnal benthic omnivore. Prey includes fishes, molluscs, bivalves, crustaceans, insect larvae, surface-dwelling insects, worms, frogs and plants. The eel prefers small prey animals which can easily be attacked. Food type varies with body size. Stomachs of eels less than 40 cm and captured in streams contained mainly aquatic insect larvae, whereas larger eels fed predominantly on fishes and crayfishes. Insect abundance decreased in larger eels. The eel diet adapts to seasonal changes and the immediate environment. Feeding activity decreases or stops during the winter, and food intake ceases as eels physiologically prepare for the spawning migration.|$|E

The silvering metamorphosis results in morphological and physiological modifications that prepare the animal to migrate {{back to the}} Sargasso Sea. The eel acquires a greyish colour with a whitish or cream coloration ventrally. The digestive tract degenerates, the pectoral fins enlarge to improve swimming capacity, eye diameter expands and visual pigments in the retina adapt to the oceanic environment, the integument thickens, percentage of somatic lipids increases to supply energy for migrating and spawning, gonadosomatic index and oocyte diameter increase, gonadotropin hormone (GTH-II) production increases, and osmoregulatory physiology changes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo cDNA isoforms of the NKCC 1 {{secretory}} cotransporter {{have been}} {{isolated from the}} European eel. The NKCC 1 a isoform exhibited mRNA expression {{in a wide range}} of tissues in a similar fashion to mammals, whereas NKCC 1 b was expressed primarily in the brain. The effect of freshwater (FW) to seawater (SW) transfer on NKCC 1 a expression was dependent on the developmental stage. In non-migratory <b>yellow</b> <b>eels,</b> NKCC 1 a mRNA expression in the gill was transiently up-regulated 4. 3 -fold after 2 days but also subsequently by 2. 5 – 6 -fold 3 weeks after SW transfer.

NKCC 1 a mRNA abundance decreased in the kidney following SW acclimation and this may correlate with lower tubular ion/fluid secretion and urine flow rates in SW teleosts. Kidney NKCC 1 a mRNA expression in silver eels was also significantly lower than in <b>yellow</b> <b>eels,</b> suggesting some pre-acclimation of mRNA levels.

40|$|Migrating European eel (Anguilla {{anguilla}} L.) glass eels {{were collected}} {{annually in the}} Garonne Basin (France) during 1987 - 1989 and subsequently raised under freshwater conditions. In 1990 and 1991 sex differentiation, gonadal development, length/weight and eye size were studied in relation to metamorphosis from yellow to silver eel stage. Differentiation from intersexual gonads to testes took place after 2 years and was synchronized with metamorphosis. Differentiated ovaries, however, were already present in 2 + yellow eels indicating that expression of female gonadal sex was not synchronized with metamorphosis. Body length and eye size {{were used to assess}} the ontogenetic stage of individual fish. The majority of female <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> and male and female silver eel of the experimental fish could be identified using these external morphological characteristics. Intersexual <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> could not be identified with this method. Intersexual and female <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> reached the silver stage at ages of 2 - 3 and 3 - 4 years and at body weight ranges of 78 - 410 and 309 - 830 g, respectively, implying that metamorphosis in captivity took place at earlier ages and at heavier body weights than in nature. Metamorphosis with respect to enlargement of eyes up to the size of mature silver eels occurred in the hatchery population without hormonal intervention. The testes of silver eels contained spermatogonia in mitotic arrest and the ovaries had oocytes, which were blocked in late prophase of meiosis. Body length and eye size were not suitable characteristics to assess sexual maturity in hatchery raised silver eel. Males and females continued to eat and grow after they became silver whereas gonadal development gradually stopped. The relationship between age, length/weight, feed intake and metamorphosis (including integumental colour change, enlargement of eyes, degeneration of the alimentary tract, gonadal growth/maturation) as well as the role of gonadotropins are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Eel Density Analysis (EDA) is a {{modelling}} {{framework that}} can be used to estimate eel populations in aquatic habitats. Survey data (primarily electrofishing operations) are used to build predictive models describing the presence/absence and the density of eel. These models are then applied to the entire network of aquatic habitat in the area of interest to estimate the total population size. The fluvial (riverine) population of <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> in Ireland was estimated using the EDA (v 2. 0) model (Jouanin et al., 2012). A total fluvial population of 8, 032, 834 yellow eels and 200, 821 silver eels (using a silvering rate of 2. 5 %) was estimated for 2011. Eel presence and abundance decreased as the distance to the sea increased, and the percentage of calcareous geology in the catchments decreased. Stock indictors (B 0, Bbest and Bcurrent) were calculated from these <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> estimates to enable the display of precautionary diagrams for each EMU in Ireland.

40|$|Due to a {{recruitment}} {{decline of}} more than 90 % in 30 years, the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) has been classified by IUCN as critically endangered. Although the species has been studied intensively to obtain knowledge to improve management, studies about the resident yellow stage are relatively scarce. In this study, 52 large female <b>yellow</b> <b>eels</b> were tagged with acoustic transmitters in a Belgian polder system and tracked by a network of 23 automatic listening stations. We studied both circadian and seasonal movement patterns {{and the effect of}} environmental variables on these patterns. Large female <b>yellow</b> <b>eels</b> were most active at night in late summer and early autumn. A generalised linear mixed model showed that their movement is only slightly influenced by environmental variables. Moreover, as <b>yellow</b> <b>eels</b> show high site fidelity (i. e., the majority was detected only in the habitat type of their catch-release location), they do not encounter many human-induced connectivity problems in polder systems, which makes these systems highly suitable as eel growth habitat. These results can contribute to an effective eel management regarding habitat protection and restoration...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} broad {{bioengineering}} investigation at Conowingo Hydroelectric Dam, MD, {{the distribution}} and abundance of juvenile American eel, Anguilla rostrata, downstream of the dam was studied for two years. Results {{of the study were}} expected to provide potential location and feasibility information as part of the broader bioengineering analysis. Elvers and <b>yellow</b> <b>eels</b> were sampled between 24 June and 6 September 2011 using elver ramps (with Enkamat and AkwaDrain substrates) and <b>eel</b> pots (for <b>yellow</b> <b>eels).</b> A total of 1, 159 eels (1, 100 elvers collected from the elver ramps and 59 <b>yellow</b> <b>eels</b> in pots) were collected in the spillway side downstream of Conowingo Dam compared to 166 elvers and 92 <b>yellow</b> <b>eels</b> collected in 2010. Capture of elvers differed between substrate type and location of ramps. The East ramps (located farther from the powerhouse), collected 539 elvers, with 133 collected in the Enkamat substrate, and 406 elvers collected in the AkwaDrain substrate. The West ramps (located near the powerhouse) collected 561 elvers, with 405 collected in the Enkamat substrate, and 156 elvers collected in the AkwaDrain substrate. High elver collections on both sides were ramps parallel to walls suggesting elvers orient themselves upstream to structure. The collection locations of elvers were subject to spillage during the study period which caused extensive damage to the collection gear, and it was observed that the integrity of any potential structure below the spillway could be at risk during spillage. Elver lengths ranged from 87 to 188 mm TL, with an average size of 124. 9 mm. <b>Yellow</b> <b>eels</b> harvested from the eel pots totaled 151 for both study years; with the exception of one, all <b>yellow</b> <b>eels</b> were collected near the powerhouse location. The length range of eels collected in pots ranged from 300 to 689 mm TL, with an average length of 515. 4 mm. Most elvers were split at age I or II, and III to V years of age at 30 %, respectively. A large gap in age at year VI to VIII was apparent; larger eels were aged IX to XVII, plus one at XIX years of age.

40|$|A size-age {{modelling}} {{technique is}} presented {{for assessing the}} vital rates, stock and recruitment of eel populations in semi-closed lagoons with fully monitored migration of silver eels. Data for yellow and silver European eels (Anguilla anguilla L.) were obtained in 2011 from the Comacchio lagoon (Italy). The analysis was performed in three steps: (i) correction of <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> data, which {{are affected by the}} fyke nets selectivity during samplings, (ii) estimation of survival curve, stock, recruitment and metamorphosis rates of the population (calibration using data from 2011) and (iii) validation of the model using the observed amount of silver eel migrating population of the next year. A bootstrap procedure was used to assess the level of uncertainty for each parameter using the 95 % intervals of the highest posterior density distribution HPDD (Bayesian approach). The measured abundance of silver eels was 0. 56 ind·ha- 1, while the <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> abundance and recruitment were estimated by the model for 2011 at 8. 77 ind·ha- 1 and 5. 99 ind. ha- 1 respectively. The model performance during validation was satisfactory as the observed total mass of migrating population of 2012 (3777 kg) was inside the 95 % HPDD intervals (3197 - 3839 kg) of model's predictions. The estimated stocks and recruitment were at least ten times lower from the respective estimations of previous studies of 1989 highlighting the crucial conditions of the population.

Treated elvers were fed with commercial paste food supplemented with mature carp ovaries, containing oestradiol, that induced an early ovarian differentiation and a higher growth rate. The antisera detected seven types of immunoreactive (ir) cells, six of which were already found in glass eel adenohypophysis, suggesting differentiation of these cell types during the leptocephalus stage. In 12 - 14 cm treated <b>yellow</b> <b>eels</b> with small ovaries, a seventh type (ir-GtH) was detected in the proximal pars distalis; in the same animals the ir-TSH cells increased in number and size. From unpigmented glass eels to 12 - 14 cm <b>yellow</b> <b>eels,</b> the whole pituitary volume of controls increased nearly four times, while that of treated ones increased nearly six times. The larger volume of pituitary in treated eels was mainly due to volume increase of proximal pars distalis and rostral pars distalis. The %GH, that is the potential index of GH production, was significantly higher in treated <b>yellow</b> <b>eels</b> with gonads differentiating into ovaries than in controls; no difference was detected in %PRL between treated and control eels.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in evolutionary biology is to understand the mechanisms underlying morphological dimorphism and plasticity, including the genomic basis of traits and links to ecology. At the <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> stage of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), two morphotypes are found: broad- and narrow-heads. This dimorphism {{has been linked to}} dietary differences, with broad-heads feeding on harder, larger prey than narrow-heads. However, recent research showed that both morphotypes could be distinguished at the glass eel stage, the nonfeeding predecessor of the <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> stage, implying that nondietary factors {{play a role in the}} development of this head shape dimorphism. Here, we used transcriptome profiling (RNAseq) to identify differentially expressed genes between broad- and narrow-headed glass eels. We found 260 significantly differentially expressed genes between the morphotypes, of which most were related to defence and immune responses. Interestingly, two genes involved in growth (soma and igf 2) were significantly upregulated in narrow-heads, while nine genes involved in chemotaxis showed significant differential expression. Thus, we found support for the observation that head shape is associated with somatic growth, with fast-growing eels developing a narrower head. Additionally, observations in the wild have shown that slow-growers prefer freshwater, while fast-growers prefer brackish water. The differential expression of genes involved in chemotaxis seems to indicate that glass eel growth rate and habitat choice are linked. We hypothesize that two levels of segregation could take place in the European eel: first according to habitat choice and second according to feeding preference. status: publishe...|$|E

This transformation occurs in association with hormonal surges of testosterone (T) and estradiol (E 2) but not with thyroid hormones (TH) and growth hormone (GH) which have a maximum activity in spring and a minimum activity in summer and autumn. It is therefore suggested THs and GH are not important for eel gonadal development in the autumn.

40|$|In the European <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> stage (Anguilla anguilla), two morphotypes are found: broad- and narrow-heads.

However, recent research showed that both morphotypes were already present at the glass eel stage, the non-feeding predecessor of the <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> stage, implying that other factors than trophic segregation {{play a role in}} the head shape dimorphism development. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the head shape dimorphism has a genetic basis using RNA-seq. More specifically, we tested whether genes involved in muscle and bone development were significantly up-regulated in broad-headed glass eels, as broad-heads have larger muscles to increase bite force. We found that 260 genes were significantly differential expressed between both morphotypes. None of these genes were, however, related to bone or muscle development. Next to this, no pathways were enriched between the two morphotypes. Interestingly, genes involved in growth (soma and igf 2) were up-regulated in narrow-heads, while also 9 genes involved in chemotaxis showed significant differential expression. Our study found support for the observation that head shape is influenced by somatic growth, with fast-growing eels developing a narrow head and vice versa. Next to this, observations in the wild showed that slow-growers prefer freshwater, while fast-growers prefer brackish water. The differential expression of genes involved in chemotaxis indeed seems to indicate that growth rate and habitat choice are related to each other.

The first steroidogenic cells, observed in undifferentiated gonads of 14 - 16 cm <b>yellow</b> <b>eels,</b> showed no P 450 scc, 3 β-HSD and P 450 arom activity, but positive regions appeared in head kidney insulae from this stage until the silver eel one.

Pre-Leydig steroidogenic cells, identified in Syrski organs of <b>yellow</b> <b>eels</b> of 22 - 26 cm evolving into testes, were positive to 3 β-HSD and P 450 scc, but negative to P 450 arom; however, steroidogenic cells in Syrski organs evolving towards ovaries and in small but fully differentiated ovaries were positive to all enzymes. Immature testes of <b>yellow</b> and silver <b>eels</b> had Leydig cells positive to P 450 scc and 3 β-HSD: the same reactions were also observed in some Sertoli cells of silver eel testes containing meiotic cells. Sex differentiation in A. anguilla apparently occurs through an initial female stage controlled by P 450 arom activity.

40|$|The {{material}} {{dealt with}} in this paper contains 975 specimens of fresh-water eels from the Norwegian Skagerrack Coast. Of these specimens 674 (9 males, 665 females) were yellow eels collected in the sea near the shore; the rest, 301 specimens, were taken in lakes and rivers {{near the town of}} Arendal. Of the latter group 150 specimens (35 males, 115 females) were silver eels, 48 specimens (females only) were yellow eels, and 103 specimens were young ones of indeterminable sex. Attention is especially drawn to the two different types of yellow eels, viz. broadheaded and narrowheaded ones. The measurements (external head proportions in relation to total length and thickness of the body) show a marked difference between the extreme specimens of the two types, but also that they are well combined by intermediate forms. Cranial measurements of young eels show the same variation as the external head measurements in larger eels. By counting the vertebrae in typical specimens no difference in this character was found between the two types. By changing from <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> to silver eel the body increases very much in thickness; measurements show that this fact is sufficient to account for the relatively narrower head in the silver eel. The size of the eyes by changing from <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> to silver eel increases by 62 per cent in the males, 39 per cent in the females. The analysis of the stomach content of the eels from the sea shows that crustaceans, and partly small fishes, are the most important food animals.

Sections of the entire gonad were exposed to goat polyclonal antibodies and prepared for optical microscopy (Grandi et al., 2003). The first steroidogenic cells, observed in undifferentiated gonads of 14 - 16 cm eels, did not show P 450 scc, 3 β-HSD and aromatase activity, but a positive immunolocalization appeared at the same stage in cephalic kidney (interrenal) regions.

A spatial analysis of the data demonstrated that the variation in pollutant concentration tended towards higher values. This was especially evident for PCBs, lindane, endrin, dieldrin and DDE. The concentration of almost all banned substances decreased significantly during the study period. Although tissue concentrations of PCBs, pesticides and heavy metals decreased over time, they remain sufficiently high for the consumption of wild captured eel to still be discouraged...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the global}} {{context of the}} decline in wild species, {{modeling}} the distribution of populations is a crucial aspect of ecological management. This can be a major challenge, especially for species, such as the European eel, that have complex life cycles, exhibit cryptic behavior, or migrate over long distances. A review of the literature suggests that eel size data could be used to assess and analyze freshwater distribution of eel. We argue that analyses based on small yellow eels (≤ 300 mm) along the longitudinal course of rivers could provide a valuable tool for population monitoring. We propose a standardized catchment recruitment index and a colonization index based on the probability of occurrence (presence/absence data) using logistic models for different size classes. The model developed here provides a convenient guide for assessing <b>yellow</b> <b>eel</b> stages in freshwater areas, and should have concrete applications for management of the species...|$|E
40|$|Biotelemetric techniques, now {{extensively}} {{utilized in}} fisheries research, have great potential {{in studies of}} activity patterns and individual movements of fish, {{as well as for}} monitoring physiological and environmental variables. In the case of eels these methods have been employed in a variety of marine and estuarine studies. However, telemetric studies of eels in fresh water have been much more limited. Radiotelemetry was used to monitor movements of Anguilla rostrata in Lake Champlain, Vermont, on the US/Canadian border, and of Anguilla anguilla in a small Spanish lake. Acoustic tags were used by Westerberg (1982) to track migrating silver eels, A. anguilla, through Lake Hjalmaren in Sweden. In the present study acoustic tracking methods were employed to monitor <b>yellow</b> <b>eel,</b> A. anguilla, movements in freshwater in western Ireland. The general objectives were to analyse individual movements with respect to swimming speeds, diel activity cycles, and environmental factors...|$|E

The objective of this study was to determine the long-term effects (between 1 and 11 years) of the PIT tag on the growth of the <b>yellow</b> European <b>eel</b> (Anguilla anguilla). A difference of more than 50 % was observed in the growth of marked and unmarked <b>yellow</b> <b>eels.</b> If this is a general long term effect in all eels, it would seriously restrict the use of PIT tags for studying the dynamics of European eel populations, and so for their management...|$|R
