The {{scholars}} and scientists of this world agree that the origin of man and humankind started in Africa and that the first parent {{of the world was}} Black. The Qur'an says that God created Adam out of black mud and fashioned him into shape. So if white people came from the original people, the Black people, what is the process by which you came to life? That is not a silly question. That is a scientific question with a scientific answer. It doesn't suggest that we are superior or that you are inferior.
