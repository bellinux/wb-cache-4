25|$|In the 1970s, <b>yuppies</b> {{began moving}} into the North End. City councilman Frederick C. Langone helped slow the {{gentrification}} process by getting the city to build affordable housing for the elderly so that longtime residents {{would not have to}} leave the neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|St Kilda also {{experience}} increased gentrification {{during the}} 1990s, particularly popular with <b>yuppies</b> {{due to its}} proximity to the CBD. The increased cost of rentals led many long term residents to leave and removed much of the bohemian and artistic character of the area.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a small}} wave of Italian {{immigration}} to Boston following World War II which lasted about 15 years, and brought immigrants from Sulmona, Apulia, Frascati, and elsewhere. Several of these new residents opened Italian restaurants, cafes, and bakeries in the North End, which helped to preserve the Italian atmosphere in the 1970s when the neighborhood began attracting <b>yuppies.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1986, Burlinson {{played the}} main role as <b>yuppy</b> {{windsurfer}} {{in the main}} modern day comedy romance Windrider alongside teen actress Nicole Kidman in her first adult role. The film was a hit both in Australia and the United States.|$|R
25|$|The {{resulting}} low-density {{development has}} been given the pejorative label urban sprawl. This is changing, however. White flight is reversing, with many <b>Yuppies</b> and upper-middle-class, empty nest Baby Boomers returning to urban living, usually in condominia, such as in New York City's Lower East Side, and Chicago's South Loop. The result has been the displacement of many poorer, inner-city residents. (see gentrification).|$|E
25|$|The new {{restaurant}} was immediately popular. Washington Post food critic Phyllis Richman declared the restaurant's signature hamburger its best entree. She found the appetizers and salads excellent, but considered the pasta dishes hit-or-miss and disparaged the main entrees. Within a year, {{the restaurant was}} mostly being patronized by <b>yuppies,</b> lawyers, and tourists. 1986 food reviews in the Washington Post concluded that Old Ebbitt Grill had the worst omelets and pancakes in the city, but the best appetizers. Its main claim to fame was its hefty portions and moderate prices.|$|E
25|$|However, Docklands {{was close}} to the City of London and this made it an {{attractive}} secondary office location as well as a possible site for riverside residential development to accommodate the phenomenon of <b>yuppies,</b> the young high income single person households created by new jobs in the financial services industry. In {{the first few years of}} LDDC's operation several offices and flats schemes were given the go ahead including on Heron Quays and Surrey Quays. Many of these buildings demonstrated unique architecture, such as the Baltic Quay building in the Surrey Docks.|$|E
50|$|The {{new image}} for Del Boy {{was based on}} Gordon Gekko from the movie Wall Street (Rodney {{mentions}} that his brother saw the film six times), {{as part of the}} <b>yuppy</b> movement that was popular at the time. The episode also introduces Cassandra into the series.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the boys}} get booked, photographed and {{thrown into a}} jail cell with a <b>yuppy</b> murderer, named Herb, and a biker/poet, named Ray. Finally the sheriff decides that the guys aren't {{suspects}} when he learns that the stolen Bronco was found and the real culprits were arrested in San Diego. But the Sheriff extorts $1,200 from Zack to let {{them out of the}} jail.|$|R
50|$|Established by {{a former}} Woolworth's Store Manager, the first store opened in 1975 and was located in the Brisbane suburb of Auchenflower. The store pre-dated 7-Eleven opening in Australia by 12 months. The store traded 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, {{offering}} an extensive range of traditional supermarket grocery items-together with fresh fruit, vegetables and hot bbq chickens. The store was popular with the growing student and <b>yuppy</b> community in the district. The business concept was franchised in 1987.|$|R
25|$|New {{characters}} Des and Steph Barnes {{moved into}} one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as <b>Yuppies.</b> Raquel Wolstenhulme (Sarah Lancashire) first appeared in 1991 and went on {{to become one of the}} most popular characters. The McDonald family were developed and the fiery relationships between Liz, Jim, Steve and Andy interested viewers. Other newcomers were Maud Grimes (Elizabeth Bradley), Roy Cropper (David Neilson), Judy and Gary Mallett, as well as Fred Elliot (John Savident) and Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold). The amount of slapstick and physical humour in storylines increased during the 1990s, with comical characters such as Reg Holdsworth and his water bed.|$|E
500|$|A {{crossover}} episode {{with the}} live-action sitcom Thirtysomething, titled [...] "Thirtysimpsons", {{was written by}} David Stern for this season, but was never produced because it [...] "never seemed to work". The crossover would involve Homer meeting a group of <b>Yuppies</b> and hanging out with them.|$|E
500|$|Michael Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor {{and thanked}} Oliver Stone for [...] "casting me {{in a part}} that almost nobody thought I could play". However, Daryl Hannah's {{performance}} was not as well received and earned her a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress, thus making this the only film to date to win both an Oscar and a Razzie. The [...] "quintessential financial high-roller's attire" [...] of Michael Douglas in the movie, designed by Alan Flusser, was emulated in the 1980s by <b>yuppies.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In addition, the Preppy looks also caught onto 80s {{youth in}} {{the first wave of}} hip hop influence. “This group of black <b>yuppy</b> wannabes or ‘buppies’ rocked to 80’s hip hop music and wore styles from Polo, The Timberland [...] and Tommy Hilfiger [...] … [...] were drawn to Hilfiger because of its all-American, WASP-y, country club feeling—it was {{exclusive}} and aspirational”. [...] The immense popularity of the brand, Tommy Hilfiger among the hip hop subculture community then led to the global expansion of the brand.|$|R
5000|$|Aaftab (Ajay Devgan [...] ) and Dhananjay (Saif Ali Khan) are {{two step}} {{brothers}} who meet {{for the first}} time. Each one has a selfish approach to life; Aaftab is a petty smuggler, specializing in smuggling goods across the Rajasthan border into Pakistan whilst Dhananjay is a corporate <b>yuppy</b> from the city, with a high-flying lifestyle. Aaftab {{is in love with}} Rukshana (Manisha Koirala), but is rejected by her family because he is illegitimate. Dhananjay is dating Ragini (Namrata Shirodkar) and has his father's death to contend with.|$|R

500|$|In 2011, Willamette Week Ruth Brown said, [...] "Red Cap Garage still parties like it's 1987. The {{crowd is}} {{generally}} younger and less hairy than at nearby Scandals, but the huge, heaving sunken dance floor welcomes all comers—from queens to hags—while the entertainment ranges from bingo nights to all-male revues to simply {{sitting on the}} heated front patio watching unsuspecting tourists and <b>yuppies</b> wander in off the street—then quickly run out again." [...] In 2012, Red Cap and Aura were co-nominated for the Q Means Business Award at the Q Center's Winter Gala Awards.|$|E
500|$|Employment {{of illegal}} aliens was not {{uncommon}} at the time, but in Baird's case it was especially bad public relations, since the Attorney General {{was in charge of}} the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). [...] Baird's wealth – she made $500,000 a year in her job and together with her husband had a combined income of $600,000 – made her, in the context of the early 1990s recession, an unsympathetic figure to not be paying taxes. [...] Moreover, Baird and Gewirtz had been wealthy enough to afford legal child care, but instead had paid the Corderos $250 a week plus board, well below minimum wage. [...] The news brought about an immediate and large-scale negative reaction. As Guardian U.S. correspondent Martin Walker later wrote, [...] " [...] were the overpaid <b>yuppies</b> and ubiquitous lawyers whom American voters had come to resent." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's lyrics, {{written by}} Yorke, are more {{abstract}} compared to his personal, emotional lyrics for The Bends. Critic Alex Ross said the lyrics [...] "seemed {{a mixture of}} overheard conversations, techno-speak, and fragments of a harsh diary" [...] with [...] "images of riot police at political rallies, anguished lives in tidy suburbs, <b>yuppies</b> freaking out, sympathetic aliens gliding overhead." [...] Recurring themes include transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism. Yorke said: [...] "On this album, the outside world became all there was... I'm just taking Polaroids of things around me moving too fast." [...] He told Q: [...] "It was like there's a secret camera {{in a room and}} it's watching the character who walks in—a different character for each song. The camera's not quite me. It's neutral, emotionless. But not emotionless at all. In fact, the very opposite." ...|$|E
40|$|The Problem: To {{create a}} mobile robot with {{morphology}} that {{is conducive to}} human interaction and equipped with sufficient sensors and actuators that social behavior is possible. This research {{is a continuation of}} the work done on the <b>Yuppy</b> robot. Motivation: Artificial social behavior models require a platform that provides both sensory input and a medium for behavioral output. The amount and quality of sensory information provided to the software directly impacts performance and capabilities for further development. In the same way, the repertoire of expression directly effects how well the system will be perceived to be working. A mobile platform adds an entirely new dimension to both the sensory systems and behavior generation by allowing everything the robot senses and does to be related to physical position. Human factors also play into the success of a particular behavior model; if people have difficulty interacting with the platform then the abilities of the model will be put at a disadvantage. Previous Work: Many robots have been built to test behavioral and sensing systems. Most closely related to this effort is <b>Yuppy,</b> a mobile robot based on a commercial wheeled platform that was augmented with a two-degree-of-freedom vision head, an actuated tail, and a pressure-sensing bag for tactile stimulus. Other robots include Cog and Kismet[1, 2]...|$|R
5000|$|The only running phrase Rodney uses is {{the word}} [...] "cosmic" [...] to {{describe}} something good or impressive, either in a sentence or exclamation form. More often than not, he uses this expression sarcastically, such as when being caught in a downpour without a raincoat that fits (<b>Yuppy</b> Love), or upon hearing a set of wardrobe doors acquired by Del were stolen (As One Door Closes). However, he frequently calls Del a [...] "git" [...] {{in the same way}} as Del would call him a [...] "plonker", [...] " [...] wally" [...] or [...] "dipstick".|$|R
50|$|Del Boy is {{suffering}} from a mysterious illness that is giving him stomach pains, but he refuses to admit to it or go {{to see a doctor}} because he is scared of them. He is also under a great deal of stress; his recent line in women's summer fashion has not been selling well with all the frost and sleet and he has been unable to pay the rent on the flat for the past three months. In {{spite of the fact that}} he, Rodney, and Albert are facing the possibility of eviction, Del is still living the <b>yuppy</b> lifestyle, eating in the curry houses and bistros, and drinking and buying rounds in wine bars and pubs, all on the slate, causing further debts.|$|R
500|$|The Simpson family {{visits a}} home and garden show where they decide to {{purchase}} a hot tub. They spend hours soaking in the tub and become so relaxed that they forget to visit Abraham [...] "Grampa" [...] Simpson at a family event. Grampa angrily unplugs and destroys the hot tub, scolding them for ignoring him. Homer decides {{to make up for}} their neglect and decides to do something Grampa wants to do. Grampa reminisces about a pub in Dunkilderry, Ireland called O'Flanagan's, where he claims to have had the best night of his life many years ago. Homer decides to take Grampa there for one last drink. When the family arrives they realize Ireland has become a commercialized, hi-tech country of consumers and workaholics. The pub itself has run out of business as many of the patrons are now <b>yuppies</b> who have no interest in drinking. The pub owner Tom O'Flanagan is happy to have customers again. Homer and Grampa sit down at the pub and start drinking while Marge, Bart and Lisa visit various Irish landmarks. They visit the Giant's Causeway, Blarney Castle, the Guinness brewery and Dublin.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{retrospective}} of both Rachel and of Baxendale's performance when the series ended. In the New Statesman, Andrew Billen wrote that Rachel [...] "was as near to a sex symbol as this comedy drama about six cold-footed <b>yuppies</b> produced. She was also materialistic, unfaithful, self-absorbed, tricky {{and had not}} the first clue about men [...] Yet her death, caused by a moment of carelessness behind the wheel, was powerful and shocking, {{a tribute to the}} extent to which we have invested and believed in her." [...] Observer critic Kathryn Flett noted that Baxendale's high-profile role in Friends made her the [...] "star" [...] of Cold Feet in the first series, but both she and Rachel had been [...] "eclipsed" [...] by the other actors and characters by the time of the final series. Spectator critic Simon Hoggart wrote, [...] "I wasn't as sorry about poor old Rachel as I should have been. It was one of those deaths which makes you think, 'Oh, her poor baby boy,' rather than 'Goodness, how we'll miss her.'" [...] Hoggart attributed his ambivalence to Baxendale's portrayal of the character as a [...] "fraught, snippy" [...] woman. Matt Greenhalgh, who co-wrote the episode featuring Rachel's death, called killing off the character [...] "a privilege".|$|E
2500|$|The Bongwater song [...] "Folk Song," [...] {{released}} on the band's 1991 album The Power of Pussy involves Ann Magnuson {{trying to persuade}} an anarchist at the demonstration out of calling {{for the death of}} rich men, <b>yuppies,</b> bourgeois Blacks, landlord Jews, bankers, et cetera.|$|E
50|$|The Trotter {{brothers}} {{spend all}} day driving around London looking for Albert, including searching the Seaman's Mission and the HMS Belfast. Eventually, they find their uncle at a <b>yuppy</b> housing development {{that used to be}} Tobacco Road. Del and Rodney apologise to Albert for yelling at him the previous night. Albert tells them how he first came to Tobacco Road at the age of 15 and got a job on a trampsteamer. He laments the fact that the old neighbourhood has been torn down for the housing development, while Del thinks of it as a huge improvement and starts to wax lyrical about what he plans to do when he can afford to move there. Rodney takes Albert home in the van, leaving Del alone to stare dreamily across the waters.|$|R
2500|$|Sullivan had a {{tendency}} to write scripts that were too long, meaning a lot of good material had to be cut. Shortly before filming of the sixth series began, he and Jason requested that the show's time slot be extended and it was agreed to extend its running time to 50 minutes. This required a 40 per cent increase in the show's budget, and coincided with the show becoming one of the BBC's most popular programmes, according to producer Gareth Gwenlan. Robin Stubbs became the costume designer for the sixth series, and was responsible for getting Del's attire to match his new <b>yuppy</b> image. His new suits cost around £200 each and were purchased from Austin Reed in Regent Street. The rest came from stores such as Tie-Rack and Dickins and Jones. His jewellery was replaced each series because it was very cheap (the rings with [...] "D" [...] cost 50p each).|$|R
50|$|The intelligent, slightly-spoiled {{daughter}} of {{the owner of a}} successful paper merchant, Alan (Denis Lill) and his wife Pam (Wanda Ventham), Cassandra was an ambitious employee of the local bank. She made her first Only Fools and Horses appearance in the episode <b>Yuppy</b> Love, in which she was an attendee of Rodney's adult education class. The two first met when they accidentally mixed up their raincoats in the cloak room, and met again at a disco later that night, at which Rodney's friends Mickey Pearce and Jevon unsuccessfully ask her for a dance. Rodney then bet £20 that he would be successful and, to their horror, she agreed to dance with him. Cassandra also offered to give him a lift home, and they exchanged telephone numbers. However, as he was ashamed to take her home to Nelson Mandela House, he pretended he lived in a more upmarket location on King's Avenue and was duly left stranded as it began to pour with rain, again getting their coats mixed up leaving Rodney to walk home.|$|R
2500|$|At 39 {{years of}} age, he {{defeated}} Tupelo businessman Jack Reed in the 1987 gubernatorial election by 53% to 47%, becoming the youngest {{governor in the}} United States. He won [...] "on a wave of black votes" [...] (black voters made up about 30 percent of the state's registered voters) and lost the white vote [...] "by about 3 to 2" [...] despite support from what a coalition one Democratic state chairman described as [...] "poor whites" [...] and <b>yuppies.</b> Mabus, who ran on the slogan [...] "Mississippi Will Never Be Last Again", was billed as [...] "the face of the New South", much like his counterpart in Arkansas at the time, Bill Clinton. Mabus was featured in a 1988 New York Times Magazine cover story titled [...] "The <b>Yuppies</b> of Mississippi; How They Took Over the Statehouse".|$|E
2500|$|Media {{treatment}} of CFS {{has often been}} controversial; in November 1990, the magazine Newsweek ran a cover story on CFS which, although supportive of an organic cause of the illness, also featured the term Yuppie Flu. Reflecting [...] a stereotype that CFS mainly affected <b>yuppies,</b> the [...] implication was that CFS {{was a form of}} burnout. Use of the term Yuppie flu is considered offensive both by patients and clinicians.|$|E
2500|$|Lomborg is gay and a vegetarian. As {{a public}} figure {{he has been a}} {{participant}} in information campaigns in Denmark about homosexuality, and states that [...] "Being a public gay is to my view a civic responsibility. It's important to show that the width of the gay world cannot be described by a tired stereotype, but goes from leather gays on parade-wagons to suit-and-tie <b>yuppies</b> on the direction floor, as well as everything in between".|$|E
5000|$|The album {{so far has}} a {{score of}} 70 out of 100 from Metacritic based on [...] "generally {{favorable}} reviews". Prefix Magazine gave the album a score of seven out of ten and said it has [...] "Enough bending guitar licks to satisfy the <b>yuppiest</b> of thirtysomething businessmen and enough mellow ballads to satisfy your Dixie Chicks-loving mom." [...] Trouser Press gave it a positive review and said, [...] "Some of the songs are immediately engrossing... Others mostly carry the story forward while allowing Mann to indulge her career-long taste for vintage keyboard orchestration, coolly elegant pop arrangements and displays of tart wordplay." [...] E! Online gave it a B− and said it [...] "reveals how straight-up dull Mann's country-tinged songs can be." [...] Other reviews are very average, mixed or negative: Mojo gave it three stars out of five and called it [...] "an unfussy affair". Blender gave it two stars out of five and said of Mann, [...] "If she doesn't follow commercial formulas, she's following creative ones, and selling herself short in the process." [...] The A.V. Club gave it an unfavorable review and said, [...] "Mann's signature wordplay sounds clichéd and exhausted, and her melodies lack the energy and pop sparkle that distinguished her pre-Lost In Space work." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{everyday}} {{foreign exchange}} market trading and news reporting, the currency pairs are often referred to by nicknames rather than their symbolic nomenclature. These are often reminiscent of national or geographic connotations. The GBP/USD pairing is known by traders as cable (also the cable), which has its origins from the time when a communications cable under the Atlantic Ocean synchronized the GBP/USD quote between the London and New York markets. GBP is also referred to by traders as quid. The following nicknames are common: [...] "Swissy" [...] or [...] "Euro-Swissy" [...] for EUR/CHF, Fiber for EUR/USD, Chunnel for EUR/GBP, Loonie and The Funds for USD/CAD, Aussie for AUD/USD, Gopher for USD/JPY, Guppy for GBP/JPY, <b>Yuppy</b> for EUR/JPY, and Kiwi or The Bird for the New Zealand Dollar NZD/USD pairing. New innovations include Barney for USD/RUB and Betty for EUR/RUB after the fictional characters the Rubbles in The Flintstones. Additionally, exotic pairs have earned more esoteric nicknames such as [...] "Glock" [...] for COP/SGN after the service pistol often carried by police officers (the ticker {{can be viewed as}} (Cop's G(u)n)). Nicknames vary between the trading centers in New York, London, and Tokyo.Care should be taken with the use of 'Betty, for EUR/RUB as, in London markets 'Betty' is used as cockney slang for Cable as in Betty Grable = Cable = GBP/USD.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, [...] "Adam" [...] spread through {{personal}} networks of psychotherapists, psychiatrists, users of psychedelics, and <b>yuppies.</b> Hoping MDMA could avoid criminalization like LSD and mescaline, psychotherapists and experimenters attempted {{to limit the}} spread of MDMA and information about it while conducting informal research. Early MDMA distributors were deterred from large scale operations {{by the threat of}} possible legislation. Between the 1970s and the mid-1980s, this network of MDMA users consumed an estimated 500,000 doses.|$|E
