25|$|Having {{received}} your peace offer, I {{consider it}} {{my duty to}} express you some caustic and bitter words that might generate for you the most unpleasant experience by this honesty, as I'm rejecting <b>your</b> <b>proposal.</b>|$|E
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. You must let me {{have time}} to {{consider}} <b>your</b> <b>proposal.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Colonel," [...] said Barnes, [...] "my dear, kind Colonel! I needn't {{tell you}} that <b>your</b> <b>proposal</b> flatters us, as much as your {{extraordinary}} generosity surprises me. I never heard anything like it--never. Could I consult my own wishes I would at once--I would, permit me to say, from sheer admiration of your noble character, say yes, with all my heart, to <b>your</b> <b>proposal.</b> But, alas, I haven't that power." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Barker, <b>your</b> <b>proposals</b> are as damnable as your manners. I want to {{have nothing}} to do with them. Suppose I stopped them altogether. What would happen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The doctor smiled. 'That point I grant. Well, {{one must}} chance something. I accept <b>your</b> <b>proposals.</b> You {{will give me}} a written agreement, signed by Mr. Logan, for the arrangement.' ...|$|R
5000|$|August 1: The Tsar {{responds}} to the king's telegram, stating, [...] "I would gladly have accepted <b>your</b> <b>proposals</b> had not the German ambassador this afternoon presented a note to my Government declaring war." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{can be no}} doubt," [...] said I, [...] "that I {{declined}} <b>your</b> <b>proposal</b> {{without any}} reservation or qualification whatever, Mr. Guppy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Consider <b>your</b> <b>proposal</b> declined, {{in every}} particular," [...] she said. [...] "And {{go on to}} your other way of {{bringing}} the inquiry to an end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Baron," [...] said he, [...] "your {{visit and}} <b>your</b> <b>proposal</b> are both a little amazing. Forgive me if I speak alone with Mademoiselle for a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I take upon myself, sir," [...] said my guardian, {{laughing}} as he rang the bell, [...] "to reply to <b>your</b> <b>proposals</b> {{on behalf of}} Miss Summerson. She is very sensible of your handsome intentions, and wishes you good evening, and wishes you well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, captain," [...] said Harry, as {{he raised}} a can of tea to his lips, and nodded to Hamilton as if {{drinking}} his health, [...] "go on with <b>your</b> <b>proposals</b> for the day. Five miles up the river to begin with, then--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are too hasty, sir," [...] she cried. [...] "You {{forget that}} I {{have made no}} answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the {{compliment}} you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of <b>your</b> <b>proposals,</b> but {{it is impossible for}} me to do otherwise than to decline them." ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS, It took {{my breath}} away, and I haven't {{recovered}} it yet, entirely--I mean {{the generosity of}} <b>your</b> <b>proposal</b> to read the proofs of Huck Finn.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel very}} much honoured by <b>your</b> <b>proposal,</b> Mr. Dryland. And {{no one can}} be more {{convinced}} than I of my unworthiness. But I'm afraid I must refuse." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Your</b> <b>proposal</b> reaches me too late. The poor creature's troubled {{life has}} come to an end. He never rallied from the {{exhausting}} effect of the fever. To the last he was attended by his mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg yours--so we are. Well, my dear Sir, I must {{be allowed}} a day or two--say two days--to {{ascertain}} what my daughter's feelings are, and to consider <b>your</b> <b>proposals,</b> which have taken me very much by surprise, as you may in fact see. But I assure you I am most flattered, most honoured, most anxious--".|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{came to you}} here," [...] she said, [...] "and {{told you}} that I was {{dismissed}} from Bearmain's. I heard <b>your</b> <b>proposals</b> and agreed to them. You sent for a nurse and you gave me chloroform here. The very last thing in my mind is that you walked to the window, and looked at your watch just before I went off." ...|$|R
6000|$|GEOFFREY [The {{proposal}} staggers him. But {{the next}} moment it inspires him with mingled anger and amusement.] My dear, good people, have you stopped for one moment to consider what the result of <b>your</b> <b>proposal</b> would be? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I acquiesce in <b>your</b> <b>proposal,</b> Doctor Hartley," [...] {{said the}} General, reluctantly {{receiving}} back {{a part of}} the contents of the pocketbook, [...] "it is because I hope to serve you with my interest, even better than with my purse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas!" [...] he said. [...] "Instinct {{tells me}} that that person {{will turn out to}} be of the other sex. If only you knew, my young friend, what the morals of this {{neighborhood}} are, you would understand how fatal <b>your</b> <b>proposal</b> is." ...|$|E
5000|$|How will <b>your</b> tax <b>proposals</b> {{affect me}} as a middle-class, 34-year-old single person with no dependents? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 2d. As to <b>your</b> <b>proposals</b> that a poll {{shall be}} opened in every precinct, {{and that the}} whole shall {{take place on the}} same day, I do not {{personally}} object. They seem to me to be not unfair; and I forbear to join in proposing them only because I choose to leave the decision in each county to the Whigs of the county, to be made as their own judgment and convenience may dictate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] Hebblethwaite replied. [...] "I am {{not telling}} you that. You've managed the whole thing very cleverly, and you know very well, Wyatt, that I am on your side. I was on your side in {{pressing}} the whole of <b>your</b> <b>proposals</b> upon the Cabinet, although honestly I think they were far larger than necessary. However, we took a fair vote, and we compromised. You had no more right {{to do what you}} have done--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As it was <b>your</b> <b>proposal,</b> Terence," [...] {{the major}} said, [...] "you shall have the honour of firing one; Ryan, you take another; Lieutenant Marks and Mr. Haines, {{you take the}} other two, and then England and Ireland will be equally represented." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pray, pray release me, Mr Pecksniff. I cannot {{listen to}} <b>your</b> <b>proposal.</b> I cannot receive it. There are many {{to whom it}} may be acceptable, {{but it is not}} so to me. As an act of {{kindness}} and an act of pity, leave me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Wordsworth and I have duly weighed <b>your</b> <b>proposal,</b> {{and this}} is an answer. He would not object to the {{publishing}} of [...] "Peter Bell" [...] or the [...] "Salisbury Plain", singly; but to the publishing of his poems in two volumes, he is decisively repugnant and oppugnant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Still, {{in spite}} of the temptations of youth, wealth, and birth which <b>your</b> <b>proposals</b> held out to her, she {{accepted}} them at first (I made her confess it herself) with a secret terror and misgiving, produced by the remembrance of me. These sensations, however, she soon quelled, or fancied she quelled; and these, it was now my last, best chance to revive. I had a whole year for the work before me; and I felt certain of success.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would be}} a fool if you did. Probably, after all, you'll think better of <b>your</b> uncles' <b>proposal</b> {{and go into the}} Church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The idea {{certainly}} pleases me," [...] Mr. Renshaw said; [...] "but, of course, I shall want time {{to think}} over <b>your</b> startling <b>proposal,</b> Helen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} a thankless creature, indeed," [...] she said, [...] "if I {{accepted}} <b>your</b> <b>proposal.</b> Do you think I am ungrateful enough to involve you in a personal quarrel with John Zant? No! If I find myself forced to leave the house, I will go away alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of that," [...] {{returned}} Karlsefin with a smile, [...] "but I like not <b>your</b> <b>proposal.</b> What good would it do that either you or Biarne should lead so small a party if ye were assaulted by a hundred or more savages, as might well be the case?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, be {{it as you}} will," [...] said Santerre. [...] "It is all {{a matter}} of taste; only remember, that before I accede to <b>your</b> <b>proposal,</b> I must consult with my colleagues in the next room, and that when once I have spoken to them it will be too late for me to go back." ...|$|E
5000|$|QUESTION: What {{are your}} {{immediate}} demands to prevent war? What are <b>your</b> long-range <b>proposals</b> for transforming the war :economy into a commonwealth dedicated to peace? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. The {{children}} {{are just going}} down to supper, and Miss Delano will rest. You can make <b>your</b> bold <b>proposal</b> now, if you dare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions {{whatever}} to {{that kind}} of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in <b>your</b> <b>proposals,</b> but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart." ...|$|R
