25|$|Many routes at Arapiles have lower-offs, so {{they can}} be {{approached}} from above or via an easier route. There is a strong tradition dating to the '80s of bringing the route down to <b>your</b> <b>level,</b> and it is now commonplace to rap in and pre-place gear. There are many routes with a mixture of fixed and natural gear for which this approach is suitable.|$|E
500|$|The show's writers {{reject the}} idea that The Daily Show has {{become a source of}} news for young people. Stewart argues that Americans are living in an [...] "age of {{information}} osmosis" [...] in which it is close to impossible to gain one's news from any single source, and says that his show succeeds comedically because the viewers already have some knowledge about current events. [...] "Our show would not be valuable to people who didn't understand the news because it wouldn't make sense," [...] he argues. [...] "We make assumptions about <b>your</b> <b>level</b> of knowledge that... if we were your only source of news, you would just watch our show and think, 'I don't know what's happening.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Many of the game's new battle {{features}} were adapted from , including the auto-battle feature that allows players to set moves and actions in advance. [...] While in combat, a player {{may choose to}} attack an enemy, move about the battlefield, use magic or items, stand their ground and defend, or flee the battle entirely. [...] Silver Star Story Complete retains the original version's movement feature, which requires characters to be within a certain distance of an enemy {{before it can be}} attacked. [...] Battles are won when all enemies are defeated, yielding experience points that allow characters to gain levels, making them stronger as well as allowing access to better abilities. [...] By gaining levels, as well as finding or purchasing increasingly more powerful weapons and armor, characters can battle increasingly more powerful enemies as the game progresses. [...] Bosses will have their abilities scaled to <b>your</b> <b>level</b> with no limit.|$|E
500|$|Mega Man X {{received}} {{criticism from}} some publications as well. Ed Semrad, Danyon Carpenter, and Al Manuel of the EGM review panel all {{noted that the}} game may have too low a difficulty level; Semrad disliked the introductory stage and felt that the game was too short as well. Super Play editor Zy Nicholson lowered his review score of the game because he found the levels were neither large nor challenging. [...] "A few elementary tricks like repeating easy sections to recoup energy and weapon power will see you through the harder bits," [...] Nicholson explained. [...] "Within the level you'll also find restart points, extra lives, and no harsh time limit {{to put pressure on}} your performance. Couple this with a password system that records <b>your</b> <b>level</b> completion, status and weapon accumulation and you'll see we're not looking at a lasting challenge for the experienced player." [...] Nintendo Power criticized how little the game had changed stating that [...] "the theme remains the same as the Game Boy and NES Mega Man titles." ...|$|E

Fame points (FP) {{can be used to}} upgrade <b>your</b> fame <b>level.</b> There are 28 fame levels, starting at Local Newcomer and ending at International Superstar. Once you have enough FP, you can be interviewed by newspaper, radio, and TV. TV takes more fame points; however, TV helps upgrade <b>your</b> fame <b>level</b> much more quickly. Newspaper takes the least amount of fame points, but {{it takes a long time}} to upgrade <b>your</b> fame <b>level.</b> Radio is somewhere in between the two.|$|R
