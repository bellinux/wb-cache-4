Assistant producer Jeff Gullet said that, in the game's recreation of a Return of the Jedi scene where Luke Skywalker [...] "jumps off the plank ... and somersaults onto the skiff", Skywalker [...] "performs an all-out acrobatic routine {{with all sorts of}} jumps from the plank. It's hilarious".

500|$|A real-life {{journalist}} named Reid, who Gray {{interviewed for}} his book, states that [...] "Girly Edition" [...] mirrors well how some journalists actually work. She said the episode shows [...] "the ludicrous nature of, you know, {{what we do}} in a lot of things. The kids news with Bart and Lisa: I mean, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> do really stupid stories about the news, and 'news you can use,' and 'how to get rid of your sheets when you wet them.' I mean, people really do stories like that." [...] Steven Keslowitz writes in his book The World According to the Simpsons that the episode showcases the fact that [...] "the viewing of attractive newscasters and the use of persuasive tones of voice often do {{have an impact on the}} minds of many intelligent members of American society." ...|$|E
500|$|Christie {{commented that}} [...] "people didn't do scenes {{like that in}} those days", and that she found the scenes {{difficult}} to film: [...] "There were no available examples, no role models ... I just went blank and Nic [...] shouted instructions." [...] The scene caused problems with censors {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. [...] The American censor advised Nicolas Roeg explicitly, saying, [...] "We cannot see humping. We cannot see the rise and fall between thighs." [...] The scene's much celebrated fragmented style, in which scenes of the couple having sexual intercourse are intercut with scenes of the couple post-coitally getting dressed to go out to dinner, partly came about through Roeg's attempt to accommodate the concerns of the censors: [...] "They scrutinised it and found absolutely nothing they could object to. If someone goes up, you cut and the next time <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> they're in a different position, you obviously fill in the gaps for yourself. But, technically speaking, there was no 'humping' in that scene." [...] In the end, Roeg only cut nine frames from the sequence, and the film was awarded an R rating in the United States. In Britain, the British Board of Film Classification judged the uncut version to be [...] "tasteful and integral to the plot", and a scene in which Donald Sutherland's character can be clearly seen performing oral sex on Christie's character was permitted, but it was still given an X rating—an adults only certificate.|$|E

[...] Eun-Young Jung in the book The Korean Wave opined that the group's concepts fall into two main categories—"innocent, cutesy, happy" [...] (early singles [...] "Gee", [...] "Genie", [...] "Oh!") and [...] "more mature, yet not overly sexy, feminine" [...] (later singles [...] "Run Devil Run" [...] and [...] "Hoot"). A writer for the Korean Culture and Information Service deemed the group's image as [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "girly" [...] "goddesses {{that are hard to}} approach." [...] John Seabrook from The New Yorker described Girls' Generation as [...] "a group of preppy-looking young women in skinny trousers.

2500|$|The authors {{argue that}} a major factor for Israel's {{economic}} growth {{can be found in}} the culture of the Israel Defense Forces, in which service is mandatory for most young Israelis. The authors believe that IDF service provides potential entrepreneurs with the opportunities to develop a wide array of skills and contacts. They also believe that IDF service provides experience exerting responsibility in a relatively un-hierarchical environment where creativity and intelligence are highly valued. IDF soldiers [...] "have minimal guidance from the top, and are expected to improvise, even if this means breaking some rules.

Jimmy Pitaro, president of Disney Interactive Studios stated [...] "we wanted to take everything that worked so well and make it epic." [...] Each character was picked based on how they would fit in the game, as said by TQ Jefferson, [...] "what you're going to see as we roll out and reveal more characters, is that they're going to be more characters that you've known forever and they make sense," [...] Jefferson said. [...] "And the other characters, you may not know them as well, but once <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in-game, you're going to understand why we made the choices that we made.

[...] As the crowds of [...] "down and outs" [...] continued to come to Pisgah Home, the movement drew the enmity of neighbors.

[...] In 1912, two of the [...] "inmates" [...] from Pisgah Home were arrested for the attempted robbery of a safe at a nearby business. [...] In 1913, Halstead [...] "Billy" [...] Stiles, claiming to be a reformed gunslinger who was part of the James-Younger Gang when it attempted the Northfield, Minnesota bank robbery, moved into the Pisgah Home. [...] Stiles' story was published in the Pisgah publication (with a reported circulation of 100,000), in which he wrote: [...] "My soul was black with many a crime, but he Lord took me and washed me as white as wool. [...] I was not reformed, but transformed." [...] Later still, a large crowd assembled when boxing champion and accused murderer Kid McCoy (the man for whom the expression the [...] "real McCoy" [...] was coined) came to Pisgah Home [...] "under heavy guard" [...] to visit his mother, a resident. [...] Other problems included elderly inmates wandering off in a [...] "dazed condition" [...] from the home.

From every direction <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> coming—in wheel-chairs, on crutches, stumbling in blindness, tottering with age, bent with burdens, painted with sin, stamped with greed ..."

2500|$|On 24 August 2008, Georgian {{president}} Mikheil Saakashvili had {{a lengthy}} televised speech. He remembered that after 2004 Adjara crisis he phoned President Putin and thanked him. [...] "I remember that conversation very well; {{in response to}} my polite remarks, he said roughly: ‘Now remember, in Adjara we did not intervene, but you won’t have any gifts from us in South Ossetia or Abkhazia.’ That’s {{what he said to}} me."

[...] Saakashvili then slammed the EU’s reaction to Russia’s admission of violating Georgian airspace in July 2008. [...] "This admission by Russia was a clear sign that they were testing western reaction," [...] he stated. Saakashvili said that his first meeting with Medvedev in June 2008 in St. Petersburg was good; while at the next meeting with Medvedev in Astana in July 2008, the Russian president’s stance was changed and [...] "it was clear that they [...] were preparing for something bad." [...] Saakashvili said that Georgia had expected a Russian attack from Abkhazia, rather than from South Ossetia, so major forces of the Georgian army were deployed in the Georgia's west. He said that as the situation deteriorated on 7 August, [...] "we moved one brigade [...] closer to South Ossetia, and later another [...] as well." [...] "But our major forces were still deployed in the west; there was a brigade at Senaki [...] and we did not call back our brigade from Iraq, because I was deeply convinced up to the last minute that Russia would not engage in such a large-scale provocation," [...] he said. [...] "Although we were under fire from 120mm mortar launchers, I announced a unilateral ceasefire; at that time we already had one dead soldier in the village of Avnevi and four others were wounded; [...] Kezerashvili was begging me to let him open artillery fire, because, he was telling me, otherwise he was unable to bring [...] from [...] But my response was that we could not open fire whatever happened," [...] he said. Saakashvili also said that the Russian army had moved into South Ossetia before the war had even started. [...] "When we ask our western partners: didn't <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> coming, they respond that their satellites were directed mainly on Iraq and that they could not fly over , but it was impossible {{to see what was happening}} on the ground because it was cloudy. So it was a serious failure of international intelligence services; they would not have hidden this information from us, if they had known it; but they also did not know it," [...] Saakashvili said.|$|E
