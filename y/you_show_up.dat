500|$|Megan Fox was {{originally}} {{attached to the}} film, and Patrick Dempsey's role as Dylan Gould {{was to be the}} employer of Fox's character, Mikaela Banes. According to various published sources, Fox's absence from the film was due to Bay ultimately choosing not to renew her role in light of her comparing him and his work ethics to Adolf Hitler, although representatives for the actress said that it was her decision to leave the film franchise. Bay later claimed that Fox was fired by executive producer Steven Spielberg, a claim which Spielberg denied. [...] "I wasn't hurt", Bay stated, [...] "because I know that's just Megan. Megan loves to get a response. And she does it in kind of the wrong way. I'm sorry, Megan. I'm sorry I made you work twelve hours. I'm sorry that I'm making <b>you</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> on time. Movies are not always warm and fuzzy." ...|$|E

5000|$|Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic {{wrote about}} the song [...] "When she shifts the gears of pain inward, she lays herself bare with unflinching honesty and vulnerability". Andrew Paschal from PopMatters said that the song [...] "attempts to marry the {{competing}} impulses of Banks's sonic personas". Idolator's Stephen Sears wrote [...] "The astonishing 'Mind Games' distills the pure essence of Banks, weaving subtle wit into her conversational lyrics: claiming I'm a handful when <b>you</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> all empty handed. This song belongs on a loop, her misery leading to catharsis as her voice, increasingly pained, wails you see me now? over and over." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Donnie Walsh, {{more than}} 120 musicians have been {{associated}} with Downchild since its 1969 founding. [...] The band has never lost its focus on blues music. While certain band members have left to pursue what was perceived to be a more lucrative rock music career, Donnie Walsh has a different perspective: [...] "Just around when I started here were all these guys in blues bands and of course they were impatient and they wanted to make some more money so they became rock bands. I played the blues then and I play the blues now. That's what I love. ... It's a living thing, it's living music. By living and breathing it goes on and {{what that means is that}} instead of being the same kind of music somebody else wrote years ago, it lives and evolves. Blues is serious stuff, it's a heavy kind of music in your soul. <b>You</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> with the blues I play, you lighten up. That's what it's all about. It's like medicine." ...|$|E
5000|$|Those {{were the}} worst two phone calls I've ever had to make in 20 years as a producer. 'Dann,' I said, 'Look, you were the bedrock of the cast, you never complained, <b>you</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> on time every day of work, you have never been {{a pain in the}} ass, and thank you. You're fired.' — Dick Wolf, about Florek's firing Florek was {{ultimately}} terminated from the series after the third season upon orders from Don Ohlmeyer, NBC's West Coast president, to add more female cast members to the show. Wolf objected to the decision, but agreed to it in the face of possible cancellation if he did not. He was one of two actors dismissed from the series along with Richard Brooks, who played Paul Robinette. Wolf described notifying Florek and Brooks about the decisions as [...] "literally the two worst phone calls I ever had to make in a business context". Florek said he did not approve of the [...] "hushed and hidden" [...] way his firing was handled.|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{were divided}} {{between those who}} felt this made it highly {{entertaining}} and those who felt this made the film exceptionally poor in quality and panned it for its lack of redeeming features. In both cases though, critics conceded that it stood a chance of becoming a classic of its kind, if for nothing else than for a level of awfulness that mandated watching. April Macintyre of Monsters and critics gave it a positive review: [...] "Dinoshark is epic!" [...] Referring to [...] "fun films, laced with implausible plots, brilliant poster art and laughable dialogue that demanded that <b>you</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> ready to suspend disbelief, prepare for a scare and always left the audience entertained", she wrote that some aspects are [...] "hilariously over the top. Think Al Pacino's Cuban accent in Scarface times ten", but concluded that {{in the context of}} its genre, [...] "We wouldn't want it any other way." [...] Genre Online felt likewise, that there were [...] "a few too many stock establishing shots", which were repetitious, but the special effects are [...] "actually pretty good", concluding the film should be approached [...] "with a sense of humor".|$|E
5000|$|Johnson raised {{questions}} about McKinney's controversial confrontation with a U.S. Capitol police officer. During the second debate on August 5, 2006, Johnson pointed to the Capitol Hill incident {{as an example of}} what he has called McKinney's embarrassing leadership in office. Johnson also {{raised questions}} about McKinney missing votes in Congress. He specifically asked about her missing a vote to extend the National Voting Rights Act of 1965: [...] "If the Voting Rights Act is not important enough for <b>you</b> to <b>show</b> <b>up,</b> then what is important enough for <b>you</b> to <b>show</b> up?" ...|$|R
