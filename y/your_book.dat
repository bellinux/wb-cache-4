25|$|Chesterton {{wrote a book}} on {{coaching}} {{for young}} people with Alan Duff, entitled <b>Your</b> <b>Book</b> of Cricket.|$|E
25|$|Alan Robert Duff (12 January 1938 – 28 June 1989) was an English cricketer {{who played}} {{first-class}} cricket matches {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. Most of these were for Oxford University, {{but he also had}} a brief county cricket career for Worcestershire. Duff's profession as a teacher at Malvern College (where he was cricket master) prevented his playing more often; he was also the co-author, with George Chesterton, of a coaching book for young cricketers, <b>Your</b> <b>Book</b> of Cricket.|$|E
25|$|Afrikaans uses a diaeresis to mark vowels {{that are}} {{pronounced}} separately {{and not as}} one would expect where they occur together, for example voel (to feel) as opposed to voël (bird). The circumflex is used in ê, î, ô and û generally to indicate long close-mid, as opposed to open-mid vowels, for example in the words wêreld (world) and môre (morning, tomorrow). The acute accent is used to add emphasis {{in the same way as}} underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example Dit is jóú boek (It is <b>your</b> <b>book).</b> The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example appel (apple) and appèl (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes no difference to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are the in the sayings òf... òf (either... or) and nòg... nòg (neither... nor) to distinguish them from of (or) and nog (again, still).|$|E

500|$|Phoebe-Lou Adams of The Atlantic gave a {{negative}} review and criticized the [...] "enormous, gigantic, monstrous historical novel" [...] for containing a protagonist who [...] "suffers and suffers and suffers while innumerable soap-opera types minuet about in fancy dress. The period is early eighteenth century, {{and the research}} underlying the gallimaufry is thorough {{beyond the call of}} duty." [...] In response to some bad attention her novel received, which she said [...] "hurt like hell," [...] Koen noted the persistence of [...] "in-fighting" [...] within the publishing industry. [...] "Who reviews <b>your</b> <b>book</b> {{has a lot to do}} with the kind of review you get," [...] she said.|$|E
500|$|Botanists responded favourably to {{the book}} {{immediately}} on its publication. Hooker told Darwin that the book showed him to be [...] "out of sight the best Physiological observer & [...] experimenter that Botany ever saw", and was glad to note that two leading traditional botanists had accepted the concept of evolution; [...] "Bentham & Oliver are quite struck up in a heap with <b>your</b> <b>book</b> & [...] delighted beyond expression". Daniel Oliver thought it [...] "very extraordinary", and even Darwin's old beetle-hunting rival Charles Babington, by then professor of botany at the University of Cambridge and inclined to oppose natural selection, called it [...] "exceedingly interesting and valuable... highly satisfactory in all respects. The results are most curious and the skill shown in discovering them equally so." [...] George Bentham praised its value in opening [...] "a new field for observing the wonderful provisions of Nature... a new and unexpected track to guide us in the explanation of phenomena which had before that appeared so irreconcilable with the ordinary prevision and method shown in the organised world." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beagle {{reached the}} Cape of Good Hope on 31 May. In Cape Town Darwin {{received}} a letter dated 29 December from his sister Caroline telling him that his fame was spreading. On 18 November 1835 Sedgwick had read extracts from Darwin's geological notes to the Geological Society of London, and this had been reported in The Athenæum on 21 November. On 25 December their father {{received a letter}} from Henslow which said that Darwin would become one of the premier naturalists of the time, and enclosed some copies of a book of extracts of Darwin's letters on South American geology which had been printed for private distribution. Their father [...] "did not move from his seat till he had read every word of <b>your</b> <b>book</b> & he was very much gratified – he liked so much the simple clear way you gave your information". Darwin was horrified that his careless words were in print, but No hay remedio (it can't be helped). He explored the geology of the area, reaching conclusions about slate formation and the injection of granite seams as liquid which differed from the ideas of Lyell and Sedgwick. The zoologist Andrew Smith showed him formations, and later discussed the large animals living on sparse vegetation, showing that a lack of luxuriant vegetation did not explain the extinction of the giant creatures in South America.|$|E

While on Anderson Cooper 360°, claiming he had not read the BMJ articles yet, he denied their validity and denied that Deer had interviewed the families {{of the children in the}} study. He also urged viewers to read his book, Callous Disregard, which he claimed would explain why he was being targeted, to which Anderson Cooper replied: [...] "But sir, if you're lying, then <b>your</b> <b>book</b> is also a lie.

2500|$|From the beginning, Richard Eberhart {{expressed}} {{his admiration for}} Bartlett's work: [...] "You have a fresh, swift, lyrical impulse." [...] About It Takes Practice Not to Die, he wrote: [...] "I have read these poems with pleasure.... ature, they have a bite to them." [...] Praising the same book, Mark Van Doren wrote: [...] "These poems are clear, swift, and strong; and witty, too, {{in the best sense}} of that word."

I will never recover as completely from B.D.'s book as I have from the stroke. Both were shattering experiences." [...] Her memoir concluded with a letter to her daughter, in which she addressed her several times as [...] "Hyman", and described her actions as [...] "a glaring lack of loyalty and thanks for the very privileged life I feel you have been given". She concluded with a reference to the title of Hyman's book, [...] "If it refers to money, if my memory serves me right, I've been your keeper all these many years. I am continuing to do so, as my name has made <b>your</b> <b>book</b> about me a success." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Cilician Catastrophe {{received}} wide acclaim and {{is considered}} an important study of the events in Adana. The Catholicos of Cilicia Sahak II praised Terzian by stating that he [...] "has created an indelible impression upon everyone as a serious and trustworthy chronicler. It is a laborious, inquisitive, vivid picture of the Great Calamity, brought to white light from under the ruins and ashes by a native son of Cilicia, which will remain an everlasting stain upon the glorified civilization and unquenchable humanism of the twentieth century." [...] Archbishop Yeghishe Tourian {{wrote in a letter}} to Terzian, [...] "I have read your Giligio Aghedu [...] with great pain in my heart. It is not a red thread that runs through the white pages of <b>your</b> <b>book,</b> but a wide, black band that stands out defiantly against the bloody pages." [...] Malachia Ormanian, the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, described the narrative as [...] "the most complete and perfect work" [...] on the events in Adana.|$|E
2500|$|Negotiations for the writer's return {{came to an}} end {{after the}} {{publication}} of his Memoirs (Воспоминания, 1950), full of scathing criticism of Soviet cultural life. Apparently aware of his own negativism, Bunin wrote: [...] "I was born too late. If I had been born earlier, my literary memoirs would have been different. I wouldn't have been a witness to 1905, the First World War, then 1917 and what followed: Lenin, Stalin, Hitler... How can I not be jealous of our forefather Noah. He lived through only one flood in his lifetime". Reportedly, the infamous Zhdanov decree {{was one of the reasons}} for Bunin's change of mind. On 15 September 1947, Bunin wrote to Mark Aldanov: [...] "I have a letter here from Teleshov, written on September 7; 'what a pity (he writes) that you've missed all of this: how <b>your</b> <b>book</b> was set up, how everybody was waiting for you here, in the place where you could have been... rich, feasted, and held in such high honour!' Having read this I spent an hour hair-tearing. Then I suddenly became calm. It just came to me all of a sudden all those other things Zhdanov and Fadeev might have given me instead of feasts, riches and laurels..." ...|$|E
