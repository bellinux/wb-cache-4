The general {{secretary}} and the sports director of the Norwegian Athletics Association were unaware of the case, as was the Norwegian Anti-Doping Agency (Antidoping Norge). It was later discovered that the case had been sent to the Gambian Athletics Association.

500|$|At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Peirsol won two gold medals. [...] In {{his first}} event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol {{surprised}} many after {{he failed to}} make the final, which he attributed to a miscalculation of his own position in the semi-finals. [...] Peirsol said, [...] "I thought I was going faster. [...] I am very disappointed. I completely misjudged my race. I have to go on, pick myself up and focus on my next events." [...] But Peirsol's world record in the 100-meter backstroke would stay in place after the final. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won the gold in a time of 1:51.92, breaking his own world record of 1:53.08 by more than a second. Peirsol then competed in the 50-meter backstroke but did not advance past the heats. In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Eric Shanteau, Michael Phelps, and David Walters to win gold in a world record time of 3:27.28, lowering the old mark of 3:29.34 set a <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> Beijing. While leading off the relay, Peirsol broke the championship record in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 52.19, bettering the previous mark of 52.26 set by Junya Koga.|$|E

2500|$|Fans began honoring Earnhardt {{by holding}} three fingers aloft {{on the third}} lap of every race, a black screen of No. 3 in the {{beginning}} of NASCAR Thunder 2002 before the EA Sports logo, and the television coverage of NASCAR on Fox and NASCAR on NBC went silent for each third lap from Rockingham to the following year's race there in honor of Earnhardt. On-track incidents brought out the caution flag on the third lap. Three weeks after Earnhardt's death, Harvick, driving a car that had been prepared for Earnhardt, scored his first career Cup win at Atlanta. On the final lap of the 2001 Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500, he beat Jeff Gordon by [...]006 seconds (the margin being 0.004 of a second closer than Earnhardt had won over Bobby Labonte at the same race a <b>year</b> <b>ago)</b> <b>in</b> an identical photo finish, and the images of Earnhardt's longtime gas man Danny [...] "Chocolate" [...] Myers crying after the victory, Harvick's tire-smoking burnout on the frontstretch with three fingers held aloft outside the driver's window; and the Fox television call by Mike Joy, Larry McReynolds, and Darrell Waltrip concluding with [...] "Just like a year ago , but he [...] is gonna get him though...Gordon got loose... it's Harvick! Harvick by inches!" [...] are memorable to many NASCAR fans. The win was also considered cathartic for a sport whose epicenter had been ripped away. Harvick would win another race at the inaugural event at Chicagoland en route to a ninth-place finish in the final points, and won Rookie of the Year honors along with the 2001 NASCAR Busch Series Championship.|$|E

It was dated from Paris and dreadfully ill-spelled. It contained a most passionate appeal for pecuniary assistance.

I never heard she found means to return." ...|$|E
60|$|The air of {{the night}} was very still, but dim with a {{peculiar}} mist, which changed the moonlight into a luminous haze.

I felt, not happy, far otherwise, but strong with reinforced strength.|$|E

Afterwards, still recalling his youth, he began to talk of Cyprus, and so time went on until the dark was falling.|$|E
