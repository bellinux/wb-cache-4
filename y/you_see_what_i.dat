2500|$|Fighting {{through a}} handful of goons {{on their way to}} {{apartment}} #726, Rama pleads with the tenant for help; despite his sick wife's protest, Gofar reluctantly hides the officers in his apartment. Five machete-wielding thugs arrive and ransack the man's home. The leader, noticing a refurbished wall, begins stabbing it but fail to find them. After tending to Bowo's wounds, Rama leaves him with the couple to search for Jaka's group. Crossing paths with the machete gang he runs to the eighth floor but is cornered. He defeats the group, including their leader, who he uses to smash through a window and cushion a three story plummet onto a fire escape below. Exhausted, he makes his way to the sixth floor before being grabbed by Andi, who had just murdered two of Tama's men in the elevator. Andi is revealed to be his estranged brother, who Rama signed up for the mission to search for at the urging of their father. Rama refuses to leave the building without his comrades, and Andi refuses to abandon his auspicious criminal life, [...] "Just because <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do as wrong doesn't mean I can't be good at it."

2500|$|In {{their earlier}} appeals, {{the defense was}} limited to the trial record. The Governor's Committee, however, was not a {{judicial}} proceeding, so Judge Thayer's comments outside the courtroom could be used to demonstrate his bias. Once Thayer told reporters that [...] "No long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!" [...] According to the affidavits of eyewitnesses, Thayer also lectured members of his clubs, calling Sacco and Vanzetti [...] "Bolsheviki!" [...] and saying he would [...] "get them good and proper". During the Dedham trial's first week, Thayer said to reporters: [...] "Did you ever see a case in which so many leaflets and circulars have been spread...saying people couldn't get a fair trial in Massachusetts? You wait till I give my charge to the jury, I'll show them!" [...] In 1924, Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer at Dartmouth, his alma mater, and said: [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did with those anarchistic bastards the other day. I guess that will hold them for a while.... Let them go to the Supreme Court now and see what they can get out of them." [...] The Committee knew that, following the verdict, Boston Globe reporter Frank Sibley, who had covered the trial, wrote a protest to the Massachusetts attorney general condemning Thayer's blatant bias. Thayer's behavior both inside the courtroom and outside of it had become a public issue, with the New York World attacking Thayer as [...] "an agitated little man looking for publicity and utterly impervious to the ethical standards one has the right to expect of a man presiding in a capital case." ...|$|E
