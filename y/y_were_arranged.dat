The species were confirmed {{with the help}} of available floristic l iterature and comparison of some of Herbarium specimens in (KUH.) Herbarium Centre For Taxonomy, University of Kashmir and I I IM (RRL.) Janki Emal Herbarium Jammu. All the famil <b>ies</b> <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> according to Bentham and Hooker’s system of classification and all the genera and species under each family col lected from the area have <b>been</b> <b>arranged</b> in alphabetical order. The specimens were collected in the polythene bags and the species were identified {{with the help of}} the available taxonomic l iterature and Herbaria consultation. As many as 31 5 species representing 209 genera belonging to 75 famil ies collected and identified from the Campus Amar Singh College, Srinagar. A total of 1 71 genera representing 265 species identified are dicotyledons and 50 species of 38 genera are monocotyledons. The ten dominant famil ies in terms of number of species are Asteraceae, Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Lamiaceae, Ranuncula-ceae, Cyperaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Apiaceae. The most dominant family of the study is Asteraceae representing 41 species representing 30 genera.

The focus here is then on pattern filtering: Given a large set Y of possible patterns or explanations, narrow down the true one Y to a small (random) subset (Y) over cap subset of Y of "detected" patterns to be subjected to further, more intense, processing. To this end, we consider a family of hypothesis tests for <b>Y</b> <b>is</b> an element of A versus the nonspecific alternatives <b>Y</b> <b>is</b> an element of A(c). Each test has null type I error and the candidate sets A subset of <b>Y</b> <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> in a hierarchy of nested partitions. These tests are then characterized by scope (vertical bar A vertical bar), power (or type II error) and algorithmic cost. We consider sequential testing strategies in which decisions are made iteratively, based on past outcomes, about which test to perform next and when to stop testing. The set (<b>Y)</b> over cap <b>is</b> then taken to be the set of patterns that have not been ruled out by the tests performed. The total cost of a strategy is the sum of the "testing cost" and the "postprocessing cost" (proportional to vertical bar(Y) over cap vertical bar) and the corresponding optimization problem is analyzed. As might be expected, under mild assumptions good designs for sequential testing strategies exhibit a steady progression from broad scope coupled with low power to high power coupled with dedication to specific explanations. In the assumptions ensuring this property a key role is played by the ratio cost/power. These ideas are illustrated in the context of detecting rectangles amidst clutter...|$|R

When Lindo turns fifteen (Irene Ng), her mother sends her to Mrs. Huang, so Lindo marries Huang's son, Tyan Hu (William Gong), a pre-pubescent boy who has no {{interest}} in her. During four years of childless and loveless marriage, she is frequently abused by her frustrated mother-in-law, who believes Lindo's childlessness is her own fault. Lindo eavesdrops on the servant girl telling her lover that she is pregnant and he willfully abandons her. Lindo realizes her chance to leave the marriage without dishonoring herself, her family and her in-laws. Later, Lindo purportedly ruins her clothes and then claims that she had a nightmare in which Tyan Hu's ancestors threatened to punish her, Tyan Hu and the matchmaker. Then Lindo claims that the ancestors impregnated the servant girl with Tyan Hu's child and her own marriage to him is considered offensive to them. Mrs. Huang does not believe Lindo until Mrs. Huang quickly discovers the servant's pregnancy through inspection. Finally, Lindo claims that the matchmaker intentionally and wrongly paired Lindo and Tyan Hu for more money. Furious, Mrs. Huang orders the matchmaker out of her family's life, allowing the servant girl to have her marriage. Lindo is able to escape the house and moves to Shanghai.|$|R

40|$|Exotic ontologies {{are all the}} rage. Distant from {{common sense}} and of-ten science as well, views like mereological essentialism, nihilism, and four-dimensionalism appeal to our desire to avoid arbitrariness, anthropocentrism, and metaphysical conundrums. 1 Such views are {{defensible}} {{only if they are}} materially adequate, only if they can “reconstruct ” the world of common sense and science. (No disrespect to the heroic metaphysicians of antiquity, but this world is not just an illusion.) In the world of common sense and science, bicycles survive changes in their parts, billiard balls strike one another, and nothing travels faster than light. The mereological essentialist denies the rst, but offers this replacement: “there exist successions of numerically distinct, but appropriately related, bicycles with different parts ” (Chisholm, 1976, chapter 3). The nihilist denies the second, but offers this replacement: “there exist X s and Y s such that the X s <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> billiard-ball-wise, the <b>Y</b> s <b>are</b> also <b>arranged</b> billiard-ball-wise, and the X s strike the Y s”. 2 The four-dimensionalist denies the third, but offers this replacement: “no sequences of matter-stages that are related by genidentity travel faster than light”. 3 There is room for disagreement over what exactly “reconstruction ” amounts to, but at a minimum: when a metaphysical theory reconstructs ordinary sentencesφ 1 [...] . as replacement sentencesψ 1 [...] ., ordinary and scientic evidence must not refute the view that, strictly speaking, it is ψ 1 [...] . rather than φ 1 [...] . that are true.
