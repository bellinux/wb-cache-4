500|$|Section 4 {{creates the}} defence of public good, which applies both to prosecutions for {{publication}} of obscene materials {{and to the}} forfeiture proceedings described in Section 3. This allows for a valid defence if the defendant can show that {{the publication of the}} materials was justifiable as for the [...] "public good", which is defined as [...] "in the interests of science, literature, art or learning, or of other objects of general concern". Experts and their testimony are admissible for determining the value of such publications. This section was initially treated very strictly by trial judges, but this attitude was reversed after the 1976 trial of the book Inside Linda Lovelace, where the jury found the publishers not guilty despite the judge saying that [...] "if this isn't obscene, members of the jury, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> that nothing is obscene". Three years later the Williams Committee recommended that restrictions on written pornography be lifted, and these restrictions have been largely abandoned.|$|E
500|$|After {{the guitar}} riffs, Michele sings about {{becoming}} a future superstar, [...] "Yeah, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> that I'm a zero/ But hey, everyone you wanna be/ Probably started off like me". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] is [...] "a sunny pop track that finds Lea Michele and Cory Monteith railing against conformity and celebrating their individuality in their verses". Other cast member lyrics include the lyric [...] "You may think I'm a freak show", responded to by Naya Rivera with the spoken [...] "I don't care". The song features self-empowerment lyrics which revolve around revenge fantasies, such as in Monteith's lines - [...] "I could be a superstar / I'll see you when you wash my car". According to Melinda Newman of HitFix the song is about [...] "being a loser now, but turning in to a winner now who never, ever looks back". Aly Semigran of MTV News said the lyrics of the [...] "peppy pop ditty" [...] keep [...] "in tune with the themes of the show".|$|E
500|$|The defence's {{witnesses}} {{included some}} of those who had cared for Elizabeth Parsons and who presumably still believed that the ghost was real. [...] Other witnesses included the carpenter responsible for removing the wainscotting from Parsons' apartment and Catherine Friend, who to escape the knocking noises had left the property. [...] One witness's testimony caused the court to burst into laughter, at which she replied [...] "I assure you gentlemen, it is no laughing matter, whatever <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> of it." [...] Thomas Broughton was also called, as was a priest surnamed Ross, one of those who had questioned the ghost. [...] Judge Murray asked him [...] "Whether he thought he had puzzled the Ghost, or the Ghost had puzzled him?" [...] John Moore was offered support by several esteemed gentlemen and presented Murray with a letter from Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury, who sought to intercede on his behalf. [...] Murray placed the letter in his pocket, unopened, and told the court [...] "it was impossible it could relate to the cause in question." [...] Richard James and Richard Parsons also received support from various witnesses, some of whom although acknowledging Parsons' drink problem, told the court they could not believe he was guilty.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive reviews. Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} song a positive review, {{calling it a}} [...] "club banger". Thomas Gonlianpoulous of Spin commended Swizz Beatz' [...] "bombastic production", Wayne's [...] "energetic yet nonsensical rap", and Brown's [...] "joyful, brisk vocals." [...] Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song, serving as lead single, says [...] "Brown's promise {{for the future is}} to be an altogether more interesting kind of RB& artist." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly referred to the song as a [...] "swaggering" [...] lead single. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times referred to the song as a type that he has made his specialty, and called it an [...] "electric, brassy collaboration." [...] Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy called the song [...] "a brutal, tuneless hunk of industrial R - as musically ugly as something like 'With You' was pretty", he said [...] "for that matter, this track rocks", commenting [...] "Whatever <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> of him, you can't deny that Chris Brown lacks balls." [...] Jude Rogers of BBC Music said the song was catchy, but was one of the album's tracks that were a [...] "pale imitation of Justin Timberlake album tracks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Setre, {{writing for}} Japanator, said [...] "Nasuicaa [...] {{is an amazing}} manga. And no matter what <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> of Miyazaki this story deserves to be read. It has great {{characters}} (some of which could star in their own series), {{a great sense of}} adventure and scale, and an awesome story." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cognitive}} {{effects of}} anxiety may include thoughts about suspected dangers, such as fear of dying. [...] "You may... {{fear that the}} chest pains are a deadly heart attack or that the shooting pains in your head {{are the result of}} a tumor or an aneurysm. You feel an intense fear when you think of dying, or <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> of it more often than normal, or can't get it out of your mind." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There is {{no harm in}} my {{answering}} you," [...] said Amelius. [...] "The dream {{really had}} something to do with her trusting me. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> not <b>think</b> quite so unfavourably of her conduct now you know that." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "As bad as I {{have been}} represented, or {{as bad as}} <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> me, I assure you that I feel support in my afflictions from {{entertaining}} a proper sense of religion. [...] As all men are subject to wrong, I cannot but say that the principle is likewise inherent in me. [...] I acknowledge myself guilty in regard of many of my slaves, but I call God to witness to my innocence in respect {{to the murder of}} Prosper. [...] I am sensible that the country thirsts for my blood, and I am ready to sacrifice it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth [...] is a 2012 book by the {{academic}} and author Bart Ehrman, a leading scholar of the New Testament and writer of over twenty-five books (including three college textbooks) in that field of study. In the book, written to counter {{the idea that there}} was never such a person as Jesus Christ at all, Ehrman sets out to demonstrate the historical evidence for Jesus' existence, and he aims to state why all experts in the area agree that [...] "whatever else <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> about Jesus, he certainly did exist." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Houston Heights, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} planned communities in Texas, is located [...] northwest of Downtown Houston. A National Geographic article says [...] "stroll the area's broad, tree-canopied esplanades and side streets dotted with homes dating from the early 1900s and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> you've landed in a small town." [...] John Nova Lomax said that the Heights, which he describes as [...] "Houston's own mini-Austin," [...] had many [...] "low-key" [...] restaurants and beer gardens. The Houston Heights Association describes the Heights as being bounded by Interstate 10 on the south, North Shepherd Drive on the west, Interstate 610 on the north and both North Main and Studewood Streets on the east.|$|E

2500|$|John O'Hara {{wrote in}} the New York Times; [...] "The most {{important}} author living today, the outstanding author {{since the death of}} Shakespeare, has brought out a new novel. The title of the novel is Across the River and Into the Trees. The author, of course, is Ernest Hemingway, the most important, the outstanding author out of the millions of writers who have lived since 1616." [...] Tennessee Williams, in The New York Times, wrote: [...] "I could not go to Venice, now, without hearing the haunted cadences of Hemingway's new novel. It is the saddest novel in the world about the saddest city, and when I say I think it is the best and most honest work that Hemingway has done, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> me crazy. It will probably be a popular book. The critics may treat it pretty roughly. But its hauntingly tired cadences are the direct speech of a man's heart who is speaking that directly for the first time, and that makes it, for me, the finest thing Hemingway has done." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{public was}} outraged on hearing the verdict. [...] The {{following}} {{ran in the}} Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shinbun, a paper that publicly protested the event in print. [...] "No matter how ignorant <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> the Japanese are, to claim that they could stare {{into the face of}} danger and fail to recognize the gravity of the situation is absurd. [...] The idea that these people were too stupid to know how to save themselves or even get help from others is a grave fallacy." [...] Donations poured in {{from all over the country}} to support the families of the victims who lost their lives. [...] Entire newspapers covered nothing but stories about the incident for days on end, supported by mournful editorials and articles calling for the removal of the officials in question. [...] Even well-known legal scholars openly accused Captain Drake. [...] Fringe politicians across the land held open meetings in which they publicly condemned Britain's violence and record of violating human rights while they rallied for the return of political power to the Japanese people.|$|E
