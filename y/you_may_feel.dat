However, what was appalling was {{that not only did}} the District not inform parents and students of this fact … hile <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> that you can say that this access will not be abused, I feel that this is not enough to ensure the integrity of students, and that even if it was no one would have any way of knowing (especially end-users). [...] I feel it would be best that students and parents are informed of this before they receive their computers.... I could see not informing parents and students of this fact causing a huge uproar.|$|E

6000|$|... "I hope <b>you</b> <b>may</b> never <b>feel</b> one, gal; the tie is {{altogether}} in the feelin's, {{in these}} matters, and therefore {{is to be}} felt and not seen. You can {{understand what it is}} to give a promise, I dare to say, good little Hetty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall see, sir. Anyhow, I am {{glad you}} have said that, because now, {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel,</b> you will keep your impatience to yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{join me in}} love to Mother and Jennie as well as yourself. I {{will be glad to}} {{hear from}} you as often as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> like writing.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{is eight}} bells striking--that means eight o'clock, and breakfast. You had better lay in {{as good a}} store as you can. We shall be outside the Needles, if the wind holds, by dinnertime; and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> not <b>feel</b> so ready for it, then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll do, Strang. For {{a winter}} or two <b>you</b> <b>may</b> expect to <b>feel</b> {{the cold and}} damp in the old wounds. But that will pass, and perhaps <b>you</b> <b>may</b> escape it altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't!... Perhaps, after a while, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> come to <b>feel</b> differently--I didn't mean to startle you," [...] {{she heard}} him reply gently. This humility, in him, was unbearable.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, {{after your}} kind {{attention}} to me, I cannot do less than relieve any curiosity that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel.</b> You {{must know that}} my father was Stanislaus Stanniford, the banker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it's sympathy, instinct, or {{something}} like that. Anyhow, I do know, and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> better when you have told me. It's {{now and then a}} relief to talk about one's troubles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh, nonsense, lad!" [...] the Doctor said. [...] "Knowing what I know of you, I have {{no doubt}} that, though <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> nervous at first, you will get over it in time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was an ungracious way {{of doing}} it," [...] O'Sullivan said, [...] "but, in your circumstances, I should have taken the money had it come from the old one himself. It is, perhaps, as well {{that it should have}} been done in such a manner that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> well <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> owe no great {{gratitude}} towards such a man." ...|$|R

When {{you have}} written a letter that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>may</b> {{possibly}} irritate your friend, however necessary <b>you</b> <b>may</b> have felt it to so express yourself, put it aside till the next day.

60|$|And, {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> {{respecting the}} beauty or wisdom of these sayings, be assured {{of one thing}} above all, that they are sincere; and of another, less often observed, that they are joyful.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only meant}} to say, that any discontent <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> as to her money, or want of money, you must refer to my uncle, {{and not to}} the family at the Small House." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there are}} others," [...] her friend went on, [...] "that stare {{us in the}} face and that--under {{whatever}} difficulty <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> you labour--may now be enough for us. Your father has been extraordinary." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{reason of}} which is, {{that if you}} are a nice person, they are not nice enough for you; and if a vulgar person, not vulgar enough.

6000|$|... "My own dear boy," [...] said she, [...] "I {{will not}} say I have nothing to forgive, for that I know {{is not what you}} want; but well do you know how freely forgiven and {{forgotten}} is all that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> ever <b>feel</b> to have been against my wish.

6000|$|GILBEY. [sitting {{down and}} grumblingly {{adjusting}} his spectacles] This {{is what he}} says. [...] "My dear Mr Gilbey: The news about Bobby had to follow me across the Atlantic: it did not reach me until to-day. I am afraid he is incorrigible. My brother, as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> imagine, <b>feels</b> that this last escapade has gone beyond the bounds; and I think, myself, that Bobby ought {{to be made to}} feel that such scrapes involve a certain degree of reprobation." [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>may</b> imagine"! And we know no more about it than the babe unborn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least--leave it open: {{it shall}} be as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel,</b> and you needn't even send me word. I only will mention that to-day, of all days, I shall {{otherwise}} sit there alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come, Mr. Somers," [...] replied Fanny, [...] "you {{forget the}} person you are talking to; {{it is not at}} all {{necessary}} for you to compliment me; nobody ever does--so <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> relieved of that trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You pelt us with enigmas, sir," [...] he said. [...] "You answer our {{questions}} only by propounding fresh conundrums. One thing, at least, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> disposed to tell us. What {{is your own}} relationship to Isobel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} will; I know you will. Oh! doctor, <b>may</b> <b>you</b> never <b>feel</b> as I do now! <b>May</b> <b>you</b> on your death-bed have no dread as I have, {{as to the}} fate of those you will leave behind you!" ...|$|R
40|$|This {{year the}} UK’s biggest poetry award, the TS Eliot prize, {{has gone to}} David Harsent for his 11 th collection, Fire Songs.

60|$|JENNIFER. Clever brutes? Do you know, doctor, {{that some}} of the dearest and most {{faithful}} friends I ever had were only brutes! You would have vivisected them. The dearest and greatest of all my friends had a sort of beauty and affectionateness that only animals have. I hope <b>you</b> <b>may</b> never <b>feel</b> what I felt when I had to put him into the hands of men who defend the torture of animals because they are only brutes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} {{you did not}} read this deed until you have signed it, Mr. Brander. I know it is a most unbusiness-like {{thing for you to}} do, but I think <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> sure you can trust me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense; I don't want {{to touch}} you. See--I'll stand {{on this side of}} the wire-netting, and you can keep on the other; so <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> quite safe. Now, look here; you screw up your lips too harshly. There 'tis--so." ...|$|E
60|$|Pray to that Holy Spirit to {{convince}} you of sin day by day, whensoever you do the least wrong thing. Pray to Him to keep your consciences tender and quick, that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> instantly, and lament deeply, every wrong thing you do.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Here see a soul that's all despair, a man All hell, {{a spirit}} all wounds. Who can A wounded spirit bear?

O! in each part What flames appear? His {{thoughts}} all stings; words, swords; Brimstone his breath; His eyes, flames; wishes, curses; life, a death, A thousand deaths live in him, he not dead-- A breathing corpse in living scalding lead.'--Ed.|$|R
6000|$|... "But isn't my {{question}} absolutely a confession of ignorance and a renunciation of thought? I put myself from this moment forth with you," [...] Mitchy declared, [...] "on the footing of knowing nothing whatever and of receiving literally from your hands all information and all life. Let my continued attitude of dependence, my dear Nanda, show it. Any hesitation <b>you</b> <b>may</b> yet <b>feel,</b> <b>you</b> imply, proceeds from {{a sense of}} duties in London not to be lightly renounced? Oh," [...] he thoughtfully said, [...] "I do at least know you HAVE them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} you're frost-bitten already," [...] replied Pat, [...] "and I {{hope that this}} will be a lesson to the whole bunch of <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>may</b> not <b>feel</b> him, but old Jack Frost is right on the job just the same, and it don't do up here to needlessly expose yourself.
