500|$|The Seducer is very {{reminiscent}} of Goethe's Faust Part 1, Scene VII (A Street). Faust says to Mephistopheles, [...] "Listen, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> that girl for me!" [...] Mephistopheles says she's an [...] "innocent" [...] girl, but Faust says she's [...] "older than 14". Mephistopheles says he's [...] "speaking like some Don Juan". Faust then calls the devil a Master Moraliser.|$|E
500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob." [...] His motto comes from Plutarch, [...] "The deceived is wiser than one not deceived." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{a statute}} of 13 January 1816, he {{shortened}} {{the terms of}} mayors and deputy-mayors by two years; Vaublanc explained this measure to a prefect thus: [...] "By accelerating the turn-over of mayors and deputy-mayors, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> those {{people out of the}} way who, without a formal recall, would continue in a station to which they appear ill-suited." ...|$|E

2500|$|Churchill {{told the}} Irish Ambassador to London in 1946, [...] "I {{said a few}} words in {{parliament}} the other day about your country because I still hope for a united Ireland. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> those fellows in the north in, though; you can't do it by force. There is not, and never was, any bitterness in my heart towards your country." [...] He later said [...] "You know I have had many invitations to visit Ulster but I have refused them all. I don't {{want to go there}} at all, I would much rather go to southern Ireland. Maybe I'll buy another horse with an entry in the Irish Derby." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reed said that, of his roles, he {{probably}} loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, [...] "t's such {{fun to do}} ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people." [...] He also commented, [...] "Ko-Ko is almost me. There's a lot of me in the character. It lets me bring out my sense of humour. ... the character parts ... <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> your own personality through." [...] On the other hand, he said, [...] "Something takes over from me when I go on. I become something different. I'm basically shy, and I go and hide behind my characters." [...] Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. [...] "Jack Point is me in another age – just a strolling player. I really believe I could die of a broken heart". Reed said that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like to see if you can make 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on". Of the [...] "younger" [...] roles he played even in his later years with the company, Reed said, [...] "I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young." [...] He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala [...] "last nights" [...] of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of [...] "Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty." ...|$|E

In other words, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> a ride or a walk this morning, in the fresh air." ...|$|E
