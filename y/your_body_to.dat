500|$|The clerk {{then read}} the sentence, Hodgson records, [...] "in a most solemn and {{affecting}} manner, which bathed {{many of the}} auditors in tears". First, he damned the crime, [...] "as odious and abominable {{in the eyes of}} God as it is hateful and abhorrent to the feelings of man". He reminded the prisoner of the short time, [...] "a very short time", that remained for him to seek for mercy in another world, and then pronounced the sentence of death itself: [...] "You shall be hanged by the neck until you be dead, <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> be dissected and anatomized". The entire trial had lasted less than eight hours.|$|E
500|$|Bagwell {{made his}} first public {{appearance}} at Minute Maid Park {{since the end of}} his career on June 28, 2007. Former teammate and long-time friend Biggio had just logged his 3,000th career hit in the seventh inning against the Colorado Rockies. Bagwell, who was in the dugout, emerged to congratulate him. The Astros fans, who had momentarily quieted after cheering Biggio for his achievement, erupted into cheers again the moment Biggio dragged Bagwell onto the playing field and to the first base line. [...] "The thing with Baggy is that he and I worked so hard here for this city and for this organization", Biggio remarked. [...] "We made so many sacrifices as far as playing the game and giving <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> a city, a team." [...] Together, they bowed to the crowd as Bagwell raised Biggio's arm, and returned to the dugout. Biggio was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} Fever chiefly focuses on themes {{of love and}} enjoyment. Thompson {{described}} the album to be [...] "all about dancing, fucking, {{and having a good}} time". In the song [...] "Love at First Sight", Minogue describes how {{she fell in love with}} her partner at [...] "first sight" [...] and how it led to good things happening for her. [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] was termed a [...] "mystery" [...] as the singer never mentions who her object of desire in the song is. Lynskey Dorian from The Guardian suggested that Minogue refers to either [...] "a partner, an evasive one-night stand or someone who doesn't know she exists" [...] as her obsession. The production of [...] "Give It to Me" [...] contrasts with its lyrics: Minogue urges her partner to [...] "slow down," [...] but the beat [...] "goes in the opposite direction and tells <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> push it a little more on the dance floor." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Fragile" [...] are simple and aim directly at the [...] " [...] heart". [...] "Come into My World" [...] is a [...] "plea for love" [...] as Minogue invites her partner into her life. On the other hand, [...] "Dancefloor" [...] focuses on issues like dealing with an end of a relationship, with Minogue celebrating a break-up by [...] "lose it in the music".|$|E

2500|$|In {{her first}} {{performance}} in Edinburgh in 1973, Abramović explored elements of ritual and gesture. Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the Russian game, in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she {{would pick up}} a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body – {{the pain and the}} sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramović began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. [...] "Once you enter into the performance state you can push <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> do things you absolutely could never normally do." ...|$|E

60|$|For he says, you are {{all members}} of one body; and all the talents, gifts, understanding, power, money, which God has {{bestowed}} on you, He has given you only that you may help your neighbours with them. Of course there is no harm in longing and praying for great gifts, longing and praying to be very wise, or very eloquent; but only that you may do all the more good. And, after all, says St. Paul, there is something more worth longing for, not merely than money, but more worth longing for than the wisdom of a prophet, or the tongue of an angel; and that is charity. If you have that, {{you will be able}} to do as much good as God requires of you in your station; and if you have not that, you will not do what God requires of you, even though you spoke with the tongues of men and of angels. Even though you had the gift of prophecy, and understood all mysteries, and all knowledge; even though you had all faith, so that you could remove mountains; even though you had all good works, and gave all your goods to feed the poor, and <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> be burned as a martyr for the sake of religion, and had not charity, you would be nothing. Nothing, says St. Paul, but sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal--an empty vessel, which makes the more noise the less there is in it. If you have charity, says St. Paul, {{you will be able to}} do your share of good where God has put you, though you may be poor, and ignorant, and stupid, and weak; but if you have not charity, all the wisdom and learning, righteousness and eloquence in the world, will only give you greater power of doing harm.|$|E
