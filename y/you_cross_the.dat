500|$|Zvi Lederman, {{the other}} {{co-director of the}} dig, {{believes}} that Beth Shemesh was a cultural meeting point {{on the border of}} Israelite, Canaanite, and Philistine areas and calls the stories of Samson [...] "border sagas", noting that Samson could cross boundaries to seek out a Philistine wife, but also to fight and kill Philistines: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> border, you have to fight the enemy and you encounter dangerous animals. You meet bad things. These are stories of contact and conflict, of a border that is more cultural than political." [...] According to Haaretz, [...] "excavation directors Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz and Dr. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University say they do not suggest that the human figure on the seal is the biblical Samson. Rather, the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal, show that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal." ...|$|E
500|$|Half of {{the first}} day's footage came out {{overexposed}} and unusable. Before the financiers or studio bosses knew about the problem, Soderbergh was already doing reshoots. The insurers made him agree that any further mishaps resulting in additional filming {{would come out of}} the director's own pocket. Soderbergh shot in various cities in California, Ohio and Texas, on a 54-day schedule and came in $2 million under budget. The director operated the camera himself in an effort to [...] "get as close to the movie as I can," [...] and to eliminate the distance between the actors and himself. Soderbergh drew inspiration from the cinema verite style of Ken Loach's films, studying the framing of scenes, the distance of the camera to the actors, lens length, and the tightness of eyelines depending on the position of a character. Soderbergh remembers, [...] "I noticed that there's a space that's inviolate, that if you get within something, <b>you</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> edge into a more theatrical aesthetic as opposed to a documentary aesthetic". Most of the day was spent shooting {{because a lot of the}} film was shot with available light.|$|E

2500|$|In June of that year, Romania {{joined the}} attack on the Soviet Union, led by Germany in {{coalition}} with Hungary, Finland, the State of Slovakia, the Kingdom of Italy and the Independent State of Croatia. Antonescu had been made aware of the plan by German envoys, and supported it enthusiastically even before Hitler extended Romania an offer to participate. On 18 June 1941, Antonescu gave orders to his generals about [...] "cleansing the ground" [...] of Jews when Romanian forces entered Bessarabia and Bukovina. Right from the start, Antonescu proclaimed the war against the Soviet Union to be a [...] "holy war", a [...] "crusade" [...] in the name of Eastern Orthodox faith and the Romanian race against the forces of [...] "Judo-Bolshevism". The propaganda of the Antonescu regime demonized everything Jewish as Antonescu believed that Communism was invented by the Jews, and all of the Soviet leaders were really Jews. Reflecting Antonescu's anti-Slavic feelings, {{despite the fact that the}} war was billed as a [...] "crusade" [...] in defense of Orthodoxy against [...] "Judeo-Bolshevism", the war was not presented as a struggle to liberate the Orthodox Russians and Ukrainians from Communism; instead rule by [...] "Judeo-Bolshevism" [...] was portrayed as something brought about the innate moral inferiority of the Slavs, who thus needed to be ruled by the Germans and the Romanians. The Romanian force engaged formed a General Antonescu Army Group under the effective command of German general Eugen Ritter von Schobert. Romania's campaign on the Eastern Front began without a formal declaration of war, and was consecrated by Antonescu's statement: [...] "Soldiers, I order <b>you,</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Prut River" [...] (in reference to the Bessarabian border between Romania and post-1940 Soviet territory). A few days after this, a large-scale pogrom was carried out in Iași with Antonescu's agreement; thousands of Jews were killed in the bloody Iași pogrom. Antonescu had followed a generation of younger right-wing Romanian intellectuals led by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu who in the 1920s-30s had rejected the traditional Francophila of the Romanian elites and their adherence to Western notions of universal democratic values and human rights. Antonescu made it clear that his regime rejected the moral principles of the [...] "demo-liberal world" [...] and he saw the war as an ideological struggle between his spiritually pure [...] "national-totalitarian regime" [...] vs. [...] "Jewish morality". Antonescu believed that the liberal humanist-democratic-capitalist values of the West and Communism were both invented by the Jews to destroy Romania. In a lengthy speech just before the war, Antonescu attacked democracy in the most violent terms as it allowed Jews equal rights and thus to undercut the Romanian [...] "national idea". As such, Antonescu stated what was needed was a [...] "new man" [...] who would be [...] "tough", [...] "virile" [...] and willing to fight for an ethnically and religiously [...] "pure" [...] Romania. Despite his quarrel with Sima, much of Antonescu's speech clearly reflected the influence of the ideas of the Iron Guard that Antonescu had absorbed in the 1930s. Antonescu's anti-Semitism and sexism went so far that he tacitly condoned the rape of Jewish women and girls in Bessarabia and northern Bukovinia by his forces under the grounds that he was going take away all of the property that the Jews had [...] "stolen" [...] from the Romanians, and as far he was concerned, Jewish females were just another piece of property. Since the Jewish women were going to exterminated anyway, Antonescu felt there was nothing wrong about letting his soldiers and gendarmes have [...] "some fun" [...] before shooting them.|$|E
