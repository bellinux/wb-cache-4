40|$|Objectives To {{estimate}} health expectancies {{based on}} measures that more fully cover the {{stages in the}} disablement process for the older Thais and examine gender differences in these health expectancies. Methods Health expectancies by genders using Sullivan’s method were computed from the fourth Thai National Health Examination Survey conducted in 2009. A total of 9, 210 participants aged 60 years and older {{were included in the}} analysis. Health measures included chronic diseases; cognitive impairment; depression; disability in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL); and disability in activities of daily living (ADL). Results The average number of years lived with and without morbidity and disability as measured by multiple dimensions of health varied and gender differences were not consistent across measures. At age 60, males could expect to live the most <b>years</b> on average <b>free</b> <b>of</b> depres-sion (18. 6 years) and ADL disability (18. 6 years) and the least <b>years</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> chronic dis-eases (9. 1 years).

40|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} of enzyme {{replacement therapy}} (ERT) compared to standard medical care was evaluated in the Dutch cohort {{of patients with}} Fabry disease. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a life-time state-transition model. Transition probabilities, effectiveness data and costs were derived from retrospective data and prospective follow-up of the Dutch study cohort consisting {{of males and females}} aged 5 - 78 years. Intervention with ERT (either agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta) was compared to the standard medical care. The main outcome measures were years without end organ damage (renal, cardiac en cerebrovascular complications), quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs. Over a 70 year lifetime, an untreated Fabry patient will generate 55. 0 <b>years</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> end-organ damage (53. 5 years in males, 56. 9 years in females) and 48. 6 QALYs (47. 8 in males, 49. 7 in females). Starting ERT in a symptomatic patient increases the number <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> end-organ damage by 1. 5 year (1. 6 in males, 1. 3 in females), while the number of QALYs gained increases by a similar amount (1. 7 in males, 1. 4 in females). The costs of ERT starting in the symptomatic stage are between € 9 - € 10 million (£ 7. 9 - £ 8. 8 million, $ 13. 0 - $ 14. 5 million) during a patient's lifetime. Consequently, the extra costs per additional <b>year</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> end-organ damage and the extra costs per additional QALY range from € 5. 5 - € 7. 5 million (£ 4. 8 - £ 6. 6 million, $ 8. 0 - $ 10. 8 million), undiscounted. In symptomatic patients with Fabry disease, ERT has limited effect on quality of life and progression to end organ damage. The pharmaco-economic evaluation shows that this modest effectiveness drives the costs per QALY and the costs per <b>year</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> end-organ damage to millions of euros. Differentiation of patients who may benefit from ERT should be improved to enhance cost-effectivenes...|$|R
40|$|Between 1998 and 2012, life {{expectancy}} at birth has risen by 4 years {{for boys and}} nearly 3 years for girls. Summary Life expectancy measures how many years on average a person can expect to live, if current death rates do not change. The term 2 ̆ 7 health expectancy 2 ̆ 7 is used to describe, within a person 2 ̆ 7 s {{life expectancy}}, the expected years spent in various health states, such as years with disability. Whether Australians have more <b>years</b> living <b>free</b> <b>of</b> disability as the overall life expectancy is lengthening {{has important implications for}} population health and wellbeing and for Australia 2 ̆ 7 s health and long-term care systems. Australians have more <b>years</b> living <b>free</b> <b>of</b> disability From 1998 to 2012, life expectancy at birth increased for both sexes, and most of this increase corresponded with an increase in <b>years</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> disability and severe or profound core activity limitation (that is, sometimes or always needing personal help with activities of self-care, mobility or communication). The disability-free life expectancy for males increased by 4. 4 years, which was more than the gain in male life expectancy (4 years). The increase in <b>years</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> disability for females was 2. 4 years. Australian boys born in 2012 could expect to live an average of 62. 4 years without disability and another 17. 5 years with some form of disability, including 5. 6 years with severe or profound core activity limitation. Girls born in 2012 could expect to live 64. 5 years without disability and another 19. 8 years with some form of disability, including 7. 8 years with severe or profound core activity limitation. The gains in the number <b>of</b> expected <b>years</b> living <b>free</b> <b>of</b> disability were related to a combination of increasing longevity and decreases in disability prevalence rates. Older Australians have more years without severe or profound core activity limitation From 1998 to 2012, there was a clear trend <b>of</b> increasing <b>years</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> disability and severe or profound core activity limitation. Along with the increase in life expectancy, Australians at age 65 gained on average more years without severe or profound core activity limitation than with it: males gained 2. 3 limitation-free years and 0. 7 years with severe or profound core activity limitation; females gained 2. 0 limitation-free years and 0. 3 years with severe or profound core activity limitation. Males at age 65 in 2012 could expect to live an average 8. 7 years without disability and another 10. 4 years with some form of disability, including 3. 7 years with severe or profound core activity limitation. Females at age 65 could expect to live 9. 5 years without disability and another 12. 5 years with some form of disability, including 5. 8 years with severe or profound core activity limitation. The gender gaps are narrowing in life expectancy and <b>years</b> living <b>free</b> <b>of</b> disability Although women could expect to live longer and live more years both with and without disability than men could, gender gaps in life expectancy and <b>years</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> disability and severe or profound core activity limitation are narrowing across all ages. During 1998 - 2012, the gender gap in <b>years</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> disability at birth was almost halved from 4. 1 years to 2. 1 years. At age 65, the gap was halved from 1. 6 years to 0. 8 years. The gap in years without severe or profound core activity limitation at age 65 narrowed from 1. 2 years to 0. 8 years. The reduced gender gaps in health expectancies were partly associated with gender differences in the decline of disability prevalence rates...|$|R

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We {{estimated}} the cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin {{treatment in the}} primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes {{using data from the}} Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 2, 838 patients, who were aged 40 to 75 years and had type 2 diabetes without a documented history of cardiovascular disease and without elevated LDL-cholesterol, were recruited from 32 centres in the UK and Ireland and randomly allocated to atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 1, 428) or placebo (n = 1, 410). These subjects were followed-up for a median period of 3. 9 years. Direct treatment costs and effectiveness were analysed to provide estimates of cost per endpoint-free year over the trial period for alternative definitions of endpoint, and of cost per life-year gained and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over a patient's lifetime. RESULTS: Over the trial period, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated to be 7, 608 pounds per <b>year</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> any CARDS primary endpoint; the ICER was calculated to be 4, 896 pounds per <b>year</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> any cardiovascular endpoint and 4, 120 pounds per <b>year</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> any study endpoint. Over lifetime, the incremental cost per life-year gained was 5, 107 pounds and the cost per QALY was 6, 471 pounds (costs and benefits both discounted at 3. 5 %). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with atorvastatin is a cost-effective intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes, with the ICER for this intervention falling within the current acceptance threshold (20, 000 pounds per QALY) specified by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) ...|$|R
