5|$|Madagascar's natural {{resources}} include {{a variety of}} unprocessed agricultural and mineral resources. Agriculture (including raffia), fishing and forestry are mainstays of the economy. Madagascar is the world's principal supplier of vanilla, cloves and <b>ylang-ylang.</b> Other key agricultural resources include coffee, lychees and shrimp. Key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi-precious stones, and Madagascar currently provides half of the world's supply of sapphires, which were discovered near Ilakaka in the late 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the late}} 17th century, the various clans {{of the eastern}} coastal region were governed by chieftains who {{typically}} ruled over one or two villages. A zana-malata named Ratsimilaho emerged to unite these clans under his rule in 1710. His reign lasted 50 years and established a sense of common identity and stability throughout the kingdom, but his successors gradually weakened this union, leaving it vulnerable to the growing influence and presence of European and particularly French settlers, slave traders, missionaries and merchants. The fractured Betsimisaraka kingdom was easily colonised in 1817 by Radama I, king of Imerina who ruled from its capital at Antananarivo in the central highlands. The subjugation of the Betsimisaraka in the 19th century left the population relatively impoverished; under colonisation by the French (1896-1960) a focused {{effort was made to}} increase access to education and paid employment working on French plantations. Production of former plantation crops like vanilla, <b>ylang-ylang,</b> coconut oil and coffee remain the principal economic activity of the region beyond subsistence farming and fishing, although mining is also a source of income.|$|E
25|$|English has {{borrowed}} {{some words}} from Tagalog, such as abaca, barong, balisong, boondocks, jeepney, Manila hemp, pancit, <b>ylang-ylang,</b> and yaya, although {{the vast majority}} of these borrowed words are only used in the Philippines as part of the vocabularies of Philippine English.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ylang-ylang's</b> {{essential}} oil makes up 29% of the Comoros' annual export (1998).|$|R
25|$|The Comoros has an {{inadequate}} transportation system, {{a young and}} rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the labour force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labour force, and provides most of the exports. The Comoros is the world's largest producer of <b>ylang-ylang,</b> and a large producer of vanilla.|$|E
25|$|The Comoros {{served as}} a way station for merchants sailing to the Far East and India until {{the opening of the}} Suez Canal {{significantly}} reduced traffic passing through the Mozambique Channel. The native commodities exported by the Comoros were coconuts, cattle and tortoiseshell. French settlers, French-owned companies, and wealthy Arab merchants established a plantation-based economy that used about one-third of the land for export crops. After its annexation, France converted Mayotte into a sugar plantation colony. The other islands were soon transformed as well, and the major crops of <b>ylang-ylang,</b> vanilla, coffee, cocoa beans, and sisal were introduced.|$|E
25|$|Flowers and blossoms: Undoubtedly {{the largest}} and most common source of perfume aromatics. Includes the flowers of several species of rose and jasmine, as well as osmanthus, plumeria, mimosa, tuberose, narcissus, scented geranium, cassie, {{ambrette}} as well as the blossoms of citrus and <b>ylang-ylang</b> trees. Although not traditionally thought of as a flower, the unopened flower buds of the clove are also commonly used. Most orchid flowers are not commercially used to produce essential oils or absolutes, except in the case of vanilla, an orchid, which must be pollinated first and made into seed pods before use in perfumery.|$|E
2500|$|The patent {{medicine}} makers {{moved from}} selling nostrums to selling deodorants and toothpastes, which {{continued to be}} advertised using the same techniques that had proven themselves selling nostrums for tuberculosis and [...] "female complaints." [...] One survival of the herbal exoticism that once characterized the patent medicine industry is the marketing of shampoos, which are often promoted as containing perfumes such as vetiver or <b>ylang-ylang,</b> and foods such as mangoes, bananas, or honey; consumers are urged to put these ingredients in their hair despite lack of any evidence that these ingredients do anything other than make the hair smell like the ingredients.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2006, it was {{announced}} that the characters of Susan, Lynette, Bree, Gabrielle and Edie were to be made into [...] tall fashion dolls, produced by Madame Alexander. In 2007, they were released in a limited edition of 300 pieces each. A fragrance was also launched by Coty Inc. in 2006, titled Forbidden Fruit, and was composed of orange blossom, peach, apple, lily, wisteria, jasmine, <b>ylang-ylang,</b> sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla and cedar. In August 2009, a collection of four fragrances by LR Health & Beauty Systems, each based on and titled after a Desperate Housewives lead character, was presented: Susan's fragrance is composed of orange blossom, cedar, sandalwood and white musk, Lynette's fragrance is composed of cardamom, star jasmine and musk, Bree's fragrance is composed of green apple, white jasmine, raspberry, lily, amber and vanilla, and Gabrielle's fragrance is composed of raspberry, pineapple, rose, patchouli and blackberries.|$|E
2500|$|Inside {{the forests}} off {{the shore of}} Gibney Beach, {{there is also an}} {{abundance}} of plant life. [...] Gibney Beach lies on the eastern coast of the island and is characterized by dry forest vegetation. [...] Cacti such as the Barbed-wire Cactus (Acanthocereus tetragonus), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), Organ Pipe Cactus (Pilosocereus royenii) and Turk's Cap Cactus (Melocactus intortus) are prominent in the area. [...] These cacti grow alongside shrubs, such as Maran (Croton flavens var. rigidula), and thorn bushes like Casha (Acacia tortuosa) and Catch-and-Keep (A. retusa). [...] The thorny nature of these forests make them difficult to navigate. [...] Mangrove forests can also be found off Gibney Beach. Mangrove trees alter the shoreline, changing salinity, tidal inundation and oxygenation of the soil. [...] Red Mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) are the most common and grow in the ocean. [...] They have specialized prop roots that protect shorelines and serve as nurseries for many marine animals. [...] Other mangrove species that {{can be found on the}} coast are the Black Mangrove (Avicennia germinans), White Mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa), and Buttonwood Mangrove (Conocarpus erectus). Other more exotic and beautiful trees can be found in residential areas off Gibney Beach. [...] Gardens often include orchids, heliconia, <b>ylang-ylang</b> trees, and fruit trees such as coconut, star fruit, [...] bananas and mango.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ylang-ylang</b> vine (Artabotrys odoratissimus) and {{climbing}} <b>ylang-ylang</b> (Artabotrys hexapetalus) are woody, evergreen climbing {{plants in the}} same family. Artabotrys odoratissimus is also a source of perfume.|$|E

50|$|Desmos chinensis is a {{flowering}} plant of the custard-apple family, Annonaceae. The yellowish-green flowers {{are similar to}} the <b>Ylang-ylang</b> flowers, therefore this plant is sometimes known as dwarf <b>ylang-ylang.</b> Their smell, however, is much less strong and is only felt in the morning. By midday it has mostly faded away.|$|E
50|$|The chief export {{crops are}} vanilla, cloves, <b>ylang-ylang,</b> and copra. The Comoros, {{including}} Mayotte, {{account for about}} 80% of world production of <b>ylang-ylang</b> essence, which is used in some perfumes. Marketed exports in 2004 included 44 tons of dried vanilla, valued at nearly $18.8 million, or 47% of agricultural exports.|$|E
5000|$|Most oils are {{distilled}} in {{a single}} process. One exception is <b>Ylang-ylang</b> (Cananga odorata), which takes 22 hours to complete distillation. It is fractionally distilled, producing several grades (<b>Ylang-Ylang</b> [...] "extra", I, II, III and [...] "complete," [...] in which the distillation is run {{from start to finish}} with no interruption).|$|E

5000|$|Typical {{chemical}} compositions of {{the various}} grades of <b>ylang-ylang</b> essential oil are reported as: ...|$|E
5000|$|... an amber floral {{fragrance}} {{with notes}} of <b>ylang-ylang,</b> neroli, iris, vetiver, jasmine, rose, musk and vanilla.|$|E
50|$|Cananga odorata var. fruticosa, dwarf <b>ylang-ylang,</b> grows {{as small}} tree or compact shrub with highly scented flowers.|$|E
50|$|Dawn perfume is inspiring {{with its}} fresh, revitalizing and {{energetic}} notes of bergamot, geranium, neroli and <b>ylang-ylang.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{fragrance}} of <b>ylang-ylang</b> is rich and deep with notes of rubber and custard, and bright with hints of jasmine and neroli. The essential oil {{of the flower}} is obtained through steam distillation of the flowers and separated into different grades (extra, 1, 2, or 3) according to when the distillates are obtained. The main aromatic components of <b>ylang-ylang</b> oil are benzyl acetate, linalool, p-cresyl methyl ether, and methyl benzoate, responsible for its characteristic odor.|$|E
50|$|Most oils are {{distilled}} in {{a single}} process. One exception is <b>ylang-ylang</b> (Cananga odorata) which is purifed through a fractional distillation.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{species of}} the family, such as Cananga odorata (<b>ylang-ylang)</b> also have {{aromatic}} oil and are used for perfumes or spices.|$|E
5000|$|Long-term {{prospects}} for the growth and stabilization of the markets for vanilla and <b>ylang-ylang</b> did not appear strong in the early 1990s. Vanilla faced increased competition from synthetic flavorings, and the preferences of perfume users were {{moving away from the}} sweet fragrance provided by <b>ylang-ylang</b> essence. Copra, the dried coconut meat that yields coconut oil, once an important Comoran export, had ceased to be a significant factor in the economy by the late 1980s, when the world's tastes shifted from high-fat coconut oil toward [...] "leaner" [...] substances such as palm oil. Although clove production and revenues also experienced swings, in the early 1990s cloves did not appear to face the same sorts of challenges confronting vanilla and <b>ylang-ylang.</b> Most Comoran vanilla is grown on Njazidja; Nzwani is the source of most ylangylang.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} oil {{is used in}} aromatherapy. It is believed to relieve high blood pressure, normalize sebum secretion for skin problems, and {{is considered to be}} an aphrodisiac. According to Margaret Mead, it was used as such by South Pacific natives such as the Samoan Islanders where she did much of her research. The oil from <b>ylang-ylang</b> is widely used in perfumery for oriental or floral themed perfumes (such as Chanel No. 5). <b>Ylang-ylang</b> blends well with most floral, fruit and wood scents.|$|E
50|$|Marketed as for women, this {{fragrance}} mainly made of bergamot, lemon, spices, carnation, jasmine, <b>ylang-ylang,</b> rose, orange blossom, tonka bean, musk, benzoin, oakmoss, {{vanilla and}} sandalwood.|$|E

50|$|In the Philippines, it is locally {{known as}} tsampaka, sampaka or sampaga. The {{fragrant}} flowers, together with sampaguita, <b>ylang-ylang</b> and camia, are usually strung into garlands and leis used to adorn statues of saints.|$|E
50|$|The {{fragrance}} {{was released}} in 1987. Uninhibited Perfume has top notes of bergamot, orange oil and aldehydic accords. Middle notes of heliotrope, <b>ylang-ylang,</b> geranium, jasmine, rose and tabac. Dry down notes of cedarwood, musk, sandalwood, vanilla and vetiver.|$|E
5000|$|The name <b>ylang-ylang</b> {{is derived}} from the Tagalog term ilang-ilang for the tree that is a reduplicative form of the word ilang, meaning [...] "wilderness", {{alluding}} to the tree's natural habitat. A common mistranslation is [...] "flower of flowers".|$|E
50|$|In Indonesia, <b>ylang-ylang</b> {{flowers are}} {{spread on the}} bed of newlywed couples. In the Philippines, its flowers, {{together}} with the flowers of the sampaguita, are strung into a necklace (lei) and worn by women and used to adorn religious images.|$|E
50|$|The Comoros is the world's {{principal}} {{producer of}} <b>ylang-ylang</b> essence, an essence {{derived from the}} flowers of a tree originally brought from Indonesia that is used in manufacturing perfumes and soaps. <b>Ylang-ylang</b> essence is {{a major component of}} Chanel No. 5, the popular scent for women. The republic is the world's second largest producer of vanilla, after Madagascar. Cloves are also an important cash crop. A total of 237 tons of vanilla was exported in 1991, at a price of about CF19 per kilogram. A total of 2,750 tons of cloves was exported in 1991, at a price of CF397 per kilogram. That year forty-three tons of <b>ylang-ylang</b> essence were exported at a price of about CF23,000 per kilogram. The production of all three commodities fluctuates wildly, mainly in response to changes in global demand and natural disasters such as cyclones. Profits—and therefore, government receipts—likewise skyrocket and plummet, wreaking havoc with government efforts to predict revenues and plan expenditures. Stabex (Stabilization of Export Earnings—see Glossary), a system of the EC, provides aid to the Comoros and other developing countries to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in the prices of export commodities.|$|E
