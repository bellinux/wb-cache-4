Daltrey {{clashed with}} Johns over the {{production}} of his vocals, and Moon's drumming was so poor that Daltrey and Entwistle considered firing him. Moon's playing improved, but on one track, [...] "Music Must Change", he was replaced as he could not play in 6/8 time. In May, the Who filmed another performance at Shepperton Sound Studios for The Kids Are Alright. This performance was strong, and several tracks {{were used in the}} film. It was the last gig Moon performed with the Who.|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker {{summarized}} Hartman's comedic style: [...] "He could momentarily fool audiences {{into thinking}} he was the straight man, but then he'd cock an eyebrow and give his voice an ironic lilt that delivered a punchline like a fast slider—you barely saw it coming until <b>you</b> <b>started</b> laughing." [...] Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor Bill Murray: [...] "He's been a great influence on me – when he did that smarmy thing in Ghostbusters, then {{the same sort of}} thing in Groundhog Day. I tried to imitate it. I couldn't. I wasn't good enough. But I discovered an element of something else, so in a sick kind of way I made myself a career by doing a bad imitation of another comic." ...|$|E

500|$|John Williams began {{composing}} {{the score}} in October 2007; ten days of recording sessions wrapped on March 6, 2008, at Sony Pictures Studios. Williams described composing for the Indiana Jones universe again as [...] "like {{sitting down and}} finishing a letter that <b>you</b> <b>started</b> 25 years ago". He reused Indiana's theme (Raiders March) and also Marion's from Raiders of the Lost Ark, and also composed five new motifs for Mutt, Spalko and the skull. Williams gave Mutt's a swashbuckling feel, and homaged film noir and 1950s B-movies for Spalko and the crystal skull respectively. As an in-joke, Williams incorporated a measure {{and a half of}} Johannes Brahms' [...] "Academic Festival Overture" [...] when Indiana and Mutt crash into the library. The soundtrack features a Continuum, an instrument often used for sound effects instead of music. The Concord Music Group released the soundtrack on May 20, 2008.|$|E
500|$|For Angels fifth season, as with Buffys fourth, Spike {{steps in}} to replace Cordelia {{as a source}} of comedic {{dialogue}} within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where are you now? Where were you when <b>you</b> <b>started</b> and where are you now and {{how do you feel about}} that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} time, {{development}} of the cabriolet version of the 997 led the design and engineering effort at Porsche with the coupé following. Porsche applied the logic that if <b>you</b> <b>started</b> with the more difficult cabriolet challenges (for chassis stiffness) the coupé version would simply be more rigid. Despite additional weight, the cabriolet versions attain nearly the same performance figures as their coupé counterparts. Even the rear tail comes up slightly higher on the cabriolets to compensate for differences in drag over the canvas top vs. the smoother coupé shape. [...] Optional for the 997 Cabriolet models is a hardtop that encapsulated the vehicle {{in place of the}} canvas top. [...] It is interchangeable with that available on the late 996 cabriolet models. [...] The hardtop provides a winter option to cabriolet owners.|$|E

2500|$|Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) {{to manage}} memory. Apple used to require manual memory {{management}} in Objective-C, but introduced ARC in 2011 {{to allow for}} easier memory allocation and deallocation. One problem with ARC {{is the possibility of}} creating a strong reference cycle, where objects reference each other in a way that you can reach the object <b>you</b> <b>started</b> from by following references (e.g. A references B, B references A). This causes them to become leaked into memory as they are never released. [...] Swift provides the keywords weak and unowned to prevent strong reference cycles. Typically a parent-child relationship would use a strong reference while a child-parent would use either weak reference, where parents and children can be unrelated, or unowned where a child always has a parent, but parent may not have a child. Weak references must be optional variables, since they can change and become nil.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the [...] "ripple effect," [...] Rouse {{explains}} that, to {{a certain}} extent, it was dictated {{by a sense of}} narrative logic; [...] "it's really crucial that Carmen treats you differently depending on whether you killed her or not. It doesn't make sense that she'd still be loving toward you if you killed her in cold blood." [...] However, it was also important that the player never feel locked into one morality; they could begin the game with bad morality and finish with good morality; [...] "you can travel down different moral paths, and both the beginning <b>you</b> <b>started</b> with and the choices you make during Ties that Bind will affect your final outcome. So there are really a surprising number of possible stories to be told. I want every player to have their own unique version of Torque's story.
