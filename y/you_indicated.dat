50|$|The {{original}} FOI {{request for}} the audit, which documented questionable spending by trustees including a trip to Israel and billing taxpayers for overnight stays at a downtown Toronto hotel during a conference, created turmoil behind the scenes at the board, the emails show.“I am seriously concerned about {{the integrity of the}} FOI process given the sudden confusion and misinformation being provided … and given evident trustee tampering … the version (of the audit) below is entirely inconsistent with the discussions we have had and deliberately obfuscates what information has been changed in the reports and undermines the credibility on the completeness of the information being provided to requestors,” said an August email sent by Mavroyannis.Michel Drapeau, a lawyer, professor and author of several works on information requests, said “if ever there has been a ‘smoking gun’ in an (FOI) request records, you found it … The exchange of records illustrate better than anything I have seen in the recent past about the increasing level of ‘impotence’ of the FOI process which is victim to the open defiance, self-importance and arrogance of individuals who place their interests ahead of the public interest and their fiduciary duties,” he said.The “very obvious and repeated attempts to obfuscate and frustrate the ‘right to know’ of the public … goes totally against the accepted Canadian-wide concept of the rule of law.”He praised Mavroyannis, saying “she clearly comes across as a true and honest public servant doing her best to uphold the law (and) provide a ‘service’ to the public.”Ottawa University professor Amir Attaran, an expert in FOI requests who suggested asking the privacy commissioner to investigate, said that if tampering is confirmed, any staff involved should be fired.Mavroyannis, in an email to one individual whose name was blacked out, said that “at the Tuesday meeting this week, <b>you</b> <b>indicated</b> that you had made changes to …(the expense audit) based upon discussions” with someone whose name is also blacked out.“Yesterday at the meeting with the director, <b>you</b> <b>indicated</b> that there was yet another version of the trustee report containing changes, and there were many more changes to be made.”Another email adds: “We cannot alter files that are the subject of an FOI. I have repeatedly said that. This constant flip-flopping detracts from the credibility of the integrity of the information being provided, and the independence of the FOI process … this process should not be interfered with …”She {{went on to say that}} “throughout this file, I have seen trustees and staff discuss the information to be provided, and provide opinion for matters for which they are not responsible. There has been clear interference in my ability to carry out the FOI request responsibly.”Drapeau said trustees should not have been told about the FOI expense audit request at all, and that trustees cannot ask to “correct a record.”“This is tampering with a record,” he added. “If you need to correct a record you produce a new version of a record and leave the original safe and intact.”Mavroyannis’ emails refer to at least three versions.While the freedom of information act doesn’t specifically deal with tampering or destruction of records, Drapeau said “it is an offence to obstruct the commissioner during its investigation of a complaint.”The unredacted portions of the emails do not name any staff or trustees who are alleged to have tampered with or interfered with the FOI process.Chair Mari Rutka said trustees did discuss the FOI {{request for the}} audit report, but would not say when or if it was during a private meeting. She said they have been seeking more “clarity” around the FOI process.“I think one of the concerns that trustees had around the information that’s already come out is that the context of it be explained,” she said. “The initial documents that went out to the Star were draft documents that contained errors, and contained items that were flagged” and trustees were concerned their explanations for those items would not be included.Trustee Shelley Laskin said her portion of the expense audit, released to the Star and CTV, mistakenly contained censored information and that she did not ask staff, at any time, to do such censoring.She said she did, however, ask which version of the report would be released, given she’d seen two last April, which was two months before the Star’s FOI request was submitted.“Did I seek clarification of what would be released? Absolutely. Did I question the release of working documents which can be exempt? Absolutely. Were there a series of emails from me to staff to clarify which version of the working papers would be released. Absolutely.”Laskin, who is familiar with the FOI process from her previous job with an Ontario government ministry, said most trustees are not aware of the process and need to be better informed about their obligations under the law.|$|E

40|$|Cue: One of {{the most}} popular methods of {{trapping}} rainwater in fields, particularly on sloping land, is through the use of contour ridges or bunds. These are raised ridges of soil or rock constructed across the slope, which stop the flow of run off, thereby encouraging water to infiltrate into the soil and preventing soil erosion. Another method is to dig a ditch across the slope. As with the contour ridge, the ditch must not go up or down, but must be perfectly level, to prevent the rain water accumulating in one place; for this reason they are called ?level ditches?. Water collects in the ditch and slowly seeps into the ground: this water then moves down the slope through the soil and is available for plants. Many farmers use level ditches to irrigate either fruit trees or fodder shrubs for livestock, which they plant in a line just below the ditch. Martin Sishekanu is the chief agricultural specialist responsible for land husbandry in the Zambian agriculture ministry. He spoke recently to Chris Kakunta about steps to encourage rainwater harvesting in hilly areas {{in the eastern part of}} the country. Chris began by asking him what technologies the Ministry was promoting, particularly to those cultivating fruit trees and fodder shrubs. IN:		?One, if it is a sloping ground?? OUT:		??consider the area of water harvesting. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 54 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Martin Sishekanu, a land husbandry specialist with the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Sishekanu	One, if it is a sloping ground, we would like to break the slope by having a storm drain constructed by the foot of the hill. This storm drain, once it is constructed it will stop the water which comes and runs which adds also to the erosion of the ground, it stops it, it breaks the energy that erodes the soil and it gently and safely takes this water. Now where we take the water is important. In most cases we use natural depressions, and in some cases we can even divert this water into a water reservoir where we can store the water, which we can use eventually, even during the dry season, for irrigating our fruit trees. And in some cases we use level ditches. Now when the slope is not that great, when we use a level ditch, what we are doing is we would like to intercept the water that would have gotten lost and temporarily store this water, to allow it to filter into the ground. And as the water filters into the ground, it moves slowly down the slope and when we have our tree crops planted below this ditch, the tree crops will be continuously receiving the water that has been allowed to be stored in the ground. Kakunta	That is very interesting Mr Sishekanu. Is it a system that you have been advising small-scale farmers to do here in Eastern Province? Sishekanu	Yes in Eastern Province we have advised some farmers, particularly in the area of the utilisation of level ditches, which you can put and dig along the contour to store some water which eventually will be able to recharge the underground water system and make available some water during the dry season below where the ditch is. And then in some cases, like in the area of Chipangali, actually there is a rock that we have harvested water from. Using that rock catchment, we have put a rim, a small block where we have captured this water. Instead of the water coming from the rock to run and erode fields, we have diverted it into a water tank and from this water tank farmers are tapping the water to be able to apply in their fields. Kakunta	Is this a new technology we are talking about? Because most often, like <b>you</b> <b>indicated,</b> rainwater is actually let go without being tapped the way you have explained? Sishekanu	Well to some extent we may call it new but it is an old system. If you remember, even in the villages when the rain is falling you will find that we put either dishes or buckets by the corners of our houses and we capture water. That is already water harvesting. So the technology is old, but it is the mechanism in which to use and tap this water and utilise it for our own betterment that might be termed as new. Kakunta	Now what are some of the benefits for a small-scale farmer to use this system that you have recommended in terms of raising fruit trees as well as fodder crops for livestock? Sishekanu	The benefit is basically that without water our tree crops will not perform very well and therefore when we tap this water it will enhance the productivity of our trees and shrubs such that at the time when the browsing material in the natural environment is completely dry, there will still be some moisture that will be still available to support the growth of the shrubs from which we can be able to support our livestock. Kakunta	Wonderful. Now what type of physical factors do you need to establish the system for it to actually work out well for the small-scale farmer? Sishekanu	Well basically the level ditches would require that the area has some sandy-related soils where it is not going to over flood; it will be able to absorb the water and allow it to infiltrate. Now in the case of where run off might be higher because of clay soils, particularly when there is also a hill, we will need to capture that water and divert it safely. At the same time, there is also the system where you dig ditches. These ditches will also be capturing water and you plant your fruit trees just by the side of the ditch and in some clay soils that will be quite handy and helpful. Kakunta	So from your own experiences here in Eastern Province, what lessons have you learnt in terms of rainwater harvesting which are practically useful for the small-scale farmers? Sishekanu	The level ditch system has been practically useful for the small-scale farmers because it helps to recharge the underground water reservoir and therefore, even where they have shallow wells, the shallow wells will be facilitated to receive water for a longer period of time than when they are absent. Kakunta	Is there anything that I have left out that you would like to put across in as far as the subject rainwater harvesting is concerned? Sishekanu	Basically I would say that if we harvest the water we will reduce the destruction of our soils and meanwhile we will enhance the productivity of our crops and therefore it will be important that we consider the area of water harvesting. End of track. On sloping land, storm ditches can protect land from erosion, while level ditches increase infiltration of rainwater runoff...|$|E
