30|$|Thus, {{the prime}} rule {{for the road}} when using point-of-care {{ultrasound}}: do not rely on ultrasound alone to “rule out” disease. With respect to likelihood ratios for negative ultrasound results, the post-test probability will probably not be low enough to confidently exclude disease. This will keep you from sending home the intussusception, pyloric stenosis or appendicitis solely based on a “negative” ultrasound. The worst thing that will happen is a confirmatory test or someone {{will tell you that}} the child you admitted did not have “x”, “y” or “z”. If you have an inconclusive or “negative” ultrasound (e.g., you did not see free fluid on a FAST exam, target sign of intussusception, or a big fat > 6  mm appendicitis that hurts the patient on sono-palpation, etc.), take a step back, reassess the clinical picture, and get that confirmatory study or continue to observe your pediatric patient. An unaddressed area of research is the effect of serial ultrasound exams on overall diagnostic accuracy (either by same operator or by a different one) as an advantage of point-of-care ultrasound is that it is easily repeatable with abnormal findings highly reproducible. Most likely, with an abnormal or positive ultrasound result—you have probably clinched the diagnosis with a sufficiently high post-test probability that allows you to move forward with further evaluation if necessary, treatment and then onto <b>your</b> next <b>emergency</b> pediatric patient.|$|R

40|$|Safety is {{a primary}} concern today for people everywhere. No one can foresee danger, and {{reaction}} to any danger is required in a split second. Recently, mobile apps have been developed, {{which can be used}} to connect to <b>your</b> <b>emergency</b> contact. But not everyone has a smartphone. Moreover, {{it is not possible to}} use an app in a split second. Microcontrollers are used in devices everywhere. An ideal panic button should be one which allows the user to react and finish the work at the fastest speed possible, while successfully accomplishing the task. This paper describes a panic button that will ensure safety in minimal time. A simple switch will trigger the device that consists of an Arduino board and GSM Module. The Arduino board sends a signal to the GSM Module with a SIM Card, which will send an emergency message to the contact pre-defined in the system, along with the exact GPS co-ordinates of the position of the user with the panic button.

40|$|In this EMCREG-International newsletter, {{we would}} like to provide for you the {{evidence}} basis, and a “blueprint, ” for implementing point-of care (POC) laboratory testing in <b>your</b> <b>emergency</b> department. In particular, cardiac biomarkers such as myoglobin, CK-MB, troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are integral for clinical decision-making in the emergency setting. Risk stratifi cation for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients can be performed with POC testing. Identifi cation of high-risk ACS patients for disposition to the coronary care unit or the cardiac catheterization laboratory, as well as to provide guideline-based anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy, can be facilitated with POC testing. Typically, time savings of an hour or more can be realized with POC testing compared to sending the test to a central laboratory for analysis. The development of a POC testing program will require collaboration between emergency physicians and cardiologists, laboratorians, and hospital administrators. As the individual POC tests often cost more than the batch run central laboratory assays, determining the cost effectiveness of POC testing requires an understanding of how faster results can decrease time to disposition from the emergency department and speed the delivery of guideline-based therapies to patients with ACS. By decreasing the length of stay of patients with possible ACS in the ED, patient satisfaction and provider satisfaction (physician and nurse) can also be improved. Through this monograph, we hope to provide you with the information you need to bring this new technology to your practice. As always, EMCREG-International hopes to provide you with unbiased, balanced information on this important topic to improve the care of your patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} to reach {{every person in}} a community {{is one of the}} major goals for emergency preparedness and response. The goal of emergency health communication is to rapidly get the right information to the entire population so that they are able to make the right choices for their health and safety. To do this, a community must know what subgroups make up its population, where the people in these groups live and work, and how they best receive information. Although knowing this type of information might seem obvious, many jurisdictions have not yet begun the process to define or locate their at-risk populations. To maintain consistency with the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA), this workbook uses the term "at-risk populations" to describe individuals or groups whose needs are not fully addressed by traditional service providers or who feel they cannot comfortably or safely use the standard resources offered during preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. These groups include people who are physically or mentally disabled (e. g., blind, deaf, hard-of-hearing, have learning disabilities, mental illness or mobility limitations), people with limited English language skills, geographically or culturally isolated people, homeless people, senior citizens, and children. Regardless of terminology, trust plays a critical role in reaching at-risk populations. Reaching people through trusted channels has shown to be much more effective than through mainstream channels. For some people, trusted information comes more readily from within their communities than from external sources. This document describes a process that will help planners to define, locate, and reach at-risk populations in an emergency. Additional tools are included to provide resources for more inclusive communication planning that will offer time-saving assistance for state, local, tribal, and territorial public health and emergency management planners in their efforts to reach at-risk populations in day-to-day communication and during emergency situations. If you follow the process outlined in this document, you will begin to develop a Community Outreach Information Network (COIN) [...] a grassroots network of people and trusted leaders who can help with emergency response planning and delivering information to at-risk populations in emergencies. Building a strong network of individuals who are invested in their community's well-being, who are prepared and willing to help, and who have the ability to respond in an emergency is just the start. You must also include network members in <b>your</b> <b>emergency</b> preparedness planning, test the capacity of your COIN to disseminate information through preparedness exercises, and make changes to your preparedness plans based on the evaluation of those exercises.

40|$|The University of Notre Dame Australia’s nursing {{graduate}} and former Chisholm Catholic student Mariko Hauge, {{has taken up}} the position of an emergency nurse in country Western Australia. Ms Hauge decided to relocate to the coastal town of Dongara {{to be with her}} fiancé. She has always had a keen interest in rural health ever since completing her practicum whilst studying at Notre Dame. “We were given the opportunity to do a country placement at University and I was able to go to Geraldton. It really appealed to me and ever since then I’ve always wanted to work in the country,” she said. On completion of her degree Ms Hague worked at Royal Perth Hospital and applied for a second year program in Emergency. She also worked regular shifts at Geraldton Regional Hospital, whilst still at Royal Perth Hospital. Ms Hauge said, “I chose to work in emergency as I knew that it would be an area of demand in the country. ” When asked of the challenges that faced her in working in a country hospital Ms Hague explained how relying on your own judgement is crucial. “I’m working in a small country hospital at the moment and while there is a doctor on duty during the day and Saturday mornings, if you are working a night or weekend shift you will be on your own”. “In the case of an <b>emergency</b> <b>your</b> clinical and assessment skills must be second-to-none as you need to ascertain the best treatment for your patient and decide whether the services of a doctor, an additional nurse or another hospital are necessary,” she said.

5000|$|A towel, it says, {{is about}} the most massively useful thing an {{interstellar}} hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid {{the gaze of the}} Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you — daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave <b>your</b> towel in <b>emergencies</b> as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have [...] "lost." [...] What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.Hence a phrase that has passed into hitchhiking slang, as in [...] "Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who really knows where his towel is." [...] (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.) Douglas Adams ...|$|R
