She added the abstract message along with the announcement: [...] "Let the cultural baptism begin. If they were not who you were taught they would be, would you still believe?" [...] "Judas" [...] was scheduled to be sent to mainstream airplay on April 19, 2011, and digital retailers on the same day, but after the track was leaked to the internet, its release was brought forward to April 15, 2011. This was done to counteract the pre-release leaks. Before the release, Gaga tweeted about the single, saying: [...] "#PawsUpForJudas! I've learned love is like a brick, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> house or sink a dead body." [...] On April 15, 2011, hours before the song was played on radio she again tweeted: [...] "Even After Three Times He Betrays Me," [...] she wrote, harking back to the song's lyrics about love and betrayal. In the United Kingdom, the song premiered on The Capital FM Network on April 15, 2011, during their program Home Run. Gaga addressed the leak in the 43rd episode of Transmission Gagavision, likening it to a disembodiment, saying, [...] "A slow death! Just put me out of my f---ing misery, just put that sh-- out. They were tearing [...] limb for limb. First it was the arm of the song, then the liver...." ...|$|E

There is ransom and loot past the counting of man on her seaboard alone--plunder that would enrich a nation--and she has neither a navy nor half a dozen first-class ports to guard the whole.

50|$|Cordwood is a {{combination}} of small remnants of firewood and other lumber that usually go to waste. These small blocks of wood can easily be put together to make a structure that, like stone, has great insulation as well as thermal mass. Cordwood provides the rustic look of log cabins without the use of tons of lumber. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>build</b> <b>an</b> entire building with just cordwood or use stones to fill in the walls.|$|R

You're quite safe if you're careful, and stand by the tree. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> fire here," [...] he stepped under the chimney-like opening, [...] "without its being noticed.

Your principles can be thwarted even by yourself--the seed can be deprived of its power to grow--the tree destroyed; and, if principles can thus be destroyed, some accident may one day destroy creation by destroying its principle.

2500|$|The {{market is}} however {{evolving}} in this area. [...] In order to automate these processes, connectors {{are needed to}} fit these systems/solutions together with a data exchange layer to transfer the information. A Process Driven Messaging Service is an option for optimizing your data exchange layer.

Process Driven Messaging Service gives you the logic to build your process by using triggers, jobs and workflows. Some companies uses an API where you build workflow/s and then connect various systems or mobile devices. You build the process, creating workflows in the API where the workflow in the API acts as a data exchange layer.|$|R

In the autumn of 1824 Captain Kritsky, the expedition supervisor, reported on several prospective sites; the best being a place closed off from the sea by the Berdyansk Spit.
