The story {{was picked up by}} media and reported widely. Upon hearing media reports of a link to the game one of the shooting victims at Dawson College contacted Ledonne and told him that [...] "I just suffered multiple gunshot wounds and I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> this game down." [...] Ledonne expressed his reaction to the shooting and renewed media attention towards his game in an interview a week later: ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Gaga slowly {{appearing}} {{from behind a}} building on a deserted street corner. The whole scenario is bathed in red and violet lights, coming from {{the windows of the}} buildings and alleyways as steam billows out from the drains. When the first verse of the song begins, Gaga emerges from the window of an apartment onto the fire escape. A long take follows, of Gaga strutting through the red-lit district singing the line [...] "I got a reason that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> me home tonight", and a shock of black hair falls in her eyes. Gaga does not remove it and the shot spans to her walking backside, gesturing the viewer to follow. The video consists mostly of interchanging shots of Gaga dancing and singing on the street, on the fire escape, and on the steps in front of the apartment building with Clemons. Near the end of the video, after Clemons' saxophone solo, Gaga crouches in front of the building's steps and kisses the sidewalk. The video concludes with a close-up of Gaga's face, before she re-enters through the window into her smokey apartment.|$|E

2500|$|Passionflower is {{reputed to}} have {{sedative}} effects {{and has been}} used in sedative products in Europe, but in 1978, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prohibited its use in over-the-counter sedative preparations because it had not been proven safe and effective. In 2011, the University of Maryland Medical Center [...] reported that passionflower [...] "... can trigger side effects and can interact with other herbs, supplements, or medications.

2500|$|In his 2015 book, Farage {{reflected}} {{that based on}} his experiences, [...] "the NHS is so over-stretched {{that if you can}} afford private health care, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> it, particularly for diagnostics and preventative medicine. In the NHS, the system is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks. The NHS is, however, astonishingly good at critical care. But what testicular cancer taught me is that the NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you". He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1989 Houston Chronicle article Alan Bernstein {{described}} {{political support}} for Jim Westmoreland, an incumbent in an at-large position, in the Houston Heights as [...] "relatively weak." [...] In one precinct 49.4 percent of the voting residents voted for him. Westmoreland drew controversy after reports of a joke that was characterized as [...] "racist" [...] spread. Beverley Clark, the opponent and a Black teacher, defeated Westmoreland in that race. Bernstein said that the significant racial minority groups and the [...] "social tolerance" [...] trait {{may have contributed to}} backlash against Bernstein. In a 1989 Houston Chronicle article, Randy Cypret, the president of the Houston Heights Association, said that the split vote from the Houston Heights may reflect the ethnic division. Cypret added that opposition may have stemmed from Westmoreland's lack of political presence in the Houston Heights and a lack of advocacy for zoning-related issues. Cypret said that he opposed Westmoreland because of [...] "the fact that he considers being on the city council a part-time job. In the fourth largest city in the country, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> your job more seriously." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Gan Ning {{brought his}} {{followers}} to Wu, Zhou Yu and Lü Meng recommended him to serve their lord, Sun Quan. Sun Quan felt that Gan Ning was extraordinary and treated him like an old acquaintance. Gan Ning proposed, [...] "The Han Empire is declining day by day. Cao Cao is becoming increasingly arrogant and he'll eventually usurp the throne. The southern territories in Jing Province are accessible in terms of travelling by land or water. The western domain of the Empire lies there. Based on my observation of Liu Biao, he'll not last long while his sons are of inferior quality and cannot inherit his jurisdiction. My lord, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> control of these lands soon, lest Cao Cao seizes them later. The best plan now is to attack Huang Zu first. Huang Zu is old and muddleheaded. He lacks funding and supplies, cheats those around them, and is only concerned with making personal gains. His subordinates are already unhappy with {{him because of his}} overbearing demands. His warships and military equipment are damaged and have not been repaired; he neglects agriculture; his army is ill-disciplined. If you attack him now, you'll surely win. After defeating him, you can move west further and take control of Chu Pass (楚關) and expand your domain and influence. After that, you can prepare to attack Bashu (巴蜀; covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing)." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Chauvel {{arrived in}} Damascus, {{he told his}} staff [...] "to pitch my camp in a clean orchard {{just out of the}} city, which I thought would suit me better after what I had seen of the place. I then went back to my camp, had lunch, and became {{immersed}} in problems of supply, collection of prisoners, orders for the morrow, etc., sending off first of all an aeroplane message to Lord Allenby, telling him what I had done." [...] He also sent for the British Supply Officer of the Hejaz Forces. [...] "Before discussing supply matters, however, he ... said 'they are out to make as little as possible of the British and make the populace think that it is the Arabs who have driven out the Turk. This is why Lawrence asked you to keep your men out of the city and they have no intention of asking you for any police.' He also said 'They are getting the British Consulate ready for you. If you go there you are not defining yourself as the Conqueror of this country, but rather as a contributory ally. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> possession of Djemal Pasha's house, which is the best one in the place, and which they are reserving for Feisal.' He said there was absolute chaos in the city, the Bazaars were closed and all the better class of people were terrified at the idea of the Hejaz crowd being in charge." [...] As a result, Chauvel decided to march through the city the following day, with [...] "practically every unit being represented; guns, armoured cars, everything, and I also took possession of Djemal's house." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Parade {{column and}} its {{response}} received considerable {{attention in the}} press, including a front page story in the New York Times in which Monty Hall himself was interviewed. [...] Hall understood the problem, giving the reporter a demonstration with car keys and explaining how actual game play on Let's Make a Deal differed from {{the rules of the}} puzzle. In the article, Hall pointed out that because he had control over the way the game progressed, playing on the psychology of the contestant, the theoretical solution did not apply to the show's actual gameplay. He said he was not surprised at the experts' insistence that the probability was 1 out of 2. [...] "That's the same assumption contestants would make on the show after I showed them there was nothing behind one door," [...] he said. [...] "They'd think the odds on their door had now gone up to 1 in 2, so they hated to give up the door no matter how much money I offered. By opening that door we were applying pressure. We called it the Henry James treatment. It was 'The Turn of the Screw.'“ Hall clarified that as a game show host {{he did not have to}} follow the rules of the puzzle in the vos Savant column and did not always have to allow a person the opportunity to switch (e.g., he might open their door immediately if it was a losing door, might offer them money to not switch from a losing door to a winning door, or might only allow them the opportunity to switch if they had a winning door). [...] "If the host is required to open a door all the time and offer you a switch, then <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> the switch," [...] he said. [...] "But if he has the choice whether to allow a switch or not, beware. Caveat emptor. It all depends on his mood.” ...|$|E
