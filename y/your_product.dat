40|$|Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) {{costs the}} electronics industry {{millions of dollars}} each year in damaged components, non-functional circuit boards and scrambled or missing information. ESD can occur in the manufacturing, shipping, receiving, and field handling of integrated circuits or computer boards with no visible signs of damage. A malfunction in these components or boards can occur immediately or the apparatus may perform for weeks, months, or even years before an unpredictable and premature breakdown causes a field failure. 6. 1. 2 Why Should I Care About Electrostatic Discharge? When you incorporate electronic components or boards into <b>your</b> <b>products,</b> ESD damage can have {{a direct impact on}} your company’s reputation and profits. That is because electrostatic damage directly affects the quality and reliability of <b>your</b> <b>products.</b> However, for a small investment in time, manpower, and equipment, you can virtually eliminate ESD-caused problems.

Still, optical components tend to be bulky and expensive, and require complex stabilization and adjustments, especially when interfacing with electronics. Embedding some photonic functionalities into an integrated chip can simplify a system and dramatically decrease its costs. However, the cutting edge optical manufacturing technologies enabling such chip integration were traditionally affordable only by large corporations. Nowadays, generic photonic integration emerges as a new paradigm that provides cost-effective and high-performance miniaturized optical systems {{for a wide range}} of applications and markets. In this white paper we will highlight the advantages of using photonic integrated circuits, and we will give you a brief overview of the new integrated manufacturing models and how can you benefit from them.
