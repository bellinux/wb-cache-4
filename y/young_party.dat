Weaver’s performance {{was better than}} that of any third party candidate since the Civil War, as he won over a million votes—8.5 {{percent of the total}} cast nationwide. In four states, he won a plurality, giving the Populists the electoral votes of Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, and Nevada along with two more votes from North Dakota and Oregon: twenty-two in total. Weaver believed the performance [...] "a surprising success", and thought it portended good results in future elections.

If not stepping down, she would compromise [...] "values and principles" [...] that were essential in order to [...] "live with self as a human being". The announcement followed a private meeting between Wibe, Hagen, Røsjorde and Grønntun. Allegedly, Tor Mikkel Wara had advised her to resign. Ellen Christine Christiansen stepped down from her position in the central board, leaving Grønntun as the only clear libertarian. Grønntun stated that <b>young</b> <b>party</b> members would not tolerate to be [...] "stepped on and hectored with [...] " [...] forever. More generally, the losing faction signalized a desire to continue promoting a liberal political profile, but in a less dramatic way.|$|E

2500|$|Hilton began {{modeling}} as a child, originally at charity events. When she was 19, {{she signed}} with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management. Hilton {{said that she}} [...] "wanted to model", Trump wanted her at his agency, and she was [...] "loving" [...] the work. While modeling, she became a daily feature of entertainment news for her partying; according to Vanity Fair, Cisco Adler (producer of Sweetie Pie, in which Hilton acted) called her [...] "a <b>young</b> <b>party</b> girl who gets sucked into the L.A. party scene and grew up a little too fast". In 2001, Hilton developed {{a reputation as a}} socialite; she was called [...] "New York's leading It Girl", whose fame was beginning to [...] "extend beyond the New York tabloids". Around that time she made a cameo appearance in Zoolander and appeared on several magazine covers, including the UK's Tatler, Italy's Giola and the US' Vanity Fair and FHM. Hilton also appeared in Vincent Gallo's [...] "Honey Bunny" [...] video. In 2002, she played a lead role in the straight-to-video horror film, Nine Lives. According to Beyondhollywood.com, [...] "Hilton's presence in the cast is the film's main marketing point, which is plainly obvious by the fact that she's front and center on the box art and is the only recognizable name in the cast". The website noted that her character was, basically, herself: [...] "Hilton plays—what else?—a spoiled American socialite who shops on three continents in one day. The script is even clever enough to take a few jabs at Hilton's real-life social standing, even mentioning that she's been on the cover of a few sleaze rags in her day". That year Hilton became engaged to fashion model Jason Shaw, but they broke up in early 2003.|$|E

Some, putting on Don Quixote's eyes for the occasion, saw helmets in milk-pails, dungeons in cellars, battle-axes in bill-hooks, and shields in pewter-plates, called the baby in its cradle the sleeping Princess, agreed that the shield must have been reversed by order of the palmer, and that one of the cows was the mischievous knight's cream-coloured donkey; so that laughter happily supplied the place of learned lore.|$|E

As to his colour, where is that nutty brown tone of the flesh? But the designs on the Greek vase are carefully rendered; though I have heard it remarked by a classical scholar that these kind of vases were not in use about Homer's time. Still, the intention is good, though the costumes are not what WE should have called Ancient Roman when the President was a boy--ay, or earlier.|$|E
