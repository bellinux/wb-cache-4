And the f------ off-spinners don't turn.' I think an {{additional}} reason was that he found some difficulty in accepting the conventions of English cricket as it was then. There was a Somerset committee member, who liked and admired him, and would greet him with, 'Morning, McCool'. That committee member was seeking to be courteous. He would have thought it pompous to say 'Mr McCool', and impertinent to say 'Colin'. But it infuriated Colin. He thought it a reflection on his status. He would have preferred something like 'Hi, Col, <b>you</b> <b>old</b> bastard.' The worlds were too far apart." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the opening}} match of the tour, a draw against North Zone, Hassett made 73. In a high-scoring match in hot {{conditions}} against the Prince's XI in Delhi, he struck 187 and 124 not out in Australia's 8/424 declared and 5/304. The team {{was scheduled to}} play East Zone in Calcutta, but the city was gripped in deadly riots as independence activists agitated against British rule. Australia batted first and made only 107, before East Zone replied with 131. Led by Hassett's 125, Australia posted 304 to leave the hosts a target of 281. On the final day, pro-independence rioters broke through the security presence and invaded the pitch {{for the second time}} during the match, while East Zone were batting. East Zone batsman Denis Compton told the rioters to talk to Hassett, saying that the Australian skipper controlled proceedings. Hassett smiled at the leader of the irate demonstrators and asked [...] "You wouldn't happen to have a cigarette, would <b>you,</b> <b>old</b> boy?"

500|$|The {{team was}} {{scheduled}} to play East Zone, but the city was gripped in deadly riots as independence activists agitated against British rule. The match went ahead, but on the first day, thousands of protestors invaded the pitch, interrupting play for an hour. Elsewhere in the city, 23 people were killed. Miller scored only 17 and one, both times dismissed by Chandu Sarwate, and did not bowl. On the final day, Miller's friend Compton, who was playing for East Zone while on deployment with the British Army in India, was nearing a century as his team closed in on victory. The rioters broke through the security presence and invaded the pitch again. The leader of the demonstrators ran up to Compton and said: [...] "Mr Compton, you very good player, but you must stop". In later years, Miller would quote this remark whenever Compton came to the crease in matches featuring both of them.

500|$|In 1923, when Adams was 76, the {{following}} newspaper story appeared in The Salt Lake Tribune, telling of his whereabouts:Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>old</b> fellows, too, thought Yank had passed on, {{but he turned}} up in New York {{the other day and}} is now spending his last days in a Bronx flat. There was a time when Yank Adams was known in every billiard room in America. He was as much at home in Eddie Graney's room at San Francisco as at Tom Foley's in Chicago of Maurice Daly's in New York, and he knew all the billiard players and big and little room keepers from coast to coast. When the history of billiards is written and the names of Willie Hoppe, old and young Jake Schaefer and Welker Cochran are included with others of the great exponents of the indoor sport, there will be a distinct division for one man—the man who did the impossible, who could make the ivories travel the wrong way, or, {{in the language of the}} billiard realm, [...] "make 'em talk all languages." [...] That man is Frank B. Adams, known the world over as [...] "Yank" [...] Adams, at one time and even now the world's only finger billiardist who can make all the apparently impossible shots on the table without the aid of a cue. Adams is 76 years old, and after fifty years of exhibitions all over the [...] world has retired from active work to live in the Bronx and conduct a billiard academy of his own at Burnside and Creston avenues in New York with his business manager for the last ten years, Samuel Polakoff. Yank now lives at 635 West 136th street In New York. When I told Tom Foley, the daddy of all the roommkeepers, that Yank Adams was back in the business he laughed and said: [...] "I thought Yank had cashed in. But he's like all those billiard players. They never die." ...|$|E

2500|$|Paul Hewson left Dragon in late 1984, and {{returned}} to New Zealand, where he died of an accidental drug overdose on 9 January 1985. During 1984 Hewson had shared an apartment in Elizabeth Bay, Sydney, with singer-songwriter Paul Kelly, who had recently arrived from Melbourne, {{and was trying to}} relaunch his career. He and Hewson became close friends. In May 1985, four months after Hewson's death, Kelly released his breakthrough solo album Post, which dealt extensively with themes of addiction, and which he dedicated to Hewson's memory. Terry Chambers and Robert Taylor left some time after. Dragon performed three songs for 13 July 1985 Oz for Africa concert (part of the global Live Aid program) – [...] "Speak No Evil", [...] "Rain" [...] and [...] "Are <b>You</b> <b>Old</b> Enough?"; which was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US. American drummer Doane Perry replaced Chambers, and Taylor was eventually succeeded by local Sydney guitar ace Tommy Emmanuel. This line-up went to America to record the Todd Rundgren-produced Dreams of Ordinary Men album in 1986 and toured Europe with Tina Turner under the name Hunter in 1987. By this time Mansfield was writing with O'Neill; they wrote [...] "Western Girls" [...] for Dreams of Ordinary Men and then three tracks for her 1987 solo album Danced in the Fire.|$|E
