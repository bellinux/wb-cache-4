2500|$|On 28 December 1965, {{the third}} A-12 was lost when [...] "Article 126" [...] crashed 30 seconds after takeoff when {{a series of}} violent yawing and {{pitching}} actions was followed very rapidly with the aircraft becoming uncontrollable. Mele Vojvodich was scheduled to take aircraft number 126 on a performance check flight which included a rendezvous beacon test with a KC-135 tanker and managed to eject safely [...] above the ground. A post-crash investigation revealed that {{the primary cause of}} the accident was a maintenance error in that the flight line technician was negligent in performing his duty when he connected the wiring harnesses for the <b>yaw</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> rate gyroscopes of the stability augmentation system in reverse. It was also found that a contributing cause was a design deficiency which made it possible to physically connect the wiring harnesses in reverse.|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of a fluttering piezoelectric energy harvester was studied in smooth flow and in aspects of replicated Atmospheric Boundary Layer turbulence (12. 7 % intensity, 310 -mm longitudinal integral length scale). The harvester was <b>yawed</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitched,</b> <b>and</b> {{the effects on}} the power output were examined. Key findings were the following: (1) off-axis flow conditions rapidly degraded the mean output power of the harvester; (2) turbulence, for this specific harvester, acted similarly to a dynamic damping mechanism; (3) for on-axis flow, turbulence degraded the power outputs relative to smooth flow and for off-axis flow, the turbulence enhanced the power outputs relative to smooth flow. Future challenges include determination of harvester efficiencies, and analysis of fatigue-induced performance degradation...|$|R

5000|$|The initial {{production}} {{version of}} the Greif, the He 177 A-1, tended to be unstable in the <b>yaw</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> axes during flight tests in August 1942, which would have led to poor bombing accuracy. Shortly after these tests, the third production A-1 example (factory serial number 15153, with Stammkennzeichen of GI + BN) had its fuselage lengthened by 160 cm (63 in) just aft of {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. The modified aircraft, with the longer distance of the [...] "tail moment", showed a marked degree of improvement in <b>yaw</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> axis stability, enough to mandate the construction of the He 177 A-3 and all later models of the He 177 with the lengthened fuselage.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{for measuring the}} dynamic stability derivatives of a model airplane in a wind tunnel. The characteristic features of this system are that single-degree-of-freedom oscillations were used to obtain combinations of rolling, <b>yawing</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitching</b> motions; that the oscillations were excited and controlled by velocity feedback which permitted operation under conditions unfavorable for more conventional types of oscillatory testing; and that data processing was greatly simplified by using analog computer elements in the strain-gage circuitry.

50|$|Although {{a typical}} jet {{aircraft}} has {{most of its}} mass distributed close to its centerline, and the aerodynamics in planes designed to be stable (such that small fluctuations in control tend to return it to attitude equilibrium) provide some stabilization, {{it is important to}} remember that aircraft realistically always fly with a small non-zero random rate of <b>yawing</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitching.</b> Inertia coupling on an aircraft usually manifests itself as a downward pitching; rolling causes the tail mass to be flung upward and thus the nose to tip down. The pitching can in turn cause gyroscopic yawing.|$|R

50|$|On some aircraft, {{horizontal}} and vertical stabilizers are combined {{in a pair of}} surfaces named V-tail. In this arrangement, two stabilizers (fins and rudders) are mounted at 90 - 120° to each other, giving a larger horizontal projected area than vertical one as in the majority of conventional tails. The moving control surfaces are then named ruddervators. The V-tail thus acts both as a <b>yaw</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> stabilizer.|$|E

The aircraft now relies on the rudder alone for turning, lateral stability is provided for by increased wing dihedral.|$|E
