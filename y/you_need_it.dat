The title of the album is a reference to 'Food and Liquor' stores common in Chicago. He explains, [...] "The store is where everything is at...Food to me represents growth and progression. You eat food and you get strength. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> to live. Liquor is not a necessity; it is a want. It destroys you. It breaks you down. I can see why it's prohibited in Islam...I've always felt like liquor represents the bad, the food represents the good, and everyone is made up of a little of both." [...] Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor was officially released on September 19, 2006. The album featured production from Jay-Z, Kanye West, Mike Shinoda, The Neptunes, Prolyfic, among others. The record spawned the singles [...] "Kick, Push", [...] "I Gotcha" [...] and [...] "Daydreamin'" [...] featuring Jill Scott. The critically lauded album was later nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Rap Album. Fiasco won [...] "Best Urban/Alternative Performance" [...] for [...] "Daydreamin'". In the same year, he was voted by GQ magazine as the [...] "Breakout Man of the Year." [...] He also received four BET Hip Hop Award nominations, and it made it to number eight on Billboard 200 and number two on Billboard Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart. That same year he participated in the first Cypher at the BET Hip-Hop Awards.|$|E
500|$|Mother's Milk {{features}} {{an array of}} musical styles in its thirteen tracks. Among the songs that surfaced from the Hully Gully sessions in early 1989, [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] {{became one of the}} most radical shifts in style for the band. The introspective lyrics, which analyze the death of Hillel Slovak and the devastating effect drugs can have on life, were a new approach for Kiedis, who primarily wrote of sexual intercourse and a hedonistic lifestyle. The vocalist did not, however, want the track to be associated with [...] "anti-drug" [...] sentiments, claiming, [...] " [...] is about letting your friends know that you need help and then being willing to accept the help of others when <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> whether it's from drugs, or from a number of other personal problems." [...] According to music journalist Jeff Apter, the song [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was [...] "clearly the most important track the band had ever laid down; it proved that these Peppers were more than knuckleheads with socks hanging off their cocks." [...] Musically, the track integrates the Chili Peppers' typical punk influences, but asserts heavier emphasis on melody and harmonics that lead into more alternative territory. [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was originally recorded to be a duet between Kiedis and Frusciante, but the song was remixed before being released as a single; the new mix accidentally highlighted the guitarist's voice instead of Kiedis'.|$|E

2500|$|Christmas {{clubs are}} savings programs, {{the first of}} which were offered by various banks in the United States during the Great Depression. The concept is that bank {{customers}} deposit a set amount of money each week into a special savings account, and receive the money back {{at the end of the}} year for Christmas shopping. For decades, financial institutions competed for the holiday savings business, offering enticing premiums and advertising items such as tokens. The Dime Saving Bank of Toledo, Ohio, issued a brass token [...] "good for 25 cents in opening a Christmas account" [...] for 1922-1923. There were also numbered tokens issued by the Atlantic Country Trust Co. in Atlantic City, New Jersey, inscribed on the reverse: [...] "Join our Christmas Club and Have Money When <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>It</b> Most." [...] In the February 2006 issue of Forbes magazine, business writer James Surowiecki summarized the accounts' appeal: [...] "The popularity of Christmas club accounts isn't a mystery; if their money was in a regular account, people assumed they'd spend it." ...|$|E
