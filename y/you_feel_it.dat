In 1973 Premier's marketing manager, Eddie Haynes, began consulting with Moon about specific requirements. At one point, Moon asked Premier to make a white kit with gold-plated fittings. When Haynes said that it would be prohibitively expensive, Moon replied: [...] "Dear boy, do exactly as <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> should be, but that's the way I want it." [...] The kit was eventually fitted with copper fittings and later given to a young Zak Starkey.|$|E

[...] In {{an interview with the}} heavy metal magazine Metal Hammer, Davis touted Robinson's behavior, saying: [...] "Ross is a very pure and clean-spirited person, and <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> when you're with him. He's {{the kind of person that}} can draw that out of you. I felt very safe with Ross." [...] The album was released on October 11, 1994 through Immortal and Epic Records. During the recording of Korn, there were four outtakes: [...] "Christmas Song", [...] "Sean Olson", [...] "Layla", and [...] "This Broken Soul". Sean Olson was put on the single release of Shoots and Ladders, and featured on [...]|$|E

He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's {{a lot of good}} things to take from it. ... But when you get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> in front of you and you want to grab it." [...] Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.|$|E

500|$|On New Years Day 2012, a {{low quality}} snippet of [...] "Lovebird" [...] leaked {{under the title}} [...] "Love Birds". After the song leaked, Lewis {{expressed}} her frustration at the song being available for listening to on the Internet, stating: [...] "I'm sad {{that one of my}} songs leaked. As an artist that holds music dear to my heart I would've liked to share it with u [...] when it's ready. I hope that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> like I do and when it's time to be released you'll still support it in the right way. Thank u [...] for the love." [...] That same month, it was announced that the album was expected to be released on 26 March 2012. Record executive Simon Cowell later publicly give his support for Glassheart, saying to Lewis that, although there had been a lengthy wait of two years for new music, the album was [...] "sensational", and that Lewis had [...] "never sounded better." ...|$|E
500|$|Fincher and Zaillian's central {{objective}} was to maintain the novel's setting. To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. [...] "So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, {{but at the same}} time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image." [...] Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, [...] "It's always an element in the background and it was very important that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct." [...] To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, [...] "It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film. It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations, but the metaphysics of them, and how the way people live comes out through design." ...|$|E

She met Lori Barbero at a {{barbecue}} {{not long after}} moving to Minneapolis in the mid-1980s, and convinced her to become a drummer– something that Lori became talented at. The pair joined with bassist Michelle Leon, and Babes in Toyland was formed. Bjelland has said she intentionally sought out bandmates who had no instrumental experience: [...] "Lori didn't {{know how to play}} when I met her. Michelle didn't know how to play. I was self-taught. Hopefully, from being technically inexperienced, you can use your imagination, and play the drums like an instrument instead of just being a beat-keeper. And play the bass like <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> from your gut, instead of saying, 'Here's my scales.'" ...|$|E

Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot {{of the reasons why}} I wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it.</b> I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I {{think a lot of people}} go through that.|$|E
