500|$|In his memoirs, one guard {{recalled}} that {{on one occasion}} another guard forgot himself and told an off-color joke to the grand duchesses during one of these meetings. The offended Tatiana ran from the room, [...] "pale as death." [...] Maria eyed the man and said, [...] "Why are you not disgusted with yourselves when you use such shameful words? Do <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> you can woo a well-born woman with such witticisms and have her be well disposed towards you? Be refined and respectable men {{and then we can}} get along." [...] Ivan Kleschev, a 21-year-old guard, declared that he intended to marry one of the grand duchesses and if her parents said no he would rescue her from the Ipatiev House himself.|$|E
2500|$|When {{you see a}} sundial or a water-clock, you {{see that}} it tells the time by design and not by chance. How then can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> the {{universe}} {{as a whole is}} devoid of purpose and intelligence, when it embraces everything, including these artifacts themselves and their artificers?

2500|$|Hitler {{awarded the}} Knight's Cross to Schmidt on 6 January 1943 – {{on the same}} day that Paulus signalled to General Kurt Zeitzler: [...] "Army {{starving}} and frozen, have no ammunition and cannot move tanks any more" [...] – and made him Generalleutnant on 17 January. On 19 January, Major Thiel [...] was sent by VIII Air Corps to assess the runway at Gumrak and see whether further landings by Luftwaffe supply aircraft would be possible. After he concluded that they would not, telling both Schmidt and Paulus so, Paulus reprimanded him for the original promise that air supply to Sixth Army would be possible, asking him: [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> the soldiers fall upon a horse cadaver, split open its head, and devour the brain raw?" [...] Schmidt addressed Thiel in the same vein: ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{studied for}} a year in Milan with the soprano Adelaide Saraceni, but her most {{important}} teacher was the London-based tenor Eduardo Asquez. She made her debut as Frasquita in Bizet's Carmen in Salzburg with the Landestheatre Opera Company, where she spent a season in 1963 singing roles in Italian, French and German operas. [...] The following year, she returned to England, performing in concerts, including two Promenade Concerts with Sir Malcolm Sargent. She later recalled, [...] "I remember Sir Malcolm Sargent plucking {{me out of the}} Royal College of Music to do some Proms as a student – can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> happening nowadays? – and saying to me 'Your quiet singing will make your fortune'". The music critics commended [...] "a team of soloists led by a newcomer, Miss Valerie Masterson, with particularly pure and radiant soprano tone" [...] in the Serenade to Music.|$|E
2500|$|In 1903, Howard Carter had {{discovered}} a tomb (KV60) in the Valley of the Kings that contained two female mummies, one identified as Hatshepsut's wetnurse, and the other unidentified. In the spring of 2007, the unidentified body was finally removed from the tomb by Dr. Zahi Hawass and brought to Cairo's Egyptian Museum for testing. This mummy was missing a tooth, and the space in the jaw perfectly matched Hatshepsut's existing molar, found in the DB320 [...] "canopic box". Her death has since been attributed to a carcinogenic skin lotion found in possession of the Pharaoh, which led to her having bone cancer. [...] "There is a lot that speaks for this hypothesis," [...] according to Helmut Wiedenfeld of the University of Bonn's pharmaceutical institute. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> the queen had a chronic skin disease and that she found short-term improvement from the salve, she may have exposed herself to a great risk over the years." ...|$|E

But you and I may comfort each other, for we are fellow-sufferers at the hands of this man of honour. My wife was the lady who entertained this gallant in her room that night." ...|$|R
