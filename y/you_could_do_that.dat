2500|$|The band's {{modern history}} began in 1904, Paul Spotts Emrick, a {{freshman}} from Rochester, joined the band. [...] His {{experience as a}} conductor resulted in his election as band president and director the next year. [...] During his senior year at Purdue in 1907, the band became the first to break ranks and form a letter on the field—the famous Block [...] "P". In a 1953 interview with the Lafayette Journal & Courier, Emrick recounted seeing geese fly over a lake in the fall, saying [...] "usually, they'd fly in a 'V', but once in a while, they'd change formation and fly in various figures. I used to wonder if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with men drilling." [...] The [...] "Block P" [...] has been performed during each pre-game performance ever since its inception.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{think that}} possible?" [...] he said, {{standing}} over her, and looking down upon her. [...] "Judging {{from your own}} heart {{do you think that}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> if outward circumstances made it convenient?" ...|$|E
5000|$|What Willow {{says when}} she first enters Buffys {{backyard}} with the gun is similar to, though not exactly what Warren says before he shoots Buffy in [...] "Seeing Red". Willow says, [...] "You think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> just <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to me? That Id let you get away with it?" [...] while Warren says, [...] "You think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> just <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to me? You think Id let you get away with that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was too {{bad that}} you couldn't send some sort of word," [...] came from Belle. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only <b>do</b> <b>that</b> we <b>could</b> stay here until the roads were well broken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{give you}} a fiver, {{and you can go}} away from Saturday to Monday. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> On Monday he's going home till he takes up his {{appointment}} at the North London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord save you, child!" [...] I said, [...] "there's {{nothing that}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> I could not {{and would not}} forgive. Not that you would ever do {{anything}} base, for {{that is the only}} thing that is hard to forgive. Tell me now what troubles you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However, {{all this}} I must leave to you. You showed {{yourself}}, in that Polish business, well {{able to help}} yourself out of a scrape, and if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> among people of whose tongues you were ignorant, {{you ought to be}} able to manage on English soil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do not see}} how <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> Francis, when so many others, {{far better}} {{qualified}} than yourself, {{will be on the}} lookout. Still, as I agree with you that you are not likely to apply your mind diligently to your tasks, and as, indeed, you will shortly be giving them up altogether, I grant your request." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, you dear boy," [...] Nelly, who {{had come}} to the door, exclaimed impetuously, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> but <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> every one would love you. We shall all be killed if that terrible battery goes on. But {{how are you going to}} do it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|ABC No Rio was {{conceived}} of as an [...] "art-making center," [...] a community-oriented alternative to what its founders perceived as an overly hierarchical art world and gallery scene. It was to be [...] "a place where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> things <b>that</b> wouldn’t even cross your mind {{to do in a}} gallery." ...|$|R
6000|$|Our friend {{allowed himself}} time for reflection. [...] "I don't think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> now with any great hope of success. I {{should say that}} the {{predominant}} face in Boston now was some type of Irish face. You know that the civic affairs of Boston {{are now in the}} hands of the Irish. And with reason, if the Irish are in the majority." ...|$|E
60|$|MURRAY. That's {{the same}} as {{answering}} no to my question. Then, if you don't love him, why don't you write {{and tell him to}} go to--break it off? (Eileen bows her head, but doesn't reply. Irritated, Murray continues brutally.) Are you afraid it would break his heart? Don't be a fool! The only way <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> would be to deprive him of his meals.|$|E
6000|$|Dane's eyes twinkled. [...] "I didn't want to, and I {{must admit}} that it isn't. Still, {{a good many of}} you quiet men are {{addicted}} to occasionally astonishing our friends, and I can't help a fancy that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> kind of thing as well as most folks, if it pleased you. It fact, there was an artistic finish to the climax that suggested your usual thoroughness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mary Erskine, [...] "there is {{one thing}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> for me, <b>that</b> {{would be a very}} great {{kindness}}, a very great kindness indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You are but {{a little}} bit of a lad,” says my lord good-humouredly; “but, in faith, I believe <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> for <b>that</b> fellow. No, my boy,” he continued, “I’ll have none of your feints and tricks of stabbing: I can use my sword pretty well too, and will fight my own quarrel my own way.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Rather too wild a project, thank you,' said Mr. Kendal, smiling. 'No; {{the only}} thing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> would be--if <b>that</b> boy of mine have not {{completely}} forfeited your kindness--' ...|$|R
6000|$|Nick {{looked at}} him with a moment's fixedness while he {{polished}} the palette; and for that moment he felt the temptation to reply: [...] "There's a way <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> to a considerable extent--I think you guess it--which wouldn't be intrinsically disagreeable." [...] But the impulse passed without expressing itself in speech, and he simply brought out; [...] "You can make this all clear to Biddy when she comes, and she'll make it clear to my mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, if {{you want}} to get away from it, I've got an idea. I'm frightfully hard up just now, I've got to be as {{economical}} as I can; but I've got a sort of little flat now in Kennington and I've got a spare room. If you like you and the baby can come and live there. I pay a woman three and sixpence a week to keep the place clean and to do a little cooking for me. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> and your food wouldn't come to much more than the money I should save on her. It doesn't cost any more to feed two than one, and I don't suppose the baby eats much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} Mr. Carteret's?" [...] The {{question}} made him laugh as her feeble reference {{five minutes before}} to the House of Lords had done. But she pursued, too full of her idea {{to take account of}} such a poor substitute for an answer: [...] "Let me tell you one thing, for I've known Charles Carteret much longer than you and I understand him better. There's nothing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> would do you more good with him than to marry Julia. I know the way he looks at things and I know exactly how that would strike him. It would please him, it would charm him; it would be the thing that would most prove to him that you're in earnest. You need, you know, to do something of that sort," [...] she said as for plain speaking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she {{answered}} slowly; [...] "but you've never come near to me. You can't {{come out of}} yourself, <b>you</b> can't. Baxter <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> better than you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Christina shuddered, and Dame Johanna herself recoiled; but {{presently}} exclaimed, [...] "Nay, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> good man, but wherefore {{not threaten}} him therewith? Stand at his bedside in early dawn, {{and tell him}} that, if he be not off ere daylight with both his cut-throats, the halberdiers will be upon him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are but {{a little}} bit of a lad," [...] says my lord, good-humoredly; [...] "but, in faith, I believe <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> for <b>that</b> fellow. No, my boy," [...] he continued, [...] "I'll have none of your feints and tricks of stabbing: I can use my sword pretty well too, and will fight my own quarrel my own way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{very pretty}} child," [...] said the steward, patting La Biondella on the cheek. [...] "We {{ought to have}} her at the hall. If his {{excellency}} should want a Cupid, or a youthful nymph, or anything small and light in that way, I shall come back and let you know. In the meantime, Nanina, consider yourself Shepherdess Number Thirty, {{and come to the}} housekeeper's room at the palace to try on your dress to-morrow. Nonsense! don't talk to me about being afraid and awkward. All you're wanted to do is to look pretty; and your glass must have told you <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> long ago. Remember the rent of the room, my dear, and don't stand in your light and your sister's. Does the little girl like sweetmeats? Of course she does! Well, I promise you a whole box of sugar-plums to take home for her, if you will come and wait at the ball." ...|$|E
6000|$|CARMODY (fighting {{against an}} oppression he cannot understand, bursts into {{a flood of}} words). Don't be talking of the trip. Sure we're glad {{to take it to}} get a sight of you. It's three months since I've had a look at you, and I was anxious. Why haven't you written a line to us? <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> without trouble, surely. Don't you ever think of us at all any more? (He waits for an answer, but Eileen remains silent with her eyes closed. Carmody starts to walk up and down, talking with an air of desperation.) You're not asking a bit of news from home. I'm thinkin' the people out here have taken all the thought of us out of your head. We're all well, thank God. I've another good job on the streets from Murphy and one that'll last a long time, praise be! I'm needin' it surely, with all the expenses--but no matter. Billy had a raise from his old skinflint of a boss a month back. He's gettin' seven a week now and proud as a turkey. He was comin' out with us to-day, but he'd a date with his girl. Sure, he's got a girl now, the young bucko! What d'you think of him? It's old Malloy's girl he's after--the pop-eyed one with glasses, you remember--as ugly as a blind sheep, only he don't think so. He said to give you his love. (Eileen stirs and sighs wearily, a frown {{appearing}} for an instant on her forehead.) And Tom and Nora was comin' out too, but Father Fitz had some doin's or other up to the school, and he told them to be there, so they wouldn't come with us, but they sent their love to you, too. They're growin' so big you'd not know them. Tom's no good at the school. He's like Billy was. I've had to take the strap to him often. He's always playin' hooky and roamin' the streets. And Nora. (With pride.) There's the divil for you! Up to everything she is and no holdin' her high spirits. As pretty as a picture, and the smartest girl in her school, Father Fitz says. Am I lyin', Maggie? ...|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked what}} one moment stands out for him, Beckham said the time Connick, Jr. said, [...] "I don't think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> <b>that</b> any better"—after Beckham's {{performance}} of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Superstition". [...] "Harry's typically been tough on me," [...] said Beckham. [...] "He's like a coach {{trying to get}} the best out of me. And I really appreciate that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A clumsy effort that, of course," [...] he admitted, [...] "especially {{when your}} father has a detective always round the place. He is well guarded, but I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> better than <b>that</b> if you would, Miss Duge." ...|$|R
500|$|The Beatles {{often called}} Mardas the [...] "Greek wizard", and Paul McCartney remembered being {{interested}} in his ideas: “Well, if <b>you</b> [...] <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> we’d like one". It was always, 'We’d like one'”. Mardas' ideas were {{not confined to the}} realms of electronic wizardry, but included songwriting involvement, with a Lennon-Mardas composition, [...] "What's the New Mary Jane", originally meant for inclusion on the Beatles' self-titled double album (also known as the White Album).|$|R
5000|$|... "Who is {{to decide}} what ought to command my reverence--my {{neighbor}} or I? [...] [...] You can't have reverence for a thing that doesn't command it.

5000|$|The Bengals {{declined}} to resign Benson in 2012. Coach Marvin Lewis later recounted how {{he explained the}} decision to Benson: [...] "'Ced, it's not that I didn't think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> on the football field, {{it was the other}} stuff that I got tired of. When I would go to you and say we're going to rotate the backs Benson would take it poorly. I don't need that anymore.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Steve-O {{travelled}} to {{shows with}} large wardrobes, often packed in garbage bags, as Petkovic recounted in We Never Learn: [...] "We flew out there and, as usual, our drummer Steve-O packied his 'costumes' (like a multicolored coat {{made out of}} shag rug) not in suitcases. but in large garbage bags. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> back then. When we were in baggage claim at LAX airport, his stuff eventually rolled out, strewn all over the carousel. We ended up getting to our first show late, at a called Nightmovies in Orange County. Not only did the promoter hate it and not want to pay me, but he hit me {{over the head with}} a gun, then pointed it at me and told me to get the fuck out".|$|E
6000|$|Grace's face softened, and {{she glanced}} at her companions, who, after waiting a little while, were just leaving the shed. [...] "Of course," [...] she said, [...] "I should have known it was absurd to fancy <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} of <b>that</b> kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{they had}} no right to take you," [...] the {{sergeant}} said; [...] "seventeen's the earliest age, and as a rule soldiers ain't much good till they are past twenty. You would have a right to get off if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> prove your age; but of course <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>that</b> without witnesses or papers, and it's an old game for recruits who look young to try to pass as under age." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is {{that really}} necessary? Well, I am sure <b>you</b> <b>could</b> learn to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with practice,' said Elfride with an ex-cathedra air, as became {{a person who}} spoke from {{experience}} in the art. 'You {{would make a great}} name for certain,' she continued.|$|R
