Methods: A cross-sectional household survey, using telephone recruitment {{followed by a}} postal pencil-and-paper questionnaire. The overall response rate was 67. 3 %. Results: Difficulties with interpersonal relationships are common causes of distress for <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> in particular problems with parents, problems with friends and relationship break-ups.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay {{was to examine the}} role of {{religious}} beliefs, actions and practice in <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> own description of their identity. An additional goal was to examine how <b>young</b> <b>people</b> describe their identity in relation to their primary and secondary socialization. A qualitative method was used with semi - structured interviews and six <b>young</b> <b>people</b> between the ages of 18 and 23 were interviewed.             The interview results show that three out of the six <b>young</b> <b>people</b> think of themselves as religious while the remaining three emphasize that they are secularized Muslims. The results also show <b>that</b> the <b>young</b> <b>people</b> emphasize <b>that</b> the celebration of feasts in the family is the main focus.   Four out of the six <b>young</b> <b>people</b> point out <b>that</b> they are themselves among friends, their families and in the mosque, while the remaining two feel a communion with their Muslim friends and people in the mosque.        Three out of the six <b>young</b> <b>people</b> consume alcohol and eat pork, while the remaining three refrain from this. The <b>young</b> <b>people</b> emphasize <b>that</b> their beliefs are a personal matter between themselves and God, and that their actions don't define them as being Muslims or non-Muslims...|$|R

And it makes you think: how is it possible that those ancient people built something so scientifically complex? They must have had something that we don't, even though we always think that we're a lot more advanced than they were. Take Rembrandt and van Gogh: who can match them today? When I think that way, I'm increasingly convinced that everything is actually possible. If they managed to do the impossible nearly five thousand years ago, why can't we do it today? That applies equally to football, but also to something like the Cruyff Courts and school sports grounds. My fourteen rules are set out for every court and every school sports ground to follow.
