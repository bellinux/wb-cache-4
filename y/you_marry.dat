500|$|The Chinese {{media has}} {{capitalized}} {{on the subject}} matter with television shows, viral videos, newspapers and magazine articles, and pundits that have sharply criticized women for [...] "waiting it out {{for a man with}} a bigger house or fancier car". The television series comedy Will <b>You</b> <b>Marry</b> Me and My Family, which premièred on CCTV-8, that revolves around the principal concept of sheng nu as a family frantically searches for a prospective spouse of the main character who is in her 30s.

500|$|It was {{following}} No.234 Squadron's move to Middle Wallop that Hughes began to score heavily against German fighters. On 15August, {{in one of}} the costliest engagements of the Battle of Britain, known thereafter to the Luftwaffe as [...] "Black Thursday", Hughes claimed victories (one of them shared) over two Messerschmitt Me110s. [...] He again achieved dual success on 16, 18 and 26August, all six victims being Messerschmitt Bf109s brought down {{in the vicinity of the}} Isle of Wight.

500|$|As {{the guitar}} intro of [...] "Gambler" [...] started, Madonna {{stood on the}} side-stage and started dancing energetically, as {{flashlights}} fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled a steel structure present {{on the side of}} the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one. She then performed [...] "Borderline", [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Crazy for You"—while touching the hands of the audience members. Madonna then returned to the microphone and started singing [...] "Over and Over" [...] from Like a Virgin. It was followed by [...] "Burning Up" [...] during which she caressed one of the guitarist, ultimately disappearing for another constume change. As the music of the song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet in her hand and a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow atop her head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck. Madonna asked the audience [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>marry</b> me?" [...] When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song. Madonna continued singing the song while rolling around the floor, and added a snippet of Michael Jackson's Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience. She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a boob tube and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck. In a self-parodying performance of the song [...] "Material Girl", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?... I'm not... Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began to strip off more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat and doing a curtsey.|$|E
