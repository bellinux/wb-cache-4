We gathered data through a mail survey of New Zealand auditors in order to ascertain their opinion on the effectiveness <b>of</b> these <b>audit</b> procedures. The results suggest that relatively few (less than half) of the 56 standard audit procedures are perceived by our surveyed auditors as being more effective in detecting fraud in stock and warehousing cycle. Further, more than half <b>of</b> the 56 <b>audit</b> procedures are perceived by respondents as moderately effective in detecting fraud. Fifteen audit procedures are perceived as being less effective in detecting fraud the stock and warehousing audit cycle. A univariate analysis reveals no significant perpetual differences among our respondents on the basis of the location of their employers in New Zealand, and the type <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> firm employing them. We employed logit regression analysis to test a model to predict the likelihood of detecting fraud in stock and warehousing cycle, given certain auditor and audit firm specific factors. The results of the regression analysis suggest that size <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> firm (measured by the number of employees), auditor’s position tenure, and auditor’s <b>years</b> <b>of</b> experience are statistically significant predictors of the likelihood of detecting fraud in stock and warehousing cycle in New Zealand.

40|$|Background: Critical {{incident}} audit {{and feedback}} are recommended interventions {{to improve the}} quality of obstetric care. To evaluate the effect <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> at district level in Thyolo, Malawi, we assessed the incidence of facility-based severe maternal complications (severe acute maternal morbidity (SAMM) and maternal mortality) during two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> and feedback. Methodology/Principal Findings: Between September 2007 and September 2009, we included all cases of maternal mortality and SAMM that occurred in Thyolo District Hospital, the main referral facility in the area, using validated diseasespecific criteria. During two- to three-weekly audit sessions, health workers and managers identified substandard care factors. Resulting recommendations were implemented and followed up. Feedback was given during subsequent sessions. A linear regression analysis was performed on facility-based severe maternal complications. During the two-year study period, 386 women were included: 46 died and 340 sustained SAMM, giving a case fatality rate of 11. 9 %. Forty-five cases out of the 386 inclusions were audited in plenary with hospital staff. There was a reduction of 3. 1 women with severe maternal complications per 1000 deliveries in the district health facilities, from 13. 5 per 1000 deliveries in the beginning to 10. 4 per 1000 deliveries at the end of the study period. The incidence of uterine rupture and major obstetric hemorrhage reduced considerably (from 3. 5 to 0. 2 and from 5. 9 to 2. 6 per 1000 facility deliveries respectively).

The research that gave support to the current study is exploratory and adopted a non-probabilistic sample comprising 28 auditors of an Undergraduate and Master’s degree programs in Accounting of a Brazilian University. Thus, to preserve the maturity and skill expected of the respondents of the research we restricted a minimum <b>of</b> one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>auditing</b> experience for the auditor that might have served in one of the Big Four Auditing firm.

Our analysis was based on absolute frequency analysis of the use of the substantive procedures. In this respect, our results revealed that auditor’s satisfaction is anchored on the materiality of the accounts or group of accounts to be audited. Yet they give a relative importance to judgment of risk and relevance of misstatement that each account presents. In so doing, auditors give preference to substantive procedures in which one is able to gather information from third parties to confirm accounting balances while giving less priority to recalculation of routine tests developed by the audited entities...|$|R

The objective of the study was to provide information that can be used by auditing educators to develop auditing curriculum that is relevant and useful to accounting practitioners and to candidates for the CPA examination in auditing.

Eighty local firms were randomly selected for the survey from the Illinois CPA Society's mailing list of 400 CPA firms; twelve of the national CPA firms were surveyed. Only firms within the 312 area code were included in the survey. Based on the results of this investigation the following implications appear to be valid at this time: (1) A significant number of topics typically included in a course in auditing do not appear to be important to the job performance of first-year staff auditors today.

40|$|Several {{previous}} {{studies have examined the}} impact of auditor switching on audit fees. The underpinning theory of these studies is that a potential new auditor will cut initial audit fees (low ball) in order to secure an audit, and the ensuing stream <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> fees including a quasi-rent component payable to any incumbent auditor. Empirical evidence of the presence <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> fee cutting subsequent to an auditor switch is mixed. The present study proposes an alternative theory which argues that a potential new auditor will low ball in order to secure an audit but that such fee cutting is conditional on non-audit services (NAS) growth between the year prior to the auditor change and the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> the new <b>audit</b> engagement. That is, the audit fee cut will be recouped by revenue generated from the provision of auditor supplied non-audit services. The study is based on data from 270 publicly listed Australian companies taken at a time when NAS fees provided by incumbent auditors were rising. The empirical evidence shows that auditees who report an auditor change together with real growth in the fees for auditor supplied non-audit services, show a significantly lower audit fee than situations in which these two conditions do not exist together.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} an <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> medical inpatient records. DESIGN [...] Retrospective {{comparison of}} the quality of recording in inpatients' notes over three years (1988, 1989, 1990). SETTING [...] Central Middlesex Hospital. MATERIALS [...] Random sample of 188 notes per year drawn systematically from notes from four selected one month periods and audited by two audit nurses and most hospital physicians. MAIN MEASURES [...] General quality of routine clerking, assessment, clinical management, and discharge, according to a standardised, criterion based questionnaire developed in the hospital. RESULTS [...] 1988 was the year preceding the start <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> in the hospital, 1989 the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> active <b>audit</b> with implicit and loosely defined criteria, and 1990 the year after introduction and circulation of explicit criteria for note keeping. There was a significant trend over the three years in 21 / 56 items of the questionnaire, including recording of alcohol intake (x 2 = 8. 4, df = 1, p = 0. 01), ethnic origin (x 2 = 57, df = 1, p = 0. 001), allergies and drug reactions (x 2 = 10, df = 1, p = 0. 01) at admission and of chest x ray findings (x 2 = 8, df = 1, p = 0. 01), final diagnosis (x 2 = 5. 6, df = 1, p = 0. 025), and signed entries (x 2 = 11. 3, df = 1, p = 0. 001). Documentation of discharge and notification of discharge to general practitioners was not significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS [...] Extended <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> note keeping failed to sustain an initial improvement in practice; {{this may be due to}} coincidental decline in feedback to doctors about their performance...|$|R

This progress has {{been the result of}} hard work throughout IRS and sustained commitment at the top levels of the agency. However, IRS still faces significant financial management challenges in (1) resolving its remaining material weaknesses and significant deficiency in internal control, (2) developing outcome-oriented performance metrics, and (3) correcting numerous other control deficiencies, especially those relating to safeguarding tax receipts and taxpayer information. At the beginning <b>of</b> GAOs <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> IRSs fiscal <b>year</b> 2011 financial statements, 77 recommendations from prior audits remained open because IRS had not fully addressed the underlying issues. During the fiscal year 2011 financial audit, IRS took actions that GAO considered sufficient to close 38 recommendations. At the same time, GAO identified additional control deficiencies resulting in 30 new recommendations. In total, 69 recommendations remain open. GAO has also identified numerous control deficiencies and made recommendations related to information security that have been reported separately and are not included in this report because of the sensitive nature of many of those control deficiencies. ...|$|R
