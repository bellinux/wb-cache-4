These adaptations may have been a consequence of tribal warfare. Humans may also have predispositions for [...] "altruistic punishment" [...] – to punish in-group members who violate in-group rules, even when this altruistic behavior cannot be justified in terms of helping those you are related to (kin selection), cooperating with those who you will interact with again (direct reciprocity), or cooperating to better <b>your</b> <b>reputation</b> with others (indirect reciprocity).|$|E
2500|$|As Southern California's {{population}} grew rapidly after World War II, {{there was a}} tremendous demand for church construction. [...] This in turn led to a boom in business for Judson Studios. [...] At the peak in the 1950s, Judson employed 30 craftsmen. [...] Walter W. Judson later recalled, “It got so it almost became counterproductive. [...] It was difficult to keep track of what was going on.” [...] As a result, Horace Judson established a rule that the studio would never again employ more than 15 craftsmen at once.

2500|$|The Huainanzi {{developed}} {{the idea of}} politically-oriented ganying philosophy. The most perfect form of government is that of wuwei [...] "non-action", for it operates through the ziran [...] "natural" [...] ganying [...] "resonance" [...] of all things.

[...] "What I call non-action ... the undertakings of government will succeed, but [...] personally will not be glorified. [...] accomplishments will be established, but <b>your</b> <b>reputation</b> will not obtain. [...] does not mean that a stimulus [...] will not produce a response [...] or that a push will not move [...]" [...] (19.2, tr. Major et al. 2010: 770-771). The Daoist idea of wuwei is interpreted formally in the sense of ganying, [...] "non-interference means to respond spontaneously and harmoniously to stimulus" [...] (Le Blanc 1985: 37).|$|E

Firstly I was very surprised at her small stature; I had imagined her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: [...] "I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, <b>your</b> <b>reputation</b> runs before you.
