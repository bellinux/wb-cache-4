5|$|The newly hatched {{young of}} oviparous fish are called larvae. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> (for nourishment), {{and are very}} {{different}} in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed metamorphosis) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> to feeding on zooplankton prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} requiem sharks, the blacknose shark is viviparous: after the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the empty <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> develops into a placental connection {{through which the}} mother provides nourishment. Off the United States, males are thought to reproduce every year, while females reproduce every other year.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the slender}} smooth-hound is diverse, but {{dominated}} by small, benthic bony fishes and decapod crustaceans. It exhibits a specialized form of aplacental viviparity with oophagy: the females produce a single capsule in each uterus that contains 30–80 ova, of which one ovum develops into an embryo that consumes {{the rest of}} the ova and stores the yolk material in its external <b>yolk</b> <b>sac.</b> The growing embryo is mainly sustained by this <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> during gestation, though it may be additionally supplied with histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. The typical litter size is two pups, one per uterus. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the slender smooth-hound as Least Concern; it is taken as fishery bycatch but not in great numbers, and furthermore large portions of its range see minimal fishing activity.|$|E

40|$|Purified {{preparations}} of Coxiella burnetii {{were examined}} for enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. Glucose-phosphate isomerase, fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphatase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase {{were shown to}} be present in C. burnetii extracts. Heat-killed C. burnetii purified with normal <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> demonstrated no activity after disruption. Aldolase was shown to be of the class II type by complete inhibition of activity in the presence of 8 × 10 − 3 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The host enzyme activity (normal and infected <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs)</b> was not affected by the same treatment. When cellulose acetate electrophoresis was performed on the extracts, aldolase from both normal and infected <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> exhibited five isozyme bands, whereas aldolase from the C. burnetii extract appeared as a single band...|$|R
5|$|The {{litter size}} ranges {{from one to}} eight, with two to five being typical, {{increasing}} with female size. In Omanese waters, females on average outnumber males in a litter by more than 2:1, and all-female litters are not uncommon. Similar but less extreme sex imbalances have also been reported from litters of milk sharks off Senegal and eastern India. The reason for this imbalance is unknown, {{and it has not}} been observed in related species such as the Atlantic sharpnose shark (R. terraenovae). Gestation of the embryos takes around a year and proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, lasting two months to an embryonic length of , the embryo relies on yolk for sustenance and gas exchange occurs across its surface integument and possibly also the <b>yolk</b> <b>sac.</b> During the second phase, which also lasts for two months to an embryonic length of , the external gill filaments develop and the <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> begins to be resorbed, the embyo ingesting histotroph (a nutritious substance secreted by the mother) in the meantime. In the third phase, lasting six to eight months, the depleted <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> is converted into a placental connection through which the fetus receives nourishment until birth.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the whitetip reef shark is viviparous; once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment {{for the remainder of}} gestation. Mature females have a single functional ovary, on the left side, and two functional uteruses. The reproductive cycle is biennial.|$|E
5|$|Lungless {{salamanders}} in {{the family}} Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay {{a small number of}} unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus Ensatinas, the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.|$|E

5|$|The {{leopard shark}} is aplacental viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos sustained by a <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> until birth. In northern areas, females use bays and sloughs as nursery areas, while {{to the south}} they give birth in more open areas. Known breeding grounds {{along the coast of}} California include Humboldt Bay, Tomales Bay, Bodega Bay, San Francisco Bay, Elkhorn Slough, Morro Bay, Santa Monica Bay (Los Angeles), Catalina Harbor (Santa Catalina Island), and San Diego Bay.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the copper shark is viviparous, in which the <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> of the {{developing}} embryo, once depleted, is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have one functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites the female {{as a prelude to}} mating. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place from October to December (spring and early summer), when both sexes have migrated into offshore waters at higher latitudes. Birthing seems to occur from June to January, peaking in October and November.|$|E
5|$|An ambush predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals {{itself on}} the sea floor and waits for approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey are targeted visually and, with a quick upward thrust of the head, snatched in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal ambush sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> until birth. Females give birth to an average of six young every spring.|$|E
5000|$|Tang Fei-fan ( [...] ; July 23, 1897 - September 30, 1958) was a Chinese medical {{microbiologist}} {{best known}} for culturing the Chlamydia trachomatis agent in the <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> of eggs.|$|R
50|$|After a {{few days}} the eggs will hatch and become wigglers. This is when the fish have hatched out of their eggs, but are still {{attached}} to the spawning surface, and feeding off of their <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs,</b> which are attached to their stomachs. After five to seven days of being wigglers, the fish have almost completely consumed their <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> and become free swimming. They are very small, but can normally eat newborn brine shrimp as a first food. They can also be fed liquid fry food, which is available at most fish or pet stores.|$|R
5000|$|The female seahorse (hippocampus) {{deposits}} {{eggs into}} the pouch on the male's abdomen. The male releases sperm into the pouch, fertilizing the eggs. The embryos develop within the male's pouch, nourished by their individual <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Encountered singly or in groups, the thornback {{guitarfish}} {{feeds on}} small, benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the developing young drawing sustenance from a <b>yolk</b> <b>sac.</b> Females {{give birth to}} 1–15 pups annually in late summer, following a roughly year-long gestation period. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the thornback guitarfish under Least Concern {{because the majority of}} its range lies within United States waters, where it is common since it has no commercial value and is not heavily fished commercially or recreationally. The status of this species in Mexican waters is inadequately known but may be more precarious.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the night shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right) and two functional uteruses, which are divided into separate compartments for each embryo. Within the uterus the embryos lie lengthwise with their heads pointing {{the same direction as}} their mother. Most information known about the night shark's life history comes from the subpopulation off northeastern Brazil, and may not hold true {{in other parts of the}} species range. Northeastern Brazilian sharks mate throughout the summer, with the males biting at the female's body and fins as a prelude to copulation.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the silky shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryo exhausts its supply of yolk, the depleted <b>yolk</b> <b>sac</b> is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Relative to other viviparous sharks, the placenta of the silky shark is less similar to the analogous mammalian structure in that no interdigitation exists between the tissues of the fetus and mother. Furthermore, the fetal red blood cells are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteri, which are divided lengthwise into separate compartments for each embryo.|$|E
40|$|When {{added to}} the serum-free medium in which 17. 5 -day rat <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> were incubated, formaldehyde-denatured 125 I-labelled bovine serum albumin was rapidly degraded. More than 80 % of the radiolabelled {{digestion}} products appearing in the incubation medium consisted of [125 I]iodo-L-tyrosine; larger digestion products were found only {{in association with the}} yolk-sac tissue. In the early stages of an incubation, low-molecular-weight digestion products began to appear in the incubation medium only after they could be detected within the tissue, and progressive association of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity with the tissue preceded both these events. None of the observed proteolysis could be attributed to proteinases released into the incubation medium. Tissue-associated acid-insoluble radioactivity showed a lysosomal distribution on sub-cellular fractionation, and cell-free homogenates of <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> degraded albumin only at acid pH values. Progressively decreasing the rat of pinosome formation (either by progressively lowering the incubation temperature or by the use of increasing concentrations of the metabolic inhibitor rotenone) caused a corresponding decrease in the rate of degradation of albumin. These findings indicate that, in vitro, formaldehyde-denatured 125 I-labelled bovine serum albumin is digested by rat <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> exclusively intracellularly, within lysosomes...|$|R

40|$|In rat <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> {{incubated}} in vitro, {{the rates}} of degradation of endogenous [3 H]leucine-labelled proteins and of pinocytically ingested 125 I-labelled bovine serum albumin were both decreased {{in the presence of}} either ammonium, methylammonium or ethylammonium ions (0 - 20 mM) or much lower concentrations of chloroquine (0 - 500 microM). These effects were also accompanied by an inhibition of pinocytosis, as measured by the rate of uptake of 125 I-labelled polyvinylpyrrolidone, and by a fall in the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio within the tissue. Re-incubation in inhibitor-free medium of <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> previously exposed to a weak base restored pinocytic and proteolytic capacities, except for tissues exposed to chloroquine at concentrations above 0. 1 mM (these appeared to be cytotoxic); an attendent rise in [ATP]/[ADP] ratios to near normal values was also observed. Weak bases, at concentrations that fully arrested the breakdown of 125 I-labelled albumin, failed to inhibit by more than 45 % the degradation of [3 H]leucine-labelled endogenous proteins. Since 125 I-labelled bovine serum albumin {{has been shown to be}} degraded entirely intralysosomally by <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs,</b> this suggests either that the hydrolysis of endogenous proteins is shared between lysosomes and some other site or that, unlike 125 I-labelled albumin, some endogenous proteins can be degraded within lysosomes at abnormally high pH...|$|R
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, the {{dusky shark}} is viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are initially nourished by a <b>yolk</b> <b>sac,</b> which is {{converted into a}} placental connection to the mother once the yolk supply is exhausted. Mating occurs during spring in the northwestern Atlantic, while {{there appears to be}} no reproductive seasonality in other regions such as off South Africa. Females are capable of storing masses of sperm, possibly from multiple males, for months to years within their nidamental glands (an organ that secretes egg cases). This would be advantageous given the sharks' itinerant natures and low natural abundance, which would make encounters with suitable mates infrequent and unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a <b>yolk</b> <b>sac,</b> which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
5|$|Active and schooling, {{the black}} dogfish is an {{opportunistic}} predator and scavenger that mainly consumes bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters {{of four to}} 40 pups that are sustained to term by a <b>yolk</b> <b>sac.</b> There is no well-defined breeding season, and mating and birthing take place year-round. The black dogfish contributes significantly to the bycatch of deep-sea commercial fisheries operating in the North Atlantic; it is of little commercial value and is usually discarded. As large portions of its range see little deepwater fishing activity and its northwestern Atlantic population seems to be stable, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this species under Least Concern overall. It has been assessed as Near Threatened in the northeastern Atlantic, where its numbers may have declined from heavy fishing pressure.|$|E
50|$|Specialised feeds are {{produced}} for fish hatcheries. In {{species such as}} salmon and trout, the newly hatched fry first feed from their <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> and then can be fed with starter feeds. Marine species such as sea bass, sea bream, flounders and turbot consume the nutrition in their <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> {{during the first few}} days post hatching and then are fed for several weeks on live prey, in the form of rotifers and brine shrimp (Artemia). Special feeds can be used to enrich the nutritional value of the prey. Rotifers are usually bred in the hatchery while brine shrimp are generally collected from the wild, e.g. salt lakes. Manufactured feed alternatives to brine shrimp are becoming available, offering more consistent nutrition and improved sustainability as demand increases with the growth of aquaculture.|$|R

50|$|All bony fish, some {{sharks and}} rays have <b>yolk</b> <b>sacs</b> at some stage of development, with all oviparous fishes {{retaining}} the sac after hatching. Lamniform sharks are ovoviviparous, in that their eggs hatch in utero, in addition to eating unfertilized eggs, unborn sharks participate in intrauterine-cannibalism: stronger sharklets consume their weaker womb-mates.|$|R
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} cephalopods, bony fishes, and other {{cartilaginous}} fishes, the copper shark is a fast-swimming predator {{that has been}} known to hunt in large groups, utilizing their numbers to their advantage; however for {{most of the time they}} remain solitary. Off South Africa, this species associates closely with the annual sardine run, involving millions of southern African pilchard (Sardinops sagax). Like other requiem sharks, it is viviparous, with the developing embryos mainly nourished through a placental connection formed from the depleted <b>yolk</b> <b>sac.</b> Females bear litters of 7 to 24 pups every other year in coastal nursery areas, after a gestation period of 12 or perhaps as long as 21 months. It is extremely slow-growing, with males and females not reaching maturity until 13–19 and 19–20 years of age respectively.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the nervous}} shark is viviparous: once the embryos exhaust their initial supply of yolk, they are {{provisioned}} {{by the mother}} through a placental connection formed from the depleted <b>yolk</b> <b>sac.</b> Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites {{at the sides of}} the female as a prelude to mating. After mating, the female stores the sperm for approximately four weeks prior to fertilization. In Darwin Harbor, mating occurs from January to March and birthing occurs in October and November following a gestation period of eight to nine months. In Shark Bay, mating occurs from late October to early November and birthing occurs around the same time the following year, following a gestation period of 11 months; this slower development likely reflects the cooler temperatures of Shark Bay.|$|E
5|$|Some of Aristotle's {{observations}} were not taken seriously by science {{until they were}} independently rediscovered in the 19th century. For example, he recorded that male octopuses have a hectocotylus, a tentacle which stores sperm and which can transfer it into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating. The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described it in his 1817 Le Règne Animal. Aristotle {{also noted that the}} young of the dogfish grow inside their mother's body attached by a cord to something like a placenta (a <b>yolk</b> <b>sac).</b> This was confirmed in 1842 by the German zoologist Johannes Peter Müller. Aristotle noted, too, that a river catfish which he called the glanis cares for its young, as the female leaves after giving birth; the male guards the eggs for forty or fifty days, chasing off small fish which threaten the eggs, and making a murmuring noise. The Swiss American zoologist Louis Agassiz found the account to be correct in 1890.|$|E
