500|$|Goldsmith was {{influenced}} by the style of the romantic, sweeping music of Star Wars. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> think about it, space is a very romantic thought. It is, to me, like the Old West, we’re up in the universe. It’s about discovery and new life [...] it’s really the basic premise of Star Trek," [...] he said. Goldsmith's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships. Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece, Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece. Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to re-work his initial ideas. The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece. The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked Enterprise by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited, requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue. Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the only Star Trek film to have a true overture, using [...] "Ilia's Theme" [...] (later re-recorded - as a lyrical version - by Shaun Cassidy as [...] "A Star Beyond Time" [...] with lyrics by Larry Kusik) in this role, most noticeably in the [...] "Director's Edition" [...] DVD release. Star Trek and The Black Hole were the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until 2000 (with Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark).|$|E

2500|$|Feinstein {{has said}} about fashion: [...] "Fashion {{is at its}} best when {{a woman and her}} outfit work {{together}} to make <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> stare just like a great painting. Art should look amazing regardless of where it is, whether it is in a collector's home or a museum...Fashion and Art both need to know their strengths and weakness and not try to do what the other does best." ...|$|E
