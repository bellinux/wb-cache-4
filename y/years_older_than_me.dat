2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs.

He was into the occult and he used to have these deaths-heads and cross-bones all over everything. He didn't like to talk to anybody, and I think suicide was the only way out for him. What else could he have done? —Joe Strummer By 1970 his brother David had become estranged from his family and had joined the National Front. His suicide in July profoundly {{affected}} Strummer, as did having to identify his body after it had lain undiscovered for three days. After finishing his time at City of London Freemen's School, Ashtead Park, Surrey, in 1970, Strummer moved on to the Central School of Art and Design in London, where he briefly flirted with the idea of becoming a professional cartoonist and completed a one-year foundation course. During this time, Mellor shared a flat in the north London suburb of Palmers Green with friends Clive Timperley and Tymon Dogg. In 1971 Strummer became a vegetarian and remained one until his death. I bought a ukulele. No kidding. I saved some money, £1.99 I think, and bought it down Shaftesbury Avenue.

40|$|On my {{block in}} Waipahu, {{there were two}} Filipino kids who always hung together. One was tall and lanky, and a silver cross dangled from his left ear. He was a fifth grader (one <b>year</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>me)</b> and his name was Angel Benavides, but Virginia "Peanut Buttah" Constancico (who stopped being a virgin after seventh grade) called him "Chocolate," because they were "two great tastes that taste great together. " Benny DeCosta was his friend, but {{everyone}} called him "Tonto. " Tonto was short, tubby, and wore airplane and helicopter BBD's that barely covered his butt-crack. I saw them every morning at seven-fifteen, as my mom took me to Our Savior Lutheran School in Aiea. And for a moment, our eyes would meet through the bubbled, do-it-yourself tint of my mom's rusted gold Duster, and Angel would give me that "wassup" nod of the head as {{he leaned against the}} stop sign smoking Kool Menthol Lights. And that was all I ever knew of them. I grew up in Waipahu, but my parents raised me a Townie. I played soccer in Aiea, joined the Boy Scouts in Pearl City, and attended school in Downtown. When I asked to play street football with Angel and Tonto, my mom said "Kid's li'dat Benevides and DeCosta boy nothing but trouble. Be a good boy. Play pool. " Five years later [...] when "Color of Money" came out [...] she learned to regret that, but I shot eight-ball every day with the blinds open, hoping they would see me run the table.

Martin says an enthusiast is worse than useless; people, he says, can't afford to dabble in ideas or dreams. He calls grandfather's idea paleolithic. I hate him to be laughed at. Martin's so cocksure. I don't think he'd find many men of eighty who'd bathe in the Serpentine all the year round, and do his own room, cook his own food, and live on about ninety pounds a year out of his pension of three hundred, and give all the rest away. Martin says that's unsound, and the 'Book of Universal Brotherhood' rot. I don't care if it is; it's fine to go on writing it as he does all day. Martin admits that. That's the worst of him: he's so cool, you can't score him off; {{he seems to be}} always criticising you; it makes me wild.... That little model is a hopeless duffer.

Grandfather's so absorbed he doesn't notice; he likes to read the thing over and over, to hear how the words sound. That girl would be no good at any sort of work, except 'sitting,' I suppose. Aunt B. used to say she sat well. There's something queer about her face; it reminds me a little of that Botticelli Madonna in the National Gallery, the full-face one; not so much in the shape as in the expression--almost stupid, and yet as if things were going to happen to her. Her hands and arms are pretty, and her feet are smaller than mine. She's two <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>me.</b> I asked her why she went in for being a model, which is beastly work. She said she was glad to get anything! I asked her why she didn't go into a shop or into service.

At last one day, when I was seven years old, I went out playing with my brother, among the pine-woods, near the waterfall that rushes below there, from under the glacier. We saw something lying in the ice-cold water, just beneath {{the bottom of the}} ice-sheet. We climbed over the moraine; and there, oh heaven! we could see two dead bodies. They were drowned, just drowned, we thought: it might have been yesterday. One of them was short and thick-set, with the face of an Englishman: he was close-shaven, and, what seemed odd to us, he had on clothes which, though we were but children, we knew at once for the clothes of a long past fashion--in fact, a suit of the Louis dix-huit style. Tha other was a tall and handsome man, dressed in the unchangeable blue coat and brown velvet breeches of our own canton, of the Graubunden. We were very frightened about it, and so we ran away trembling and told an old woman who lived close by; her name was Cathrein, and her grandchildren used to play with us, though she herself was about the age of my father, for my father married very late. Old Cathrein came out with us to look; and the moment she saw the bodies, she cried out with a great cry, [...] "It is he! It is Andreas! It is my betrothed, who was lost on the very day week when I was to be married. I should know him at once among ten thousand. It is many, many years now, but I have not forgotten his face--ah, my God, that face; I know it well!" [...] And she took his hand in hers, that fair white young hand in her own old brown withered one, and kissed it gently. [...] "And yet," [...] she said, [...] "he is five <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> this fair young man here; five years older than me!" [...] We were frightened to hear her talk so, for we said to ourselves, [...] "She must be mad;" [...] so we ran home and brought our father. He looked at the dead bodies and at old Cathrein, and he said, [...] "It is indeed true. He is my brother." [...] Ah, monsieur, you would not have forgotten it if you had seen those two old people standing there beside the fresh corpses they had not seen for all those winters! They themselves had meanwhile grown old and grey and wrinkled; but the ice of the glacier had kept those others young, and fresh, and fair, and beautiful as on the day they were first engulfed in it.
