According to bassist Matt Rubano, Fred Mascherino and Adam Lazzara's lyrics [...] "are coming into a golden age. The tracks are really more rocking and we’re trying some new things, but it’s still us."

All we've got him in the nets is bowling offspin, offspin, offspin. It's repetition all the time and he's getting better and better at it. He's a very fast learner." ...|$|E
