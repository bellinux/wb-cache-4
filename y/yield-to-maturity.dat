40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the mathematics {{of the relationship}} between the default risk and <b>yield-to-maturity</b> of a coupon bond. It is shown that the <b>yield-to-maturity</b> is driven not only by the default probability and recovery rate of the bond but also by other contractual characteristics of the bond that are not commonly associated with default risk, such as the maturity and coupon rate of the bond. In particular, for given default probability and recovery rate, both the level and slope of the <b>yield-to-maturity</b> term structure depend on the coupon rate, as the higher the coupon rate the higher the <b>yield-to-maturity</b> term structure. In addition, the <b>yield-to-maturity</b> term structure is upward or downward sloping depending on whether the coupon rate is high or low enough. Similar qualitative results also holds for CDS spreads. Consequently, the <b>yield-to-maturity</b> is an indicator that must be used cautiously as a proxy for default risk.

40|$|Lally (2007) {{concludes that}} {{regulators}} must esimate the risk-free rate as the <b>yield-to-maturity</b> on Government debt with a term-to-maturity {{equal to the}} regulatory period, {{to ensure that the}} present value of expected cash flows equals the investment base. The analytics behind this conclusion assume that forward rates are an unbiased estimate of future spot rates, an assumption which is inconsistent with empirical evidence. This has an important economic implication. With the typical case being that the yield curve is upward-sloping, adopting a short-term risk-free rate would result in equityholders being systematically under-compensated for the actual risk involved in a long-lived project. If we adopt an alternative assumption that current rates are an unbiased estimate of future rates, the regulated rate of return {{is a function of the}} entire forward curve of interest rates and the accounting depreciation schedule.

Aumann and Serrano (2008) have recently proposed an index of riskiness that helps to make this intuition rigorous. We use their index to analyze the riskiness of corporate bonds and how this can change over time and across rating classes and how it compares to the riskiness of other financial instruments. We find statistically significant evidence that a number of financial and macroeconomic variables can predict time-variation in the riskiness of corporate bonds, including in ways one might not expect.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that the {{duration-based}} hedge ratio has many serious defects: first, the <b>yield-to-maturity</b> is not the market interest rate, and it cannot even serve as a proxy for the market interest rate. Second, it is difficult to choose an appropriate bond for hedging among available bonds and to calculate duration. Third, duration can only be applied to small changes of interest rate. If there is a large change in interest rate, a duration-based hedge's performance may be worse than expected. The paper proposes an improving method to solve these problems. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed design is a model-driven enterprise system. Findings – The proposed system integrates the complex risk management into the enterprise architecture.

The decomposition is accomplished applying the concept of factorization and factor analysis on treasury bonds returns. Weekly data from the interbank market in Poland for the period 30 June – 6 October, 2004 (14 weeks) are used. In the single-factor model of decomposition, the source of risk is assumed to be the change of <b>yield-to-maturity</b> (YTM) of the considered bond. Within the multi-factor model, decomposition is carried out by means of both the factorization concept and factor analysis. Factor analysis is undertaken as a preliminary action aimed to identify common factors of market risk that affect the realized rate of return of the examined securities. The results of factor analysis are used in the multi-factor model of decomposition.

40|$|M. Comm. Fixed-income {{securities}} as {{an asset}} class form {{an integral part of}} investment portfolios. Turnover in the South African bond market during 2009 was R 13. 4 trillion. Normal coupon bonds are traded in the market on a <b>yield-to-maturity</b> basis, and the price of the bond is calculated using a formula based on the sum of all the present values of the future cash flows of the bond. The bond-pricing formula makes the assumption that coupons can be reinvested at the same yield as the current yield-tomaturity. If the investor invests the coupons at a different rate when coupons are paid out, the investor will realise a different yield on the investment. Interest rates are not static, but instead volatile, or change over time and maturity. The term structure of interest rates are of a dynamic nature and the slope of the yield curve changes as market forces impact on short-, medium- and long-term interest rates. The bond-pricing formula ignores the term structure of interest rate. Bonds with similar terms-to-maturity, trading at the same <b>yield-to-maturity</b> and different coupon rates, will produce different returns to investors because of the reinvestment of the coupons in the future. Zero-volatility spreads are calculated by determining the present value of each individual future cash flow of a bond at the relevant point on the yield curve. The sum of all these present values is then compared to the price of the bond. The zerovolatility spread will be equal to a fixed spread to the yield curve, and this will result in the present value of future cash flows at the yield curve and the bond price being equal to each other. Yield curves in this study are constructed as zero-coupon curves with money market, FRA and swap rates as inputs to the calculation thereof. Different methods of determining portfolio returns are investigated to enable the researcher to distinguish between the returns of two bond portfolios. Two portfolios with similar bonds with different zero-volatility spreads are compiled, and similarities in bond portfolios are tested with price value of a basis point, duration and convexity. The returns of these two portfolios are measured and compared over the period 30 September 2000 to 30 November 2009 in order to determine whether zero-volatility spreads as an evaluative tool can optimise bond portfolio returns...|$|E

40|$|A key {{measure of}} {{relative}} {{value of a}} corporate bond is its swap spread. This is the basis point spread over the interest-rate swap curve, and {{is a measure of}} the credit risk of the bond. In its simplest form, the swap spread can be measured as the difference between the <b>yield-to-maturity</b> of the bond and the interest rate given by a straight-line interpolation of the swap curve. In practice traders use the asset-swap spread and the Z-spread as the main measures of relative value. The government bond spread is also considered. We consider the two main spread measures in this paper. Asset-swap spread An asset swap is a package that combines an interest-rate swap with a cash bond, the effect of the combined package being to transform the interest-rate basis of the bond. Typically, a fixed-rate bond will be combined with an interest-rate swap in which the bond holder pays fixed coupon and received floating coupon. The floating-coupon will be a spread over Libor (see Choudhry et al 2001). This spread is the asset-swap spread and is a function of the credit risk of the bond over and above interbank credit risk. 1 Asset swaps may be transacted at par or at the bond’s market price, usually par. This means that the asset swap value is made up of the difference between the bond’s market price and par, as well as the difference between the bond coupon and the swap fixed rate. The zero-coupon curve is used in the asset swap valuation. This curve is derived from the swap curve, so it is the implied zero-coupon curve. The asset swap spread is the spread that equates the difference between the present value of the bond’s cashflows, calculated using the swap zero rates, and the market price of the bond. This spread is a function of the bond’s market price and yield, its cashflows and the implied zero-coupon interest rates. 2 Exhibit 1 shows the Bloomberg screen ASW for a GBP-denominated bond, GK...|$|E
40|$|Since {{in recent}} years a {{relatively}} liquid and transparent market of government securities has emerged in Hungary, it seems straightforward for the monetary authority to try to extract information about market expectations of future nominal interest rates and inflation from the prices of these assets. However, drawing a conclusion from the prices of T-bills and -bonds concerning either nominal interest rate- or inflation expectations is by far not an easy task, both because of its technical complexity and the assumptions which often remain implicit in the process. The primary motivation {{of this paper is}} to present some methods by which the major technical obstacle, i. e. the estimation of the zero-coupon yield curve from couponbearing bond price data can be done, and also to evaluate these methods in terms of suitability to current Hungarian data and practical use in monetary policy. In addition to this, I would like to emphasize and make explicit some often overlooked assumptions (especially the expectations hypothesis) needed to draw conclusions about market expectations of future nominal rates and inflation. Using the estimated zero-coupon rates, I also try to quantify the average difference between yields-tomaturities (YTMs) of coupon bonds and the corresponding zero-coupon rates in Hungary. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 1. 1 and 1. 2 describe the basic concepts and definitions related to the yield curve, and compare zero-coupon curves with <b>yield-to-maturity</b> curves, focusing on the theoretical shortcomings of the latter. Section 1. 3 defines implied forward rates, and shows how to interpret them. Section 1. 4 focuses on the conditions which are necessary to hold if one wants to infere nominal interest rate and inflation expectations from the zero-coupon yield curve. Part 2 deals with some methodological issues of the estimation of zero-coupon yield curves and compares alternative estimation methods on the basis of their applicability to Hungarian data and monetary policy purposes. Sections 2. 1 and 2. 2 give the descriptions of the two methods examined in detail in this paper, i. e. polynomial fit and “parsimonious” models. Section 2. 3 deals with data issues that arise when we try to estimate yield curves using Hungarian bond price data. Section 2. 4 lists some of the criteria which can be used to select a particular estimation method and (where it is possible) compares the methods applied to Hungarian data on the basis of these criteria. Section 2. 5 contains the method proposed for future use in the NBH. Part 3 is an application of the estimated zero-coupon yields, which empirically demonstrates the bias in YTM-type yield curves when the underlying zero curve is non-horizontal. More specifically, in this part I try to quantify the inherent bias in the daily “benchmark yields” calculated by the State Debt Management Agency (SDMA). ...|$|E
