500|$|Frise and Clark {{had grown}} {{concerned}} with the Stars treatment of its staff and made an agreement in 1946 to leave at the first opportunity. [...] Clark contacted John McConnell, publisher of the Montreal Standard, a newspaper with a smaller circulation than the Star that had earlier offered him a position. [...] McConnell offered the pair salaries similar to what they received at the Star, {{as well as the}} opportunity for Frise to have his strip syndicated in the United States, which would supplement his income. [...] When they handed in their resignations that Christmas Eve, Hindmarsh asked them, [...] "Aren't <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> us a chance to bid?" [...] Frise told him, [...] "Mr Hindmarsh, you have nothing to bid with." [...] The last Birdseye Center episode ran on 1 February 1947.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2010, she {{was criticized}} after saying that {{breastfeeding}} should be law. She told Harper's Bazaar UK, [...] "Some people here [...] think they don't have to breastfeed, and I think 'Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> chemical food {{to your child}} when they are so little?'...I {{think there should be}} a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months." [...] Bündchen later posted a statement on her blog saying, [...] "My intention in making a comment about the importance of breastfeeding {{has nothing to do with}} the law. It comes from my passionate beliefs about children. Being a new mom has brought a lot of questions. I feel like I am in a constant search for answers on what might be the best for my child. It's unfortunate that in an interview sometimes things can seem so black and white." ...|$|E

Are you, after {{a life of}} indulgence, come to such a pass that you can only indulge {{yourself}} in one thing more? Are you"--he kept lowering his voice as he went on--"are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> yourselves that last indulgence? Are you going to avoid the consequences of your folly by the one infallible and easy path? Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the slip to the sheriff's officers of conscience by the one open door?" ...|$|E
60|$|But I saw in {{the papers}} that <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up your seat in the House owing to ill-health.|$|R
6000|$|... (Margaret {{prepares the}} cup of tea.) Everybody is excited over that speech. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> us {{particular}} fits, to-morrow, I understand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good, {{you shall}} have it," [...] {{returned}} the Secretary, with a laugh. [...] "I see <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> us big surprises to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Company won’t save you," [...] ses Joe. [...] "For {{the last}} time, are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me that watch and chain, or not? Here’s your fifteen bob." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ruined?" [...] {{said the}} young man. [...] "Are you ruined, like me? Are you, after {{a life of}} indulgence, come to such a pass that you can only indulge {{yourself}} in one thing more? Are you" [...] - he kept lowering his voice as he went on - [...] "are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> yourselves that last indulgence? Are you going to avoid the consequences of your folly by the one infallible and easy path? Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the slip to the sheriff's officers of conscience by the one open door?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put up a mill!" [...] {{said the}} woman, still in scorn. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me back my money; or food that my poor bairns can ate?" ...|$|E
60|$|ANDROCLES. But if <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up our faith, brother, {{why not do}} {{it without}} hurting anybody? Don't fight them. Burn the incense.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} be more fit for matrimony because <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up your profession. Now, Lord Ongar has--heaven knows what--perhaps sixty {{thousand}} a year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good! You say <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up {{public life}} {{for the sake of}} your conscience. I should have no {{criticism}} to make if it stopped there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Edith, come here," [...] Dame Vernon said, [...] "I {{have done}} talking now. And what are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> this brave knight of ours who saved us from drowning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, really, young man," [...] Forsyth said, [...] "we can't let you {{impoverish}} {{yourself at}} this rate. What have {{you said to}} your benefactor, Tata? What are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me my gold piece or not?" [...] demanded Link Merwell, {{and now he}} {{gave the}} newsboy such a twist of the {{shoulder}} that the ragged lad cried out with pain.|$|E
6000|$|... "My son," [...] {{retorted}} Blakeney, [...] "let me {{tell you}} this. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> that message {{up to me and}} I will put five whole livres into your hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{saw your}} young--er--relative in earnest {{conversation}} with friend Monk this morning,' said Marriott, {{later on in}} the day, to Gethryn; 'I thought <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him the tip in that direction?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told the}} President about it, Uncle Jethro; I {{told him how}} sick Cousin Eph had been, and that <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him the {{postmastership}} because he couldn't work any more with his hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} it right enough," [...] ses Joe, {{getting a bit}} closer to me as I stepped outside the gate. [...] "Here’s your fifteen bob; are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me that watch and chain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The trouble about a {{pleasant}} {{time is that}} it comes to an end, and I'll have to pull out to-morrow," [...] he said. [...] "When are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me the photographs you promised, Lawrence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here," [...] {{suddenly}} demanded Prince Zingle, {{standing up}} and shaking the bars of his cage, [...] "are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me anything to eat? Or {{do you expect me}} to live on peanuts forever?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] Duge murmured, [...] "you come {{in touch}} with them. For instance, I should {{like to know what}} advice <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Norris Vine about the {{publication}} of that little document in his paper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There! Get out, get out!' said Mr. Childers, {{thrusting}} {{his young}} {{friend from the}} room, rather in the prairie manner. 'Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff, it don't much signify: it's only tight-rope and slack- rope. <b>You</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me a message for Jupe?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course! Why, I had {{forgotten}} all about it for the moment. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me ten per cent interest or something splendid, aren't you? Well, what about it? You don't {{want to take it}} away with you now, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you haven't!" [...] said Mary {{beginning}} to smooth her ruffled plumes. [...] "Well, I'm sorry I said it; but what explanations are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> of this scene? It must have surprised her very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Nugent gave {{a little}} exclamation of surprise. [...] "First thing I noticed," [...] she said, with commendable gravity. [...] "He's very good-looking and very determined.

6000|$|... "Glinda," [...] said Dorothy, {{when she}} had been greeted by the Sorceress, who was tall and stately, with {{handsome}} and dignified features and dressed in a splendid and becoming gown, [...] "what are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Ozma for a birthday present?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] echoed Captain Good, [...] "what do {{you think}} of them, Mr. Quatermain? I hope that <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> us the {{pleasure}} of your company so far as Solomon's Mines, or wherever the gentleman you knew as Neville may have got to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, very well; if <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> in, we may as {{well all}} eat humble pie 'together,'" [...] and Ned imitated his weak-minded friend, glad of an excuse to claim the {{leadership}} of the little choir who led off the weekly [...] "sing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm mighty glad <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> this, Tom, on Songbird's account," [...] {{announced}} Sam, {{when he and}} {{his brother}} were left to themselves.

6000|$|... "Yes, it's {{all to the}} merry," [...] put in Stanley, who {{had come}} up with Bob. [...] "But tell us privately, William, are you going to depend on a {{straight}} ball and speed, or are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them some curves and fadeaways?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ransom was disappointed; he saw he {{was going}} to be taken away, and, before he could {{suppress}} it, an exclamation burst from his lips--the first exclamation he could think of that would perhaps check his cousin's retreat: [...] "Ah, Miss Olive, are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up Mrs. Farrinder?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{the first}} time, Fischer, I've known you {{to touch a}} drop of {{anything}} before the evening! I'll have a whisky and soda with you. Thank God we're away from that inquisitive crowd for a few minutes! Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me an idea of what's moving?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I {{know that}} you are in love. I hope <b>you</b> are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> over being in love, Johnny, because it is such fun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all I am only {{telling you}} a few plain facts. We {{have every reason to}} believe our boat is somewhere around this camp. If it is I want to know if <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it up peaceably, or if we'll have to send down to town for an officer of the law? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't {{you say a}} word of me, and she won't say nothing, you may be sure. <b>You</b> ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> in <b>to</b> all her cantraps that way, John?' John {{shook his}} head and rubbed the meal about on his forehead. 'It was only just {{something}} for her to say. What have I done that she should object to me?' ...|$|R
