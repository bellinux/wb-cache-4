50|$|Admittance {{parameters}} or Y-parameters (the {{elements of}} an admittance matrix or <b>Y-matrix)</b> are properties {{used in many}} areas of electrical engineering, such as power, electronics, and telecommunications. These parameters are used to describe the electrical behavior of linear electrical networks. They are also used to describe the small-signal (linearized) response of non-linear networks. They are members of a family of similar parameters used in electronic engineering, other examples being: S-parameters, Z-parameters, H-parameters, T-parameters or ABCD-parameters.|$|E
50|$|A Y-parameter matrix {{describes}} the behaviour of any linear electrical network {{that can be}} regarded as a black box with a number of ports. A port in this context is a pair of electrical terminals carrying equal and opposite currents {{into and out of the}} network, and having a particular voltage between them. The <b>Y-matrix</b> gives no information about the behaviour of the network when the currents at any port are not balanced in this way (should this be possible), nor does it give any information about the voltage between terminals not belonging to the same port. Typically, it is intended that each external connection to the network is between the terminals of just one port, so that these limitations are appropriate.|$|E

Doctor of Social Sciences, PhD. Research interests: sociological theory, institutions, economic theory, the theory of institutional matrices, transients in Russian society.

5000|$|X-economies and Y-economies could, {{according}} to Kirdina, borrow certain properties {{from each other}} while keeping their institutional core, although a complete replacement of X-matrix with <b>Y-matrix</b> was not possible (at least for a large country). Rather, changes in the basic institutions were {{likely to result in}} the destruction of the society as a whole. A typical example was the fate of the Roman Empire (Kirdina, 2000, 201-202). Basic to Kirdina's position was a refusal to consider the market economy as superior to non-market ones, and thus she did not consider the transition from non-market to market economies as progress or modernization." [...] To her both systems were of equal merit, and each of them was effective in its appropriate place.|$|E

40|$|The P-matrix is {{commonly}} used to analyse surface acoustic waves (SAW) elements such as the interdigital transducer (IDT) but, when some IDTs are connected through their acoustic ports, their frequency response could be calculated easily {{in terms of their}} admittances. Instead of the P-matrix, <b>Y-matrix</b> also allows coupling of the system to another electric or electronic device. Here, the authors present a general method to obtain the <b>Y-matrix</b> (with size N × N) of a SAW device with N electrical terminals connected to N different voltage sources. This method considers the reflections from the edges or any other non-electrical elements that can cause reflections beyond P-matrices. In addition, {{it has been shown that}} when there are no reflections and there are two P-matrices, this method converges to well-known previous results. Furthermore, the authors present two cases that could be used to analyse a SAW device: the input admittance and the equivalent P-matrix for a SAW device when a <b>Y-matrix</b> is connected to the electrical port of the SAW device. Also, the authors have calculated the acoustic relations for two SAW devices connected through their electric ports. Furthermore, these methods are exemplified through their application to a SAW system composed of three different IDTs and to an IDT and an inductor connected to its electrical port...|$|E

In the coarsening regime, the temporal evolution of the y'-precipitate average radii and the <b>y-matrix</b> supersaturations follow the predictions of classical coarsening models, while the temporal evolution of the y'-precipitate number densities of both alloys do not.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some theoretical-methodological {{bases for}} comparative institutional analysis. First, {{it shows the}} specific approach of the Marxian school to analyzing social and economic institutions. Second, it discusses the most general features of the system paradigm in economic theory (Kornai, 1998 [2002]). Third, it presents institutional matrices theory, or IMT (Кирдина, 2001; Kirdina, 2001, 2010, etc.), which develops a Marxian approach together with systemic ideas. This section describes two basic institutional models, so-called X- and Y-institutional matrices. Fourth, it demonstrates that the economic dominance of <b>Y-matrix</b> countries (like the USA and European countries) since the 1970 s has gradually decreased and that since 2008 the global GDP share of X-matrix countries (like Russia and China, e. g.) has prevailed and continues to grow. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Damping {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} on two-phase (<b>y-matrix,</b> y'-precipitates) nickel-base alloys containing different volume fractions of y ' {{in order to achieve}} {{a better understanding of the}} strong elastic modus de-crease between 1000 °C and 1 100 °C. For the investigation of the damping a free-free beam flexural vibration tech-nique was applied. Nickel-base alloys with a high volume fraction of y', like CMSX- 4, and the intermetallic phase Ni 3 A 1, the near y'-phase, show two different damping peaks between 1000 °C and 1200 "C. The measurements on al-loys with a low volume fraction of the y'-phase and of a near-y matrix material lead to only one damping maximum in this high-temperature range. A comparison of the evaluated damping parameters leads to the assumption that the dif-fusion of nickel and aluminium atoms in the y'-phase most probably is responsible for the relaxation processes in nickel-base alloys such as CMSX- 4. 1...|$|E
40|$|Orthogonal signal {{correction}} (OSC) is {{a technique}} for pre-processing of, for example, NIR-spectra before they are subjected to a multivariate calibration. With OSC the X-matrix is corrected by a subtraction of variation that is orthogonal to the calibration <b>Y-matrix.</b> This correction can then be applied to new spectra {{that are going to}} be used in predictions. The aim of this study is to investigate if the OSC transform makes the spectra less dependent of instrument variation. This may result in easier calibration model transfer between different instruments without creating or re-analysing the whole calibration sample set. OSC was applied to NIR-spectra that were used in a calibration for the water content in a pharmaceutical product. Partial Least Squares calibrations were then compared to other calibration models with uncorrected spectra, models with spectra subjected to multiplicative signal correction, and a number of other transfer methods. The performance of OSC was on the same level as for piece-wise direct standardisation and spectral offset correction for each individual instrument and PLS-models with both instruments included...|$|E
40|$|Anew {{contingency}} {{analysis method}} for contingency selection is proposed in this paper. In the method proposed, a fault is simulated by power injections to adjacent buses on the fault devices in ａ pre-fault system, and by essentially a non-iterative linear calculation to avoid recalculation of a Z-matrix or refactor of a <b>Y-matrix.</b> As more accurate load flow calculation is {{available by the}} method proposed than by the sensitivity approach, more reliable contingency selection is available, even though the computational speed of the method is a little slower {{than that of the}} method using the sensitivity approach. From the IEEE 30 bus example, it is found that the method is satisfactorily applied to the contingency selection from the view of both the accuracy and the computational speed. The error of the method is less than 1 ％ in voltage and less than 1 degree in phase angle for most fault cases of the IEEE 30 bus system. The computational burden is less than 10 ％ of that of P-Q decoupled load now method in most fault case...|$|E
30|$|The content {{stored in}} the {{non-volatile}} memory is used for generating actual addresses which point to soft messages {{stored in the}} volatile memory (RAM). An actual address can easily be determined by adding an offset address to the base address. A decoder retrieves a soft message by accessing the RAM via an actual memory address. The number of addresses required to retrieve all the content of message RAM equals {{to the number of}} 1 -components in the H-matrix. Each 1 -component in H represents a RAM address. All the RAM addresses needed for the decoder to obtain the soft messages are stored in the non-volatile memory. Without optimization, the size of this non-volatile memory is equal to Z × U bits, where Z is the address width (Z ≧ log 2 N) [5], and U is the total number of 1 -components in an H-matrix with code length N. In QC-LDPC block codes, the non-volatile memory for recording the RAM addresses can be replaced by a reduced 2 -D <b>Y-matrix,</b> in which only shift values are stored. With the content of Y and an AGU [5], the original memory space can effectively be reduced. This section shows how an H-matrix of a QC-LDPC code can be compactly stored and how actual addresses can be determined by an AGU.|$|E
40|$|Two circuit model extractors {{for complex}} {{multilayer}} microelectronic packages {{based on the}} Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) technique, namely University of Arizona Effective Package Inductance Calculator (UAEPIC) and University of Arizona Effective Package Inductance and Capacitance Calculator (UAEPIC²), have been developed. The first one, UAEPIC, {{is based on the}} magneto-quasistatic assumption where the displacement current effect on the derivation of the electromagnetic field integral equation is neglected and thus the dominant inductive effects are modeled in order to extract the RL equivalent model. The second one, UAEPIC², uses a more rigorous electromagnetic model that accounts for displacement (yet nonretarded) electromagnetic effects to extract the RLC equivalent model of the given microelectronic package. The development of electrical models of packages of high complexity requires the numerical solution of linear systems of several thousands of equations. This makes the development of a broadband equivalent circuit to include skin effect computationally expensive. To circumvent this difficulty, two model order reduction techniques have been utilized. The method of Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE) has been incorporated in UAEPIC, and the Passive Reduced-order Interconnect Macromodeling Algorithm (PRIMA) has been applied to UAEPIC². Applications of AWE and PRIMA provide orders of magnitude reduction in computation labor and lead to a direct multiport <b>Y-matrix</b> representation in terms of the poles and residues. In this form, and using a special algorithm, the multiport, frequency-dependent equivalent circuit of the package can be incorporated efficiently in a SPICE-like circuit simulator.

40|$|The paper {{justifies the}} {{necessity}} to transit towards the mobilization model "triple helix" (strategic partnership of science and education organizations, business and government, the public). Innovation {{as a product of}} entrepreneurship permeate the system of relations from top to bottom – from more efficient ways of doing home Ho households, and to design mechanisms of state regulation of the economy. However, at the theoretical level, the relationship remains poorly studied in-novations as a function of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship as social phenomenon in the system of institutional relations "business-authorities-society". Modern Russian economy has features of "dual enclave economy" with isolated more productive export-oriented resource sector. Innovative entrepreneurs do not become actors of change because of weak protection of property rights, manipulated state, weak sanctions for rent-seeking. The transition from innovative system "technology push" (fundamental knowledge on demand of state) towards innovation system "market pull" (innovations on demand of business) is complicated within <b>Y-matrix</b> of competitive institutional environment. It {{could turn out to be}} more effective to transit to the mobilization model "triple helix" (strategic partnership of science and education organizations, business and government, the public) in compliance with X-matrix of cooperative institutional environment of redistribution. This will allow to create the necessary mechanisms for the exchange of missing codified knowledge (for those who imitate innovations) and tacit knowledge (for pure innovators) in the cross-sectoral technological chains. The design of institutional change in compliance with real needs of participants of innovative processes requires formal analysis of the region economic development type through assessing its key spheres, revealing and modeling prevailing type of entrepreneurship as well as identifying the relationship between development type and entrepreneurship type within institutional environment...|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} been done for {{establishing}} analytical theory and design method of a chopper circuit that {{is a kind of}} D.

C. amplifiers in regard to every characteristics and the fields utilizing effectively chopper circuits are clarified. The purpose and the summary of this study are described in this chapter. 　In chapter 2, is described the approximate solution of chopper circuits which have larger time constants than chopper 2 ̆ 7 s switching period; general formulas are obtained by using the special characteristics of chopper 2 ̆ 7 s terminal voltage and current, and by using the approximation of circuit impedances. The frequency response and so on are easily obtained by inserting elements of <b>Y-matrix</b> of chopper circuits in to the general formulas. Characteristics of each fundamental circuit are investigated in detail and the most suitable contact ratio of choppers at which the gain of chopper amplifiers changes scarcely is obtained by using the general formulas. The error of the approximate solution is also investigated with experiments. 　In chapter 3, is first described the performance calculation for chopper circuits comprising two choppers at least of which the performance can not be analysed independently. The performance calculation is obtained by using the products of chopper 2 ̆ 7 s characteristic functions and the analytical method used in chapter 2. The performance calculation is available for analysing balanced modulating circuits or chopper amplifiers with negative feedback, and coincides closely with experimental values. The differential type of a wide-band chopper amplifier is described next and is the one which broadens the freqency band width withou tmaking a switchinig frequency higher and by increasing the nurnber of a mechanical chopper. The analysis and the design method of the differential type is also given in this chapter. 　In chapter 4, is described the precice analysis of chopper circuits. The general successive formulas of chopper circuits are obtained by the concept of T transform or modified Laplace transform and give the precice values of chopper 2 ̆ 7 s terminal voltages. Initial values at each switching period is not neccesary for using the successive formulas, so the chopper 2 ̆ 7 s terminal voltages may be easily calculated by the successive formluas. The precice solution coincides with the approximate solution if the time contsants of chopper circuits are sufficiently large. The stability criterion can be obtained by the precice solution. 　In chapter 5, it is described how negative feedback has influence on the characteristics of chopper circuits. It is shown by the theory and the experiment that higher harmonics generated in the demodulating circuits of the conventional chopper amplifiers do not change and higher harmonics of the wide-band chopper amplifiers can be sufficiently decreased by negative feedback. The upper limit of negative feedback is obtained by the precice solution {{for the sake of the}} design of chopper amplifiers with negtive feedback. It is clarified that a circuit which is considered as stable in general may be unstable with specialmechanism of oscillation. The upper limit of negativefeedback of the complex circuits considered as hard to be calculated by the theory, is obtained by the experiment...|$|E
