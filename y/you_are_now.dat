The special is hosted by Alan Resnick as himself, and is presented by Dan Deacon. Both, along with O'Brien, are members of the Baltimore-based art collective Wham City, who co-produced the episode under their video production division, AB Video Solutions.|$|E

25|$|My son! I {{have always}} been a {{careless}} and injudicious mother to you, and I am about to propose a most imprudent step. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> of age, and it's high time you began to think of taking a wife. Several old and hideous princesses who are enormously poor have proposed for your hand, and I think it high time you began to think of making one of them unhappy.|$|E

"Sir, if {{in future}} you indulge the ill-founded {{asperity}} of your Pen, [...] {{may be called}} to answer for your Conduct, {{in a way that}} may cause you to regret that ever you was born, or, at least, that Nature has given you Abilities, which, if guided by Discretion, would have made you as much a Blessing, as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> a Curse to Mankind." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite time {{constraints}} imposed on {{him by the}} expansion of his business, Boulton continued his [...] "philosophical" [...] work (as scientific experimentation was then called). [...] He wrote in his notebooks observations on the freezing and boiling point of mercury, on people's pulse rates at different ages, on {{the movements of the}} planets, and on how to make sealing wax and disappearing ink. [...] However, Erasmus Darwin, another fellow enthusiast who {{became a member of the}} Lunar Society, wrote to him in 1763, [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> become a sober plodding Man of Business, I scarcely dare trouble you to do me a favour in the... philosophical way." ...|$|E

500|$|The show on 6 June 1987 {{was played}} {{close to the}} Berlin Wall. The show was heard by {{thousands}} of East German citizens across the wall and was followed by violent rioting in East Berlin. According to Tobias Ruther, these protests in East Berlin were {{the first in the}} sequence of riots that led to those {{around the time of the}} fall of the wall in November 1989. Although other factors were probably more influential in the fall of the wall, on Bowie's death in 2016, the German Foreign Office tweeted [...] "Good-bye, David Bowie. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> among #Heroes. Thank you for helping to bring down the #wall." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1850, the Ohio Women's Convention met in Salem, Ohio a {{few weeks}} before a state {{convention}} met to revise the Ohio state constitution. The women's convention sent a communication to the constitutional convention requesting that the new constitution secure the same political and legal rights for women that were guaranteed to men. [...] Stone sent a letter praising their initiative and said, “Massachusetts ought to have taken the lead in the work <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> doing, but if she chooses to linger, let her young sisters of the West set her a worthy example; and if the ‘Pilgrim spirit is not dead,’ we’ll pledge Massachusetts to follow her.” ...|$|E
500|$|Isaac {{had been}} given letters of {{introduction}} {{to the director of}} the Paris Conservatoire, Luigi Cherubini, but he needed all his eloquence to persuade Cherubini even to give Jacob an audition. The boy's age and nationality were both obstacles to admission. Cherubini had several years earlier refused the 12-year-old Franz Liszt admission on similar grounds, but he eventually agreed to hear the young Offenbach play. He listened to his playing and stopped him, saying, [...] "Enough, young man, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> a pupil of this Conservatoire." [...] Julius was also admitted. Both brothers adopted French forms of their names, Julius becoming Jules and Jacob becoming Jacques.|$|E

500|$|Live Forever as <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Now</b> with Alan Resnick {{aired on}} December 24, 2013 at 4a.m. on Adult Swim. It {{was the third}} {{in a series of}} {{infomercial}} parodies broadcast by the network, succeeding Broomshakalaka and For-Profit Online University. The early-morning timeslot was chosen since infomercials usually air during such hours. The special was published onto Adult Swim's YouTube channel the same day. The special was viewed by 926,000 viewers and received a Nielsen household rating of 0.7, meaning that approximately 0.7 percent of households with a television watched it. A web chat allowing users to converse with [...] "Teddy" [...] was created for the network's website.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the story}} is told by the songs, with the lyrics {{coordinating}} with the events {{of the story}}. For example, [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] introduces the affair between Greg and Connie, allowing them to flirt in the presence of Fran. It pre-empts the result of their relationship with the line [...] "we will both be sorry"; this is unsung by the characters, but nonetheless emphasise in the episode. The song also speaks to the relationship between Greg and Roger, with Greg singing [...] "don't you want me?" [...] when he fears that he will be fired, and tells of Greg's character with lines including [...] "Don't forget it's me who put you where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> // And I can put you back there too".|$|E
500|$|Davis's {{reputation}} among ex-Confederates {{was restored}} {{by the book}} and by his warm reception on his tour of the region in 1886 and 1887. In numerous stops, he attended Lost Cause ceremonies, where large crowds showered him with affection and local leaders presented emotional speeches honoring his sacrifices to the would-be nation. Such events helped the South {{come to terms with}} its defeat and continued for decades after the war. The Meriden Daily Journal stated that Davis, at a reception held in New Orleans in May 1887, urged southerners to be loyal to the nation. He said, [...] "United <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>now,</b> and if the Union is ever to be broken, let the other side break it." [...] Davis stated that men in the Confederacy had successfully fought for their own rights with inferior numbers during the Civil War and that the northern historians ignored this view. Davis firmly believed that Confederate secession was constitutional. The former Confederate president was optimistic concerning American prosperity and the next generation.|$|E

500|$|Palmer was {{contacted}} by a Chicago businessman interested in starting an sf magazine, {{and took the}} opportunity to resolve his financial problems by forming a new company, Bell Publications, in partnership with the businessman (whose name was never revealed), and starting two magazines: Universe Science Fiction and Science Stories. [...] Universes first issue appeared in June 1953, while Other Worlds was still being published. [...] It was financed by Palmer's partner, and intended as a bimonthly, though in fact the first four issues were on a quarterly schedule. [...] It was edited by Palmer and Mahaffey, who used the collective pseudonym [...] "George Bell" [...] for the first two issues. [...] Science Stories followed in October, also edited by Palmer and Mahaffey as [...] "George Bell", and published by Bell Publications; this was effectively the same magazine as Other Worlds Science Stories, with [...] "Other Worlds" [...] dropped from the title. [...] In the second issue of Science Stories Palmer explained the reason for the new magazine: [...] "For a variety of reasons—and let's be honest, most of them were financial—we had to make a spur-of-the-moment decision to discontinue Other Worlds and replace it with the magazine <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> reading. [...] We phoned the typesetter, halted work on the August OW, and lifted the editorial and stories we needed for Science Stories No. 1 from OW material on hand". Subscribers to Other Worlds were given the option to continue their subscription with whichever of the two magazines they preferred.|$|E
500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>now?</b> You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob." [...] His motto comes from Plutarch, [...] "The deceived is wiser than one not deceived." ...|$|E
