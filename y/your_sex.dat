500|$|In the album's liner notes, Gaye {{explained}} {{his views on}} the themes of sex and love, stating [...] "I can't {{see anything wrong with}} sex between consenting anybodies. I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have <b>your</b> <b>sex,</b> it can be exciting, if you're lucky. I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a September 15, 2013 opinion {{piece in}} the New York Post {{entitled}} [...] "Obamacare will question <b>your</b> <b>sex</b> life", McCaughey wrote: [...] "Are you sexually active? If so, with one partner, multiple partners or same-sex partners?" [...] Be ready {{to answer those questions}} and more the next time you go to the doctor, whether it's the dermatologist or the cardiologist and no matter if the questions are unrelated to why you're seeking medical help. And you can thank the Obama health law. Politifact rated this assertion as [...] "Pants on Fire", and FactCheck.org also called it false.|$|E

2500|$|Hippies {{embraced the}} old slogan of free {{love of the}} radical social reformers of other eras; it was {{accordingly}} observed that [...] "Free love made the whole love, marriage, sex, baby package obsolete. Love was no longer limited to one person, you could love anyone you chose. In fact love was something you shared with everyone, not just <b>your</b> <b>sex</b> partners. Love exists to be shared freely. We also discovered the more you share, the more you get! So why reserve your love for a select few? This profound truth {{was one of the}} great hippie revelations." [...] Sexual experimentation alongside psychedelics also occurred, due to the perception of their being uninhibitors. Others explored the spiritual aspects of sex.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the number}} of {{children}} with intersex conditions referred to Lawson Wilkins' new pediatric endocrinology clinic at Hopkins increased, it was recognized that doctors [...] "couldn't tell by looking" [...] at the external genitalia, and many errors of diagnosis based on outward appearance had led to anomalous sex assignments. Although it seems obvious now that a doctor could not announce to an eight-year-old boy and his parents that [...] "we have just discovered that you are 'really' a girl, with female chromosomes, and ovaries and uterus inside, and we recommend that you change <b>your</b> <b>sex</b> to match your chromosomes and internal organs," [...] a few such events occurred around the world as doctors and parents tried to make use of new information.|$|E
2500|$|Tracy E. Hopkins of Barnes & Noble {{wrote that}} the song [...] "won't wow too many fans with its nursery rhyme-like." [...] Spence D. of IGN was mixed, writing, [...] "The {{obligatory}} star power guest shot occurs with 'Call On Me' featuring Nelly. Janet goes for her delicate wisp, but {{it sounds as if}} she's trying hard to maintain the crispness, straining to keep from cracking. Nelly delivers a slippery grind, making this also the obligatory 'time to get <b>your</b> <b>sex</b> on' number." [...] Don Baiocchi of Blogcritics was mixed, writing that [...] "to kick off a comeback with the mediocre 'Call On Me,' a duet where she actually makes Nelly sing, is just plain wrong. 'Call on Me' wasn't the way to do that." [...] He also noted that [...] "details like the tiny hand claps in 'Call On Me' are bizarre missteps." [...] Evan Serpick of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "it shamelessly re-creates 'Dilemma,' the St. Louis rapper's collaboration with Kelly Rowland." [...] Johnny Loftus of Metro Times was also negative, writing that the song [...] "falls flat." ...|$|E

2500|$|When [...] "I Want Your Sex" [...] {{reached the}} US charts, American Top 40 host Casey Kasem {{refused to say}} the song's title, {{referring}} to it only as [...] "the new single by George Michael." [...] In the US, the song was also sometimes listed as [...] "I Want <b>Your</b> <b>Sex</b> (from Beverly Hills Cop II)", since the song was featured on the soundtrack of the movie. Despite censorship and radio play problems, [...] "I Want Your Sex" [...] reached No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 3 in the UK. The second single, [...] "Faith", was released in October 1987, {{a few weeks before}} the album. [...] "Faith" [...] became one of his most popular songs. The song was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US for four consecutive weeks. It also reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart. The video provided some definitive images of the 1980s music industry in the process—Michael in shades, leather jacket, cowboy boots, and Levi's jeans, playing a guitar near a classic-design jukebox.|$|E
