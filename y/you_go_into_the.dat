[...] Noting that {{the first half of the}} New York Times review of The Birth of a Nation is taken up with the controversy, this person adds, [...] "No matter what Nate Parker makes, ... this will always be the first paragraph."

6000|$|Lord Valleys {{raised his}} eyebrows. [...] "Waste of time," [...] he said. [...] "You'd know {{more at the}} end of it, if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> House at once. You take the matter too seriously." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, no, Basil, be honest; fibbing isn't your forte: I wonder <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{insurance}} business; <b>you</b> {{ought to}} have been a lawyer. <b>Go</b> because <b>you</b> like eating, and are hungry, perhaps, or think you may be so before we get to New York.|$|R
6000|$|... "That'll do," [...] Mr. Parker declared.

60|$|LADY. You didn't want to {{read the}} letters; but you were curious about what was in them.
