2500|$|Honey, the way {{you play}} guitar makes me feel so... makes me feel so...masochistic. The way you go down low deep into the neck... and I would do anything... and I would do anything. And Patty Hearst, you {{standing}} {{there in front of}} the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread. I was wondering: were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women? Or were you really dead? And now that you're on the run, what goes on in your mind? Your sisters they sit by the window. You know, your mama does sit and cry. And your daddyâ€”well, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> daddy said Patty. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> daddy said, Patty? He said... he said... he said.... "Well, sixty days ago she was such a lovely child. Now here she is, with a gun in her hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Dragon-made a face, and growled again three times, 'Hum, hum, hum,' {{and said}} to the third, 'Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> {{wineglass}} shall be?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But now if by my suit you'll not be won, [...] <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> unkindness oft has done,-- [...] I'll e'en forsake the playhouse, {{and turn}} Nun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Freeland; {{about my}} wife and yours and Tryst and the Gaunts, {{and all the rest}} of it! It's a pity, isn't it? This is a small place, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>What's</b> <b>your</b> own feeling?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Groucho: [...] "I {{play golf}} too, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>What</b> is <b>your</b> handicap, Jim?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are both}} insolent and false. But listen to me, {{since you are}} here and I cannot avoid <b>you.</b> I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> threats mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With all {{my heart}} I wish you could, Lady Anna. Nothing makes such heart-burning sorrow as a family quarrel. But what can I say? <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> mother thinks?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh? What? Oh, yes! I {{come from}} Palembang. Ha, ha, ha! <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> father said? He {{said he was}} afraid you were having a very dull time of it here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> rights are, an don't you let Job {{impose on}} {{you in any}} way. I'll be round here after you get through work, an' we'll bunk in somewhere together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! it {{is there}} that I fear for <b>you.</b> I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> {{feelings}} are; but think of his sorrows, and do not be hard on him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Did he underrate the Holt, the wretch, {{or was it}} civility? She spoke {{a little}} severely. 'It is not a {{considerable}} property, but it gives a certain position, and it should {{make a difference to}} <b>you</b> to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> prospects are.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can {{you talk}} about shame, papa?" [...] and she stopped while the waiter creaked in with the paper, and then slowly creaked out again; [...] "how {{can you talk}} about shame? <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> all <b>your</b> friends think about this question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't like it. I call it horrid. It {{was only}} your stepfather's name {{according}} to your account, and I must find you a different one. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> mother's name was--before she married, I mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> dinner will be," [...] said Mrs. Grant, smiling--"the turkey, and I {{assure you}} a very fine one; for, my dear," [...] turning to her husband, [...] "cook insists upon the turkey's being dressed to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't suppose I keep a {{stock of}} {{assorted}} subjects on hand, do you?" [...] said the doctor. [...] "I fear it won't {{be easy to}} get what you want. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> friend intends to do with it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Neither. But {{do not you}} {{remember}} his carrying you into Woolstone-lane? I always believed <b>you</b> did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> little teeth were doing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Lydgate, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> well <b>what</b> <b>your</b> {{advantages}} are. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> {{that our}} young men here cannot cope with you. Where you frequent a house it may militate very much against a girl's making a desirable settlement in life, and prevent her from accepting offers {{even if they are}} made." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] said Lord de la Poer, [...] "do <b>you</b> want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> Uncle Giles is like? you've {{only to look}} at {{yourself}} See, Barbara, {{is it not a}} capital likeness?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has done}} well," [...] he answered, [...] "but your {{education}} {{in other respects}} needs considerable polish. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> unprecedented temerity would have cost you had you failed to kill {{either of the two}} chieftains whose metal you now wear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> father's {{wanting to}} do now?" [...] Mrs. Lapham asked her eldest daughter, who lounged into the parlour a moment with her wrap {{stringing}} from her arm, while the younger went straight to bed. [...] "He wants to invite Mr. Corey's father to a fish dinner at Taft's!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Is it so? Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> words mean? If {{they mean}} anything, they {{mean that you}} had rather not have been christened, because you are now {{expected}} to behave as a christened man should. Now is there any one of you who dare say, [...] "I wish I had not been christened?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm {{sure you}} never could," [...] said Tessa, earnestly. [...] "You {{thought he might}} be Nofri," [...] she added, with a triumphant air of conclusiveness. [...] "But never mind; <b>you</b> couldn't <b>know.</b> <b>What</b> is <b>your</b> name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! hush! {{you would}} not talk so if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> share of the spoils might be. Ay! if you did, sir, your cheek would be paler, and your very teeth would chatter. I knew one man who was {{travelling}} in the forest, just as we are now; it was about this time; and he believed in the Wild Huntsman {{about as much as}} you, that is, he liked to talk of the Spirit, merely to have the opportunity of denying that he believed in him; which showed, as I used to say, that his mind was often thinking of it. He was a merry knave, and as firm a hand for a boar-spear as ever I met with, and I have met many. We used to call him, before the accident, Left-handed Hans, but they call him now, sir, the Child-Hunter. Oh! it is a very awful tale, and I would sooner tell it in blazing hall than in free forest. You did not hear any sound to the left, did you?" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS WARREN [on {{the alert}} at once] Now see here, George: {{what are you}} up to about that girl? I've been {{watching}} your way of looking at her. Remember: I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> and <b>what</b> <b>your</b> looks mean.|$|R
6000|$|HUNT. Half a tick, Badger. You're {{a man of}} parts, you are; you're solid, you're a true-born Englishman; you ain't a Jerry-go-Nimble like him. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> pal the Deacon's {{worth to}} you? Fifty golden Georges and a free pardon. No {{questions}} asked and no receipts demanded. What do you say? Is it a deal? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh I say, Laura, don't put {{on so many}} frills, as Selina says. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> {{sister is}} as well as I do!' They stood {{looking at each other}} a moment and he {{appeared}} to see something in her face which led him to add--'You know, at any rate, how little we hit it off.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Console {{yourself}}, Chebron. I {{know what}} you are feeling now, but do not blame yourself too greatly for this calamity. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> father said--that it was but an accident, and that it was doubtless the will of the great God that your arrow should fly as it did; and he himself declared that he believed that all this was but the result of conspiracy, and that, as we heard in the temple, there were men determined to take his life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Chris Shivers - People ask {{me all the}} time. They say <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>what</b> was <b>your</b> rankest bull? I {{say well}} it's hard to answer because, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> the rankest bull I ever got on was {{probably}} Dillinger, and I was 96 and 1/2 points on him {{and it felt like}} I was going to be about 88 points <b>you</b> <b>know</b> because just so in time and everything just worked the way it was supposed to, but he was a super rank bull.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{too hard}} and unjust," [...] cried Caroline; [...] "it cannot be. I must halve it with the child, as {{if there had been}} no will at all. Robert! <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that is <b>what</b> <b>your</b> brother would have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not, by any chance, proposing," [...] Tavernake said at last, [...] "to discuss {{either of}} these ladies with me? I do not <b>know</b> <b>you</b> or <b>what</b> <b>your</b> {{business}} may be. In any case, I am going now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bellingham {{shook his}} head. [...] "If {{they can show}} profit on the old manufacture, and prove they can make their paint still cheaper and better hereafter, they can have all the money they want. And {{it will be very}} {{difficult}} for you to raise it if you're threatened by them. With that competition, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> plant at Lapham would be worth, and what the shrinkage on your manufactured stock would be. Better sell out to them," [...] he concluded, [...] "if they will buy." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. You {{must make}} it possible. You {{are going to}} make it possible. Sir Robert, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> English {{newspapers}} are like. Suppose that when I leave this house I drive down to some newspaper office, and give them this scandal and the proofs of it! Think of their loathsome joy, of the delight they would have in dragging you down, of the mud and mire they would plunge you in. Think of the hypocrite with his greasy smile penning his leading article, and arranging the foulness of the public placard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{but there}} is a very great doubt of it, ma'am; and you will say so too when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> severe {{son-in-law}} threatens to do." [...] He turned to Mrs. Linley. [...] "After having seen that pretty little friend of mine who has just gone to bed (how much nicer it would be for all of us if we could go to bed too!), I think I know how you answered your husband's letter. But I ought perhaps to see how you have expressed yourself. Have you got a copy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> and I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> joint income would be, and I {{know that}} there would be great {{incompatibility}} between you, as Lord Ballindine, with a wife and family--and fifteen hundred a year, or so. But mind, I'm only telling you what I think you'd better do." ...|$|R
60|$|Nour. 'Tis not {{for nothing}} that we life pursue; It pays our hopes with {{something}} still that's new: Each day's a mistress, unenjoyed before; Like travellers, we're pleased with seeing more. Did <b>you</b> but <b>know</b> <b>what</b> joys <b>your</b> way attend, You would not hurry to your journey's end.|$|R
