25|$|The {{dyeing process}} {{involves}} {{the preparation of}} the yarn {{in order to make it}} susceptible for the proper dyes by immersion in a mordant. Dyestuffs are then added to the <b>yarn</b> <b>which</b> remains in the dyeing solution for a defined time. The dyed yarn is then left to dry, exposed to air and sunlight. Some colours, especially dark brown, require iron mordants, which can damage or fade the fabric. This often results in faster pile wear in areas dyed in dark brown colours, and may create a relief effect in antique oriental carpets.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th-century, there were mills {{spinning}} thread. As of 1920, {{there were two}} factories in Smyrna dyeing <b>yarn,</b> <b>which</b> were owned by British companies. These companies employed over 60,000 people. During this time, {{there was also a}} French owned cotton spinning mill. The city also produced soap made of refuse olive oil. An ironworks, also owned by the British, produced tools and equipment. Those tools were used to extract tannin from valonia oak. As of 1920, the ironwork was exporting 5,000 tons of product a year. The city also produced wooden boxes, which were used for fig and raisin storage. The wood for the boxes was imported from Austria and Romania.|$|E

2500|$|The notion {{implicit}} in questions like this attributed by the rabbis to Koraḥ {{is the same}} as that expressed in Koraḥ's challenge to Moses and Aaron (Numbers 16:3), [...] "The entire congregation is holy, and God is in their midst, so why do you exalt yourselves above God's congregation?" [...] Koraḥ ostensibly subscribed to the laws that were the subject of his questions to Moses, but was really using them to mock and discredit Moses. Therefore, Koraḥ's question about a tallit made entirely of blue <b>yarn,</b> <b>which</b> is ostensibly [...] "more kosher than tzitzit" [...] but is really not, since it still requires tzitzit, became, in Hebrew idiom, an epithet used sarcastically against hypocritical displays of false piety.|$|E
2500|$|A weaver {{who earned}} his {{livelihood}} from commercial weaving, {{as opposed to}} domestic weaving, {{had to have a}} ready supply of yarn and often it was only mill-spun yarn bought in from the mainland of Scotland could give him that supply. The great danger of using machine-spun yarn from a mainland mill was that nobody could guarantee that the <b>yarn</b> <b>which</b> came back had been made from the island wool which had been sent to the mill, or even that the yarn was made from 100% pure virgin wool as was tradition. It was by no means unheard of for unscrupulous spinning mills, particularly in the north of England, to introduce a proportion of re-cycled wool or even cotton [...] "shoddy", to make the new wool go further.|$|E
