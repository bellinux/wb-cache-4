It was the second-longest running No.1 album among the debut albums in Billboard history, behind Men at Work's Business as Usual, which had 15 weeks on top in 1982-83. The album {{exhibited}} massive staying power, remaining on the Billboard 200 for 162 weeks. It also spent a record 46 weeks in the top 10, beating Carole King's record with Tapestry. But the record was later broken by some artists in 1990s—Paula Abdul's Forever <b>Your</b> <b>Girl,</b> Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill and Celine Dion's Falling into You. Houston's debut was the best-selling album of 1986 in the United States and the #1 album of the year on 1986 Billboard year-end charts, making her the first female artist to earn that distinction. She became also the #1 pop artist of the year. The RIAA certified it Diamond on March 16, 1999 and later 15× platinum on July 29, 1999, for shipments of 15,000,000 copies of the album in United States.|$|E

AllMusic's Joe Francis complimented the recording. Singer Sinéad O'Connor recorded [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] on her album Am I Not <b>Your</b> <b>Girl</b> (1992). Her version received mixed response, with Joy Press from Spin who described the rendition as [...] "a melodramatic, sweeping 'Je ne regrette rien'—style apologia. O’Connor had a calling. Obsessed with purity and truth, she pitched herself somewhere between Christ and the Virgin Mary, as an asexual visionary whose suffering was Inextricably Intertwined {{with the pain}} of Ireland and of the world." [...] Released as a CD maxi single, the song reached number 31 in Belgium Flanders and number 44 in Netherlands. A punk rock version was recorded by alternative band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes in 1999 for their second studio album, Are a Drag. Angus Cargill, author of Hang the DJ: An alternative book of music lists {{was shocked by the}} complete revamp of the song as punk rock, saying that [...] "there's a dark appeal in here, like the thought of taking a cattle prod to your grandma's".|$|E

[...] Ben Williams of New York magazine wrote that Timberlake {{had been working on}} his pickup lines, with [...] "You see these shackles baby I'm your slave / I'll let you whip me if I misbehave." [...] Jason Bracelin of the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Timberlake sings about [...] "threatening to steal your girl." [...] Charlie Brooker for The Guardian, in regards to the lyric, [...] "them other fuckers don't know how to act", writing that Timberlake's translation is of him telling everyone in the world that they are a [...] "clueless fornicator".

Barry Schwartz of Stylus noted that the song features [...] "pillow talk", in reference of the song's [...] "sex-crazed lyrics".|$|E
500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and <b>your</b> <b>girl</b> wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below.

500|$|According to Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] {{reference}} a state of romantic obsession. Beyoncé said that the song talks [...] "about how, when you are falling in love, you {{do things that are}} out of character and you do not really care because you are just open." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control." [...] The lyrics are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: [...] "Yes! So crazy right now. Most incredibly, it's <b>your</b> <b>girl,</b> B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been inhaling the chain smokers, how you think I got the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees." [...] She then sings the chorus again and the song fades out with the horns.|$|E
500|$|The {{commercial}} success of Rhythm Nation 1814 was an unexpected achievement for mainstream pop music. Although Jackson was told focusing her album's theme on social consciousness would negatively impact sales, it was [...] "a prediction soon proved wrong when {{the album was}} certified multi-platinum" [...] and subsequently topped the pop, R and dance music charts. In She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul (2003), Lucy O'Brien wrote that contrary to A's fear that the album would underperform, its multi-platinum sales pushed Jackson {{to a level of}} superstardom rivaling her brother Michael, calling it a [...] "personal manifesto" [...] and regarding it as a female counterpart to Marvin Gaye's What's Going On (1971). Timothy E. Scheurer, author of Born in the USA: The Myth of America in Popular Music from Colonial Times to the Present (2007), wrote that the album [...] "may remind some of Sly Stone prior to There's a Riot Going On and other African-American artists of the 1970s in its tacit assumption that the world imagined by Dr. King is still possible, that the American Dream is a dream for all people." [...] It made history as the only album to generate seven top-five hits on the Billboard Hot 100, surpassing Michael Jackson's Thriller (1982) and Bruce Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. (1984), each having seven top ten hits. It is also the only album to achieve number one hits in three separate calendar years, with [...] "Miss You Much" [...] in 1989, [...] "Escapade" [...] and [...] "Black Cat" [...] in 1990, and [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] in 1991.

500|$|Timbaland {{began his}} {{producing}} career for R acts. In the mid-1990s, {{he produced a}} few songs for R acts such as Jodeci and Sista. In 1996, he made his mainstream breakthrough by producing the majority of both Aaliyah's second album One in a Million and Ginuwine's debut album Ginuwine...the Bachelor. This included the major hit singles [...] "If <b>Your</b> <b>Girl</b> Only Knew" [...] by Aaliyah and [...] "Pony" [...] by Ginuwine. While Timbaland was initially producing for R artists, his trademark sound was very much rooted in hip-hop with its fast-paced nature and clear drum breaks. He was taking a hip-hop sound and applying it to R, {{and in this way}} his sound was instrumental in blurring the distinction between hip-hop and R production. In 1997, he fully produced Supa Dupa Fly, the debut album of Missy Elliott, who had been a childhood friend of Mosley. In this album Timbaland continued with his now trademark electronic production style, but since Missy frequently rapped the music was considered hip-hop. Also in 1997, he released his first album with his partner Magoo, Welcome to Our World, also a hip-hop album. In the late 1990s, his hip-hop production sound would become very influential and common as he produced for many high-profile hip-hop artists including Jay-Z, Nas, and The LOX. In 1999, he scored a major hit with Jay Z and rap group UGK with the hit [...] "Big Pimpin'". He also fully produced Missy's second album in 1999, Da Real World. Still Timbaland in this period produced primarily for R artists. He continued to produce for Ginuwine and Aaliyah, as well as contributing significantly to albums by Xscape, Nicole, Playa, and Total. He remixed Usher's major hit [...] "You Make Me Wanna". In the early 2000s Timbaland produced songs including Ludacris' [...] "Roll Out (My Business)", Jay-Z's [...] "Hola' Hovito", Petey Pablo's [...] "Raise Up", and Beck's cover of David Bowie's [...] "Diamond Dogs" [...] during this period. He also contributed three songs, all eventually released as singles, to Aaliyah’s self-titled third album, the exotic lead single [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] (featuring himself rapping a verse), [...] "More than a Woman", and the ballad [...] "I Care 4 U". He also makes an appearance in Aaliyah's single [...] "Try Again", which he also produced and co-wrote.|$|E

[...] Cantwell knows he is dying and faces death [...] "with the dignity which he {{believes}} he has maintained throughout his military service." [...] Oliver thinks the two male characters, Cantwell and Alvarito, have an unstated understanding – both men love Renata, but Cantwell accepts and is happy to know Renata will almost certainly marry Alvarito. Within hours of dying he says to himself: [...] "You have said goodbye to <b>your</b> <b>girl</b> and she has said goodbye to you. That is certainly simple". The theme of death is central in Hemingway's writings and his characters routinely achieve redemption at the moment of death, which can be seen as a form of existentialism.
