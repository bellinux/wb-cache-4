2500|$|Pause and probe is {{the skill}} of the {{moderator}} to give each participant a chance to jump in. As a general rule, a moderator should pause {{for at least five}} seconds after a participant talks or before beginning to talk. Probes, such as [...] "would <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> further?" [...] or [...] "Would you give me an example?" [...] help to give additional information. Being prepared for the unexpected is one of the abilities of the focus group leaders in order for the efficient functioning of the groups. Some examples of unexpected events are no one showing up (make sure you bring list and phone numbers), only a few showing up (hold group anyway), meeting place is inadequate for the members to reach, the group members get too involved and don't want to leave (have formal ending), bad or hazardous weather (call everyone and cancel). Organization Skills helps focus group leaders to plan the theme for group discussions and also develop a printed outline for the meetings. There may be more productive discussions when every member of the focus group has a copy of the printed agenda before starting the discussion. This allows the member to have some time to review the topics and focus on key relevant issues. The leader should use the counseling skills in order for the discussion to take place effectively.|$|E

5000|$|In December 2016, Morgan was disinvited from {{a meeting}} about Brexit at Number 10 after she {{expressed}} concerns over Prime Minister Theresa May's £1,000 leather trousers. Following the falling-out, she withdrew from a scheduled appearance on Have I Got News For <b>You,</b> <b>explaining</b> <b>that</b> {{she wished to}} [...] "keep a low profile".

You feel like a disembodied spirit, immaterial; and {{you seem to be}} able to touch beauty as though it were a palpable thing; and you feel an intimate communion with the breeze, and with the trees breaking into leaf, and with the iridescence of the river. You feel like God. Can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Tom Sawyer, {{what kind}} of a lie are you fixing YOUR mouth to contribit to this mess of rubbage? Speak out--and I warn you before you begin, that I don't believe a word of it.

As I veiled my face {{and stood in the}} dark end of the shop, I heard <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> you wanted a musical {{instrument}} for a bedridden girl. Your voice and manner were so softened, you showed such interest in its selection, you took it away yourself with so much tenderness of care and pleasure, that I knew you were a man with a most gentle heart. Oh, Mr. Jackson, Mr. Jackson, if you could have felt the refreshing rain of tears that followed for me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my lord, he is dead. I {{understood}} you to {{say that}} you had already heard it; and, unless my ears deceived me, <b>you</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> his demise was the immediate cause of your present visit.

[...] Then {{he stopped}} suddenly, and I heard a little whimper in the dark, {{and knew that}} Vixen had found me at last. She knew as well as I did {{that if there is}} one thing in the world the {{elephant}} is more afraid of than another it is a little barking dog. So she stopped to bully Two Tails in his pickets, and yapped round his big feet. Two Tails shuffled and squeaked. [...] "Go away, little dog!" [...] he said.

"DEAR MIDGETINA,--It's {{a strange}} fact, but while, {{to judge from}} [...] your letter, {{you seem to be}} growing smaller, I (in spite of Miss [...] Stebbings's water porridge) am growing fatter.

I never do, lest I should {{remember}} the answers. Anyhow, I [...] shall not write again. But if, by any chance, Mr Crimble should [...] make another call, will <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> my chief motive in not [...] singing at the concert was because I should have been a second [...] mezzo-soprano.

He looks about him; the flies on the ceiling strike him as being extremely comic. How do they manage to walk upside down? They have suckers on their feet, says Sister Agatha, and wonders if her natural history is quite sound. Suckers on their feet--ha, ha! What an uproarious notion! Suckers on their feet--that's good, that's damned good! You can say charming, pathetic, positively tender things about the irrelevant mirth of convalescents the more so in this particular case, where the mirth is expressed by a young man who is to be taken back to jail as soon as he can stand firmly on his legs.

6000|$|I got out {{at several}} stations, {{and looked at}} all the carriages. I could not see my little men. From that day to this I have never set eyes on them. That is all my story. Who were they?

How came they to have passed {{out of the hands of}} a refined lady (as she evidently was, with whom I first saw them) into the charge of quite a common woman like her with whom I saw one of the boys at Venice? Here is but one chapter of the story. Can any man write the next, or that preceding the strange one on which I happened to light? Who knows? the mystery may have some quite simple solution. I saw two children, attired like little princes, taken from their mother and consigned to other care; and a fortnight afterwards, one of them barefooted and like a beggar.

5000|$|Doña Juanita (diminutive of Juana) {{is a name}} {{used for}} the average Chilean, and {{specially}} the older women from the countryside (in the manner of Britishman John Bull).

5000|$|Washington Post media writer Howard Kurtz {{has written}} that the {{connection}} between the two Chicagoans was [...] "all but ignored by the news media, other than Fox" [...] until it was raised in a primary debate.

[...] Obama responded: This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who's a professor of English in Chicago who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from. He's not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis. And the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was eight years old, somehow reflects on me and my values doesn't make much sense, George.|$|E
5000|$|A second {{commercial}} {{aired in}} September 1988; the voice-over narration began with: [...] "How {{can you explain}} it?

How can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> various {{people around the world}} - who had never met before - had encounters with beings from outer space and their descriptions of the creature match almost exactly (sketch art of grey aliens appear on screen during this narration)? That's why Time Life books presents a remarkable new series, Mysteries of the Unknown, which takes a clear and comprehensive look at our own untapped capabilities. Maybe no one can explain these things but they can no longer be ignored. How can you explain this? Four men enter a ring of trees and without warning one is grabbed by an unseen force, lifted five feet in the air, and suspended for thirty seconds."

5000|$|The {{combination}} {{of being an}} actor and a parent proved to be frustrating at times for von Furstenberg, who believed that the two roles sometimes blended together in daily life and posed special challenges both in and outside the home. In 1972, six years after her divorce from Guy Vincent, she expressed her views on the subject in a personal essay titled [...] "Actors Are Not the Only Ones Who Act", {{which was published in}} The New York Times on September 24, 1972. [...] In one portion of her essay she shares the following: ...I have gotten my way by 'acting' in some very significant moments in my life when perhaps {{in the long run it}} would have been better if I hadn't gotten my way...One of the most frustrating drawbacks of being an actor‐parent is to have your children accuse you of acting when you're being perfectly sincere. Of course, they've seen you being 'perfectly sincere' on stage so for the poor things I guess the better you are the more confusing it is for them (and how do <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> both are real and yet not the same?). Ultimately your actions must bear out the truth of what you say to them. After a prolonged period of being single, von Furstenberg finally married for the second time in 1984, then to New York real-estate broker John J. Reynolds. They remained together until his death in 1994. [...] She lived another twenty-one years. On April 21, 2015, von Furstenberg died at her home in Manhattan at the age of 83 from complications attributed to Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
