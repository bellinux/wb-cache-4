25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>either</b> do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E

500|$|Patricia Lee Smith {{was born}} in Chicago. Her mother, Beverly (Williams), was a waitress, and her father, Grant, worked at the Honeywell plant. The family was of Irish ancestry. She spent her early {{childhood}} in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, before her family moved to Pitman, New Jersey and later to The Woodbury Gardens section of Deptford Township, New Jersey. Her mother was a Jehovah's Witness. Patti had a strong religious upbringing and a Bible education, but left organized religion as a teenager because she felt it was too confining; much later, she wrote the line [...] "Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine" [...] in her cover version of Them's [...] "Gloria" [...] {{in response to this}} experience. She has described having an avid interest in Tibetan Buddhism around the age of eleven or twelve, saying [...] "I fell in love with Tibet because their essential mission was to keep a continual stream of prayer," [...] but that as an adult she sees clear parallels between different forms of religion, and has {{come to the conclusion that}} religious dogmas are [...] "...man-made laws that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>either</b> decide to abide by or not." [...] At this early age Smith was exposed to her first records, including Shrimp Boats by Harry Belafonte, Patience and Prudence doing The Money Tree, and Another Side of Bob Dylan, which her mother gave to her. Smith graduated from Deptford Township High School in 1964 and went to work in a factory. She gave birth to her first child, a daughter, on April 26, 1967, and chose to place her for adoption.|$|E

2500|$|In a video titled [...] "Global Warming Unmasked: The Hidden Agenda", Voris {{claimed that}} [...] "Catholic leaders must {{recognize}} global warming {{for what it}} is. It is a government power grab via population reduction. It is a pseudoscience and hyper-sensationalism. These things {{are being used to}} promote the global warming agenda, just {{as they were in the}} early 20th century eugenics movement... In fact, global warming is the evolution, the natural evolution, of that early eugenics program." [...] Voris said, [...] "Hitler adopted the American eugenic ideals and implemented them throughout his Nazi regime. Hitler did not originate the idea of eugenics and creating a superior Aryan race. It was indeed an American concept. He saw this happening in America, and went 'Ah-ha' and grabbed it and incorporated it into his whole Nazi philosophy." [...] Voris held that governments accepting the concept of global warming might limit availability of energy, cutting off those who [...] "exceed what Washington says is your limit [...] <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>either</b> be charged an exorbitant fine or perhaps have your energy supply limited or even cut off. ...If you think the government interfering in private lives to this extent based on junk science and the hysteria surrounding it just isn't possible... think back to the tens of thousands of citizens who were sterilized against their will by the government in state after state after state. ...And remember the only thing that brought the eugenics movement to an end was the horror of the Nazi death camps. If that had not happened, sterilization would just be a normal thing. It was so revolting that finally people said, 'this whole theory is wrong.' Government leaders were quite happy to just roll along exercising power without limit over their citizens." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times {{gave the}} film 4 out of 4 stars, stating that it is, [...] "a breathless, {{exciting}} story, heartbreaking and exhilarating." [...] Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern refers to Slumdog Millionaire as, [...] "the film world's first globalised masterpiece." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post argues that, [...] "this modern-day 'rags-to-rajah' fable won the audience award at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this year, and it's {{easy to see}} why. With its timely setting of a swiftly globalising India and, more specifically, the country's {{own version of the}} 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' TV show, combined with timeless melodrama and a hardworking orphan who withstands all manner of setbacks, 'Slumdog Millionaire' plays like Charles Dickens for the 21stcentury." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times describes the film as [...] "a Hollywood-style romantic melodrama that delivers major studio satisfactions in an ultra-modern way" [...] and [...] "a story of star-crossed romance that the original Warner brothers would have embraced, shamelessly pulling out stops that you wouldn't think anyone would have the nerve to attempt any more." [...] Anthony Lane of the New Yorker stated, [...] "There is a mismatch here. Boyle and his team, headed by the director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle, clearly believe that a city like Mumbai, with its shifting skyline and a population of more than fifteen million, is as ripe for storytelling as Dickens's London [...] At the same time, the story they chose is sheer fantasy, not in its glancing details but in its emotional momentum. How else could Boyle get away with assembling his cast for a Bollywood dance number, at a railroad station, over the closing credits? <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>either</b> chide the film, at this point, for relinquishing any claim to realism or you can go with the flow—surely the wiser choice." [...] Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent was also full of praise, saying the film [...] "successfully mixes hard-hitting drama with uplifting action and the Who Wants To Be a Millionaire show is an ideal device to revolve events around". Several other reviewers have described Slumdog Millionaire as a Bollywood-style [...] "masala" [...] movie, due to the way the film combines [...] "familiar raw ingredients into a feverish masala" [...] and culminates in [...] "the romantic leads finding each other." ...|$|E
