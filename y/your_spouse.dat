25|$|In some jurisdictions an extramarital affair may incur {{unexpected}} financial costs. In Australia, for example, {{affairs of}} two or more years duration can be deemed a de facto relationship, exposing the married cheater to financial claims in the Family Court on their superannuation savings, income and property. A de facto relationship may exist even when the partners do not think so. It is the Court that will define when it began and ended, based on the evidence.

The characters lie to each other and the reader about affairs and disappearances. Amy fabricates a fake diary to implicate her husband for her disappearance and murder. Flynn says that, in writing the book, she wanted to examine how people within a marriage lie to each other: [...] "marriage is sort of like a long con, because you put on display your very best self during courtship, {{yet at the same time}} the person you marry is supposed to love you warts and all. But <b>your</b> <b>spouse</b> never sees those warts really until you get deeper into the marriage and let yourself unwind a bit." ...|$|E

Ken Tucker's review shortly after the show's debut awarded it a B+; he stated the show's writing wasn't [...] "top-notch", but [...] "Romano manages to {{communicate}} something distinctive." [...] A 1997 review by Bruce Fretts, which gave the show the same score, said that the show [...] "may now be the best sitcom on the air." [...] Common Sense Media's Betsy Wallace, who awarded the show {{four out of five}} stars, wrote: [...] "the cast is stellar and plotlines shed light on universal human insecurities, such as doubting that <b>your</b> <b>spouse</b> still finds you attractive as you grow older." [...] However, she warned that the show's [...] "intimacy issues of married couples -- including (in)frequency of sex -- often take center stage," [...] as well as the show's mild language. Plugged In said in their review, [...] "Seven years and a mantle full of Emmys later, Raymond is still smartly scripted, now with new characters added to a maturing, expanding family." [...] In 2013, Complex ranked the show as 49th of [...] "The 50 Funniest TV Comedies of All Time", with writer Matt Barone saying that [...] "You'd want to pat Ray on the shoulder and say, 'We feel for you, man,' if you weren't laughing so hard."

60|$|I {{am quite}} alone and never see strangers without being sick, but I am {{nevertheless}} {{on good terms}} with my neighbours, for I neither ride or shoot or move over my Garden walls, but I fence and box and swim and run a good deal to keep me in exercise and get me to sleep.

From Bristol he carried me to Gloucester, which was merely a journey of pleasure, to take the air; and here it was our hap to have no lodging in the inn but in one large chamber with two beds in it. The master of the house going up with us to show his rooms, and coming into that room, said very frankly to him, 'Sir, it is {{none of my business}} to inquire whether the lady be <b>your</b> <b>spouse</b> or no, but if not, you may lie as honestly in these two beds as if you were in two chambers,' and with that he pulls a great curtain which drew quite across the room and effectually divided the beds. 'Well,' says my friend, very readily, 'these beds will do, and as for the rest, we are too near akin to lie together, though we may lodge near one another'; and this put an honest face on the thing too. When we came to go to bed, he decently went out of the room till I was in bed, and then went to bed in the bed on his own side of the room, but lay there talking to me a great while.|$|E
50|$|Prenuptial {{agreements}} are, at best, {{a partial}} solution to obviating {{some of the}} risks of marital property disputes in times of divorce. They protect minimal assets and are not the final word. Nevertheless, {{they can be very}} powerful and limit parties' property rights and alimony. It may be impossible to set aside a properly drafted and executed prenup. A prenup can dictate not only what happens if the parties divorce, but also what happens when they die. They can act as a contract to make a will and/or eliminate all your rights to property, probate homestead, probate allowance, right to take as a predetermined heir, and the right to act as an executor and administrator of <b>your</b> <b>spouse's</b> estate.|$|R

6000|$|The king, when he {{the happy}} change had seen, Trusted {{the ear of}} Constance, his fair queen, With Lisa's {{innocent}} secret, and conferred How they should jointly, by their deed and word, Honor this maiden's love, which, like the prayer Of loyal hermits, never thought to share In what it gave. The queen had that chief grace Of womanhood, a heart that can embrace All goodness in another woman's form; And that same day, ere the sun lay too warm On southern terraces, a messenger Informed Bernardo that the royal pair Would straightway visit him, and celebrate Their gladness at his daughter's happier state, Which they were fain to see. Soon came the king On horseback, with his barons, heralding The advent of the queen in courtly state; And all, descending at the garden gate, Streamed with their feathers, velvet, and brocade, Through the pleached alleys, till they, pausing, made A lake of splendor 'mid the aloes gray; When, meekly facing all their proud array, The white-robed Lisa with her parents stood, As some white dove before the gorgeous brood Of dapple-breasted birds born by the Colchian flood. The king and queen, by gracious looks and speech, Encourage her, and thus their courtiers teach How, this fair morning, they may courtliest be, By making Lisa pass it happily. And soon the ladies and the barons all Draw her by turns, as at a festival Made for her sake, to easy, gay discourse, And compliment with looks and smiles enforce; A joyous hum is heard the gardens round; Soon there is Spanish dancing, and the sound Of minstrel's song, and autumn fruits are pluckt; Till mindfully {{the king and queen}} conduct Lisa apart to where a trellised shade Made pleasant resting. Then King Pedro said,-- [...] "Excellent maiden, that rich gift of love Your heart hath made us hath a worth above All royal treasures, nor is fitly met Save when the grateful memory of deep debt Lies still behind the outward honors done: And as a sign that no oblivion Shall overflood that faithful memory, We while we live your cavalier will be; Nor will we ever arm ourselves for fight, Whether for struggle dire, or brief delight Of warlike feigning, but we first will take The colors you ordain, and for your sake Charge the more bravely where your emblem is: Nor will we claim from you an added bliss To our sweet thoughts of you save one sole kiss. But there still rests the outward honor meet To mark your worthiness; and we entreat That you will turn your ear to proffered vows Of one who loves you, and would be <b>your</b> <b>spouse</b> We must not wrong yourself and Sicily By letting all your blooming years pass by Unmated: you will give the world its due From beauteous maiden, and become a matron true." ...|$|E

[...] 45 [...] Full many a saint, since first the world began, [...] Lived an unspotted maid, in spite of man: [...] Let such (a God's name) with fine wheat be fed, [...] And let us honest wives eat barley bread. [...] For me, I'll keep the post assigned by heav'n, [...] 50 [...] And use the copious talent it has giv'n: [...] Let my good spouse pay tribute, do me right, [...] And keep an equal reck'ning ev'ry night: [...] His proper body is not his, but mine; [...] For so said Paul, and Paul's a sound divine.[4] [...] 55 [...] Know then, of those five husbands I have had, [...] Three were just tolerable, two were bad.[5] [...] The three were old, but rich and fond beside, [...] And toiled most piteously to please their bride: [...] But since their wealth, the best they had, was mine, [...] 60 [...] The rest, without much loss, I could resign. [...] Sure to be loved, I took no pains to please,[6] [...] Yet had more pleasure far than they had ease. [...] Presents flowed in apace: with show'rs of gold, [...] They made their court, like Jupiter of old. [...] 65 [...] If I but smiled, a sudden youth they found, [...] And a new palsy seized them when I frowned. [...] Ye sov'reign wives! give ear, and understand, [...] Thus shall ye speak, and exercise command.[7] [...] For never was it giv'n to mortal man, [...] 70 [...] To lie so boldly as we women can: [...] Forswear the fact, though seen with both his eyes, [...] And call your maids to witness how he lies. [...] Hark, old Sir Paul, 'twas thus I us'd to say, [...] Whence is our neighbour's wife so rich and gay? [...] 75 [...] Treated, caressed, where'er she's pleased to roam-- [...] I sit in tatters, and immured at home. [...] Why to her house dost thou so oft repair? [...] Art thou so am'rous? and is she so fair? [...] If I but see a cousin or a friend, [...] 80 [...] Lord! how you swell, and rage like any fiend! [...] But you reel home, a drunken beastly bear, [...] Then preach till midnight in your easy chair; [...] Cry, wives are false, and ev'ry woman evil, [...] And give up all that's female to the devil. [...] 85 [...] If poor, you say she drains her husband's purse; [...] If rich, she keeps her priest, or something worse; [...] If highly born, intolerably vain, [...] Vapours and pride by turns possess her brain, [...] Now gayly mad, now sourly splenetic, [...] 90 [...] Freakish when well, and fretful when she's sick. [...] If fair, then chaste she cannot long abide, [...] By pressing youth attacked on ev'ry side: [...] If foul, her wealth the lusty lover lures, [...] Or else her wit some fool-gallant procures, [...] 95 [...] Or else she dances with becoming grace, [...] Or shape excuses the defects of face. [...] There swims no goose so grey, but soon or late, [...] She finds some honest gander for her mate. [...] Horses, thou say'st, and asses men may try, [...] 100 [...] And ring suspected vessels ere they buy: [...] But wives, a random choice, untried they take, [...] They dream in courtship, but in wedlock wake; [...] Then, nor till then, the veil's removed away, [...] And all the woman glares in open day. [...] 105 [...] You tell me, to preserve your wife's good grace, [...] Your eyes must always languish on my face, [...] Your tongue with constant flatt'ries feed my ear, [...] And tag each sentence with, My life! my dear! [...] If, by strange chance, a modest blush be raised, [...] 110 [...] Be sure my fine complexion must be praised. [...] My garments always must be new and gay, [...] And feasts still kept upon my wedding-day. [...] Then must my nurse be pleased, and fav'rite maid: [...] And endless treats, and endless visits paid, [...] 115 [...] To a long train of kindred, friends, allies; [...] All this thou say'st, and all thou say'st, are lies. [...] On Jenkin too you cast a squinting eye: [...] What! can your 'prentice raise your jealousy? [...] Fresh are his ruddy cheeks, his forehead fair; [...] 120 [...] And like the burnished gold his curling hair. [...] But clear thy wrinkled brow, and quit thy sorrow, [...] I'd scorn your 'prentice, should you die to-morrow. [...] Why are thy chests all locked? on what design? [...] Are not thy worldly goods and treasures mine? [...] 125 [...] Sir, I'm no fool; nor shall you, by St. John, [...] Have goods and body to yourself alone. [...] One you shall quit, in spite of both your eyes; [...] I heed not, I, the bolts, the locks, the spies. [...] If you had wit, you'd say, [...] "Go where you will, [...] 130 [...] Dear spouse, I credit not the tales they tell; [...] Take all the freedoms of a married life; [...] I know thee for a virtuous, faithful wife." [...] Lord! when you have enough, what need you care [...] How merrily soever others fare? [...] 135 [...] Though all the day I give and take delight, [...] Doubt not, sufficient will be left at night. [...] 'Tis but a just and rational desire, [...] To light a taper at a neighbour's fire. [...] There's danger too, you think, in rich array, [...] 140 [...] And none can long be modest that are gay: [...] The cat, if you but singe her tabby skin, [...] The chimney keeps, and sits content within; [...] But once grown sleek, will from her corner run, [...] Sport with her tail, and wanton in the sun; [...] 145 [...] She licks her fair round face, and frisks abroad, [...] To show her fur, and to be catterwawed.[8] [...] Lo thus, my friends, I wrought to my desires [...] These three right ancient venerable sires. [...] I told 'em, Thus you say, and thus you do, [...] 150 [...] And told 'em false, but Jenkin swore 'twas true. [...] I, like a dog, could bite as well as whine, [...] And first complained, whene'er the guilt was mine.[9] [...] I taxed them oft with wenching and amours, [...] When their weak legs scarce dragged 'em out of doors; [...] 155 [...] And swore the rambles that I took by night, [...] Were all to spy what damsels they bedight. [...] That colour brought me many hours of mirth;[10] [...] For all this wit is given us from our birth; [...] Heav'n gave to woman the peculiar grace, [...] 160 [...] To spin, to weep, and cully human race. [...] By this nice conduct, and this prudent course, [...] By murm'ring, wheedling, stratagem, and force, [...] I still prevailed, and would be in the right, [...] Or curtain lectures made a restless night. [...] 165 [...] If once my husband's arm was o'er my side, [...] What! so familiar with <b>your</b> <b>spouse?</b> I cried: [...] I levied first a tax upon his need: [...] Then let him--'twas a nicety indeed! [...] Let all mankind this certain maxim hold, [...] 170 [...] Marry who will, our sex is to be sold. [...] With empty hands no tassels you can lure,[11] [...] But fulsome love for gain we can endure; [...] For gold we love the impotent and old, [...] And heave, and pant, and kiss, and cling, for gold. [...] 175 [...] Yet with embraces, curses oft I've mixed, [...] Then kissed again, and chid, and railed betwixt. [...] Well, I may make my will in peace, and die, [...] For not one word in man's arrears am I. [...] To drop a dear dispute I was unable, [...] 180 [...] Ev'n though the Pope himself had sat at table.[12] [...] But when my point was gained, then thus I spoke, [...] "Billy, my dear, how sheepishly you look? [...] Approach, my spouse, and let me kiss thy cheek; [...] Thou should'st be always thus resigned and meek! [...] 185 [...] Of Job's great patience since so oft you preach, [...] Well should you practise, who so well can teach. [...] 'Tis difficult to do, I must allow, [...] But I, my dearest, will instruct you how. [...] Great is the blessing of a prudent wife, [...] 190 [...] Who puts a period to domestic strife. [...] One of us two must rule, and one obey; [...] } [...] And since in man right reason bears the sway, [...] } [...] Let that frail thing, weak woman, have her way. } [...] The wives of all my family have ruled [...] 195 [...] Their tender husbands, and their passions cooled. [...] Fye, 'tis unmanly thus to sigh and groan; [...] What! would you have me to yourself alone? [...] Why take me, love! take all and ev'ry part! [...] Here's your revenge! you love it at your heart. [...] 200 [...] Would I vouchsafe to sell what nature gave, [...] You little think what custom I could have. [...] But see! I'm all your own--nay hold--for shame! [...] What means my dear--indeed--you are to blame." [...] Thus with my first three lords I passed my life; [...] 205 [...] A very woman, and a very wife. [...] What sums from these old spouses I could raise, [...] Procured young husbands in my riper days. [...] Though past my bloom,[13] not yet decayed was I, [...] Wanton and wild, and chattered like a pye. [...] 210 [...] In country dances still I bore the bell. [...] And sung as sweet as ev'ning Philomel. [...] To clear my quail-pipe, and refresh my soul, [...] Full oft I drained the spicy nut-brown bowl; [...] Rich luscious wines, that youthful blood improve, [...] 215 [...] And warm the swelling veins to feats of love: [...] For 'tis as sure as cold ingenders hail, [...] A liqu'rish mouth must have a lech'rous tail; [...] Wine lets no lover unrewarded go, [...] As all true gamesters by experience know. [...] 220 [...] But oh, good gods! whene'er a thought I cast [...] On all the joys of youth and beauty past, [...] To find in pleasures I have had my part, [...] Still warms me to the bottom of my heart. [...] This wicked world was once my dear delight; [...] 225 [...] Now all my conquests, all my charms, good night! [...] The flour consumed, the best that now I can, [...] Is e'en to make my market of the bran.[14] [...] My fourth dear spouse was not exceeding true! [...] He kept, 'twas thought, a private miss or two: [...] 230 [...] But all that score I paid--as how? you'll say, [...] Not with my body, in a filthy way: [...] But I so dressed, and danced, and drank, and dined; [...] And viewed a friend, with eyes so very kind, [...] As stung his heart, and made his marrow fry,[15] [...] 235 [...] With burning rage, and frantic jealousy. [...] His soul, I hope, enjoys eternal glory, [...] For here on earth I was his purgatory. [...] Oft, when his shoe the most severely wrung, [...] He put on careless airs, and sat and sung. [...] 240 [...] How sore I galled him, only heav'n could know, [...] And he that felt, and I that caused the woe. [...] He died, when last from pilgrimage I came, [...] With other gossips, from Jerusalem;[16] [...] And now lies buried underneath a rood,[17] [...] 245 [...] Fair to be seen, and reared of honest wood. [...] A tomb indeed, with fewer sculptures graced, [...] Than that Mausolus' pious widow placed,[18] [...] Or where inshrined the great Darius lay; [...] But cost on graves is merely thrown away. [...] 250 [...] The pit filled up, with turf we covered o'er; [...] So bless the good man's soul, I say no more. [...] Now for my fifth loved lord, the last and best; [...] (Kind heav'n afford him everlasting rest) [...] Full hearty was his love, and I can shew [...] 255 [...] The tokens on my ribs in black and blue; [...] Yet, with a knack, my heart he could have won, [...] While yet the smart was shooting in the bone. [...] How quaint an appetite in woman reigns! [...] Free gifts we scorn, and love what costs us pains: [...] 260 [...] Let men avoid us, and on them we leap; [...] A glutted market makes provision cheap.[19] [...] In pure good will I took this jovial spark, [...] Of Oxford he, a most egregious clerk. [...] He boarded with a widow in the town,[20] [...] 265 [...] A trusty gossip, one dame Alison. [...] Full well the secrets of my soul she knew, [...] Better than e'er our parish priest could do. [...] To her I told whatever could befall: [...] Had but my husband pissed against a wall, [...] 270 [...] Or done a thing that might have cost his life, [...] She, and my niece, and one more worthy wife, [...] Had known it all: what most he would conceal, [...] To these I made no scruple to reveal.
