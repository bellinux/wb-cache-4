40|$|Scope. Due to the {{imminent}} {{growth of the}} world population, shortage of protein sources for human consumption will arise in the near future. Alternative and sustainable protein sources (e. g. insects) are being explored {{for the production of}} food and feed. In this project, the safety of <b>Yellow</b> <b>mealworms</b> (Tenebrio molitor L.) for human consumption was tested using approaches as advised by the European Food Safety Authority for allergenicity risk assessment. Methods and results. Different <b>Yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> protein fractions were prepared, characterised, and tested for cross-reactivity using sera from patients with an inhalation or food allergy to biologically related species (House dust mite (HDM) and crustaceans) by immunoblotting and basophil activation. Furthermore, the stability was investigated using an in vitro pepsin digestion test. IgE from HDM- and crustacean allergic patients cross-reacted with <b>Yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> proteins. This cross-reactivity was functional, as shown by the induction of basophil activation. The major cross-reactive proteins were identified as tropomyosin and arginine kinase, which are well known allergens in arthropods. These proteins were moderately stable in the pepsin stability test. Conclusion. Based on these cross-reactivity studies, there is a realistic possibility that HDM- and crustacean allergic patients may react to food containing <b>Yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunocompetence}} handicap hypothesis postulates that secondary sexual {{traits are}} honest signals of mate quality because the hormones (e. g. testosterone) {{needed to develop}} secondary sexual traits have immunosuppressive effects. The best support for predictions arising from the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis so far comes from studies of insects, although they lack male-specific hormones such as testosterone. In our previous studies, we found that female <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles</b> prefer pheromones of immunocompetent males. Here, we tested how juvenile hormone (JH) affects male investment in secondary sexual characteristics and immune functions in the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor. We injected male <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles</b> with JH (type III) and found that injection increased the attractiveness of male pheromones but simultaneously suppressed immune functions (phenoloxidase activity and encapsulation). Our results suggest that JH, which {{is involved in the}} control of reproduction and morphogenesis, also plays {{a central role in the}} regulation of a trade-off between the immune system and sexual advertisement in insects. Thus, the results reflect a general mechanism by which the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis may work in insects...|$|R
50|$|The <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle</b> breeds prolifically. Mating is a three-step process: {{the male}} chasing the female, {{mounting}} her and inserting his aedeagus, and injecting a sperm packet. Within {{a few days}} the female burrows into soft ground and lays about 500 eggs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Measures of {{repeatability}} {{are essential}} for understanding behavioral consis-tency and individual differences in behavior, i. e. animal personalities.

Behavioral tests were repeated in Eppendorf test tubes where we also measured resting metabolic rate (RMR). Results show that the response latency to a threatening/startling stimulus, and the total {{time spent in the}} state of tonic immobility, correlated across the tests. The behavioral responses were repeatable and RMR covaried phenotypically with personality: we found a negative correlation between response latency time and time spent immobile, a positive correlation between response latency and RMR, and a negative correlation between RMR and total time spent immobile. These correlations were also similar across trials performed in the Eppendorf test tubes and the plastic containers...|$|E
40|$|Adaptation to cooler climates is a {{necessity}} for the organisms which endure temperatures below freezing. The <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio moli-tor, overwinters in the larval stage and is therefore succeptable to freezing conditions.

In particular, we used the <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae, Linnaeus, 1758), as an experimental model comparing the results obtained with this species with those available in literature for other insects. As a whole, acetone preservation proved to be cost-effective and widely applicable making acetone an excellent storage medium not only during field surveys, but also to obtain efficient and low-cost storage of Coleoptera in museum collections for biomolecular studies. Furthermore, the morphological characters of acetone-preserved insects have been examined by scanning electron microscope analysis, showing that acetone can preserve also fragile structures, such as sensilla, strengthening our suggestion of acetone as an optimal fixative for insect archival maintenance...|$|E
40|$|A {{protocol}} for extraction of <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> larvae proteins was established, conditions were evaluated {{and the resulting}} protein extract was characterised. The freeze-dried <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> larvae contained around 33 % fat, 51 % crude protein and 43 % true protein on a dry matter basis. The true protein content of the protein extract was about 75 %, with an extraction rate of 70 % under optimised extraction conditions using 0. 25 M NaOH, a NaOH solution: ethanol defatted worm ratio of 15 : 1 mL/g, 40 degrees C for 1 h and extraction twice. The protein extract was {{a good source of}} essential amino acids. The lowest protein solubility in distilled water solution was found between pH 4 and 5, and increased with either increasing or decreasing pH. Lower solubility was observed in 0. 5 M NaCl solution compared with distilled water. The rheological tests indicated that temperature, sample concentration, addition of salt and enzyme, incubation time and pH alterations influenced the elastic modulus of <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> protein extract (YMPE).

40|$|A {{large part}} of the {{environmental}} impact of animal production systems is due to the production of feed. Insects are suggested to efficiently convert feed to body mass and might therefore form a more sustainable food and/or feed source. Four diets were composed from by-products of food manufacturing and formulated such as to vary in protein and fat content. These were offered to newly hatched Argentinean cockroaches, black soldier flies, <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworms,</b> and house crickets. The first two species are potentially interesting as a feed ingredient, while the latter two are considered edible for humans. Feed conversion efficiency, survival, development time, as well as chemical composition (nitrogen, phosphorus, and fatty acids), were determined. The Argentinean cockroaches and the black soldier flies converted feed more efficiently than <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworms,</b> and house crickets. The first two were also more efficient than conventional production animals. On three of the four diets <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworms</b> and house crickets had a feed conversion efficiency similar to pigs. Furthermore, on the most suitable diet, they converted their feed as efficiently as poultry, when corrected for edible portion. All four species had a higher nitrogen-efficiency than conventional production animals, when corrected for edible portion. Offering carrots to <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworms</b> increased dry matter- and nitrogen-efficiency and decreased development time. Diet affected survival in all species but black soldier flies, and development time was strongly influenced in all four species. The chemical composition of Argentinean cockroaches was highly variable between diets, for black soldier flies it remained similar. The investigated species can be considered efficient production animals when suitable diets are provided. Hence, they could form a sustainable alternative to conventional production animals as a source of feed or food...|$|R
40|$|Two {{problems}} were studied: a) Whether a lower titre of the corpus allatum hormone {{had a different}} influence on the tissues of an adult insect with a diapause mechanism than on those of one without a diapause. b) Whether the metabolic effects of the corpus allatum hormone were caused mainly by its indirect influence upon an organ, e. g. the ovary, or by general influence on the metabolism as a whole. For the research two adult Coleoptera were used: the Colorado beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say) with a diapause mechanism and the <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle</b> (Tenebrio molitor L.) without such a mechanism. By tracing the influences of allatectomy or of castration on the respiration {{it was concluded that}} in both species the hormone had a gonadotropic influence in females and in♂and♀Colorado beetles also a general influence on the metabolism (direct on the basal resting respiration of active insects and probably indirect on their respiration by forced action through the central nerve system). Further hypotheses were drafted about the location of the diapause mechanism (the flight muscles and the fat body?) and the function of the corpus allatum in the fat metabolism (probably mainly to speed the making of fatty acids unsaturated) ...|$|E
40|$|Females that {{mate with}} more than one male may derive both {{material}} and genetic benefits, and differentiating between the two benefits is often difficult. We tested for both material and genetic effects associated with multiple mating in the highly promiscuous <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor. Females that mated four times to the same male laid more eggs and produced more larvae than females that mated only once. Whether copulations occurred on the same day or over several days, the result was an immediate increase in the production of eggs by females. Some females were kept on a restricted diet to test whether nutrients in the spermatophore disproportionately benefitted food-deprived females. Although females on poor diets produced fewer and smaller offspring, diet did not significantly affect the proportional benefit of mating treatment on female fecundity. By controlling for male mating history, we were able to separate the effects of mating with different males from the effects of receiving multiple spermatophores from the same male. Females that mated with four different males achieved substantial gains in numbers of eggs produced (32 % increase) beyond those of females that mated an identical number of times with the same male. We found no evidence that males allocate fewer sperm to previous mates. Egg hatchability was unaffected by mating behavior, suggesting that genetic incompatibility at that stage is not responsible for the low reproductive success of females mated with a single male. These results suggest that females may delay or reduce oviposition or may be incapable of achieving maximal fecundity until they have gained the material and/or genetic benefits of mating with multiple males.

40|$|Laboratory bioassays were {{conducted}} to evaluate alpha-cypermethrin and thiamethoxam for the control of adults, small larvae and large larvae of the khapra beetle Trogoderma granarium, and the <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle</b> Tenebrio molitor, on concrete. Factors such as dose (0. 025 and 0. 1 mg alpha-cypermethrin or thiamethoxam/cm(2)), exposure interval (1, 3 and 7 d), and formulation (alpha-cypermethrin SC and thiamethoxam WG) were evaluated. Apart from immediate assessment at end of exposure, an assessment of delayed mortality was performed with {{the survivors of the}} 7 -d exposure by removing them from the treated substrate and keeping them on untreated surfaces for 7 more days. After the 7 -d exposure, more T. granarium adults were dead on dishes treated with alpha-cypermethrin than with thiamethoxam. Small larvae were generally less susceptible than adults. After 7 d, small larval mortality reached 64. 4 % for alpha-cypermethrin, while for thiamethoxam it was < 6 %. Large T. granarium larvae were more tolerant than the small ones. Delayed mortality of T. granarium adults was generally high for both insecticides and doses, and ranged between 43. 3 and 63. 3 % of those that were still alive immediately after the 7 -d treatment. For both larval categories, delayed mortality was higher for larvae that had been previously exposed to alpha-cypermethrin, than with thiamethoxam. For T. molitor, after the 7 -d exposure, significantly more adults were dead on dishes treated with alpha-cypermethrin than with thiamethoxam. For small larvae mortality was 38. 9 % at the lowest thiamethoxam dose, but in the other cases ranged between 88. 9 and 95. 6 %. In the case of large larvae, the overall mortality was low in all tested combinations. Regarding delayed mortality of this species, it remained at low levels, for both adults and small larvae. Our results indicate that 7 : molitor was more susceptible than T. granarium in both insecticides tested, but alpha-cypermethrin was more effective than thiamethoxam. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, limited information is available on the safety of insects, and toxic elements are one of the potential hazards of concern. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the potential accumulation of cadmium, lead and arsenic in larvae of two insect species, Tenebrio molitor (<b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm)</b> and Hermetia illucens (black soldier fly), which seem to hold {{potential as a}} source of food or feed. An experiment was designed with 14 treatments, each in triplicate, per insect species. Twelve treatments used feed that was spiked with cadmium, lead or arsenic at 0. 5, 1 and 2 times the respective maximum allowable levels (ML) in complete feed, as established by the European Commission (EC). Two of the 14 treatments consisted of controls, using non-spiked feed. All insects per container (replicate) were harvested when the first larva in that container had completed its larval stage. Development time, survival rates and fresh weights were similar over all treatments, except for development time and total live weight of the half of the maximum limit treatment for cadmium of the black soldier fly. Bioaccumulation (bioaccumulation factor > 1) was seen in all treatments (including two controls) for lead and cadmium in black soldier fly larvae, and for the three arsenic treatments in the <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> larvae.

We found that pre-challenged larvae produced a long-lasting antimicrobial response, which provided a survival benefit when the larvae were exposed to fungal infection. These results suggest that the observed response is functionally "adaptive"...|$|R
