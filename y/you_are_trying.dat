25|$|There {{are limits}} to electrophoretic techniques. Since passing current through a gel causes heating, gels may melt during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is {{performed}} in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. There are also limitations in determining the molecular weight by SDS-PAGE, especially if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to find the MW of an unknown protein. There are certain biological variables that are difficult or impossible to minimize and can affect the electrophoretic migration. Such factors include protein structure, post-translational modifications, and amino acid composition. For example, tropomyosin is an acidic protein that migrates abnormally on SDS-PAGE gels. This is because the acidic residues are repelled by the negatively charged SDS, leading to an inaccurate mass-to-charge ratio and migration. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.|$|E

Coxon was a fan of the series and said [...] "If I'd been told a year ago that I would be playing SpongeBob today I would have loved it, {{although}} I'm not sure I would have believed it." [...] Coxon admitted it was difficult to adapt the show into a musical. He remarked [...] "It is difficult because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to recreate this character that is so fluid on screen. For example I'm just getting used to my square costume, although it does have an incredible design, so that, although I am restricted, I {{can do a lot of}} the things he does in the cartoon." ...|$|E

500|$|Bird came to Pixar {{with the}} lineup of the story's family members worked out: {{a mom and}} dad, both {{suffering}} through the dad's midlife crisis; a shy teenage girl; a cocky ten-year-old boy; and a baby. Bird had based their powers on family archetypes. After several failed attempts to cast Edna Mode, Bird took on her voice role himself. It was {{an extension of the}} Pixar custom of tapping in-house staff whose voices came across particularly well on scratch dialogue tracks. During production, Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli visited Pixar and saw the film's story reels. When Bird asked if the reels made any sense or if they were just [...] "American nonsense," [...] Miyazaki replied, through an interpreter, [...] "I think it's a very adventurous thing <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to do in an American film." ...|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. spent $100million {{marketing}} the film. Although Inception {{was not part}} of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of [...] "Christopher Nolan as a brand". Kroll declared that [...] "We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day." [...] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, [...] "You have this movie which {{is going to have a}} pretty big built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to keep very secret. Chris [...] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{retrospective}} feature by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's program Good Game highlighted Red Alarm {{as one of}} the Virtual Boy's most visually impressive games due to its polygonal graphics. The outlet praised it as one of {{the most}} entertaining titles on the console. Video game database AllGame gave the game a two and a half out of five rating, noting how the graphics made it difficult to play. The review stated that the design of the graphics [...] "makes structures hard to see because there is empty space between the lines defining them. Add multiple enemy fighters and ground defenses into the mix, and it can be very difficult to navigate your ship, especially when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to fight back!" [...] The review concluded that the developers [...] "have created a very detailed setting for which to fight in. Walls have faces stretching out of them like a scene from The Abyss, there are several interesting bosses to combat, and you'll even hear some speech. Deep down there is a fine shooter that is simply hard to enjoy due to the limitations of the hardware... and that is truly a shame." [...] In 2008, Kolan called it [...] "a really competent shooter" [...] with strong visuals and gameplay. The following year, Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer summarized Red Alarm as [...] "pretty good fun to play", although inferior to Star Fox. However, Wireds Chris Kohler later opined that the game [...] "kind of sucked".|$|E

500|$|Following the Mighty Ducks' Stanley Cup run, Kariya {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free {{agent in the}} off-season. With Kariya requiring a $10 million qualifying offer from Anaheim to remain with the team, General Manager Bryan Murray let him go to free agency. Murray went on record saying, [...] "We understand {{that he is an}} important player for the franchise...but when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to build a team it's hard to have one player at $10 million when your payroll is the mid to low ($40 million range)." [...] It was reported that the team had tried negotiating a longer-term deal with a decreased salary, while Murray told media {{at the time that he}} would remain in negotiations with Kariya to sign him for less. With former linemate Teemu Selänne also entering unrestricted free agency that summer after three years with San Jose (he decided to opt out of his final year, valued at $6.5 million), the duo agreed to reunite and sign with the same team. Together, they approached the Colorado Avalanche, having decided the team had the best chance of winning the Stanley Cup. On July 3, 2003, the Avalanche announced the signing of Kariya and Selänne to one-year contracts. In order for the team to afford both players, Kariya took an $8.8 million paycut from his $10 million salary with Anaheim the previous year, marking the highest decrease in compensation for a player in NHL history. At $1.2 million, his salary was below the NHL average, ensuring that he would have the freedom of unrestricted free agency at the end of the season. Selänne, meanwhile, signed for $5.8 million. Their deals were partially facilitated by goaltender Patrick Roy's retirement, which freed up $8.5 million in salary.|$|E

"Portmanteaux {{first came}} about with Lewis Carroll" [...] {{as a way}} to blend words, stated Jonathan Gabay, author of the Copywriter's Compendium—a {{reference}} guide to the English language. Gabay added that people blend words in this fashion because sometimes there are words an individual wants, but those words do not actually exist. [...] "There's a feeling <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to get out", he said.

Some couples are given more complex portmanteaux; on (How I Met Your Mother), the pairing of Barney and Robin is referred to as [...] "BROTP", incorporating their initials, their platonic status as [...] "bros", and the popular fandom term OTP ("One True Pairing"). Seth Cohen of the show The O.C. parodied name-blending trends when he talked about real couples' overexposure to one another; he wondered whether or not his pairing with Summer Roberts would be called [...] "Summereth" [...] or [...] "Sethummer".|$|E
2500|$|... “One {{morning as}} I {{came into the}} dining-tent I noticed that {{everybody}} but the Indians had been served with hot cakes. [...] This did not bother me much, as Indians do not eat such food. [...] At dinner-time that same day, when I sat down to our table, I saw to my surprise that there were pancakes before us. These were the ‘left-overs’ from the morning, and now the cook wanted to feed them to us. [...] Although I was very angry, I made no remark, but quietly left the table and went over where Buffalo Bill and the head officials of the show were eating dinner. Colonel Cody asked, ‘What is it, Standing Bear?’ ‘Colonel Cody,’ I replied, ‘this morning all the other races represented in the show were served with pancakes, but the Indians were not given any. [...] We do not object to that, as we do not care for them; but now the cook has put his old pancakes on our table and expects us to eat what was left over from breakfast, and it isn’t right.’ [...] Buffalo Bill’s eyes snapped, as he arose from the table. ‘Come with me, Standing Bear,’ he exclaimed. [...] We went direct to {{the manager of the}} dining-room, and the Colonel said to him, ‘Look here, sir, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to feed my Indians left-over pancakes from the morning meal. [...] I want you to understand, sir, that I will not stand for such treatment. [...] My Indians are the principal feature of this show, and they are the one people I will not allow to be misused or neglected. [...] Hereafter, see to it that they get just exactly what they want at meal-time. Do you understand me, sir”’ [...] ‘Yes, sir, oh, yes, sir,’ exclaimed the embarrassed manager. [...] After that, we had no more trouble about our meals.” ...|$|E
