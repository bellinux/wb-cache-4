500|$|Lovato {{collaborated with}} Beckett on a song titled [...] "For the Love of a Daughter". Although not {{planning}} to write a personal song, a [...] "really long talk" [...] with Beckett resulted in the song being written. The song chronicles Lovato's relationship with her estranged birth father, who left the family when she was two years old. In the song, she pleads with her father to [...] "put the bottle down" [...] and questions him: [...] "How could you put <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ones that you swore you loved?" [...] The song was set {{to appear on the}} album, but Lovato and her management felt of the song's subject would be too much for her young audience and later was removed from the album. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained: [...] "When I took a step back, I realized I wouldn't like those subjects being talked about in somebody else's home, with a seven-year-old and their mom." [...] Several other [...] "emotional" [...] songs were also put on hold. The song was later selected and included on her third studio album Unbroken released in September 2011, when Lovato had left Disney Channel.|$|E
2500|$|That {{sales pitch}} {{was typical of}} Wolfman Jack's growling, exuberant on-air style. [...] In the spirit of his {{character}} name, he would punctuate his banter with howls, while urging his listeners to [...] "get naked" [...] or [...] "lay <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio and squeeze my knobs". [...] Part of the persona was his nocturnal anonymity; listeners {{from coast to coast}} {{had no idea how to}} recognize the face behind the voice that said things like [...] "Wolfman plays the best records in the business, and then he eats 'em!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Bonham {{appeared}} on The Family Dogg's A Way of Life, with Page and Jones. Bonham also played for Screaming Lord Sutch on Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends in 1970. He played on Lulu's 1971 single [...] "Everybody Clap (Lulu song)," [...] written by Maurice Gibb and Billy Lawrie. In 1972, he {{played on a}} Maurice Gibb-produced album by Jimmy Stevens called Don't Freak Me Out in the UK and Paid My Dues in the US, credited as [...] "Gemini" [...] (his star sign). He drummed for his Birmingham friend, Roy Wood, on [...] "Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wheel", a single subsequently released on his 1979 album, On the Road Again, and on Wings' album Back to the Egg on the tracks [...] "Rockestra Theme" [...] and [...] "So Glad to See You Here". He was also featured on Paul McCartney & Wings [...] "Beware My Love" [...] demo version first recorded in 1976, it remained unreleased until 2014 {{with the release of}} the album Wings at the Speed of Sound boxset. Bonham was the best man of Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi at his wedding ceremony.|$|E

2500|$|A {{controversy}} over the tactics used by the MCPD ensued, with reports of officers walking down I-270 between stopped cars with weapons drawn, telling people {{to get back in}} their vehicles, and demanding commuters pop their trunks without any explanation why. One woman was reportedly shouted at by police with weapons drawn after she'd opened her car door to throw up, having gotten motion sickness from sitting in her vehicle {{for an extended period of}} time. Chief Thomas Manger defended the MCPD's actions, stating that they were justified under exigent circumstances. Don Troop, a man who witnessed the incident, told the Washington Post that a group of officers made its way to his car and other cars around him. [...] "They were just walking along saying: 'Pop the trunk! Pop the trunk!'" [...] Troop said he overheard a man in a truck next to him call out to another motorist: [...] "The police are looking for bank robbers." [...] A short time later, about nine officers approached his car — including state troopers, county police officers, and at least one plainclothes officer. Among the commands given to motorists by officers were: [...] "stay in your car", [...] "pop the trunk", [...] "get <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel", and [...] "get you hands up where we can see them", according to Troop. Corporal Aaron Smith, a pilot flying a Prince George's County police helicopter dispatched to assist stated that he [...] "saw that they were searching traffic and going vehicle to vehicle." [...] MCPD spokesman Captain Paul Starks described the incident as a [...] "systematic check of trunks and rear hitches" [...] of detained vehicles.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{doubtful}} that Mrs. Wine actually composed the lyrics herself. More likely she had heard the revised refrain and variations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verses of the older song from the congregation at the praise hall. The leading [...] "Paul and Silas" [...] stanzas in the modern [...] "Keep Your Eyes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Prize" [...] lyrics were already present in some versions of the older [...] "Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Plow." [...] Our Singing Country shows these lyrics were already in use in 1949 and before. Odetta used them in her 1960 Carnegie Hall appearance and recording.

"A day or {{two after}} that I found out {{from a man who}} run a still, and knew the Red Captain well, that he had made up his mind to lave Galway and come down south, where he had some friends; so I just shut up the house and walked down here. Now you know, your honor, that I don't come here {{for the sake of the}} reward. Not a penny of it would I touch if I were dying of hunger, and sooner than be pointed at as an {{informer}} I would throw myself over them big rocks. But they have got Denis, and either they will make him as bad as themselves--which I don't think--or they will shoot him; and if they don't shoot him he will be shot one of these days by the soldiers. What I want you to promise, your honor, is, that if I point out where you can lay <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> villains, you won't say who tould you, and that you will tell your soldiers not to shoot Denis.|$|E
60|$|I {{have now}} {{completed}} my literary {{survey of the}} first floor of the palace. At the desire of my noble and gracious patron, the lord of this glorious edifice, I next ascend to the second floor, and continue my catalogue or description of the pictures, decorations, and other treasures of art therein contained. Let me begin with the corner room at the western extremity of the palace, called the Room of the Caryatides, from the statues which support the mantel-piece. This work is of comparatively recent execution: it dates from the eighteenth century only, and reveals the corrupt taste of the period in every part of it. Still, there is a certain interest which attaches to the mantel-piece: it conceals a cleverly constructed hiding-place, between the floor of the room and the ceiling of the room beneath, which was made during the last evil days of the Inquisition in Venice, and which is reported to have saved an ancestor of my gracious lord pursued by that terrible tribunal. The machinery of this curious place of concealment has been kept in good order by the present lord, as a species of curiosity. He condescended to show me the method of working it. Approaching the two Caryatides, rest your hand on the forehead (midway between the eyebrows) of the figure which is on your left as you stand opposite to the fireplace, then press the head inwards as if you were pushing it against the wall behind. By doing this, you set in motion the hidden machinery in the wall which turns the hearthstone on a pivot, and discloses the hollow place below. There is room enough in it for a man to lie easily at full length. The method of closing the cavity again is equally simple. Place both <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> temples of the figures; pull as if you were pulling it towards you--and the hearthstone will revolve into its proper position again.|$|E
