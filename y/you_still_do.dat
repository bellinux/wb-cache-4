5000|$|Responding to the {{controversy}} Ridley defended the play, describing {{what he felt}} were double standards within the theatrical establishment, {{in that it is}} acceptable for there to be scenes of violence in classical drama but not within contemporary plays: [...] "Why is it that it is fine for the classic plays to discuss - even show - these things, but people are outraged when contemporary playwrights do it? If you go to see King Lear, you see a man having his eyes pulled out; in Medea, a woman slaughters her own children. The recent revival of Iphigenia at the National was acclaimed for its relevance. But when you try to write about the world around us, people get upset. If I'd wrapped Mercury Fur up as a recently rediscovered Greek tragedy it would be seen as an interesting moral debate like Iphigenia, but because it is set on an east-London housing estate it is seen as being too dangerous to talk about. What does that say about the world we live in? What does it say about theatre today?"Ridley also explained that he felt critics had disliked Mercury Fur because of its subject matter and not for the theatrical experience the play is trying to create for its audience: “I don’t think there is anything wrong with people being disturbed within the theatre at all… I think theatre is fifteen years behind any other art form... It’s still perceived as a kind of subject matter based art form. You wouldn’t go along and look at a Suzanne painting and criticize it just on the choice of apples she’s chosen to paint, you’d criticize it, and you’d judge it and experience it for the use of paint… Because we come from a basic literal tradition we still view stage plays as kind of glorified novels and we judge them purely on their subject matter, regardless of the theatrical experience of sitting there and watching the play.” Ridley also defended the depiction of violence within the story, arguing that is used for a moral purpose and that the play is more about love than violence:"The things that happen in Mercury Fur are not gratuitous, they are heart-breaking. The people may do terrible things but everything they do is out of love, in an attempt to keep each other safe. The play is me asking, 'What would I do in that position?' If you knew that to keep your mother, brother and lover safe, you would have to do terrible things, would <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> them? That's the dilemma of the play. It asks us all, 'What lengths would you go to to save the people you love?'" ...|$|E
40|$|In practice, {{the problem}} of law {{enforcement}} is half a matter of what the government does to catch violators and half a matter of what violators do to avoid getting caught. In the theory of law enforcement, however, although the state 2 ̆ 7 s efforts at detection play a decisive role, offenders 2 ̆ 7 efforts at detection avoidance are largely ignored. Always problematic, this imbalance has become all the more urgent {{in recent years as}} episodes of corporate misconduct spur new interest in punishing process crimes like obstruction of justice and perjury. This article adds detection avoidance to the existing theoretical frame with an eye toward informing the current policy debate. The exercise leads to several conclusions. First, despite recent efforts to strengthen laws governing obstruction and perjury, sanctioning is relatively inefficacious at discouraging detection avoidance. Sanctions send a mixed message to the offender: do less to avoid detection, but to the extent <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> something, do more to avoid detection of your detection avoidance. The article argues that detection avoidance is more effectively deterred through the structural design of evidentiary procedure (inclusive of investigation). Specifically advocated are devices that exploit the cognitive shortcomings of potential avoiders and the strategic instability of their cooperative arrangements, thereby lowering the cost effectiveness of devoting resources to avoiding detection.

40|$|This work is {{intended}} {{to contribute to a}} program of developing general concepts and methods for applying category theory to the modeling and solution o f scientic problems. It was motivated by my experiences as an engineering student studying continuum and kinetic models of uid ows. The language of category theory is employed because it facilitates precise comparisons between diverse types of structures. Using this language to investigate relationships between uid ow models requires categorical specications of constitutive relations and of idioms occurring across classications of dynamic systems. It is shown that a category-theoretic denition of chaotic system applies not only to the Smale horseshoe, a standard chaotic system, but also to Conway's of Life " automaton. Symbolic dynamics of the Philosophers " relational system is computed. A category composed of stochastic matrices is dened and some of its elementary properties are developed. A categorical variant of symbolic dynamics is applied to a nite stochastic process. Using point-wise Kan extension formulas, conditions ensuring existence of certain representations among categories of dynamic systems are proved. iii For my parents iv Acknowledgments Thanks, Mom and Dad.

40|$|Galaxy {{clusters}} are spectacular. We {{provide a}} Google Earth compatible imagery for the deep co-added {{images from the}} Sloan Digital Sky Survey {{and make it a}} tool for examing galaxy clusters. Google Earth (in sky mode) provides a highly interactive environment for visualizing the sky. By encoding the galaxy cluster information into a kml/kmz file, one can use Google Earth as a tool for examining galaxy clusters and fly across them freely. However, the resolution of the images provided by Google Earth is not very high. This is partially because the major imagery google earth used is from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (SDSS collaboration 2000) and the resolutions have been reduced to speed up the web transferring. To have higher resolution images, you need to add your own images in a way that Google Earth can understand. The SDSS co-added data are the co-addition of {approx} 100 scans of images from SDSS stripe 82 (Annis et al. 2010). It provides the deepest images based on SDSS and reach as deep as about redshift 1. 0. Based on the co-added images, we created color images in a way as described by Lupton et al. (2004) and convert the color images to Google Earth compatible images using wcs 2 kml (Brewer et al. 2007). The images are stored at a public server at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and can be accessed by the public. To view those images in Google Earth, you need to download a kmz file, which contains the links to the color images, and then open the kmz file with your Google Earth. To meet different needs for resolutions, we provide three kmz files corresponding to low, medium and high resolution images. We recommend the high resolution one {{as long as you have}} a broadband Internet connection, though you should choose to download any of them, depending on your own needs and Internet speed. After you open the downloaded kmz file with Google Earth (in sky mode), it takes about 5 minutes (depending on your Internet connection and the resolution of images you want) to get some initial images loaded. Then, additional images corresponding to the region you are browsing will be loaded automatically. So far, you have access to all the co-added images. But <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not have the galaxy cluster position information to look at. In order to see the galaxy clusters, you need to download another kmz file that tell Google Earth where to find the galaxy clusters in the co-added data region. We provide a kmz file for a few galaxy clusters in the stripe 82 region and you can download and open it with Google Earth. In the SDSS co-added region (stripe 82 region), the imagery from Google Earth itself is from the Digitized Sky Survey (2007), which is in very poor quality. In Figure 1 and Figure 2, we show screenshots of a cluster with and without the new co-added imagery in Google Earth. Much more details have been revealed with the deep images...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{modes of}} {{academic}} publication. What it is: Page for {{the dissemination of}} academic papers in alternative formats. Aimed at the diffusion {{of the idea of}} open publication, or open access publication, a branch of open science, a multidisciplinary movement that seeks to modify the paradigm of knowledge production that centralizes it and prevents its spreading. Historically, Western tradition has become firmly rooted in the free dissemination of knowledge among peers. However, the concentration of research funding, publication channels and creative capacity around closed institutions of production and publication of knowledge interrupted this tradition on a large scale. Diverse movements inspired by the concepts of free software and open source have joined to form the still evolving concept of open science. This page is not an electronic journal, or periodical, or newspaper, or repository of pre-publications. Like the concepts that I want to defend, I want this creation to be an alternative publication modality itself. The project starts as follows: 	It is a one-man venture (for now), but open to contributions 	No periodicity ("published" material is identified by the versioning) 	There will be no requirement for quality, except for the unambiguous evidence base. - Example: you will not see in this page texts about UFOs or alternative (pseudo) science (the alternative in this page is the format) 	It will not have a peer review system, but will be open to the free commentary, provided the Code of Conduct is followed. 	There will never be monetary charges (but I will accept donations). How to use: The information disclosed will always be made available by free licenses compatible with the Open Science movement, especially (but not exclusively) the Creative Commons Attribution 4. 0 International license. No copyrighted or proprietary copyrighted content will be published, but citations to such protected material may occur if comments on other publications are published.
